Because all these steps proceed in a constantly changing environment, functional gene analyses during development have to take time into account. This is quite challenging, however, as loss-of-function approaches based on classic genetic tools do not allow for the precise temporal control that is required for developmental studies. Gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) in combination with the chicken embryo or with cultured embryos opens new possibilities for functional gene analysis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Axonin-1/TAG-1 is a cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily with a well defined temporal and spatial expression pattern in the developing vertebrate nervous system. Axonin-1/TAG-1 was shown to promote neurite outgrowth <italic>in vitro </italic>and to be required for commissural and sensory axon pathfinding <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To knock down axonin-1 in a temporally and spatially controlled manner during development of the nervous system, we have combined RNAi with the accessibility of the chicken embryo even at late stages of development. Using <italic>ex ovo </italic>RNAi, we analyzed the function of axonin-1/TAG-1 in cerebellar development. Axonin-1 is expressed in postmitotic granule cells while they extend their processes, the parallel fibers. In the absence of axonin-1 these processes still extend but no longer in a parallel manner to each other or to the pial surface of the cerebellum.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Axonin-1/TAG-1 is required for the navigation, but not for the elongation, of granule cell processes in the developing cerebellum <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Axonin-1 (AX-1)/TAG-1 is a cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily that was shown to be an axon guidance cue in the central nervous system <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Commissural axons in the spinal cord require AX-1 for midline crossing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In the absence of interactions between growth cone AX-1 and floor-plate NrCAM the floor plate is perceived as repulsive and growth cones fail to enter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Sensory neurons from dorsal root ganglia depend on AX-1 for subpopulation-specific navigation to the gray matter of the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In the absence of AX-1 function, nociceptive fibers failed to innervate their target layers in the dorsal spinal cord and extended into areas normally innervated by mechanoreceptive fibers. In the cerebellum, AX-1 is expressed in postmitotic granule cells at the time when they extend their processes, the parallel fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The cerebellum is responsible for motor coordination but is also involved in cognitive processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Malformations or damage to the cerebellum have been linked to several human disabilities, including ataxia, cerebral palsy, and epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In line with the more recent literature describing a contribution of the cerebellum to cognitive processes, changes in cerebellar structure and function have been linked to mental retardation, autism, and schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The development of the cerebellum has been studied in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and in chicken embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Cells of the cerebellum originate from rhombomere 1, the anterior-most part of the hindbrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. With one notable exception, the granule cells, all cells are born in the ventricular zone and migrate radially to reach their final destination in the mature cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The rhombic lip, the contact site between the roof plate of the fourth ventricle and the neural tube, gives rise to precursors of granule cells. These migrate tangentially on the pial surface of the cerebellar anlage to form the external germinal layer (EGL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. After proliferation in the outer EGL, granule cell precursors differentiate in the inner EGL and extend their axons, the parallel fibers. Together, parallel fibers and dendrites of Purkinje cells form the molecular layer (ML). After the initial formation of parallel fibers, granule cells migrate radially through the Purkinje cell layer to form the inner granule cell layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Thus, the only cell bodies that remain in the ML are interneurons, stellate and basket cells that originate from the ventricular zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Although these processes are known at the cellular level, the molecular mechanisms regulating these distinct steps are poorly understood.</p><p>To test for a role of AX-1 in parallel fiber extension in the developing cerebellum, we used <italic>ex ovo </italic>RNA interference (RNAi), a combination of RNAi and <italic>ex ovo </italic>culturing of chicken embryos. In contrast to our previously established method, <italic>in ovo </italic>RNAi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], <italic>ex ovo </italic>RNAi enhances the accessibility of chicken embryos for loss-of-function approaches at late stages of development.</p><p>We developed <italic>in ovo </italic>RNAi as a tool to study gene function in a temporally controlled manner during development of the chicken nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Using this technique, we demonstrated, for instance, additional functions of the morphogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh) beyond patterning and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. During early stages of development, Shh acts as a ventralizing factor in spinal cord patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Later, still using Patched and Smoothened to mediate its effect, Shh attracts commissural axons toward the floor plate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Only a few hours later, Shh switches receptors and, mediated by Hip (Hedgehog-interacting protein), acts as a guidance cue for postcommissural axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The analysis of Shh's function clearly demonstrates the importance of tight temporal control of gene silencing during embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p><italic>Ex ovo </italic>RNAi extends the usefulness of the chicken embryo as a model organism to study later stages of neural development during which the embryo is no longer easily accessible in the egg. Chicken embryos can be transferred from the egg to a plastic dish without detrimental effects on their development. The absence of the eggshell enhances access to the developing embryo for experimental manipulation. <italic>Ex ovo </italic>RNAi allowed us to study the role of AX-1 in parallel fiber formation. In the absence of AX-1 function, neurites of granule cells still extended but failed to navigate correctly in the developing ML. Rather than extending in a parallel manner, they invaded the layer of proliferating granule cells at the pial surface of the cerebellum.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Embryos grown <italic>ex ovo </italic>can easily be accessed for manipulation of gene expression in a temporally and spatially controlled manner</title><p>To enhance its accessibility during later stages of development, the chicken embryo can be cultured in a dish without adverse effects on development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. To have access to the developing cerebellum, we transferred embryos to a domed dish after the second day of incubation (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). As described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], the transfer should be done no later than embryonic day 2.5 (E2.5) for best survival of the embryo. The survival rate of embryos depended on several factors, including temperature and humidity in the incubator, as well as the time of embryo transfer. Routinely, we found 62% of the embryos alive on E8, the time of injection in this study. At that time, embryos grown in a dish did not differ from embryos kept in the egg. Similarly, the comparison of cerebellar development between embryos developing in the egg and those developing in a dish for up to ten days after transfer (the latest time point that we analyzed) revealed no differences (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).</p><p>Injections into the cerebellum had to be carried out without direct visual control. However, the blood vessels that are readily visible through the skin could be used as landmarks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). By using an expression plasmid encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), the proper injection site, the required depth of the injection, as well as the best electroporation settings were determined. For electroporations we placed the head of the embryo between tweezer electrodes. To prevent tissue damage, direct contact between embryo and electrodes was carefully avoided (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). The cerebellum was efficiently transfected with 6 pulses of 99 ms duration at 40 V, as judged by the number of EGFP-expressing cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d&#x02013;i</xref>). Only one half of the cerebellum expressed the transgene, because the negatively charged nucleic acids were migrating towards the anode (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c,d</xref>). Therefore, the untransfected side of the cerebellum could be used as a control for the analysis of potential phenotypes. When injections were carried out at Hamburger and Hamilton stage 34 (HH34; E8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], the survival rate one day after the experiment was 72%. However, the time point of the injection is not restricted to HH34. Injections and electroporations were performed successfully until HH36 (E10; not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Different cerebellar layers can be targeted by <italic>ex ovo </italic>electroporation.</bold> The cerebellar anlage is positioned right under the bifurcation of the middorsal sinus and the middle cerebral vein. <bold>(a) </bold>The injection site is indicated by +.

To get efficient transfection of all cerebellar layers, the glass capillary was inserted into the ventricle and the injection pressure was maintained during its retraction. For this study, we used only sections that were successfully transfected in the EGL and the developing ML.

Apoptosis was compared between untreated control embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>), control embryos injected and electroporated with the EGFP plasmid alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>), and experimental embryos injected and electroporated with EGFP and dsRNA derived from AX-1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). We did not find any difference in apoptosis between control and experimental embryos, indicating that our experimental procedure did not induce cell death. This is consistent with our previous findings demonstrating that injection and electroporation of long dsRNA did not induce unspecific effects in the chicken spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Ex ovo </bold><bold>electroporation and RNAi using long dsRNA does not induce apoptosis and does not disturb cerebellar</bold><bold> organization.</bold><bold>(a-c) </bold>Apoptosis was investigated by TUNEL in 30-&#x003bc;m-thick sagittal sections at HH35, one day after electroporation.

To demonstrate efficient downregulation of AX-1 in these cells by <italic>ex ovo </italic>RNAi, we mixed dsRNA derived from AX-1 with a plasmid encoding EGFP at a molecular ratio of 50:1. In all experiments EGFP expression was used to identify the position and the size of the electroporated area in the cerebellum. Electroporation of AX-1 dsRNA efficiently knocked down AX-1 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

Knock down of AX-1 in the developing cerebellum at HH34 resulted in the failure of granule cell axons to extend parallel to each other and parallel to the pial surface (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). When analyzed in coronal slices at HH35, parallel fibers were found to deviate from their normal trajectory, often even invading the outermost part of the EGL, where granule cell precursors proliferate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c,f</xref>). In control embryos injected with dsRNA derived from CD34, a gene not expressed in the cerebellum, or in control embryos injected with the EGFP plasmid alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6e</xref>), neurofilament staining was not found in the outer EGL. The same was true for the contralateral side of experimental embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d</xref>). The failure of granule cell axons to extend in a parallel manner with respect to each other and with respect to the pial surface was reflected in the irregular appearance of the ML (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>). Its width was non-uniform and the fiber density appeared strongly reduced. Because we did not observe an increase in cell death compared to control embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) we took the apparent decrease in fiber number in the developing ML as further evidence for the aberrant growth of parallel fibers. Because it was impossible to count the number of aberrant fibers individually, we measured the intensity of neurofilament staining in the developing ML. As the width of the layer varies considerably depending on the anteroposterior position in the cerebellum, we measured the staining intensity as a ratio between the targeted and the contralateral side. The comparison of neurofilament staining intensity between the experimental and the control sides indicated a 38% decrease in AX-1 dsRNA-treated embryos (n = 19 slices from 9 embryos) but no changes in EGFP-treated embryos (n = 14 slices from 6 embryos) or untreated embryos (n = 10 slices from 4 embryos) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6i</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Silencing AX-1 in the developing cerebellum induces aberrant trajectories of parallel fibers.</bold><bold>(a-c,f) </bold>Parallel fibers from areas outlined in (a) were analyzed in 250-&#x003bc;m-thick vibratome slices taken from HH35 cerebella after downregulation of AX-1 by <italic>ex ovo </italic>RNAi at HH34 (a-c,f).

Using a tungsten needle as cathode, Purkinje cell progenitors were successfully electroporated after injection of a GFP plasmid into the ventricular system at E3.5. However, temporally and spatially controlled transfection of different cerebellar cell types was not possible at these early stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Furthermore, electroporation of antisense cDNA to induce a loss-of-function phenotype at E3.5 was not sufficient for functional readouts at later stages of cerebellar development (E11.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Due to ongoing cell proliferation, transfected antisense cDNAs were diluted extensively, resulting in inefficient downregulation of the target gene. An additional problem with the early electroporation of antisense nucleotides, but also dsRNA for RNAi, may occur if a candidate gene exerts multiple functions at different stages of development. Early disruption of gene function would prevent any further functional analysis at later developmental stages. Therefore, our focus was to design appropriate conditions to extend the applicability of RNAi to older stages of embryonic development. With this protocol, AX-1 in granule cells of the EGL could efficiently be downregulated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>Despite the fact that some genes involved in cerebellar specification have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], the molecular basis of cerebellar development is still poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. A number of cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily are expressed in granule cells, including NgCAM/L1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], NrCAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], Contactin/F11/F3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>], and AX-1/TAG-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. <italic>In vitro </italic>studies indicated an inhibitory role of Contactin/F3 in parallel fiber outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic>, parallel fibers extended in the absence of Contactin/F3 but their growth and contact with dendrites of Purkinje cells was aberrant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Only later extending parallel fibers were affected in contactin/F3 knockout mice, growth of early extending fibers was normal, consistent with the late onset of contactin/F3 expression in granule cells compared to TAG-1/AX-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. A forced early expression of Contactin/F3 under the TAG-1 promoter interfered with the correct formation of the ML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Reduced cerebellar size and defects in foliation were found in mice lacking both L1/NgCAM and NrCAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The defect was the result of a lack of granule cell survival rather than an effect on parallel fiber growth. Only very subtle cerebellar phenotypes were found in mice lacking only one of the two genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Mice lacking TAG-1 were shown to have a migration defect of a subset of pre-cerebellar neurons in the superficial migratory stream, but no cerebellar phenotype was reported in these mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. The absence of an effect on granule cells was unexpected based on the expression of TAG-1/AX-1 in postmitotic granule cells at the time of parallel fiber extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Similarly, no effect on commissural axons was found in the spinal cord of the <italic>Tag-1 </italic>knockout mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>], in contrast to the chicken embryo where the perturbation of AX-1 function resulted in the failure of commissural axons to cross the midline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The most likely explanation for this discrepancy is the technique used to block TAG-1/AX-1 function. While TAG-1 is permanently and ubiquitously deleted in the knock-out mouse, AX-1 function was blocked acutely during a specific time window of interest in our <italic>ex ovo </italic>RNAi approach ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]; this study) or by the injection of function-blocking antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Therefore, redundancy or compensatory mechanisms that are generally thought to explain the absence of phenotypes in knock-out mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>] would not be present in the 'acute' knock down of AX-1 in chicken embryos. Such a scenario would also explain the discrepancy between the <italic>NrCAM </italic>knockout mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>] and our previous reports on the effect of acute perturbation of NrCAM function by injection of function-blocking antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and <italic>in ovo </italic>RNAi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] on axon guidance in the spinal cord. Thus, despite the fact that acute knock down of a gene of interest by RNAi is not removing all of the gene product, because preexisting protein is not removed and only a subset of the cells in the target area are transfected by electroporation, this approach may be more sensitive for the analysis of gene function during embryonic development compared to generic knock-out approaches that are the method of choice when gene function in the adult nervous system is of interest.</p><p>Downregulation of AX-1 in the developing cerebellum by <italic>ex ovo </italic>RNAi specifically interfered with the formation of parallel fibers. This defect was not caused by inhibition of axon extension, as we found no effect of AX-1 on neurite length <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, our analyses of cerebellar slices taken from embryos lacking AX-1 are consistent with an effect of AX-1 on guidance but not on growth of granule cell axons. Granule cells still extended axons after downregulation of AX-1, although their orientation was aberrant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><p>These results are consistent with earlier observations made with commissural neurons from the dorsolateral spinal cord <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].

Expression of those molecules is found only in older parallel fibers in the developing ML. Furthermore, a homophilic interaction of AX-1 is consistent with all our <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>AX-1 is expressed by granule cells as soon as they become postmitotic and is required for the parallel arrangement of their axons but is not required for neurite extension. This is similar to the situation found for commissural axons of the spinal cord. They require AX-1 for pathfinding but not for elongation. In contrast, AX-1 was found to be required for guidance of sensory DRG axons <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and to promote their outgrowth <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Taken together, these results demonstrate that AX-1 acts in a context-dependent manner either as an axon guidance cue without affecting neurite outgrowth, or as a molecule promoting neurite outgrowth.

The synthesized ssRNA was purified by sequential extraction with acidic phenol-chloroform (25:24:1 vol/vol/vol phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol) and chloroform/isoamylalcohol (24:1). After precipitation with 100% ethanol, the ssRNA was washed with 70% ethanol, and dissolved in 20 &#x003bc;l phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). To produce dsRNA, equal nanogram amounts of antisense and sense ssRNAs were mixed, heated for five minutes at 95&#x000b0;C, and then slowly cooled down to room temperature by switching off the heating block. For quality control, 1 &#x003bc;l samples were taken after each step and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The dsRNA was stored at -80&#x000b0;C until further use.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Ex ovo </italic>injection and electroporation</title><p>Injections and electroporations were performed at E8. The embryos were staged according to Hamburger and Hamilton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. To have direct access to the embryo, a small hole of 3&#x02013;4 mm diameter was cut into the extraembryonic membranes above the eye. For positioning and stabilization of the head during injection and subsequent electroporation, we used a hook prepared from a spatula (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). Approximately 1 &#x003bc;l of the nucleic acid mixture consisting of a plasmid encoding EGFP under the control of the &#x003b2;-actin promoter (100 ng/&#x003bc;l), dsRNA derived from AX-1 (500 ng/&#x003bc;l), and 0.04% (vol/vol) Trypan Blue (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) dissolved in sterile PBS were injected into the cerebellum using a borosilicate glass capillary with a tip diameter of 5 &#x003bc;m (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>; World Precision Instruments, Berlin, Germany). Depending on the depth of the injection, different cerebellar layers could be targeted. To get transfection of all cerebellar layers, the glass capillary was first inserted into the ventricular system and injection pressure was maintained during retraction. Before electroporation a few drops of sterile PBS were added to the embryo. For the electroporation a platelet electrode of 7 mm diameter (Tweezertrodes Model #520, BTX Instrument Division, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA) was placed collaterally to the head of the embryo (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Six pulses of 40 V and 99 ms duration with one second interpulse intervals were applied using a square wave electroporator (ECM830, BTX). For the present study, we selected only embryos that were successfully electroporated in the EGL and the developing ML for further analysis. Slices and sections from experimental embryos were compared with slices/sections taken from the same position of a control cerebellum with respect to both the anteroposterior and the mediolateral axis. As controls we used CD34 dsRNA injected, EGFP plasmid injected, and untreated control embryos, respectively.</p><p>For injections of function-blocking anti-AX-1 antibodies, approximately 1 &#x003bc;l of the antibody solution (10 mg/ml with 0.04% Trypan Blue in PBS) was injected into the cerebellum three times every 12 h.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue preparation</title><p>One to four days after electroporation the embryos were sacrificed. The brain was removed and analyzed for EGFP expression using a fluorescence stereomicroscope (SZX12, Olympus). After fixation for 2 h at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, the brain tissue was rinsed in PBS and transferred to 25% sucrose in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for cryoprotection. In this study, 30-&#x003bc;m-thick sagittal cryostat sections and 250-&#x003bc;m-thick coronal vibratome slices were used. For the preparation of cryostat sections, the brains were embedded with OCT Tissue-Tek in Peel-a-Way<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>disposable embedding molds (Polysciences, Eppelheim, Germany), frozen in isopentane on dry ice, and cut on a cryostat (Leica CM1850). The sections were collected on SuperFrost<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>Plus microscope slides. For the preparation of 250-&#x003bc;m-thick vibratome slices, the brain was embedded in 6.5% ultra low-melting agarose (Type IX, Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland) and cut with an OTS-300-04 oscillating tissue slicer (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA). The slices were collected in PBS and the remaining agarose was removed before staining.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Immunostaining of cryostat sections was done essentially as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. We used the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-GFP (1:250; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), FITC-labeled goat anti-GFP 1:400; Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA, USA), anti-Calbindin (1:1000; Swant, Bellinzona, Switzerland), both rabbit and goat anti-AX-1 (1:1,000) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], goat anti-NgCAM, anti-NrCAM (both 1:1,000), rabbit anti-Contactin/F11 (1:1,000) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], mouse anti-neurofilament (RMO270; 1:1,500; Zymed/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), rabbit anti-neurofilament (1:250; Chemicon/Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and the monoclonal antibodies H5, recognizing Vimentin (supernatant), and Pax6 (2 &#x003bc;g/ml; both obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA). All antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer (10% fetal calf serum in PBS). Incubation was overnight at 4&#x000b0;C for primary antibodies and 90 minutes at room temperature for secondary antibodies. Secondary antibodies were: goat anti-rabbit-Alexa488 and donkey anti-goat-Alexa488 (1:250; Molecular Probes/Invitrogen), goat anti-mouse-Cy3 (1:250), donkey anti-rabbit-Cy3 (1:200), or donkey anti-goat-Cy3 (1:250; all Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Newmarket, Suffolk, UK). For staining of vibratome slices, essentially the same protocol was used, although incubation times were extended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. Slices were mounted in sterile PBS between two coverslips sealed with high vacuum grease (Dow Corning, Wiesbaden, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title><bold>Bromodeoxyuridine labeling</bold></title><p>Embryos were injected with dsRNA derived from AX-1 and the EGFP plasmid, or with the EGFP plasmid alone, and electroporated at HH34. After 4 days (HH38), 200 &#x003bc;l 50 mM bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in H<sub>2</sub>O were pipetted onto the chorioallantois. After 3 h the embryos were sacrificed, and the brains were dissected and prepared for cryostat sections as described above. For visualization of the incorporated BrdU, the sections were incubated in 50% formamide, 0.3 M NaCl in 0.03 M tri-sodium citrate buffer, pH 7.0, for 1&#x02013;2 h at 65&#x000b0;C, rinsed twice with 0.3 M NaCl in 0.03 M tri-sodium citrate buffer for 15 minutes, followed by incubation in 2 N HCl for 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C. Sections were rinsed in 0.1 M borate buffer (pH 8.5) for 10 minutes at room temperature, followed by PBS (six changes). BrdU was detected using the mouse anti-BrdU antibody from Sigma (1:200) using the protocol detailed above. Sections were counterstained with DAPI (5 &#x003bc;g/ml in PBS) for 20 minutes at room temperature.</p></sec><sec><title>TUNEL assay</title><p>Apoptosis was compared between embryos taken directly from the egg, control embryos that were injected and electroporated with the EGFP plasmid alone, or experimental embryos injected with dsRNA derived from AX-1 (together with the EGFP plasmid). As a positive control, sections were treated with DNase I (300 U/ml; Roche) for 10 minutes at room temperature. To detect apoptotic cells, the ApoAlert DNA Fragmentation Assay Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fragmented, fluorescein-labeled DNA was detected with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated sheep anti-FITC antibody (1:1,000; Roche) dissolved in 10% fetal calf serum/PBS. The alkaline phosphatase reaction was carried out as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification</title><p>Fluorescence intensities after AX-1 or neurofilament staining were measured with the analySIS Five software from Olympus Soft Imaging System (Muenster, Germany). A decrease of the protein level was calculated from the relative fluorescence intensities measured in the ML of the transfected versus non-transfected areas. The staining intensity was then compared between embryos injected with dsRNA derived from AX-1, embryos injected with the EGFP plasmid only, and untreated controls. For statistical analyses ANOVA with Bonferroni correction was used.

The EGL was separated from coronal slices by cutting through the ML. The tissue was collected in ice-cold HBSS (Hank's Balanced Salt Solution). After trypsinization and trituration, cells were suspended in MEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and penicilin/streptomycin, and plated at a density of 50,000 cells per well of an 8-well LabTek slide. Slides were coated with 20 &#x003bc;g/ml laminin or 50 &#x003bc;g/ml AX-1 essentially as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] except that slides coated with laminin were precoated with 100 &#x003bc;g/ml poly-lysine. After 48 h, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature. Cell cultures contained granule cells and Bergmann glia cells when coated on laminin as determined by Pax6 and GFAP staining (not shown). On AX-1 substratum glia cells were not able to spread. Neurite lengths were measured and are representative for four different cultures.

(a) After two days of incubation at 38.5&#x000b0;C the whole egg content was carefully transferred into a domed dish. After 6 days of <italic>ex ovo </italic>culturing the embryos reached HH34/E8 (b), the time point when injections and electroporations were performed in this study. The chicken embryo can be kept alive throughout embryonic development. Due to an increasing number of blood vessels in the extraembryonic membranes at later developmental stages (as seen at E18 in (c)), injections and electroporations become more difficult, however. Depending on the time of transfer the survival rate varied slightly but not significantly. (d) When embryos were transferred after two days (black dots), the survival rate of the embryos decreased more slowly during the first eight days compared to embryos that were transferred after 3 days (white dots). In both cases the survival rates stabilized for the following days (after E8). Routinely, we did not take <italic>ex ovo </italic>cultures out of the incubator before E8, the time point of injection. This resulted in a markedly higher survival rate of 62% at E8 (red dot).

The morphology of the cerebellum at HH38, revealed by methylene blue staining, was indistinguishable between embryos developing in the egg (a) and embryos that had been in a dish for 10 days (b). HH38 is the oldest developmental stage used in this study. Similarly, no differences between embryos developing in the egg (c,e) and embryos developing in a domed polystyrene dish (d,f) were found at HH38 when more specific criteria were used, like migration of Purkinje cells and formation of the characteristic layer in the periphery of the lobes (c,d) or AX-1 staining of parallel fibers in the ML (e,f). Purkinje cells were stained with an anti-Calbindin antibody (c,d). Therefore, differences in development between experimental and control embryos were not caused by culturing embryos in a dish.
