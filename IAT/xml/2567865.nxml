Errors in this process result in aneuploidy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003516-Jones1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. It is the homologous chromosomes that separate from each other during the first meiosis (meiosis I) while sister chromatids segregate during the second meiosis (meiosis II). Why do sister chromatids not separate in meiosis I? It is thought that one linkage between sister chromatids exists in meiosis I while it is not present in meiosis II. Previous reports have demonstrated that the multi-subunit complex, cohesin, is responsible for the linkage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003516-Haering1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

The removal of Rec8 along chromosome arms triggers segregation of homologs during meiosis I.

Whatever is responsible for preventing centromeric Rec8 from degradation in meiosis I?</p><p>The Shugoshin (Sgo) family of proteins has been demonstrated to protect centromeric cohesion during mitosis and meiosis in fission yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003516-Kitajima1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, Sgo may sense the loss of tension at the centromere to generate a spindle checkpoint signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003516-Watanabe2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003516-Kawashima1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. The previous work on Sgo1 was mainly focused on mitosis or meiosis of yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003516-Vaur1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and maize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003516-Han1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, but little is known about its role in mammalian meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003516-Lee2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we are trying to address Sgo1's roles in chromosome separation by exogenous protein overexpression to enhance, or by RNAi to suppress Sgo1 function during two meioses of mouse oocytes. The results imply that Sgo1 holds sister chromatids together in anaphase of first meiosis (AI) and that loss of Sgo1 causes chromatid separation in anaphase of second meiosis (AII) at the correct time.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subcellular distribution of Sgo1 during mouse oocyte meiosis</title><p>To characterize the roles of Sgo1 in chromosome separation during mouse oocyte meiosis, due to the lack of working antibody in mice, low concentration of (&#x02264;0.4 mg/ml) Myc<sub>6</sub>-Sgo1 mRNA was injected into oocytes to examine the dynamics of Sgo1 localization at metaphase and anaphase of both meiotic divisions. Then anti-myc-FITC antibody was used for immunofluorescence. The same amount of Myc<sub>6</sub> mRNA was injected as control, but no specific signals were found. All 40 chromosomes of mouse oocytes are telocentric, so homologs form bivalents in meiosis I while sister chromatids form univalents in meiosis II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003516-Choi1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. As shown clearly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003516-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, in pre-metaphase of meiosis I (pre-MI), synaptic homologous chromosomes turned into 20 bivalents, which have a strong Sgo1 staining in centromeres and a little faint staining along the chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003516-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>). In metaphase of the first meiosis (MI), homologous chromosomes are aligned at the spindle's equator, and sister chromatids of one homolog are pulled towards the same spindle pole. Prominent Sgo1 staining was always observed at centeomeres while faint Sgo1 staining on chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003516-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>). During the anaphase of the first meiosis (AI), Sgo1 signals were only detected on the centromeres of sister chromatids, until up to the metaphase of the second meiosis (MII), while no sgo1 signals were observed on arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003516-g001">Fig. 1c and d</xref>, insets). After chemical activation of MII oocytes, however, Sgo1 was no longer detected on the centromeres of separated single chromosomes in the anaphase of the second meiosis (AII) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003516-g001">Fig. 1e</xref>). The localization of Sgo1 on centromeres of sister chromatids during mouse oocyte meiosis was completely similar to that of Rec8 in meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003516-Buonomo1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003516-Watanabe1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003516-Lee1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. It is possible that Sgo1 on centromeres holds sister chromatids together during first meiosis, and sister chromatids can not separate apart but are pulled together as one homolog towards the same spindle pole instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003516-g001">Fig. 1c</xref>, inset). The loss of Sgo1 on centromeres of sister chromatids in AII stage and its concurrence with the separation of sister chromatids implies that loss of Sgo1 from centromeres is related to the separation of sister chromatids in second meiosis.</p><fig id="pone-0003516-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003516.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Localization of Myc-Sgo1 during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation.</title><p>Prominent Myc-Sgo1 signals were observed at the centromeres of sister chromatids and faint Myc-Sgo1 signals on chromosome arms in pre-MI and MI.

MII oocytes were injected with high concentrations (&#x02265;2.5 mg/ml) of Myc6-Sgo1 mRNA and cultured to AI stage (1 hour after chemical activation). The resulting images revealed that exogenous overexpressed Myc-Sgo1 along the arms of sister chromatids attached them tightly so that sister chromatids could not separate apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003516-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, arrow), whereas in control the sister chromatids separated apart normally. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003516-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, sister chromatid separation was observed in only 2.5&#x000b1;2.5&#x00025; of oocytes in Myc signal-positive oocytes, whereas in the control the ratio was 61.1&#x000b1;5.2&#x00025; (P&#x0003c;0.01). The overexpression of Myc6-Sgo1 blocked the initiation of AII and kept the oocytes at MII. As long as the overexpressed Myc-Sgo1 existed, the oocytes could not overcome the MII arrest. Can inactivation of either the spindle checkpoint or PP2A help oocytes overcome the prolonged arrest?

After 14 hours of culture in milrinone-free medium, exogenous Sgo1 overexpression significantly decreased extrusion of the first polar body (PBE), from 82.2&#x000b1;3.3&#x00025; in the control to 55&#x000b1;2.4&#x00025; in the injection group (P&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003516-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Then we collected all oocytes and divided them into two groups for immunofluorescence microscopy, based on positive or negative PBE. In oocytes without PBE, overexpressed Sgo1 was detected on all centromeres and arms of chromosomes like an &#x0201c;adhesive coat&#x0201d;, which kept homologous chromosomes as one entity and they did not separate apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003516-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>a). A typical bivalent shape displayed non-disjunctioned homologous chromosomes, which were connected through arm regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003516-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>a, inset). Very notably, in some oocytes with PBE, which indicates that the APC/C activity and onset of anaphase are normal, bivalents consisting of homologous chromosomes were seen instead of univalents as in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003516-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>c, arrow). To verify the observation in detail, we only collected the oocytes with PBE from both control and the Sgo1-overexpression group to perform chromosome spreads. Typical results showed that pairs of sister chromatids (20 pairs) were observed in the control oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003516-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, arrow head). However, in Sgo1-overexpressed oocytes with first polar body (pb1) extrusion, bivalents consisting of pairs of homologous chromosomes were observed in the oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003516-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, arrow). In the Sgo1 overexpression group, 30&#x000b1;8&#x00025; of the oocytes exhibited abnormal bivalents while in the control absolutely no such oocytes were observed (P&#x0003c;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003516-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). In this case, homologous chromosomes could not separate apart and the ultimate produced gamete would be aneuploid, which points to a significant cause for genetic disorder. Therefore, it is Sgo1 located along the arms of homologous chromosomes that attaches these chromosomes tightly together and the non-disjunctioned homologous chromosomes (bivalents) are pulled towards the same spindle poles as a whole. It is suggested that loss of Sgo1 along the arms of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I is required for homologous chromosome separation, and that Sgo1 at the centromere of sister chromatids protects them from separation until AII.</p><fig id="pone-0003516-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003516.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Overexpression of Sgo1 in meiosis I glues homologues tightly together.</title><p>(A) At meiosis I, overexpression of Myc-Sgo1 holds homologous chromosomes together and prevents them from separating apart.

Then the oocytes were arrested at GV by 2.5 &#x000b5;M milrinone for 24 hours before meiosis resumption.

Considering the mechanical stress during chromosome spreading, the number of chromosomes less than 25 was counted as normal.

The incorrect numbers of chromosomes could be related to the premature separation of sister chromatids after MI stage, which was consistent with the results from yeast. The low frequency could be due to the inefficiency of RNAi in oocytes, because the cell cycle of oocytes is more static than that of somatic cell lines, and the RNAi effects might not be as good as in somatic cell lines.</p><p>Our RNAi results are like those most recently reported by Lee et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003516-Lee2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

Lee et al had proposed that Sgo2 alone plays a predominant role in protecting centromeric cohesion in meiosis I in oocytes, whereas Sgo1 is mostly, if not entirely, dispensable for this function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003516-Lee2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Llano et al also supported that Sgo2 is essential for the completion of meiosis but not for mitotic cell division in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003516-Llano1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. However, here we stress the Sgo1's roles. In the MI stage, homologous chromosomes could form bivalents by chiasma, and separase-mediated cleavage of Rec8 did not occur until the onset of AI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003516-Watanabe2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003516-Petronczki1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. No single chromatid but bivalent was found in Sgo1-RNAi oocytes even though Sgo1 was depleted at the MI stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003516-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>c). Then the oocytes proceeded AI stage. During this process, homologous chromosomes were pulled towards opposite spindle pole. Centromeres between sister chromatids lost the protection from Sgo1 and linkage between chromatids was degraded, and thus single chromatids instead of univalents was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003516-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>d, arrow). Until MII, the oocytes always showed premature separated chromatids, while in control, sister chromaitids as univalents did not separate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003516-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>b). Based on our results regarding exogenous Sgo1 overexpression and RNAi, we conclude that Sgo1 plays an important role in protecting the linkage between sister chromatids during meiosis I in oocytes.</p><p>We also injected Sgo1-m siRNA into zygotes and cultured them for 4.5 days to examine the blastocyst rate. The blastocyst ratio (16&#x000b1;10.1&#x00025;, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;49) of the Sgo1 RNAi groups was significantly lower than that of the control groups (66.4&#x000b1;2.6&#x00025;, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;45) (P&#x0003c;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003516-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Sgo1 is therefore essential in setting up the meiotic pattern of chromosome segregation. If regarded it as true that the conservation of Sgo1 across species, mutations in human Sgo1 might induce chromosome-segregation defects in meiosis, which would lead to genetic imbalances. Many diseases are from it, such as infertility of spontaneous abortion, or to debilitating trisomies such as Down's syndrome.</p><p>In conclusion, prevention of premature separation of sister chromatids in meiosis I requires retention of centromeric Sgo1, while normal separation of sister chromatids in meiosis II requires loss of centromeric Sgo1. Given that Sgo1 is highly conserved among species, mutations in human Sgo1 might increase the frequency of aneuploidy in gametes, which would be a significant cause for genetic disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>All chemicals and medium were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO) unless stated otherwise.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Oocyte collection and culture</title><p>ICR mice care and handling were conducted in accordance with policies promulgated by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
