Despite these threats, human skin is normally not infected. In the last decade it has become evident that human skin provides, in addition to its physical barrier, also a chemical barrier based on the release of antimicrobial proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Braff1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Schrder1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Antimicrobial proteins are endogenous, gene-encoded proteins, which are able to kill bacteria, fungi and viruses at micro- and nanomolar concentrations. Recent <italic>in vivo</italic> studies confirmed the hypothesis that antimicrobial proteins have the capacity to protect the host against pathogenic microorganisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Chromek1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Salzman1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Some of these antimicrobial proteins are upregulated at sites of infection and inflammation such as the human beta-defensins &#x02212;2 and &#x02212;3 (hBD-2, hBD-3) as well as the cathelicidin LL-37 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Schrder1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-DeSmet1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Zanetti1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the physiological role of these ribonucleases is still not well understood. Recent data suggest that ribonucleases may also play a role in host defense. Eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN; RNase 2) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP; RNase 3) are localized to eosinophil secretory granules and exhibit antiviral activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Domachowske1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Domachowske2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

Many studies indicate that antimicrobial proteins, like the human beta-defensins, cathelicidin LL-37 and S100 protein psoriasin (S100A7), play an important role in cutaneous defense <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Braff1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Schrder1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Although several reports suggest that the human RNase A superfamily members ECP (eosinophil cationic protein, RNase 3) and EDN (eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, RNase 2) are important effector molecules of eosinophilic granulocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Rosenberg1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Rosenberg2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, the role of RNases in epithelial defense is largely unknown. A recent study indicates that a mouse ribonuclease (angiogenin 4) may participate in regulating the intestinal microflora <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Hooper1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The recent isolation of the antimicrobial ribonuclease RNase 7 from stratum corneum of healthy skin prompted us to further analyze its role in cutaneous defense. A quantitative analysis revealed that primary keratinocytes express high levels of RNase 7 mRNA when compared to other skin-derived antimicrobial proteins such as psoriasin, hBD-2, and LL-37. This observation further strengthened the hypothesis that RNase 7 may be an important defense molecule in cutaneous innate immunity. To get further insight into RNase 7 protein expression, we generated RNase 7 specific antibodies. Immunohistochemistry using these novel antibodies revealed expression of RNase 7 in all layers of human epidermis with higher intensity in the more outer differentiated epithelial layers. Hair follicles also stained positively which is in concordance with a recent study demonstrating RNase 7 expression in hair follicle epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Reithmayer1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The expression of RNase 7 in the uppermost epidermal layers and its expression in hair follicles are in concordance with its proposed antimicrobial function, because it is expressed at areas where the first contact with bacteria takes place. Because the deduced RNase 7 precursor contains a signal sequence, we hypothesized that RNase 7 may be efficiently secreted by keratinocytes. Using an RNase 7-ELISA, that we developed, we were able to detect higher RNase 7 protein levels in the supernatants of the primary keratinocyte cultures compared with keratinocyte extracts. These data indicate that RNase 7 is secreted from viable cells and acts primarily outside the cell, which is consistent with the proposed role of RNase 7 in antimicrobial defense.</p><p>Based on these <italic>in vitro</italic> data, we speculated that RNase 7 is secreted <italic>in vivo</italic> on the body surface. To prove this hypothesis, we determined whether RNase 7 is present at various skin surface sites. We were able to recover various amounts of RNase 7 in skin washing fluids from different body sites, which confirmed that RNase 7 is secreted <italic>in vivo</italic>. High variability in RNase 7 secretion levels was detected in different persons and skin locations. This suggests that levels of RNase 7 secretion may depend on environmental factors such as microbial colonization.</p><p>We recently identified psoriasin as a principal <italic>E. coli</italic>&#x02013;killing factor that protects the skin from infections with the gut bacterium <italic>E. coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Glser1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the high expression of RNase 7 in skin and its very potent activity against <italic>E. faecium</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Harder3">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> suggest that the skin is also protected against colonization with <italic>E. faecium</italic>. This would explain the low infection rate of skin areas exposed to <italic>E. faecium</italic> such as the perianal region. To prove this hypothesis, we first explored whether the skin has the capacity to kill <italic>E. faecium</italic>. Skin extracts derived from the stratum corneum efficiently killed <italic>E. faecium</italic> indicating that the skin harbors defense mechanisms which inhibit cutaneous colonization with <italic>E. faecium</italic>. To further evaluate whether RNase 7 might contribute to these defense mechanisms, we specifically inhibited the antimicrobial activity of RNase 7 in the skin extracts using RNase 7-specific antibodies. These experiments revealed that RNase 7 contributes to the <italic>E. faecium</italic> killing activity of skin extracts, suggesting an important role for RNase 7 in protecting the skin against <italic>E. faecium</italic> infection.</p><p>The high antimicrobial activity of RNase 7 against <italic>E. faecium</italic> raises the question of the responsible molecular killing mechanisms. We speculated that the high ribonuclease activity of RNase 7 might be involved in the RNase 7-mediated killing of <italic>E. faecium</italic>. To address this question, we generated recombinant RNase 7 that lacks enzymatic activity. By making point mutations of the catalytic residues lys-38 and his-123, we found that ablation of ribonuclease activity had no impact on the bactericidal activity of RNase 7 against <italic>E. faecium</italic>. This is consistent with other reports showing that members of the RNase A superfamily exhibit ribonuclease-independent antibacterial activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Rosenberg3">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Nitto1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, but raises the question of the role of the enzymatic activity. It has been shown that the antiviral activity of the RNases ECP and EDN against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) requires functional ribonuclease activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Domachowske1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Domachowske2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. These data suggest that the ribonuclease activity of RNase 7 may be necessary for a potential antiviral rather than antibacterial activity. However, this remains to be proven as it is not yet known whether RNase 7 exhibits antiviral activity.</p><p>Recently, it has been reported that the ribonuclease inhibitor interacts with RNase 7 and blocks its ribonuclease as well as antimicrobial activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Abtin1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. It is possible that the ribonuclease inhibitor masks the amino acid residues responsible for the antimicrobial action of RNase 7. Another explanation is that the interaction of the ribonuclease inhibitor RI induces a conformational change of RNase 7 as recently reported for the interaction of RNase 1 and the ribonuclease inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Johnson1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>RNase 7 is a highly cationic protein with a pI of approximately 10.7. Many human antimicrobial proteins are cationic and contain a large number of basic amino acids. Examples comprise the alpha- and beta-defensins, the cathelicidins as well as the histatins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-DeSmet1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Pazgier1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Selsted1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. It is believed that the highly cationic character of these molecules results in a high affinity to the negatively charged surface of bacteria, which is prerequisite for efficient killing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Powers1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Very recently, Huang and colleagues showed by NMR and mutagenesis studies that cationic lysines are critical for the antimicrobial activity of RNase 7 against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. They suggested that RNase 7 may bind to the negatively charged components of the bacterial membrane through the presence of cationic residues which ultimately leads to membrane disruption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Huang1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. It remains to be shown whether this killing mechanism, which has been proposed for many antimicrobial peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006424-Powers1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, is also responsible for the high killing activity of RNase 7 against <italic>E. faecium</italic>.</p><p>In summary, our data suggest that RNase 7 contributes to cutaneous innate immunity against <italic>E. faecium</italic> and probably other bacteria. An interesting speculation is that dysregulation of RNase 7 may result in higher susceptibility to infectious diseases. A better understanding of the role of endogenous antimicrobial proteins such as RNase 7 may result in the development of novel therapeutic strategies that enhance the cutaneous innate defense system by the application or selective induction of antimicrobial proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All experiments were performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki protocols and under protocols approved by the Ethics Committee at the Medical Faculty of the Christian-Albrechts-University, Kiel, Germany (A104/06).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Culture of epithelial cells</title><p>Keratinocytes were derived from foreskin samples obtained from circumcision surgery after obtaining written informed consent.
