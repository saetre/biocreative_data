During the mitotic cell division cycle, entire chromosomes must first be completely replicated before the newly synthesized sister chromatids condense and are segregated equally to the nuclei of daughter cells in which they decondense in interphase. Following cytokinesis the whole chromosome cycle is ready to be reinitiated. In addition, activation and repression of transcription are frequently accompanied by reorganization of the chromatin structure, facilitating access of the required DNA-binding proteins. These structural changes involve local disruption or reformation of nucleosomes and can be mediated by large multiprotein structures called chromatin remodeling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c2">2</xref>). These events are highly conserved in all eukaryotes from unicellular yeast to human.</p><p>The first remodeling complex identified was the budding yeast 11 subunit SWI&#x0002f;SNF complex, which is required for chromatin derepression and activation of a set of inducible genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c5">5</xref>). Other related remodeling complexes were more recently isolated from <italic>Drosophila</italic>. These complexes, named NURF (<underline>nu</underline>cleosome <underline>r</underline>emodeling <underline>f</underline>actor; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c6">6</xref>), CHRAC (<underline>chr</underline>omatin <underline>a</underline>ccessibility <underline>c</underline>omplex; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c7">7</xref>) and ACF (<underline>A</underline>TP-dependent <underline>c</underline>hromatin assembly and remodeling <underline>f</underline>actor; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c8">8</xref>), were found to arrange the histone octamers to promote nucleosome mobility and to stimulate binding of transcription factors. Interestingly, one or more subunits of each complex contain a conserved sequence called the SNF2-related helicase&#x0002f;ATPase domain. The basic function of this domain has been proposed to destabilize protein&#x02013;DNA interaction by moving along DNA templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c9">9</xref>).</p><p>Another class of related proteins implicated in chromatin remodeling is the CHD (<underline>c</underline>hromo-<underline>h</underline>elicase&#x0002f;ATPase <underline>D</underline>NA-binding protein) family. These proteins contain not only the SNF2-related domain but also two chromodomains (<underline>chr</underline>omatin <underline>o</underline>rganization <underline>mo</underline>difier), generally believed to be involved in the formation of repressed and heterochromatic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c11">11</xref>). The chromodomain consists of 30&#x02013;50 amino acids conserved in several eukaryotic chromatin-binding proteins such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> HP1 (<underline>h</underline>eterochromatin <underline>p</underline>rotein <underline>1</underline>), Pc (<underline>P</underline>oly<underline>c</underline>omb) and Suvar3-9 proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c14">14</xref>). In fission yeast there are three previously known chromodomain proteins: Swi6p (<underline>swi</underline>tching; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c15">15</xref>), Clr4p (<underline>c</underline>ryptic <underline>l</underline>oci <underline>r</underline>egulator; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c17">17</xref>) and Chp1p (<underline>ch</underline>romo domain protein <italic>in Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c18">18</xref>). Although the mechanism by which chromodomains interact with chromatin is unclear, synthetic chromodomain peptides are able to self-associate, providing chromodomain-containing proteins the potential to bind to each other and to form complexes among unknown components of the heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c19">19</xref>).</p><p><italic>The S.pombe</italic> Hrp1 is a new member of the chromodomain and of the SNF2&#x0002f;SWI2 family, with two chromodomains, a SNF2-related helicase&#x0002f;ATPase domain and a Myb-like telobox-related DNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c20">20</xref>). Until now, Hrp1 has been known to contain DNA-binding activity with a preference for (A&#x0002b;T)-rich tracts in double-stranded DNA via interaction with the minor groove. However, like other family members, it exhibits no helicase activity in spite of the presence of the conserved helicase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c21">21</xref>).</p><p>In this report, we show that Hrp1 has a DNA-dependent ATPase activity. We investigate the subcellular localization of Hrp1 and further characterize its cellular functions. We demonstrate that <italic>hrp1</italic>&#x00394; has a slight mitotic chromosome loss and defective anaphase phenotypes and that overexpression of Hrp1 leads to a severe chromosome decondensation and chromosome segregation defect similar to that of <italic>top2</italic> and condensin mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c23">23</xref>). Thus, Hrp1 directly or indirectly affects the sister chromatid structure that is vital for segregation and separation of chromosomes in mitosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, media and techniques for molecular biology and genetics</title><p><italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> strains used in this study are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd307tb1">1</xref>. <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> cells were grown in Edinburgh Minimal Medium (EMM) supplemented with appropriate amino acids at 30&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c24">24</xref>).

The analysis showed that Hrp1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus with an evenly dispersed pattern (compare upper and lower left panels in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f1">1</xref>A). The control experiment (right panels of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f1">1</xref>A) revealed that the faint spots in the cytoplasm shown in the top left panel of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f1">1</xref>A were non-specific. In order to analyze the location of the nuclear localization signal (NLS), we made green fluorescent protein (GFP)&#x02013;Hrp1 fusion constructs. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f1">1</xref>B, amino acids 1&#x02013;152 were sufficient to direct GFP to the nucleus and deletion of amino acids 122&#x02013;152 from this construct abolished the nuclear localization. The results suggest that Hrp1 is predominantly a nuclear protein and it is possible that its subcellular localization may be determined by a putative NLS which is within amino acids 122&#x02013;152.</p></sec><sec><title>Hrp1 has a DNA-dependent ATPase activity</title><p>Sequence analyses showed that Hrp1 contains a unique ATPase motif, a DNA-binding domain and helicase motifs found in the SWI2&#x0002f;SNF2 protein family. To see if the ATPase motif of Hrp1 has a true function, we purified 6&#x000d7;His-tagged Hrp1 protein and tested it for ATPase activity. As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd307tb2">2</xref>, ATPase activity of Hrp1 was stimulated up to 9-fold by both dsDNA and ssDNA. Little ATPase activity was observed when <italic>S.pombe</italic> total RNA was added to the reaction, implying that RNA is a poor cofactor for ATP hydrolysis by Hrp1 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd307tb2">2</xref>). At least 100 ng of dsDNA were required for DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f2">2</xref>A). <italic>In vitro</italic> ATPase activity of Hrp1 had an optimal pH of 7.0 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f2">2</xref>B) and required Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, which could be replaced by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, but not by Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd307tb2">2</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f2">2</xref>C, ATP hydrolytic activity of Hrp1 proceeds in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. We also examined whether other nucleotides could be substrates for Hrp1 ATPase. The enzyme hydrolyzed dATP with similar efficacy and cofactor requirements as with ATP (data not shown). Other NTPs and dNTPs, however, were not significantly hydrolyzed by Hrp1 (data not shown).</p><p>Kinetic analysis of the Hrp1 ATPase was carried out by varying the ATP concentration (100&#x02013;2000 &#x000b5;M). The <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value, representing the ATP concentration at half maximal velocity, was calculated from a Lineweaver&#x02013;Burk plot to be 5.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup> M (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f2">2</xref>D). These results show that Hrp1 also has a catalytic function driven by the energy from ATP hydrolysis, which is similar to that of other ATPases from the SWI2&#x0002f;SNF2 family.</p></sec><sec><title>Hrp1 disrupts mitotic chromosome segregation when overexpressed</title><p>The growth rates of <italic>hrp1</italic> deletion (<italic>hrp1</italic>&#x00394;) and Hrp1-overproducing cells (JYK672) have been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c20">20</xref>). Strain <italic>hrp1</italic>&#x00394; enters the exponential growth phase slightly faster than the wild-type, whereas JYK672 (overexpressing) cells are unable to grow exponentially. To investigate if the growth defects correlated with structural changes in nuclear morphology, the <italic>hrp1</italic>&#x00394; and Hrp1-overexpressing cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy. While we observed infrequently altered states of chromatin compaction in <italic>hrp1</italic>&#x00394; cells, chromosome decondensation and missegregation were readily observed by microscopic examination in JYK672 (Hrp1-overexpressing) cells after DAPI staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f3">3</xref>) and altered ploidy was detected by FACS analysis of DNA content (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f4">4</xref>). JYK672 cells were apparently not able to proceed with coordinated mitosis and thus showed various aberrant patterns of chromosomal segregation, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f3">3</xref>. At least 27&#x00025; of the Hrp1-overexpressing cells (JYK672) showed abnormal segregation of the chromosomes after 12 h in thiamine-depleted (overexpression) conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f3">3</xref>C&#x02013;F and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd307tb3">3</xref>). The number of cells showing abnormal mitotic phenotypes was closely correlated with the incubation time under derepressing condition of the <italic>nmt1</italic> promoter. Some of the cells had undergone cytokinesis without a prior completion of mitosis, resulting in displacement of the nucleus and anucleation in daughter cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f3">3</xref>C) and some showed uneven nuclear segregation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f3">3</xref>D). Some of septated cells displayed a &#x02018;cut&#x02019; (<underline>c</underline>ell <underline>u</underline>ntimely <underline>t</underline>orn) phenotype (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f3">3</xref>E and F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f5">5</xref>C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c30">30</xref>) due to untimely cleavage of the undivided nucleus by the septum.</p><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f4">4</xref>, FACS analysis revealed an aberrant DNA profile of Hrp1-overexpressing cells. While the DNA profile of the wild-type cells was unchanged even after 30 h in the thiamine-depleted medium, a significant change was observed in the DNA profile of Hrp1-overproducing cells. During the early period of incubation, JYK672 cells cultured both with (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f4">4</xref>, b) and without (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f4">4</xref>, c) thiamine showed a somewhat broader spectrum but their 2C DNA peaks were slightly shifted toward higher DNA contents compared to that of wild-type cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f4">4</xref>, a). Prolonged thaimine-depleted incubation of JYK672 cells under the same conditions led to a decrease in the number of cells with 2C DNA content and then the appearance of cells containing higher or lower DNA contents. Incubation &#x0003e;26 h resulted in eventual loss of the 2C peak. Thus, it seems as if overproduction of Hrp1 led to aberrant mitosis and missegregation of chromosomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Both deletion of the <italic>hrp1</italic> gene and overexpressed Hrp1 cause anaphase decondensation in mitosis</title><p>To examine the anaphase defects in <italic>hrp1</italic>&#x00394; and Hrp1-overexpressing cells, we performed immunofluorescent staining with an anti-tubulin antibody, TAT1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f5">5</xref>). Tubulin staining revealed a substantial fraction of abnormal anaphase (12&#x00025; abnormal anaphase cells, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 50) in <italic>hrp1</italic>&#x00394; (JYK121) cells as compared to wild-type (FY367) control cells (&#x0003c;2.0&#x00025; abnormal anaphase cells, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 51). The abnormal <italic>hrp1</italic>&#x00394; cells had lagging chromosomes in the mid zone of late anaphase spindles. Overexpression of Hrp1 caused a more severe defect in anaphase chromosome behavior. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f5">5</xref>A shows normal anaphase (top) and normal post-anaphase configurations (bottom) of microtubules and chromosomes. While all wild-type cells found in anaphase showed normal morphologies, most (93&#x00025;) Hrp1-overexpressing cells in anaphase had abnormal decondensed and entangled chromosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f5">5</xref>B and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd307tb3">3</xref>). These cells had elongated nuclear structures, as seen in <italic>top2</italic> mutants, and their chromatin fibers seemed to extend along the spindle.

Hrp1 expression in the <italic>nmt1</italic>-<italic>hrp1</italic> integrant was measured by western blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f6">6</xref>). The percentage of cells retaining a mini-chromosome was measured after each culture was incubated on YE plates containing a low concentration of adenine. As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd307tb4">4</xref>, Ch<sup>16</sup> mini-chromosomes were frequently lost in the Hrp1-overexpressing strain. Since full induction of the Hrp1 protein in FY672 cells led to some lethality, the mini-chromosome loss rate was likely to be underestimated. In addition, loss of function of Hrp1 resulted in a 10-fold increase in chromosome loss rate compared to that of wild-type cells (0.03&#x00025;). This result suggests that a balanced level of Hrp1 is important for proper chromosome segregation.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of Hrp1 induces an aberrant nucleolar structure</title><p>To determine whether abnormal chromatin compaction causes the slow growth and unequal chromatin segregation of Hrp1-overexpressing cells, the cellular morphologies of wild-type (FY367), <italic>hrp1</italic>-deleted (JYK121) and Hrp1-overexpressing (JYK672) cells were examined by transmission electron microscopy. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f7">7</xref>A&#x02013;C, intact nuclei and nucleoli were observed in the wild-type, <italic>hrp1</italic> deletion mutant and Hrp1-repressed JYK672 cells. However, odd electron-dense materials were found to accumulate in the nucleus of Hrp1-overexpressing cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f7">7</xref>D&#x02013;F). The distinct nucleoli structures found in the cells were classified as follows: (i) horseshoe-shaped nucleoli (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f7">7</xref>D, most frequently found); (ii) two unequally separated nucleoli (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f7">7</xref>E); and (iii) in rare cases, a widely dispersed pattern of dark material in the nucleus as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd307f7">7</xref>F.

Swi6p and Clr4p are required for formation of heterochromatin structures at centromeres, near telomeres and in the silent mating type region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c31">31</xref>). Since Hrp1 possesses a chromodomain, it is conceivable that this protein also functions as part of heterochromatin structures. Hrp1 also has a Myb-like DNA-binding domain in the C-terminus, a domain which is conserved among several proteins binding with telomere-related sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c32">32</xref>). We previously reported that Hrp1 is a DNA-binding protein having a preference for (T&#x0002b;A)-rich minor grooves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c21">21</xref>). However, our experiments here demonstrate that Hrp1 protein is uniformly localized in the nucleus. Therefore, we suggest that Hrp1p at least is not exclusively localized to heterochromatin, whilst the other chromodomain proteins in fission yeast, Swi6 and Clr4, are localized to heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c31">31</xref>). The CHD1 homologs from mouse (mCHD1), <italic>Drosophila</italic> (dCHD1) and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (ScCHD1) were also found to be localized in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c35">35</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>DNA-stimulated ATPase activity of Hrp1</title><p>Many SNF2&#x0002f;SWI2 proteins have been reported to have DNA-dependent ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c39">39</xref>) and mutations in this ATPase domain have been shown to affect the function of the protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c40">40</xref>). In other SWI2&#x0002f;SNF2 proteins the energy released from ATP hydrolysis is used for isomerization of the nucleosome structure by alteration of histone&#x02013;DNA contacts critical for their function. In this study, we show that Hrp1 protein, a new member of the SWI2&#x0002f;SNF2 protein family and CHD1 subfamily, also has a DNA-stimulated ATPase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and it is therefore possible that Hrp1 functions in nucleosome remodeling like the other family members.</p></sec><sec><title>Defective chromosome segregation</title><p>We report an elevated mini-chromosome loss rate for both <italic>hrp1</italic>&#x00394; cells and Hrp1-overexpressing cells. In general, the missegregation of chromatin could be caused by the defects in chromosome condensation, sister chromatid separation, anaphase-promoting proteolysis and&#x0002f;or spindle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c41">41</xref>). We found that the <italic>hrp1</italic> deletion mutant had a slight defect in mitotic chromosome segregation, detected as an increase in Ch<sup>16</sup> mini-chromosome loss, and some aberrant mitosis, detected by staining with TAT1 antibody. Interestingly, mutations in other chromodomain protein genes, <italic>clr4</italic> and <italic>swi6</italic>, cause similar defects, such as lagging chromosomes in late anaphase spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c31">31</xref>). In contrast, Hrp1-overexpressing cells revealed a relatively high incidence of cytological defects, including a decondensed anaphase and &#x02018;cut&#x02019; phenotype, which is very similar to decondensed chromatin in <italic>cut3</italic>, <italic>cut14</italic> and <italic>top2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c23">23</xref>). Therefore, the chromosome missegregation in Hrp1-overexpressing cells is likely to be caused by interference with chromatin condensation in mitosis.</p><p>The electron microscopic analysis shows that nucleolar electron-dense regions were larger when Hrp1 was overexpressed as compared to nucleoli of wild-type cells. These enlarged dark regions also appeared to exhibit unusual horseshoe shapes. These results suggest that overexpression of Hrp1 also causes condensation of the nucleolus. <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> rDNA is known to consist of 100&#x02013;150 copies of 10.9 kb tandem head-to-tail repeats in two clusters at both ends of chromosome III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c43">43</xref>). Thus, it is possible that a higher cellular level of Hrp1 causes unusual assembly of nucleolar structures, including the rDNA clusters.</p></sec><sec><title>A direct or indirect role of Hrp1 in chromosome condensation?</title><p>The observed defects in chromosome segregation and nucleolar morphology in Hrp1-overexpressing cells may be interpreted by the following hypotheses. (i) Hrp1 may directly or indirectly affect the chromatin structure by virtue of the conserved ATPase&#x0002f;helicase and chromodomains. During the cell cycle, Hrp1 may facilitate and&#x0002f;or counteract the action of condensins. (ii) Hrp1 may directly compete with other proteins such as condensins or topoisomerase II for (A&#x0002b;T)-rich binding sites. (iii) High Hrp1 levels may cause inappropriate heterochromatin formation that prevents normal chromosome segregation. Our previous data showed that Hrp1 prefers to bind an (A&#x0002b;T)-rich sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c21">21</xref>) and 13S condensin is also proposed to bind a scaffold attachment region containing an (A&#x0002b;T)-rich DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c44">44</xref>). Thus, Hrp1 may normally play a role in condensation of some specialized regions of chromatin (rDNA, telomere, centromere, etc). Possibly, overexpressed Hrp1 may prevent the binding of some condensin-like proteins and in turn inappropriately condense or decondense non-cognate structures. It is clear that proper condensation is a prerequisite for normal sister chromatid separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd307c45">45</xref>).</p><p>It remains unclear what exact role the Hrp1 protein might play in chromatin remodeling. To understand the exact role of Hrp1, further studies examining the relationship between Hrp1 and other proteins that play a role in chromatin condensation, such as Swi6, Clr4, Top2 and the condensins, remain to be performed. However, this present study establishes that Hrp1 is a nuclear protein that contains ATPase activity like other SNF2&#x0002f;SWI2 protein family members and that it is required for chromosome segregation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd307f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Determination of Hrp1 subcellular localization.
