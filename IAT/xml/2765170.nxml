We show that the mycobacterial enzyme is almost 21 times more catalytically proficient than its counterparts in other prokaryotes. ITC measurements illustrate that the enzyme follows an ordered mechanism of substrate addition with DCoA as the leading substrate and ATP following in tow. Kinetic and ITC experiments demonstrate that though CTP binds strongly to the enzyme, it is unable to participate in DCoA phosphorylation. We report that CTP actually inhibits the enzyme by decreasing its Vmax. Not surprisingly, a structural homology search for the modeled mycobacterial CoaE picks up cytidylmonophosphate kinases, deoxycytidine kinases, and cytidylate kinases as close homologs. Docking of DCoA and CTP to CoaE shows that both ligands bind at the same site, their interactions being stabilized by 26 and 28 hydrogen bonds respectively. We have also assigned a role for the universal Unknown Protein Family 0157 (UPF0157) domain in the mycobacterial CoaE in the proper folding of the full length enzyme.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>In view of the evidence presented, it is imperative to assign a greater role to the last enzyme of Coenzyme A biosynthesis in metabolite flow regulation through this critical biosynthetic pathway.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, the causative organism of tuberculosis, possesses a thick, hydrophobic, complex cell envelope composed of a variety of complex lipids, peptidoglycans etc. which serves as an impervious barrier to drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007645-Glickman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007645-McKinney1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

One such ubiquitous cofactor is Coenzyme A (CoA) which along with its precursor, 4&#x02032;-phosphopantetheine, functions as an acyl group carrier and carbonyl activating group for Claisen reactions as well as for amide-, ester-, and thioester-forming reactions in the cell acting as prosthetic groups of carrier proteins of fatty acid, polyketide, nonribosomal peptide synthases etc. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007645-Begley2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. A survey of the BRENDA database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brenda-enzymes.info">http://www.brenda-enzymes.info</ext-link>) of all known enzyme activities shows that 9&#x00025; of the approximately 3500 identified activities use CoA or a CoA thioester as a co-substrate and therefore, the ratio between CoA and its thioester derivatives is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007645-Leonardi1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. This is further corroborated by the fact that all attempts to disrupt the genes coding for the enzymes in the CoA biosynthetic pathway have either failed or have resulted in lethal phenotypes in many organisms.</p><p>CoA biosynthesis, a five-step pathway which utilizes the precursors, pantothenate, cysteine and ATP, is invariant in all organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007645-Begley2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. It begins with the phosphorylation of pantothenate by the enzyme CoaA (pantothenate kinase). CoaB (phosphopantethenoylcysteine synthetase) condenses the 4&#x02032;-phosphopantothenate thus generated with a cysteine molecule to form 4&#x02032;-phosphopantothenoylcysteine which is further decarboxylated by CoaC (phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase) liberating 4&#x02032;-phosphopantetheine, the prosthetic group incorporated by carrier proteins in fatty acid, polyketide, nonribosomal peptide biosyntheses. CoaD (phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase) adenylates the 4&#x02032;-phosphopantetheine moiety to generate the final CoA precursor, dephosphocoenzyme A (DCoA). CoaE (dephosphocoenzyme A kinase, EC 2.7.1.24) then phosphorylates the 3&#x02032;-OH of the ribose in the DCoA structure to generate CoA.</p><p>In mammals, the activities of the penultimate enzyme CoaD and the final enzyme CoaE are carried out by a single bifunctional 62 kDa enzyme, encoded by the CoA synthase gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007645-Worrall1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007645-Aghajanian1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The human and porcine CoA synthases have been shown to possess three domains, an N-terminal domain that helps target the bifunctional enzyme to the mitochondrial outer membrane and mediates protein-protein interactions, a middle CoaD domain and a C-terminal CoaE domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007645-Zhyvoloup1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, it has been shown that proteolytic cleavage of the human enzyme does not affect enzyme activity or the proposed tertiary structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007645-Worrall2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, the N-terminal domain of the CoA synthase is found only in higher eukaryotes and has been shown to effect regulation of the CoaD and CoaE activities by phospholipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007645-Zhyvoloup2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The amalgamation of the last two enzyme activities also hints at the existence of a currently-unknown, relatively recently evolved mechanism of regulation of the CoA biosynthetic pathway seen only in the higher eukaryotes. The mycobacterial enzyme shows a very low sequence similarity (15&#x00025;) to the human CoaE. Thus low sequence homology and different mechanisms of regulation in the prokaryotic and eukaryotic sequences show that selective inhibition of the mycobacterial CoA biosynthesis is possible, marking out dephosphocoenzyme A kinase (CoaE) as a potential antimycobacterial drug target.</p><p>Unlike the first step of mycobacterial CoA biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007645-Das1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007645-Hong1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, information about its last step, catalyzed by CoaE, is scanty.

We show that its activity is regulated by an intrinsic cellular metabolite, cytidine triphosphate (CTP) a feature as yet unknown for members of this family of enzymes. The mycobacterial enzyme is atypical compared to its counterparts in the prokaryotic kingdom as it possesses an extra domain C-terminal to the dephosphocoenzyme A kinase, which belongs to the Unknown Protein Family, UPF0157 (Pfam database); to which no function has been assigned till date. We show that this domain is essentially required for the proper folding of the mycobacterial CoaE, delineating region 35&#x02013;50 (KIACGHKALRVDHIG) of this domain as essential for the latter function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Plasmid Construction, Expression and Purification of CoaE</title><p>The full length CoaE gene was amplified from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genomic DNA using the primers CoaE_Fwd:<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;- GGAATTCCATATGGTGACCGACCGCGAT&#x02013;3&#x02032;</named-content> and CoaE_Rev:<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;- CCCAAGCTTTTAACGCAAATGCAC-3&#x02032;</named-content>, designed with NdeI/HindIII sites.

A thermodynamically favorable reaction is accompanied by a decrease in free energy (&#x02212;&#x00394;G), which is composed of enthalpic and entropic terms (&#x00394;G&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;&#x00394;H&#x02212;T&#x00394;S). Calorimetry measures the heat exchanged during any reaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007645-Todd1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The high sensitivity of the technique allows experiments to be carried out with low amounts of enzyme and a single experiment allows rate calculations multiple times as several injections of the substrate into the cell containing the enzyme can be carried out. ITC experiments were performed using a VP-ITC titration microcalorimeter (Microcal Inc., U.S.A.). The reference cell was filled with water and the calorimeter was calibrated using standard electrical pulses as recommended by the manufacturer. For all ITC experiments, the CoaE protein was dialyzed overnight (12&#x02013;18 hr) in 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM KCl and 5&#x00025; glycerol. Substrate solutions were prepared in the final dialysis buffer. Solutions of the protein were filled in the sample cell (1.4 ml) and titrated with ATP-&#x003b3;S (a non-hydrolysable analog of ATP) or DCoA solutions introduced into it from the syringe (298 uL). Excepting the substrate against which the parameters were being determined, the composition of the solutions in the syringe and cell were kept constant. ITC experiments were routinely performed at 20&#x000b0;C. Raw data were collected for substrate heats of dilution in the buffer and integrated using the Microcal Origin software version 7.0 supplied with the instrument. In control experiments, the substrates were titrated against buffer.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0007645-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007645.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Thermodynamic parameters of ligand binding to mycobacterial CoaE at pH 7.8 and 20&#x000b0;C.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0007645-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0007645.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Titrant</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>N</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>&#x00394;H (cal/M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>K<sub>a</sub> (M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x0002a;104)</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>&#x00394;S (calM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>K<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)</italic></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ATP alone</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.683</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;495.3 (&#x000b1;36.3)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.18 (&#x000b1;0.14)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.9 (&#x000b1;1.21)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DCoA alone</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.810</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;3719 (&#x000b1;201.5)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.43 (&#x000b1;0.34)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.32 (&#x000b1;0.34)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NHATP binding on DCoA-saturated CoaE</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.947</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;3776 (&#x000b1;234.5)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.06 (&#x000b1;0.47)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.85 (&#x000b1;0.48)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DCoA binding on NH-ATP-saturated CoaE</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.839</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;1063 (&#x000b1;71.3)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.85 (&#x000b1;0.25)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.9 (&#x000b1;0.91)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CoA alone</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NB</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NB</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NB</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NB</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ADP binding on DCoA-saturated CoaE</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.07</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;3612 (274.8)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.03 (&#x000b1;0.51)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.38 (&#x000b1;0.78)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ADP binding on CoA-saturated CoaE</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.23</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;2138 (&#x000b1;181.5)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.88 (&#x000b1;0.58)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.1 (&#x000b1;0.98)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">dATP binding on DCoA-saturated CoaE</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.871</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;848 (&#x000b1;54.7)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.74 (&#x000b1;0.24)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.4 (&#x000b1;1.85)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CTP binding</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.08</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;482.5 (&#x000b1;37.4)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.59 (&#x000b1;0.19)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.6 (&#x000b1;1.11)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GTP binding</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NB</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NB</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NB</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NB</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><label/><p>Values of &#x00394;H and &#x00394;S are in cal mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>K<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.

In order to aid the selection of modeling templates for the N- and C-terminal domains of the mycobacterial CoaE, the Sequence Feature Scan tool from the Swiss-Model was used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007645.s001">Supporting Information File S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007645.s006">Table S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007645-Arnold1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Putative models for the NTD and CTD were obtained by the SWISS-MODEL software of the SWISSPROT workspace using both the first approach mode as well as the alignment interface mode. Since the closest homolog, with a solved structure, to the mycobacterial enzyme, was the <italic>E. coli</italic> CoaE, we modeled the NTD on the <italic>E. coli</italic> structure (32.7&#x00025; identity, 54.7&#x00025; similarity). In 2006, a crystal structure for the GrpB protein of unknown function from <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> was deposited in the PDB, (PDB code: 2nrk, accession no. Q837C3_ENTFA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007645-Cuff1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. This protein also belongs to the UPF0157 family of proteins of unknown function like the CTD of the mycobacterial CoaE, with which it shares a sequence identity of 25.5&#x00025;. No other crystal structures were available for this domain except the 2nrk structure and as the CTD shares considerable sequence similarity with the enterococcal protein (e-value of 4e-48 in PSI-BLAST search), the latter was used as a template to model the CTD using the Swiss-Model software in the alignment interface mode. The models of the NTD and CTD thus obtained were then energy minimized using the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) utility, version MOE2006.08, using the MMFF94x forcefield and were then stitched together to generate the modeled mycobacterial CoaE by the Coot software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007645-Chemical1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007645-Emsley1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

These were energy minimized by MOE using the AMBER99 forcefield and then docked onto the energy minimized protein models using the MMFF94x forcefield in the MOE server. The docked complex with the least energy was chosen. Each process starting from model building, energy minimization and ligand docking was carried out a minimum of 15 times for each ligand-protein complex.

Our ITC studies on the mycobacterial CoaE reveal as yet unknown features for this class of enzymes. The two substrates, DCoA and ATP, are presumably located in separate and well defined binding pockets of the enzyme, as is seen in all the other enzymes belonging to this superfamily of P-loop containing proteins. The ternary complex between the enzyme and its substrates may either be formed via an obligatory sequential pathway or by a random mechanism of substrate addition. Sequential addition of substrates can follow either of the following two routes: CoaE &#x02192; CoaE&#x000b7;DCoA &#x02192; CoaE&#x000b7;DCoA&#x000b7;ATP (reactions i and ii of Scheme 1) or CoaE &#x02192; CoaE&#x000b7;ATP &#x02192; CoaE&#x000b7;ATP&#x000b7;DCoA (reactions iii and iv depicted in scheme 1). On the other hand, if substrate binding follows a random mechanism, binding of one substrate to the enzyme would not be a prerequisite for binding of the other, and all four reactions of Scheme 1 can take place with equal probability.<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0007645.e002"/></disp-formula></p><sec id="s3c1"><title>Scheme 1</title><p>Formation of the ternary enzyme-substrate complex, CoaE&#x000b7;DCoA&#x000b7;ATP.

On expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) competent cells, a majority (90&#x02013;98&#x00025;) of the hexahistidine tagged NTD protein went into the insoluble fraction. In contrast, a major fraction of the CTD alone was expressed in the soluble form. All attempts to express the NTD alone in its soluble form, even by modification of the conditions of its induction were to no avail. Also, attempts to purify the His-tagged NTD, in the absence of the CTD, from the insoluble fraction were not fruitful. Interestingly, only when it was expressed in fusion with Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST) at its C-terminus (using the pETGEXCT vector which allows the production of C-terminal fusions of GST), NTD with full retention of its enzyme activity was found to be completely (95&#x00025;) in the soluble fraction. In contrast, neither did an N-terminal fusion of GST to the NTD nor the expression of GST in trans to the NTD (on a separate plasmid co-transformed with the NTD-pET plasmid) yield any protein in the soluble fraction. The full length protein that contains both the NTD and the CTD is found completely in the soluble form with full activity. The NTD alone, on the other hand, cannot be expressed without the CTD (or GST at its C-terminus). The CTD, however, fails to assist the folding of other proteins and therefore in all probability, does not act as a general chaperone in the cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007645.s001">Supporting Information File S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007645.s002">Fig. S1</xref>). Thus the UPF0157 domain, i.e. the mycobacterial CTD, serves a specific role in the proper folding of the NTD as evident from its appearance in soluble form with full retention of its activity.</p><p>We next determined whether deleting a part of the CTD affects the expression of CoaE in the soluble form with a retention of its full enzymatic activity. Initially, we constructed deletes of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 amino acids from the C-terminus of the CTD, none of which affected full-length protein expression or activity. Focusing then on the N-terminus of the CTD, 150, 100 and 50 residues were deleted from this end of the CTD. Despite all attempts, none of these yielded protein in the soluble fraction. To further delineate the exact region in the CTD that is involved in the specific NTD-chaperoning activity, we deleted 14 and 35 residues from the beginning of the CTD, both of which expressed soluble protein. Characterization of the CTD-N&#x00394;35 mutant revealed that it has a Kcat/Km value of 0.0362 &#x000b5;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, which is approx. 72&#x00025; of the wtCoaE that contains both the NTD and the full length CTD. The mycobacterial dephosphocoenzyme A kinase therefore requires a specific unit on its C-terminus which facilitates its folding, maturation and functional expression. This role was performed by GST in the NTD-GST clone and is carried out by residues 35&#x02013;50 (KIACGHKALRVDHIG) of the UPF0157 domain in the full length enzyme.</p><p>Other probable functions of the UPF0157 domain were investigated but each was ruled out (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007645.s001">Supporting Information File S1</xref>).

All attempts to assign such an activity to UPF0157 by a methyltransferase assay, using SAM as the donor, were unsuccessful. Also, lack of heat exchange when the full length CoaE was titrated against SAM under a variety of conditions ruled out such a role. We further explored the possibility of the CTD channeling the 4&#x02032;-phosphopantetheine (4&#x02032;-PP) moiety from CoA as soon as it is synthesized by the mycobacterial CoaE, but the cloned UPF0157 domain did not show any phosphopantetheinyl transferase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007645.s001">Supporting Information File S1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>CoaE catalyses phosphoryl transfer in the last step of CoA biosynthesis and has been shown as an essential enzyme. The differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic CoaE proteins, prompted us to characterize the kinetic mechanism of CoaE from the human pathogen <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Its indispensable role renders it an attractive target for the development of anti-mycobacterial agents. The mechanism of the forward reaction was explored and elucidated using steady-state kinetics by coupled enzyme-spectrophotometric assays and ITC. The Km values of 34.9 &#x000b5;M for DCoA and 56.8 &#x000b5;M for ATP are the lowest, compared to those reported for this class of enzymes from bacteria. The CoaE domain of the human bifunctional CoA synthase shows a very low Km of 5.2 &#x000b5;M for DCoA and this high affinity of the human bifunctional enzyme for DCoA may be attributed to the merger of the CoaD and CoaE activities, which possibly helps channel the DCoA product of CoaD faster to the CoaE active site, therefore resulting in a catalytically more efficient bifunctional enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007645-Begley1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>This study reports, for the first time, that CoaE has a sequential ordered mechanism of substrate binding with DCoA being the leading substrate and ATP following in tow as ATP binding to the enzyme is not as efficient as that when the enzyme is <italic>a priori</italic> saturated with DCoA while DCoA binding is unaffected by the presence or absence of ATP. A more positive change in entropy (15.9 cal M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> K<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) is seen for DCoA binding than that seen with ATP (6.85 cal M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> K<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). This indicates that DCoA binding facilitates ATP binding by inducing conformational changes in the enzyme and preparing the ATP-binding pocket for a snug fit.</p><p>Of all the phosphate donors evaluated for the mycobacterial enzyme, dATP binds reasonably well to CoaE with a binding constant of 1.74&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, though it is poor in phosphoryl transfer. In contrast, GTP and dGTP fail to bind to CoaE. ADP being structurally quite similar to ATP is capable of fitting in the ATP-binding pocket but is catalytically inactive, proving the substrate specificity of CoaE for ATP. A reduction in the catalytic efficiency with ADP can also possibly be because the nucleophiles on DCoA, which attack the ATP &#x003b3;-phosphate, are in closer proximity to ATP than ADP and thus the phosphoryl transfer is more efficient in the presence of ATP, besides the intrinsic lability of the high energy &#x003b2;&#x02212;&#x003b3; phosphoryl bond.</p><p>ADP's strong binding to CoaE prompted us to study the reverse reaction, i.e. the conversion of CoA and ADP to DCoA and ATP, which we observed was extremely slow and in all probability, negligible in the cell. This was lent further credence by the fact that CoA binds extremely poorly to CoaE. Also, considering the fact that CoaE synthesizes a critical cell metabolite, it is safe to conclude that a majority of the reaction goes on in the forward direction to constantly replenish the ever-depleting CoA pool in the cell. CoA is known to feedback regulate its biosynthesis by acting on the first committed step of the pathway, catalyzed by pantothenate kinase and inhibiting the reaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007645-Rock1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. The non-binding of CoA to CoaE also shows that CoA is incapable of directly feedback regulating its own production at the last step of the biosynthetic pathway.</p><p>Being structurally distant to ATP due to the pyrimidine ring, CTP's stronger binding to CoaE relative to GTP, which possesses a purine ring as ATP, came as a surprise. This raised an interesting question about the possible role of CTP in regulation of CoaE. Such a role is not uncommon in the biological context as several enzymes are regulated by NTPs other than their respective natural substrates. Therefore, we decided to further explore the relevance of its strong interaction with the mycobacterial enzyme. While CTP did not participate in phosphoryl transfer, preincubating the enzyme with CTP inhibited the enzyme. Conversely, CTP bound the enzyme poorly when the latter was preincubated with DCoA alone before the addition of CTP. Docking CTP on CoaE reveals that the there is an overlap in the binding pocket utilized by CTP and DCoA which renders an explanation for the inhibition shown by CTP. A regulatory mechanism is seen emerging from these studies whereby CTP limits the catalytic efficiency of CoaE when it binds the enzyme before the enzyme interacts with its leading substrate.</p><p>Regulation of enzyme activity by CTP is slightly unlikely in an everyday-context considering the fact that ATP is the major phosphoryl donor in the cell and is vastly abundant relative to CTP in the cellular context. The cell has possibly devised this unique mode of regulation of this critical biosynthetic enzyme to prepare itself for circumstances when ATP levels drop precipitously. Therefore, in the physiological context, this regulation might have consequence in the face of adversity, when the cell needs to minimize metabolite flow through a majority of its pathways and maintain a basal level of metabolism. Also, it has been well documented that in facultative anaerobes, like mycobacteria, the cellular CoA pools vary greatly in response to various stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007645-Jackowski1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007645-Chohnan1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, under circumstances where the cellular ATP/CTP ratio becomes low, CTP is recruited which helps in fine-tuning the levels of the cellular CoA pool by modulating its activity, to limit the biosynthesis of CoA<monospace>. </monospace>Thus CTP might help in regulating CoA biosynthesis under stress conditions therefore helping the organism tide over harsh conditions. In view of the evidence presented here, the currently held view of the regulation of the CoA pathway only at its first step needs to be reconsidered with a greater role allocated to CoaE than previously assigned. Considering the ever-changing environment this robust organism faces in the host, with a regular onslaught of drugs and the need to constantly fine tune its metabolism according to the surrounding conditions, regulation effected by CTP may be an effective system to bring about rapid changes in the cellular CoA levels.</p><p>We further validated our results by modeling the mycobacterial CoaE and studying its interactions with its substrates, DCoA and ATP; its product, CoA and the intrinsic metabolic regulator, CTP. Docking studies show a snug fit for DCoA in the acceptor substrate binding site, well poised for a nucleophilic attack on the ATP &#x003b3;-phosphate, its interaction being stabilized by a total of 89 contacts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007645-t002">Table 2</xref>). Docking also revealed residues interacting with the leading substrate in the pathogen's enzyme which are different from the ones in the human enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007645-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). These can therefore be exploited for developing inhibitors against the enzyme. Our docking analyses also explain the inability of CTP to serve as a phosphoryl donor to DCoA as it shows specific and stoichiometric binding at a site distinct from that of ATP (the P-loop). These results also unequivocally explain the kinetic inhibition shown by CTP by virtue of its binding at the same site as DCoA and therefore obscuring the acceptor substrate binding site.</p><p>The mycobacterial enzyme has two domains as revealed by BLAST analysis, a 196-residue NTD homologous to known dephosphocoenzyme A kinases and a 211-residue CTD belonging to a family of proteins of unknown function (UPF0157). When attempts to purify the NTD alone were not fruitful, it appeared imperative to rethink the strategy being employed. Considering the fact that the mycobacterial genome has undergone a considerable amount of downsizing with a concomitant loss of redundant genes, there has to be a rationale for the organism carrying the supposed &#x02018;burden&#x02019; of a domain of no function, the CTD of the mycobacterial CoaE. We probed a possible role of the UPF0157 domain in assisting the NTD in folding as a separately cloned NTD alone was incapable of independent, soluble expression. Such a function is not uncommon in the biological context and has been observed in several multidomain proteins, an example being the human CoaDE bifunctional enzyme complex which possesses a third domain apart from the two enzymatic domains. This 200-residue N-terminal domain in the human enzyme complex is absolutely required for the proper expression and folding of the protein when overexpressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Thus, the CTD of the mycobacterial CoaE might also act in a similar fashion and thereby assist the NTD in attaining its biologically functional conformation. If the CTD performs such a function, replacing it with a protein of similar function should aid NTD solubilization to some extent. Indeed, consistent with this hypothesis, expression of the NTD in fusion with glutathione-S-transferase at its C-terminus led to the expression of a soluble NTD that showed 95&#x00025; activity of the full length protein while an N-terminal GST fusion did not yield soluble protein. Co-transformation of GST and the NTD on separate plasmids also did not facilitate NTD folding, ruling out a possible chaperonic effect in trans. Further investigations using a series of deletion mutants revealed that the stretch of amino acids from 35&#x02013;50 of the UPF0157 domain are indispensable for the proper soluble expression and appropriate folding of a completely soluble and active NTD. The CTD, therefore, might not act as a universal chaperone in the cell but it specifically helps the mycobacterial CoaE NTD domain attain a properly folded structure. Thus, of all putative roles that we have examined for the UPF0157 domain at the C-terminus of mycobacterial CoaE, the only physiologically significant role to emerge is its ability to facilitate the expression of the NTD in a folded/catalytically competent form. Such a role could also be possible in cases where this domain is found either upstream or downstream of an acetyltransferase.</p><p>In summary, our results establish a new paradigm for dephosphocoenzyme A kinases providing a framework for understanding how this class of enzymes interact with their substrates. From this work a regulatory model for the CoA pathway emerges which provides insights, into the probable mechanisms employed by the cell, to keep the metabolite flow at this until now-underexplored, though critical step in the CoA biosynthesis under check. These studies show that the end product of CoA biosynthesis, CoA, cannot feedback regulate its own production at the last step of the pathway, but the cell utilizes other subtle means to regulate metabolite flow, using an intrinsic metabolic inhibitor, CTP, which by virtue of its binding at a site, distinct from that of ATP, is unable to act as a phosphate donor but can easily inhibit the enzyme due to its binding at a site overlapping that of the acceptor substrate, DCoA as illustrated by homology modeling and docking studies. Therefore, under conditions of metabolite paucity and stress, the cell calls upon CTP to monitor the flow at the CoaE step. In view of the evidence presented in this work, the widely understood mechanism of regulation of Coenzyme A biosynthesis; which considers feedback regulation by CoA at the pantothenate kinase step of the pathway to be the sole means of metabolite flow regulation of this critical biosynthetic pathway, needs to be revised and a broader role for the last enzyme in the pathway, CoaE, needs to be considered. We have also for the first time, experimentally established a role for the UPF0157 domain from the Pfam database in acting as a very specific chaperone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007645.s001"><label>Supporting Information File S1</label><caption><p>(0.04 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0007645.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007645.s002"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Universal Chaperone Assays for the CTD.
