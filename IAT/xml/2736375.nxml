Increase in temperature increased the activity but reduced its stability. Circular dichroism (CD), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) were deployed to determine the physical states of LipC in solution. As the salt concentration increased, DLS revealed substantial increase in aggregate sizes, but CD measurements revealed the maximal retention of the &#x003b1;-helical structure at the salt concentration matching the optimal activity. These observations were supported by SANS analysis that revealed the highest proportion of unimers and dimers around the optimal salt concentration, although the coexistent larger aggregates showed a trend of increasing size with salt concentration, consistent with the DLS data.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The solution &#x003b1;-helical structure and activity relation also matched the highest proportion of enzyme unimers and dimers.

Halobacteria living in high saline ecosystems can have optimal salt concentrations for growth that amount to some ten times above the sea water. Their enzymes have developed particular features including adequate stability and solubility in high salt concentrations by acquiring a relatively large number of charged amino acid residues on their surfaces to prevent precipitation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006980-Kim1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006980-Madern1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this work, we present the cloning, heterologous expression of the lipolytic gene lipC from halophilic Archaeon <italic>Haloarcula marismortui</italic> (ATCC 43049) using mesophilic host <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 (DE3). The heterologous enzyme was purified and their enzymatic properties were studied. In order to illustrate relationship between the physical state of the enzyme in solution and its activity, the catalytic behaviour of the enzyme and its different structural properties under different solution environments were studied by combining bioactivity assays with dynamic light scattering (DLS) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS). Our studies have revealed that the halophilic enzyme displayed hydrolytic activity over an alkaline pH range. At pH 9.5, its optimal activities occurred at the temperature of 45&#x000b0;C and a high NaCl concentration of 3.4 M. Shift of NaCl concentration away from the optimal value led to the decline of enzymatic activity, but readjustment of salt concentration back to the optimal condition could restore the optimal activity. Structural studies from SANS revealed that under the optimal activity conditions the enzyme existed mostly in the form of free molecules. Decrease in salt concentration improved the solubilisation of the enzyme whilst increase in salt concentration above the optimal concentration intensified aggregation. Interestingly, however, the internal secondary structures as revealed by circular dichroism (CD) measurements became maximal around the optimal solution sat concentration range. As the salt concentration was shifted away from the optimal conditions substantial loss of secondary structures occurred, consistent with the trend of activity. These results thus demonstrated a clear correlation between enzymatic activity and the secondary structure change, but the molecular mechanism of salt effect on the solubilization and aggregation of the enzyme requires further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>1. Analysis of nucleotide and amino acid sequence of halophilic esterase LipC</title><p>We undertook the blast analysis of our enzyme LipC in the hydrolysis database ESTHER (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensam.inra.fr/cgi-bin/ace/index">http://www.ensam.inra.fr/cgi-bin/ace/index</ext-link>) and the results showed that the LipC sequence belonged to the H block of the lipase/esterase family corresponding to the family IV of bacterial lipolytic enzymes according to Arpigny and Jaeger classification (1999) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006980-Arpigny1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and that the catalytic triad of LipC was Ser128, Asp224 and His254. The sequence of this enzyme only had some 35&#x00025; matching to those of the existing ones searched from GenBank, consistent with the outcome of M&#x000fc;ller-Santos et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006980-MllerSantos1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, the enzyme contained 17&#x00025; acidic amino acids and had an isoelectric point of 4.2, showing that it was an unusual enzyme, as far as the primary sequences were concerned. Also, neither transmembrane domains nor signal peptides were identified, indicating that it was a cytosolic enzyme. The distribution of high negative surface charge groups may favor solvation, in a manner similar to the glucose dehydragenase from <italic>Haloferax mediterranei</italic>. The solvent exposed glutamate and aspartate residues are strongly hydrated and as a result, the degree of surface solvation of this glucose dehydrogenase is among the highest in proteins with known 3D structures. The association of these hydrated amino acid residues with cations would substantially contribute to the stability and solubility of LipC or alike halophilic enzymes in high salt or solvent deprived environments.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>2.

DLS measurements</title><p>The physical state of LipC in aqueous solution under different conditions was subsequently investigated by DLS with representative data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006980-g008">Figure 8</xref>. In DLS experiments, particles in solution are illuminated with light of a given wavelength (&#x003bb;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;632.8 nm used in this work) and the intensity fluctuations from the scattered light are measured over a time course typically between 1 ns and 1 ms. The intensity fluctuations occur due to the random diffusion of particles through the solvent, known as Brownian motion. The change in signal intensity over the time course of an experiment arising from these fluctuations can be principally described through the autocorrelation function. The significance of the autocorrelation function is that particles with a larger hydrodynamic radius will diffuse with a lower velocity through the bulk solvent. As a result, the autocorrelation function, describing the similarity between the two signals, will be greater for particles with a larger hydrodynamic radius, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the signal from a larger particle will not have altered as much over time as that from a smaller particle. If the particles studied are small compared to the employed wavelength, the translational diffusion coefficient, <italic>D<sub>o</sub></italic>, can be determined through the Laplace inversion of the autocorrelation function.

Globular proteins such as lysozyme (MW&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;14 kD), hCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin, MW&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;38 kD) and BSA (MW&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;67 kD) are ellipsoidal or cylindrical in shape and have a length of <italic>ca</italic> 4.5 nm, 7 nm and 14 nm, respectively. Given that LipC had similar MW as hCG, the main size distribution centered around 10 nm could be a measure of the hydrodynamic diameters of the molecules under the solution environment. Assuming that the main peak dimension reflected the length of LipC, the result would indicate that the majority of LipC molecules could exist as individually dispersed molecules, with a small proportion of them present in the form of small aggregates. The effect of temperature on the state of aggregation was studied by raising the pH 8 enzyme solution (without any NaCl added) from 22&#x000b0;C to 45&#x000b0;C, with the size distribution similarly measured by DLS. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006980-g008">Figure 8</xref>, the overall distribution closely resembled that at the ambient temperature, but the peak has shifted to a greater value of ca 15 nm, indicating some modest increase of the size of the average scattering objects. In addition, the shoulder peak has disappeared, but the distribution is broader and is skewed towards the large size side, showing the possible coexistence of relatively large aggregates with unimers and dimers. These DLS data have thus revealed that whilst LipC molecules were predominantly dissolved under these conditions some extent of aggregation occurred and that the solutions were inhomogeneous.</p><p>The effect of salt addition on enzyme solubilization and aggregation was examined by undertaking the above DLS measurements in the presence of 3.4 M NaCl. The main observation from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006980-g008">Figure 8</xref> is that salt addition has substantially increased the sizes of the scattering objects, evident from the shift of peaks to much greater values. At both temperatures, the main peaks are centered around 1000 nm (consistent with the occurrence of some turbidity), indicating the formation of large aggregates in these systems. Furthermore, the size distribution measured at the ambient temperature is characterized by 3 peaks. The convergence to the single, middle, peak at the high temperature suggests that temperature increase in the presence of 3.4 M NaCl has made the aggregates more uniform.</p><p>The time dependent change of solution aggregation has also been assessed and the results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006980-g008">Figure 8</xref> as well. After 2 days of equilibration, the two smaller size distributions were shifted to slightly bigger sizes, but the two large size distributions in the presence of 3.4 M NaCl were shifted to smaller size ranges. The largest drop in size was observed from enzyme dissolved in 3.4 M NaCl at 45&#x000b0;C, with the peak aggregate diameter decreased from some 1000 nm to about 200 nm only. A further observation was that all four distributions become more uniform and symmetrical. But the main outcome from the DLS studies was the formation of large enzyme aggregates upon addition of 3.4 M NaCl where the enzyme was rather active.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>9.

Information about the structure of scattering objects is usually obtained by comparing a scattering profile calculated from a presumed geometrical shape with the obtained data, and the process is iterated until an acceptable fit is produced. To enhance structural sensitivity and resolution, SANS measurements of protein structure are often done in D<sub>2</sub>O instead of H<sub>2</sub>O so that the interfacial boundary is highlighted. Although SANS is capable of detecting size and shape of scattering objects over a large size range, it is more sensitive to the small changes over range of a few nanometers compared to DLS.</p><p>In our previous studies, SANS was used to determine the solution structures of dimeric globular proteins of glucose oxidase and lactoferrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006980-Lu1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. It was found that both molecules could be modeled into cylindrical shapes whose sizes matched their respective crystalline structures well. In this work, we have investigated the effects of pH, salt and temperature by undertaking selective SANS experiments with the fitted parameters listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006980-t002">Table 2</xref>. The scattering profiles appeared to be similar in shape, indicating that the main features of solution characteristics were similar. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006980-g009">Figure 9</xref> compares the two representative profiles measured from the system at pH 8, 22&#x000b0;C without any added NaCl and from the same system with the addition of 3.4 M NaCl and at 45&#x000b0;C. Quantitative analysis was carried out by first assuming spherical shape for the hydrated enzyme. It was found that such a model could not produce any adequate fit over the size range appropriate for LipC. Subsequent attempts with cylindrical model improved the fits, but it was necessary to adopt at least two size distributions to account for polydispersity in each of the samples measured, consistent with the DLS analysis. In the absence of NaCl added, the model is sensitive to the diameters of the small cylinders, with an optimally fitted value of 6&#x000b1;0.5 nm. On the other hand, the fitting showed much less sensitivity to the length. Any values around 15 nm or greater could produce acceptable fits. As this length is clearly greater than the full length expected from the single enzyme molecule, the model implied the formation of small cylindrical aggregates, equivalent to the end-by-end templating between 2 or more enzymes. Larger cylindrical aggregates with a diameter of 20 nm and a length of 40 nm were also required for fitting the scattering curve, showing that under this solution condition, some of the enzyme molecules also formed aggregates through side-by-side and end-to-end templating. The scale factors produced from the fitting (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006980-t002">Table 2</xref>) provided a useful indication of the population of both types of aggregates, with the small aggregates being dominant, consistent with DLS finding. Addition of 1.7 M NaCl did not alter the main feature of the picture, that is, the two types of scattering objects were still required to fit the measured scattering profile. The diameter of the cylinder remained 6&#x000b1;0.5 nm and the length of the small cylindrical aggregates found to be 20&#x000b1;5 nm. The scale factors again revealed that the proportion of the large aggregates was again low. When &#x0005b;NaCl&#x0005d; was increased to 3.4 M, the cylindrical diameter was still about 6 nm and other parameters remained largely the same. The scale factors also showed little change in the proportion of small to large aggregates. When the same measurement was made at 45&#x000b0;C, the small scattering objects had both diameter and length at 6 nm, consistent with the dimensions expected of unimers. However, the large aggregates became bigger. These SANS results thus showed that over the entire salt concentration range studied aggregates always existed and that as the salt concentration increased the size of the large aggregates increased but its proportion remained low, as indicated by the relative ratio of the scale factors. This trend of the effect of salt addition on the size of large aggregates is broadly consistent with the outcome of DLS results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006980-g008">Figure 8</xref>. More importantly, SANS studies also revealed that the coexistence of small cylindrical aggregates equivalent to the formation of dimers and that these became unimers at the optimal conditions. It is likely that these less aggregated enzymes were active than those heavily aggregated because of structural unfolding incurred.</p><fig id="pone-0006980-g009" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006980.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>SANS scattering intensity profiles (I) plotted against wave vector (Q).</title><p>The two sets of the measured data were from 2 mg/ml LipC in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 (&#x00394;); in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 with 3.4 M NaCl at 45&#x000b0;C (&#x025ca;).

Note that at pH 4 and 8 and the ambient temperature, the enzyme had little activity.</p><p>Thus, the SANS data as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006980-t002">Table 2</xref> show that each solution studied could be approximated to a group of small aggregates of unimers and dimers coexistent with another group of large aggregates. Upon increase of NaCl concentration to around 3 M, the large aggregates became greater, indicating more extensive structural unfolding for some enzyme molecules, but the overall enzyme activity became substantially increased, showing that it was the unimers and dimers that might become active. Although DLS and SANS revealed the inhomogeneous nature of aggregation, it remains unclear why small aggregates (equivalent to dimers or trimers) formed at pH 4 and 8 had little activity. However, the CD spectra did reveal the large increase in the &#x003b1;-helical content with &#x0005b;NaCl&#x0005d; addition over the optimal activity range. Further CD work will be used to assess the combined temperature and salt effect on structure-function relation. It is intuitive to assume that the association of a large amount of hydrated amino acid residues in LipC with cations would substantially contribute to the stability and solubility of LipC, and the results presented in this work show that this is so as far as the average activity and secondary structure are concerned. But increase in &#x0005b;NaCl&#x0005d; also caused a substantial increase in enzyme aggregation. Hence, the overall picture was the formation of inhomogeneous solutions within which there were different responses to the increase of NaCl concentration.</p><p>In summary, we have cloned a halophilic esterase gene and expressed it in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The recombinant enzyme LipC was purified and characterized by combining both biochemical and biophysical measurements. MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprint spectral analysis of fragments of the halophilic esterase derived through trypsin digestion showed a complete matching to the sequence of the enzyme. The resultant enzyme showed an anomalous migration in SDS-PAGE, possibly due to its special amino acid composition. Preliminary characterization of enzymatic activity through the measurement of ester bond cleavage in <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl acylates indicated that its relative activity was dependent on salt concentration and temperature. The enzyme clearly showed preference to <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl esters with short acyl chains, consistent with the basic esterase character. Under the experimental conditions, the enzyme was found to show its optimal activity at pH 9.5, 45&#x000b0;C and &#x0005b;NaCl&#x0005d;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3.4 M, or other equivalent conditions. However, an important criterion for enzymatic biocatalysis is its stability against time. Whilst salt addition could offer high enzymatic stability against time, this effect was found to be highly temperature dependent. As the reaction temperature increased, the salt stabilizing effect decreased. As the temperature was above 50&#x000b0;C, salt addition turned out to accelerate the destabilization.</p><p>The solution structure analysis of LipC by combining CD, DLS and SANS measurements led to interesting observations. The CD spectra revealed that under the optimal activity conditions the enzyme solutions showed the highest content of &#x003b1;-helical structure. The scattering data revealed that the highest enzyme activities matched the highest proportions of free molecules in solution. Given that even under the optimal activity conditions revealed, there were still some fractions of enzyme that existed in the form of aggregates, indicating that further effort is required to improve the solubility and stability of the enzyme in aqueous solution, particularly with respect to understanding the responses of the high content of acidic amino acids to temperature and salt under alkali pH.</p><p>As halophilic enzymes are becoming increasingly attractive, LipC is clearly a good model for further study of the structure-function relation, the striking salt tolerant ability and its structural implication on activity at different structural levels.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Cells, biochemicals and chemicals</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) and plasmid pET28a were obtained from Novagen (USA).
