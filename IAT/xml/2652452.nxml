How epithelial cells maintain their polarity, adhesion and shape remains poorly understood. Polarity in epithelia is founded on the segregation of determinants into apical and baso-lateral membrane domains. Adherens junctions are located at the interface of these domains and connect the actin cytoskeleton to neighbouring cells. Actin filaments are visible around the entire plasma membrane, but a particularly prominent belt of actin filaments runs around the apical cortex, overlapping with the ring of adherens junctions. This apical contractile bundle of actin filaments is likely to be a critical element in organising the polarised form of epithelial cells (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). Molecules regulating the spatial organisation of the actin cytoskeleton and generation of forces upon it are therefore of particular interest.</p><p>Erzin-Radaxin-Moesin (ERM) proteins link actin filaments with the plasma membrane and are necessary to organise the cortical actin cytoskeleton (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). <italic>Drosphila </italic>has a single ERM family member, Moesin, that is essential for maintenance of epithelial cell polarity and shape. Cells lacking Moesin are unable to maintain their polarised form, disassemble adherens junctions and leave the epithelium, ultimately undergoing apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Myosin II can slide two actin filaments against each other to create tension (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This is the basis for muscle contraction in skeletal muscle, but also has important force-generating roles in non-muscle cells. <italic>Drosophila </italic>has a single non-muscle myosin II heavy chain encoded by <italic>zipper (zip) </italic>and a single non-muscle myosin II regulatory light chain (MRLC) encoded by <italic>Spagetti-Squash (Sqh)</italic>. Analysis of mutant alleles of these genes has revealed that non-muscle myosin II is required for maintenance of epithelial cell shape, as well as other processes involving dynamic cell shape changes such as gastrulation movements and cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Both Moesin and Myosin II are activated by phosphorylation and concentrated at the apical membranes of <italic>Drosophila </italic>epithelial cells. Several kinases that phosphorylate Moesin (Slik kinase; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]) and Sqh/MRLC (Rho kinase; see for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] have been identified). One of the four <italic>Drosophila </italic>PP1 phosphatases, PP1&#x003b2;9c, has been shown to antagonise Sqh/MRLC phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Here, we identify Sds22, a PP1 phosphatase regulatory subunit, that binds to all four <italic>Drosophila </italic>PP1 phosphatases and restricts the activity of both Sqh/MRLC and Moesin. We show that loss of Sds22 has a similar but stronger phenotype than loss of PP1&#x003b2;9c, disrupting both epithelial cell shape and polarity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>sds22 </italic>is required for epithelial morphology in imaginal disc epithelia</title><p>In a PiggyBac transposon-mutagenesis screen in the <italic>Drosophila </italic>eye imaginal disc, we recovered an insertion immediately upstream of the start codon of <italic>sds22 </italic>(PB1173) which disrupts epithelial morphology, causing lethality (Additional Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The lethality and mutant phenotypes of this allele were reverted when the PiggyBac transposon was excised. The PiggyBac transposon allows transcription (data not shown) but is expected to prevent translation of the <italic>sds22 </italic>mRNA. The <italic>sds22</italic><sup>PB1173 </sup>phenotype was also rescued by expression of a <italic>UAS.sds22-GFP </italic>transgene (Additional Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Finally, expression of a UAS.sds22-IR transgenic RNAi line (VDRC 11788) produced phenotypes highly similar to that of <italic>sds22</italic><sup>PB1173 </sup>(data not shown). Although we have not specifically established that sds22 expression was reduced or absent in the insertion mutant, we presume that this is the case as the mutant is rescued by an <italic>sds22 </italic>transgene and phenocopied by Sds22-RNAi. Together, these results show that the observed phenotypes are caused by disruption of the <italic>sds22 </italic>gene.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>sds22 </italic>is required to maintain epithelial morphology in imaginal discs</bold>.

Mutant cells change shape, shortening along their apical-basal axis and assuming a more cuboidal morphology.

Note that mutant cells retain correct localisation of the apical adherens junction marker Armadillo.

In addition, several cells have been extruded from the epithelium and are undergoing apoptosis, visible as pyknotic nuclei near the apical or basal surface of the epithelium (arrow). Deep infolding of the mutant tissue causes islands of wild-type tissue to be cut off from surrounding cells. (C) When apoptosis is blocked in <italic>sds22 </italic>mutant cells by expression of the caspase inhibitor p35, mutant clones (marked by expression of RFP) are still extruded from the epithelium.

The wing disc is composed of a columnar epithelium, a pseudostratified monolayer, that is continuous with an overlying peripodial epithelium, a squamous monolayer (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). We induced GFP negative clones of wild-type (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and <italic>sds22 </italic>mutant (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) cells and allowed the clones to grow for two (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) or three days (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The <italic>sds22 </italic>mutant clones survived and grew similarly to wild-type clones for the first two days (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) but were eliminated by three days (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). This phenotype suggests that the <italic>sds22 </italic>mutant cells are sensitive to cell competition, a phenomenon whereby weaker cells are killed off by their more strongly growing neighbours (see, for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]).</p><p>We therefore gave <italic>sds22 </italic>mutant clones a growth advantage over their neighbours with the <italic>Minute </italic>technique. This technique slows the growth of cells neighbouring the clone by making these cells heterozygous mutant for a <italic>Minute </italic>gene, encoding a ribosomal subunit. With this method, wild-type clones grow to very large sizes (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) after 2 days. In contrast, <italic>sds22 </italic>mutant cells formed smaller clones over the same time period and exhibited defects in epithelial morphology (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). After 3 days, the <italic>sds22 </italic>mutant cells were still largely eliminated from the tissue, being extruded basally from the epithelium and undergoing apoptosis (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). Extrusion of the <italic>sds22 </italic>mutant cells left behind dramatic folds in the epithelium (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>), more easily appreciated when the filamentous actin cytoskeleton was visualised by staining with phalloidin (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G, H &#x00026; I</xref>).</p><p>To examine the cellular basis for these phenotypes, we examined confocal cross-sections of discs carrying <italic>sds22 </italic>mutant clones (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). By examining both smaller, younger clones (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>; marked by absence of GFP) and larger, older clones (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>; marked by absence of GFP) we observed a progressively stronger phenotype. In smaller clones, the mutant cells appear abnormally short in their apical-basal axis, adopting a more cuboidal morphology than their pseudostratified columnar neighbours (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Although the mutant cells in these small clones are abnormally short, they retained their polarised epithelial character, with normal localisation of the adherens junction component, Armadillo (Arm; Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In larger clones, abnormally short mutant cells were also visible, but, more dramatically, infolding and extrusion of the mutant cells created islands of wild-type epithelium, surrounded by mutant cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>; also visible in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>, arrow). A large number of pyknotic nuclei, indicating apoptotic cells, were visible in the <italic>sds22 </italic>mutant clones (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), some of which appeared to have left the epithelium entirely (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, arrow). These results suggest that <italic>sds22 </italic>mutant cells first change shape, adopting a more cuboidal morphology, and later leave the epithelium and apoptose, leaving behind a deep infolding of the tissue.</p><p>We next tested whether extrusion of <italic>sds22 </italic>mutant cells from the epithelium was a cause or consequence of their apoptosis. We therefore prevented apoptosis of <italic>sds22 </italic>mutant cells by expression of the baculovirus caspase inhibitor, p35. We found that mutant cells were still extruded from the epithelium, collecting as a ball of round cells on the basal side of the disc (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>; positively marked by expression of RFP). These results show that <italic>sds22 </italic>is essential to maintain the epithelial integrity of wing imaginal disc cells and suggest that extrusion of mutant cells is the cause of apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>sds22 </italic>is required for epithelial morphology in ovarian follicle cells</title><p>To test whether the <italic>sds22 </italic>is specifically required in imaginal discs or more generally required in epithelia, we examined the follicular epithelium of <italic>Drosophila </italic>egg chambers (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). As in the wing, <italic>sds22 </italic>mutant clones showed a spectrum of defects in epithelial morphology, depending on clone size. In smaller clones, cells appear abnormally contracted along their apical-basal axis (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). In many larger clones, cells rounded up and tended to form double layers (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B&#x00026;C</xref>). When markers of apical-basal polarity were analysed in <italic>sds22 </italic>mutant clones (not shown) or in clones expressing RNAi against <italic>sds22 </italic>(<italic>UAS.sds22-IR</italic>; Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D, E&#x00026;F</xref>, clones marked by GFP expression), abnormal spreading of baso-lateral markers (anti-Dlg or anti-&#x003b1;-Spectrin 3A9 staining) around the cell into apical regions was detected. In some clones, the apical marker aPKC appeared relatively normal (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>), while in others aPKC staining appeared reduced and more diffuse (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D&#x00026;F</xref>). These results indicate that follicle cell epithelia deficient for <italic>sds22 </italic>show both cell shape and polarity defects.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold><italic>sds22 </italic>is required to maintain epithelial cell shape and polarity in follicle cells</bold>.

Levels of both phospho-Sqh (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) and phospho-Moe (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>) were elevated relative to total Sqh (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>) and Moe (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>) in <italic>sds22 </italic>mutant cells. Note that the excess phospho-Sqh and phospho-Moe staining accumulates on both apical and baso-lateral membranes in mutant cells (in contrast to their apical concentration in wild-type cells). Thus, <italic>sds22 </italic>is required to restrict the phosphorylation of both Moe and Sqh/MRLC.</p></sec><sec><title>Conserved function of Sds22 in human cells</title><p>Sds22 is widely conserved in the animal kingdom, including a mammalian homologue PPP1R7. We therefore investigated if PPP1R7 performed similar functions in mammalian cells to Sds22 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. A431 cells are keratinocytes that retain adherens junctions and grow in 'quasi-epithelial' clusters despite being transformed. First, we investigated the morphology of A431 cells lacking PPP1R7. Control A431 cells formed colonies with an average of 10 cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D&#x00026;E</xref>) whereas cells depleted for PPP1R7 formed smaller clusters usually consisting of 4&#x02013;6 cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D&#x00026;E</xref>). Thus, PPP1R7 helps to maintain the cohesion of groups of human cells of epithelial origin.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>The function of Sds22 is conserved in human cells</bold>.

Depletion of PPP1R7 with siRNA oligos caused a dramatic increase in the phosphorylation of both ERM proteins and MLC (on Ser19; Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A, B &#x00026; E</xref>). This striking result indicates that the biochemical function of Sds22/PPP1R7 is conserved between Drosophila and mammals. To verify the RNAi effect, we measured depletion of PPP1R7 mRNA levels in A431 cells by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). The mild variations observed between the extent of knockdown and phenotypic strength with different siRNA oligos are likely to result from experimental differences between the staining and PCR.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results show that Sds22, a protein previously identified as a PP1 phosphatase regulatory subunit in yeast, is essential for PP1 function in <italic>Drosophila </italic>tissues. We have also shown that the phosphorylation state of both Moesin and Sqh/MRLC depends upon the Sds22/PP1 phosphatase. Our experiments do not prove that Moesin and Sqh/MRLC are direct substrates of Sds22/PP1, but this is a distinct possibility, as previous work has shown that Sqh/MRLC can be found in a complex with PP1. We have shown that this function of Sds22 is conserved in mammalian cells, consistent with previous biochemical evidence that PPP1R7 (the mammalian Sds22 homologue) binds to PP1 proteins.</p><p>Moesin and Sqh/MRLC are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. Our work favours a model in which restricted activation of Moesin and Sqh/MRLC maintains an apical contractile bundle of actin filaments that is essential for the shape and integrity of epithelial cells. Both Moesin and Sqh/MRLC are activated by phosphorylation at the apical membranes of epithelia. In the case of Moesin, this phosphorylation is essential for epithelial integrity and depends on the apically localised kinase Slik [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In the case of Sqh/MRLC, this phosphorylation is essential for cells to maintain their columnar shape and depends on Rho kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Our work indicates that this restricted activation of these proteins at the apical membrane is complemented by dephosphorylation of Moesin in other parts of the cell by ubiquitous PP1 phosphatases containing the regulatory subunit Sds22. In <italic>sds22 </italic>mutants, these actin regulators are activated along the entire cell membrane at high levels, leading to an abnormal contraction of the cells along their apical-basal axis. A similar, but milder, phenotype is visible in <italic>PP1&#x003b2;9c </italic>mutant clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and in clones overexpressing a phospho-mimetic form of Sqh/MRLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>A second phenotype observed upon depletion of Sds22 is a loss of apical-basal polarity, associated with cells rounding up and forming multi-layers. Baso-lateral polarity markers appeared to be more strongly affected than apical markers in follicle cell epithelia. In imaginal discs, loss of polarity in <italic>sds22 </italic>mutant clones would explain the extrusion and apoptosis of these cells. Importantly, both the loss of polarity in follicle cells and the extrusion of imaginal disc cells were most commonly visible in larger, older clones, indicating that this phenotype takes longer to manifest than the abnormal cell shape phenotype. This raises the possibility that Sds22 may not be a direct regulator of cell polarity, but rather is required for polarity as a consequence of its regulation of Sqh/MRLC and Moesin. Alternatively, there may be additional targets of Sds22 that regulate the localisation of polarity markers.</p><sec><title>Evolution of Sds22 and PP1 functions</title><p><italic>sds22 </italic>was first identified in the single-celled yeast, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe </italic>where it encodes a nuclear protein that directly binds to and regulates a PP1 phosphatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, Sds22 is essential for this phosphatase to control events during mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In metazoans, the PP1 family has expanded and Sds22 has aquired additional functions in cell shape and polarity. Accordingly, in both <italic>Drosophila </italic>and mammals, Sds22 is not exclusively localised to the nucleus and is instead found throughout the cell (Additional Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]).</p></sec><sec><title>Discrepancies between <italic>sds22 </italic>and <italic>PP1 </italic>mutant phenotypes in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p><italic>Drosophila </italic>have four PP1 phosphatases, named after their isotype and cytological location:<italic>PP1&#x003b1;13c</italic>,<italic>PP1&#x003b1;87c</italic>, <italic>PP1&#x003b1;96a </italic>and <italic>PP1&#x003b2;9c</italic>. The potential for redundancy among these four genes complicates genetic analysis. Nevertheless, mutation of individual <italic>PP1 </italic>genes indicates that some may have unique functions. Mutant alleles of PP1&#x003b1;87c, which contributes 80% of the total PP1 phosphatase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], show strong defects in mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Of the other three <italic>Drosophila </italic>PP1s, only one is essential, PP1&#x003b2;9c. Interestingly, the morphological phenotype of <italic>PP1&#x003b2;9c-</italic>mutant cells resembles that of <italic>sds22 </italic>mutant cells in both follicle cells and nurse cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In <italic>PP1&#x003b2;9c </italic>mutant clones of the follicular epithelium, cells are shortened in their apical-basal axis and cytosolic levels of G-actin and phospho-Sqh are increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, <italic>PP1&#x003b2;9c </italic>mutant cells were not reported to show defects in cell polarity.</p><p>Why do <italic>sds22 </italic>mutants not exhibit the mitotic defects found <italic>PP1&#x003b1;87c </italic>mutants? A likely explanation is that our <italic>sds22 </italic>mutant allele is not a null. In fact, depletion of <italic>sds22 </italic>by RNAi in <italic>Drosophila </italic>cells was recently reported to cause mitotic defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]; [D. Glover, personal communication]. Thus, our <italic>sds22 </italic>allele may be a hypomorph that reveals the function of Sds22 in regulating cell shape and polarity.</p><p>Why do <italic>PP1&#x003b2;9c </italic>mutants not exhibit the polarity defects found in <italic>sds22 </italic>mutants? A plausible explanation is that the presence of the three other PP1s masks this phenotype. <italic>PP1&#x003b1;87c </italic>mutants, which remove 80% of PP1 activity, might therefore be expected to show a polarity defect. However, the mitotic defects in these mutants prevent growth of clones, obscuring any potential polarity defect. Thus, <italic>sds22 </italic>mutations are a convenient way of modulating PP1 activity that can reveal otherwise hidden phenotypes.</p><p>Finally, other proteins have been identified which link PP1 phosphatases to target proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. These include MYPT-75D, which appears to recruit Sqh to PP1 and its loss has a weaker phenotype than loss of Sds22 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Another MYPT is MBS, whose loss of function phenotype even more strongly resembles that of Sds22 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. While these two related MYPTs may be partially redundant with one another, it is unlikely that they are also redundant with Sds22. Redundancy between Sds22 and MYPTs would likely result in Sds22 being non-essential. Further experiments will be necessary to establish whether the Sds22/PP1 complex and MYPT/PP1 complexes act independently or together in cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have confirmed work in other organisms by showing that Sds22 acts as an essential subunit of PP1 phosphatases in both <italic>Drosophila </italic>and mammals and controls cell shape and polarity in epithelial cells. There is an interesting parallel between the <italic>sds22 </italic>mutant phenotype in <italic>Drosophila </italic>and the escape of metastasising tumour cells from epithelia to invade local tissues. Interestingly, PPP1R7 has been reported to be significantly downregulated in human squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) and other cancers, such as melanoma and prostate cancer <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oncomine.org/"/>. Thus, downregulation of Sds22/PPP1R7 may contribute to tumour progression in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Generation of mutant <italic>sds22 </italic>alleles</title><p>The PiggyBac transposon based mutagenesis screen has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].
