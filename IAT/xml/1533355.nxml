Multiple classes of genes are transcriptionally activated by oxidants and are implicated in different phenotypic responses. In the present study, we performed differential mRNA display to elucidate genes that are induced or repressed after exposure of rat lung epithelial (RLE) cells to H2O2 or crocidolite asbestos, a pathogenic mineral that generates oxidants. After 8 or 24 hr of exposure, RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed, and amplified by polymerase chain reaction with degenerate primers to visualize alterations in gene expression. The seven clones obtained were sequenced and encoded the mitochondrial genes, NADH dehydrogenase subunits ND5 and ND6, and 16S ribosomal RNA. Evaluation of their expression by Northern blot analysis revealed increased expression of 16S rRNA after 1 or 2 hr of exposure to H2O2. At later time periods (4 and 24 hr), mRNA levels of 16S rRNA and NADH dehydrogenase were decreased in H2O2-treated RLE cells when compared to sham controls. Crocidolite asbestos caused increases in 16S rRNA levels after 8 hr of exposure, whereas after 24 hr of exposure to asbestos, 16S rRNA levels were decreased in comparison to sham controls. In addition to these oxidants, the nitric oxide generator spermine NONOate caused similar decreases in NADH dehydrogenase mRNA levels after 4 hr of exposure. The present data and previous studies demonstrated that all oxidants examined resulted in apoptosis in RLE cells during the time frame where alterations of mitochondrial gene expression were observed. As the mitochondrion is a major organelle that controls apoptosis, alterations in expression of mitochondrial genes may be involved in the regulation of apoptosis.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00540-0081-a" xlink:role="1192"/></fig><fig id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00540-0082-a" xlink:role="1193"/></fig><fig id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00540-0082-b" xlink:role="1193"/></fig><fig id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00540-0082-c" xlink:role="1193"/></fig><fig id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00540-0083-a" xlink:role="1194"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="envhper00540-0080.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1191" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00540-0081.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1192" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00540-0082.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1193" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00540-0083.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1194" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00540-0084.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1195" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
