Neovascularization can lead to fibrosis and disruption of delicate tissues required for vision. Laser photocoagulation as conventional treatment is effective in halting the progression of angiogenesis in the short-term. However, it is also destructive to the retinal tissue, leads to immediate and sometimes significant loss of vision, and does not address the underlying angiogenic mechanisms of the disease. Therefore, therapy targeting molecular mechanisms underlying retinal neovascularization may provide better treatment result and fewer detrimental side effect.</p><p>Angiogenesis is a complex process, involving multiple gene products expressed by different cell types, all contributing to an integrated sequence of events. However, laboratory studies have demonstrated that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a central role in several retinal vascular diseases. Clinical trials have confirmed the importance of VEGF in disease pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. Consequently, VEGF becomes an optimal target for inhibition of retinal neovascularization. Accumulated data indicate that attenuation of VEGF activity could effectively suppress retinal neovascularization. Recent treatments based on antibody technology have been proven to be efficacious. Lucentis, a anti-VEGF antibody fragment, has been approved as an antiangiogenic drug for the treatment of ocular neovascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. Although antibodies are effective, they are not efficient. Large amounts of antibodies are needed to suppress the targeted protein, and the inhibitory effects of antibodies are transient unless these high doses are administered repeatedly.</p><p>RNA interference (RNAi) is a recently developed technique to silence proteins in a sequence-specific manner by inhibiting mRNA and consequently reducing protein expression. The high efficiency and specificity of RNAi has made it a powerful and widely used tool for gene therapy. The functional mediator of RNAi is a short double strand RNA (dsRNA) oligonucleotide called small interfering RNA (siRNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. A growing number of investigations are examining the use of siRNA as a candidate therapeutic agent, Currently, there are two siRNA-based molecules: Cand5, which is a siRNA against all isoforms of VEGF, and siRNA-027, a kind of siRNA targeting VEGF receptor 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. Acuity Pharmaceuticals (Philadelphia, PA) has begun a Phase II clinical trial for Cand5, and Sirna Therapeutics (San Francisco, CA) is on a Phase 1 clinical trial for siRNA-027. However, due to differential pre-mRNA splicing, a single VEGF gene gives rise to many different VEGF isoforms. To date, five isoforms of human VEGF have been identified: VEGF<sub>121</sub>, VEGF<sub>145</sub>, VEGF<sub>165</sub>, VEGF<sub>189</sub>, and VEGF<sub>206</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. Although VEGF is highly conserved throughout evolution, the murine homologs contain one fewer amino acid. The murine designation for the human VEGF<sub>165</sub> is VEGF<sub>164</sub>. Of the various isoforms, VEGF<sub>165</sub> (VEGF<sub>164</sub>) appears to be the major pathological VEGF isoform in the eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. Because VEGF<sub>165</sub> is a major disease-causing isoform in models of neovascular eye disease, we expected to identify whether retinal angiogenesis could be attenuated by siRNA targeting VEGF<sub>165</sub>.</p><p>In this report, we used a vector-based siRNA expression system, which overcomes the limitations of transience and high cost in synthetic siRNAs, to specifically inhibit VEGF<sub>165</sub> expression in the murine model of proliferative retinopathy. Our data confirm the potential VEGF<sub>165</sub> inhibitors for the treatment of ocular angiogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Recombinant pSilencer<sup>siVEGF</sup> construction</title><p>The cDNA oligonucleotides targeting VEGF<sub>165</sub> mRNA were designed and examined by Guan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. A pair of 63 nucleotide oligos containing endonuclease restriction sites at both ends was synthesized by the Sangong Company (Shanghai, China).

The annealed dsDNA oligonucleotides were ligated between the BamHI and HindIII sites on the pSilencer2.1-U6 hygro vector. The targeted VEGF<sub>165</sub> sequences were GAT AGA GCA AGA CAA GAA A. All inserted sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture and transfection of cells</title><p>Human umbilical vein endothelial cell lines (HUVECs) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HUVECs were grown in F12K medium, containing 0.1&#x000a0;mg/ml heparin, 20% fetal bovine serum, 0.03&#x000a0;mg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and antibiotic mixtures of 100 U/ml penicillin G and 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin sulfate.

Hypoxia was 1% oxygen. In the vivo studies, normoxic mice were raised in room-air-raised. For hyperoxia, mice were kept in 75&#x000b1;2% oxygen. Transfection reagent lipofectamine2000 was used to transfer the pSilencer<sup>siVEGF</sup> to the HUVECs according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). In brief, 2&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> HUVECs cells were seeded into six-well plates.

The reproducible murine model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. C57BL/6J mice were bought from Experimental Animal Center of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan province, China. The mice were exposed to less than 300&#x000a0;lx of 12 h cyclical broad spectrum light. The oxygen-treated mice were housed in an incubator. Oxygen concentration was monitored with a Beckman oxygen analyzer (Model D2; Beckman,. Irvine, CA). The cage temperature was maintained at 23&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C&#x000b1;2&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The mice were placed in the oxygen chamber with enough food and water to sustain them for 5 days. Postnatal day 7 (P7) C57BL/6J mice and their nursing mothers were exposed to 75%&#x000b1;2% oxygen for five days. On P12, the mice were removed from the chamber and maintained in room air until P17. Mice of the same strain and of the same age were kept in room air and used as control subjects. Intravitreal injections of liposome&#x02013;pSilencer<sup>siVEGF</sup> complexes were performed at P12 as described in the next section. At P17, the mice were sacrificed by cardiac perfusion of 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) catalog number of PBS is 20012043 (Gibco), and their eyes were enucleated for RT&#x02013;PCR and immunohistologic analysis. Alternatively, some mice underwent retinal fluorescein angiography, as described in the next section.</p></sec><sec><title>Intravitreal injections</title><p>At P12, mouse pups were deeply anesthetized with a 30&#x000a0;mg/kg intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital. The lid fissure was opened with a no. 11 scalpel blade, and the eye was proptosed. Intravitreal injections were performed by first entering the eye with an Ethicon TG140&#x02013;8 suture needle at the posterior limbus.

Half of the group of mice were used for angiography with high-molecular-weight fluorescein-dextran, and the other half were used for histological analysis of neovascularization. Paraffin-embedded axial serial sections of the retina, 6&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m thick, were obtained starting at the optic nerve head.

Under pathological conditions, such as diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity, the retina increases the production of angiogenic stimulators and reduces the production of angiogenic inhibitors, which would disrupt the balance between the positive and negative regulators of angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. VEGF as major angiogenic stimulator is upregulated in ocular neovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. However, due to alternative splicing of mRNA, VEGF has multiple isoforms. VEGF<sub>165</sub> (VEGF<sub>164</sub> in mice) is the major disease-causing isoform in models of neovascular eye disease. VEGF<sub>165</sub> was found to be more potent than other VEGF isoforms in inducing vascular leakage and breakdown of blood&#x02013;retinal barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. Hence, VEGF<sub>165</sub> was selected for this study as a target for suppressing retinal neovascularization. We hoped that therapy targeting VEGF<sub>165</sub> in the retina could increase specificity and efficacy of the treatment.</p><p>To decrease pathological VEGF<sub>165</sub> upregulation, we constructed a vector-based VEGF<sub>165</sub> targeted siRNA expression system (pSilencer<sup>siVEGF</sup>) for our studies. pSilencer<sup>siVEGF</sup> has been shown to specifically inhibit VEGF<sub>165</sub> expression in normoxia-cultured tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. It has been hypothesized that sustained overproduction of VEGF by hypoxia retinal cells promotes retinal neovascularization in several neovascular eye diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. Consequently, close attention was paid to whether pSilencer<sup>siVEGF</sup> could work properly under hypoxia conditions. VEGF<sub>165</sub> was found to be decreased dramatically not only in the hypoxia cultured cells but also in the hypoxia retinal cells in the murine animal models, suggesting that hypoxia-induced VEGF could be abrogated by pSilencer<sup>siVEGF</sup> under hypoxia conditions. We surmise that overproduction of VEGF by hypoxia retinal cells may also be blocked by pSilencer<sup>siVEGF</sup> in human neovascular eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy.</p><p>In the current study, retinal neovascularization in the murine model was greatly inhibited by 1000 ng of pSilencer<sup>siVEGF</sup>. This dramatic decrease in retinal neovascularization could be attributed to the following reasons. First, the localization of plasmids mediated by cationic liposome is close to the site of hypoxia-induced VEGF generation. VEGF<sub>164</sub> level in the retinas of the murine model was found to increase in the inner nuclear layer and ganglion cell layer in this study, which was consistent with a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. However, cationic liposome has been confirmed as an effective reagent for retinal gene transfer, which could carry plasmids into retinal ganglion cells and retinal pigment epithelial cells through the injection of plasmids and liposome complex into the vitreous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Accordingly, intravitreal injections of pSilencer<sup>siVEGF</sup> could be successfully carried into retinal cells, which are in charge of producing hypoxia-induced VEGF by liposome. Second, the catalytic nature of RNAi entered the retinal cells. Small hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting VEGF<sub>165</sub> could be generated and processed into siRNA in these cells. The siRNA targeting VEGF<sub>165</sub> binds to the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC), which in turn becomes activated. The activated RISC complex seeks out the VEGF<sub>165</sub> mRNA and then splices the mRNA at the site of the homologous sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, in multiple turnover kinetic fashion, the activated RISC can seek another VEGF<sub>165</sub> mRNA to bind and destroy. One activated RISC complex can bind and destroy hundreds of VEGF<sub>165</sub> mRNA. Finally, the high efficiency of pSilencer<sup>siVEGF</sup> is attributed to the divisional rate of the retinal cells. The division rate of cells that have taken in siRNA is an important factor when determining durability of silencing in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>], which leads to dilution of the activated RISC as it is divided between daughter cells. Because the division rate of retinal cells is slow, the silencing effect in the cells could last until upregulation of VEGF in ischemic retina disappears.</p><p>In summary, we found that siRNA targeting VEGF<sub>165</sub> expressed from pSilencer<sup>siVEGF</sup> could decrease VEGF<sub>165</sub> expression in vitro and reduce retinal neovascularization in a murine model of OIR. However, further experiments are necessary to determine whether detrimental side effects will appear after local administration of pSilencer<sup>siVEGF</sup>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of
