Furthermore, modulation of neurotrophin expression by IL-1&#x003b2; and modulation of substance P expression by TNF&#x003b1;, coupled with their increased expression in the degenerate IVD, highlights novel roles for these cytokines in regulating nerve ingrowth in the degenerate IVD and associated back pain.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Low back pain is a widespread and incapacitating disorder of significant social and economic importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Degeneration of the intervertebral disc (IVD) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic low back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and is characterised by increased degradation of the extracellular matrix coupled with an ingrowth of blood vessels and nerves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] into the normally avascular and aneural tissue. Indeed, we have shown an association between the painful degenerate IVD and nerve ingrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The mechanisms underlying innervation into the degenerate human IVD, however, are largely unknown. Studies by Johnson and colleagues have demonstrated that the extracellular matrix component aggrecan, derived from the healthy IVD, has an inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Likewise, such an inhibitory effect has also been demonstrated in an ovine annular model of disc degeneration in which depletion of the proteoglycan content was associated with an increased nerve ingrowth into the IVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The normal healthy IVD is largely aneural. Anatomical studies by Jackson and colleagues and by Bogduk and colleagues have demonstrated innervation of only the superficial outer layers of the annulus fibrosus, with the central core of the IVD completely lacking nerves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This is supported by the work of Fagan and colleagues, who have demonstrated innervation of both the perianular region of the IVD as well as the central region of endplate above the nucleus pulposus (NP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Within the degenerate IVD, however, nerves have been shown to penetrate both the inner annulus fibrosus (IAF) and the NP. Importantly, these innervating fibres have been shown to express both the neural growth-associated marker GAP43 and the pain-associated neuropeptide substance P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Additional studies investigating innervation in the degenerate IVD have also demonstrated expression of Trk-A, the high-affinity receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF), on ingrowing nerves &#x02013; indicating that such nerves are NGF sensitive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This is supported by Aoki and colleagues, who have identified NGF-responsive nerve fibres as the predominant neuronal subtype innervating the peripheral regions of the healthy annulus fibrosus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Studies by Ohtori and colleagues have also demonstrated that a number of the neurons innervating the rat IVD were immunoreactive for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a modulator of pain-associated processes in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Neurotrophins are growth and survival factors, associated mainly with neuronal development, function and nociception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. They are located primarily within the central and peripheral nervous systems, and they consist of a family of four principal members: NGF, BDNF, neurotrophin 3 and neurotrophin 4/5. Both NGF and BDNF have been identified in non-neural cells of healthy and diseased connective tissue such as human cartilage and bone, and, interestingly, recent studies have highlighted a possible role for neurotrophins in the IVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. For example, Johnson and colleagues demonstrated stimulation of neurite outgrowth by soluble mediators produced by degenerate disc cells, mediators they hypothesised to be neurotrophic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Additionally, NGF has been identified in association with the blood vessels growing into the degenerate IVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and also in the rounded chondrocyte cells of the annulus fibrosus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. More recently, Abe and colleagues have confirmed this and have also shown both expression and synthesis of NGF in NP cells isolated from the human IVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>As well as NGF expression, microarray analysis of human disc cells subjected to hyperosmotic stimuli has identified expression and upregulation of BDNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Additionally, in a recent study Gruber and colleagues showed expression of BDNF in human IVD cells, with BDNF gene expression in annulus fibrosus cells positively correlating with increasing degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Whether both NGF and BDNF are upregulated in the degenerate IVD, and as such play a key role in innervation and the pathogenesis of low back pain, however, remains to be determined.</p><p>The neurotrophins NGF and BDNF function principally through their high-affinity receptors Trk-A and Trk-B. Indeed, both receptors have been identified in cells of the musculoskeletal system, and more recent studies have demonstrated Trk-A and Trk-B expression in human disc cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Studies investigating a role for neurotrophins in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis have shown upregulation of both NGF and Trk-A in osteoarthritic chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, expression of Trk-A and Trk-B by human disc cells in terms of disease pathology has yet to be fully examined.</p><p>A role for the proinflammatory cytokines TNF&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; in innervation of the IVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and in degeneration of the IVD has been demonstrated by a number of authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Additionally these cytokines have been shown to regulate neurotrophin expression in non-neuronal cells. Studies by Kemi and colleagues have demonstrated upregulation of NGF and BDNF in bronchial smooth muscle cells after treatment with IL-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Similarly, in synovial fibroblasts isolated from patients with osteoarthritis, both IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF&#x003b1; were shown to increase NGF synthesis and release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Evidence to support a role for IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF&#x003b1; in the modulation of neurotrophin expression in the IVD comes from studies by Abe and colleagues, who demonstrated an increase in NGF gene expression and protein secretion after NP cells (cultured in monolayer) were treated with IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Work to date therefore supports a role for neurotrophins in the biology of innervation in the IVD, the function of which may be regulated by proinflammatory cytokines known to be upregulated during IVD degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Based on this knowledge we hypothesised that expression of the neurotrophins NGF and BDNF increases with disc degeneration and that they are regulated by IL-1&#x003b2;, which also increases with the severity of degeneration. Using immunohistochemistry we have therefore investigated NGF and BDNF expression, including expression of the receptors Trk-A and Trk-B, in non-degenerate, moderately degenerate and severely degenerate human IVD tissue, and we have examined the effects of IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF&#x003b1; on neurotrophin expression in non-degenerate and degenerate disc cells (seeded in a three-dimensional matrix).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>NGF, BDNF, Trk-A and Trk-B protein expression in the nondegenerate and degenerate human IVD</title><p>Human IVD tissue was obtained at surgery/postmortem, and ethical consent was obtained from the local ethical committees together with informed consent from the patient or relatives.

There are no studies to date, however, which have examined an association between the expression of these two neurotrophins and the severity of disc degeneration. In the present study, an association between BDNF protein expression and disease severity was demonstrated &#x02013; a greater number of positive disc cells was noted in all regions of severely degenerate samples (grades 9 to 12), which was significant for cells in the NP and IAF. For NGF, although a greater number of immunopositive cells were observed in the NP and IAF of disc samples of moderate degeneration and in the OAF of severely degenerate samples, these differences were not significant. These observations suggest that BDNF may be the more important neurotrophin in IVD degeneration driving pain-related processes as well as neuronal survival and innervation.</p><p>Few studies have examined the function of neurotrophin expression in cells of non-neural origin. Studies by Johnson and colleagues support the concept that disc cells, in particular cells from the degenerate IVD, produce nerve-promoting factors with the ability to induce neurite outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Similarly, our previous work demonstrating the presence of Trk-A-expressing nerves growing into the degenerate IVD corroborates a role for neurotrophic factors, principally NGF, in the mechanisms associated with nerve ingrowth into the painful IVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Additionally, the high levels of NGF expression in both the non-degenerate and degenerate IVD perhaps point towards a function for NGF unrelated to nerve ingrowth or survival. Indeed, studies by Uchiyama and colleagues have highlighted a role for NGF in adaptation of disc cells to their acidic and hyperosmotic microenvironment via regulation of acid-sensing ion channel 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Our data show increased expression of BDNF with increasing severity of degeneration, which supports the recent findings of Gruber and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This highlights a novel function for BDNF in possible innervation in the degenerate IVD, although further work elucidating its exact role is necessary and should include investigation of BDNF-responsive nerves within the degenerate IVD. Similarly a role for neurotrophic factors with regard to nociception in the painful IVD has yet to be elucidated.</p><p>Using a rat model of experimental IVD herniation, Onda and colleagues have highlighted a correlation between induction of NGF within the dorsal nerve root using surgical procedures and pain behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In a mouse model of skeletal pain and of bone healing, antibodies blocking NGF were shown to significantly reduce fracture pain-related behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The function of BDNF with regard to pain processes has focussed mainly on its role within the dorsal horn and central nervous system, with few studies examining effects peripherally. It is possible the neurotrophic factors expressed by IVD cells may have the ability to modulate each other's function. Studies by Zhao and colleagues suggest that NGF may regulate inflammatory pain in sensory nociceptive neurons in part through the expression of BDNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. A relationship between NGF and BDNF within the IVD therefore requires futher investigation.</p><p>The present investigation also importantly highlights a possible function for neurotrophins and their receptors in disc cell biology. In non-degenerate, moderate and severely degenerate IVD tissue, the receptors Trk-A and Trk-B were expressed by the chondrocyte-like cells of the IVD, suggesting that neurotrophins in the IVD may exert autocrine effects on the disc cells themselves. Significant differences were observed between receptor expression in the different regions of the IVD: expression was significantly greater in the NP and IAF compared with the OAF. Some investigators have suggested that neurotrophin and receptor expression by articular chondrocytes may contribute to disease processes by influencing cell metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Work by Raucci and colleagues has demonstrated NGF to have an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation in chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and similar effects have been observed in osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Neurotrophins may therefore play a role in matrix turnover and regulation of cell metabolism in the IVD.</p><p>The study undertaken here confirms a role for disc-related proinflammatory cytokines IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF&#x003b1; in the modulation of neurotrophin and neuropeptide expression in cells from the IVD seeded in a three-dimensional matrix. Treatment with IL-1&#x003b2; resulted in a significant increase in the relative gene expression of both NGF and BDNF in NP cells, with a greater increase in cells from non-degenerate IVD. This supports the work of Abe and colleagues, who demonstrated an increase in NGF protein and gene expression in NP cells seeded in monolayer and treated with IL-1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Indeed a number of studies have demonstrated regulation of NGF expression and NGF-associated pain processes by IL-1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. As a consequence, IL-1&#x003b2; may be an important factor with regard to upregulation of neurotrophin expression and nerve ingrowth by disc cells in the initial stages of disease. IL-1&#x003b2; expression in the IVD has also been shown to increase with disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], so it is reasonable to hypothesise that, as well as functioning to enhance catabolic processes, increasing amounts of IL-1&#x003b2; may also serve to perpetuate the degenerate disease IVD phenotype in terms of processes associated with nerve ingrowth and pain.</p><p>Unlike the results obtained by Abe and colleagues, however, the studies described here showed TNF&#x003b1; to have little effect on neurotrophin gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This may be as a consequence of differences in experimental procedures, as we cultured NP cells in alginate &#x02013; which maintains a phenotype more representative of that seen <italic>in vivo </italic>&#x02013; whereas Abe and colleagues treated NP cells cultured in monolayer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Work by Hattori and colleagues has demonstrated a synergistic effect between TNF&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; in the stimulation of NGF from fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], and therefore whether the effects of TNF&#x003b1; on neurotrophin expression in the IVD also requires the presence of IL-1&#x003b2; remains to be investigated.</p><p>It is possible to hypothesise that substance P may contribute to nociceptive processes within the degenerate IVD since expression of the pain-related neuropeptide and its receptor have been identified in both disc cells and nerves growing into the diseased IVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In the present study TNF&#x003b1; treatment resulted in an increase in substance P expression, and this was greater in degenerate NP cells. An association of TNF&#x003b1; with substance P expression and degeneration is supported by the work of Chubinskaya and colleagues, who have demonstrated downregulation of both genes in an anticatabolic disc model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results overall suggest a dual function for neurotrophins within the non-degenerate and degenerate IVD. Expression of NGF and increased expression of BDNF with degeneration identifies a possible role for these factors in perpetuation of nerve ingrowth into the degenerate IVD. Expression of the high-affinity receptors by cells of the non-degenerate and degenerate IVD, however, implicates an autocrine role for neurotrophins in disc cell metabolism. Enhancement of neurotrophin expression by IL-1&#x003b2; and neuropeptide expression by TNF&#x003b1; coupled with the increased expression of these proinflammatory cytokines in the degenerate IVD identifies new roles for IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF&#x003b1; in regulating nerve ingrowth and associated chronic low back pain. IL-1&#x003b2; may act as a key modulator of neurotrophin expression in the IVD, yet TNF&#x003b1; may have an influential role in regulation of nociception through substance P.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BDNF = brain-derived neurotrophic factor; DMEM = Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media; FCS = foetal calf serum; IAF = inner annulus fibrosus; IL = interleukin; IVD = intervertebral disc; NGF = nerve growth factor; NP = nucleus pulposus; OAF = outer annulus fibrosus; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; TNF = tumour necrosis factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DP participated in the design of the study, performed the majority of the laboratory work and analysis, and drafted the manuscript.
