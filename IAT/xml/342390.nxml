In each case, the pattern of methylation was examined by use of the restriction enzymes Hha I and HPA II HPA II, which cut DNA at the sites 5'GCGC and 5'CCGG respectively, when the cytosines at these sites are not methylated. Mouse embryo DNA was found to have the same level of methylation as adult mouse tissues, and no changes in methylation were seen during differentiation of the teratocarcinoma cells. The ratio of 5-MeCyt/Cyt in DNA was measured by high performance liquid chromatography for the differentiating teratocarcinoma cells and for several adult mouse and rabbit tissues. The variation between tissues or between teratocarcinoma cells at different stages of differentiation was less than 10 percent. These results are discussed in view of proposals that 5-MeCyt plays a role in differentiation.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00461-0298-a" xlink:role="2375"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00461-0300-a" xlink:role="2377"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00461-0301-a" xlink:role="2378"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00461-0292.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2369"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00461-0293.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2370"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00461-0294.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2371"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00461-0295.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2372"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00461-0296.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2373"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00461-0297.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2374"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00461-0298.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2375"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00461-0299.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2376"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00461-0300.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2377"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00461-0301.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2378"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00461-0302.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2379"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00461-0303.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2380"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00461-0304.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2381"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00461-0305.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2382"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00461-0306.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2383"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00461-0307.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2384"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00461-0308.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2385"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
