The physiological relevance of these discoveries to cIAP1 function remains undetermined. We show that upon ligand binding, the TNF superfamily receptor FN14 recruits a cIAP1&#x02013;Tnf receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) complex. Unlike IAP antagonists that cause rapid proteasomal degradation of cIAP1, signaling by FN14 promotes the lysosomal degradation of cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2 in a cIAP1-dependent manner. TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK)/FN14 signaling nevertheless promotes the same noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B signaling elicited by IAP antagonists and, in sensitive cells, the same autocrine TNF&#x003b1;-induced death occurs. TWEAK-induced loss of the cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2 complex sensitizes immortalized and minimally passaged tumor cells to TNF&#x003b1;-induced death, whereas primary cells remain resistant. Conversely, cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2 complex overexpression limits FN14 signaling and protects tumor cells from TWEAK-induced TNF&#x003b1; sensitization. Lysosomal degradation of cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2 by TWEAK/FN14 therefore critically alters the balance of life/death signals emanating from TNF-R1 in immortalized cells.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: cIAP1, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1; DD, death domain; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; MVB, multivesicular body; TNFRSF, TNF receptor superfamily; TRAF, Tnf receptor-associated factor; TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; TWEAK, TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Upon binding of their cognate ligand, TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) members transmit signals via their cytoplasmic domains. Several TNF receptors bear death domains (DD) that allow them to directly promote apoptotic cell death. Activation of the TNFRSF receptors, such Fas or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)&#x02013;R2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tartaglia et al., 1993</xref>), allows the binding of FADD in a DD&#x02013;DD interaction, which initiates apoptotic signaling by the recruitment and activation of caspase 8 or 10 by oligomerization. TNF-R1&#x02013;induced activation of caspase 8 or 10 is less direct, involving recruitment of the DD-containing adaptor TRADD, followed by the formation of an internalized secondary complex which can bind FADD and caspase 8 to initiate the apoptotic program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Micheau and Tschopp, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Despite its name, most tumor cells do not die when exposed to TNF&#x003b1; but must also be treated with inhibitors of translation or transcription, such as actinomycin D or cycloheximide. These agents are thought to sensitize cells to TNF&#x003b1; by preventing production of survival proteins induced via NF-&#x003ba;B. Many of the TNFRSF members, including FN14, contain a consensus Tnf receptor-associated factor (TRAF) binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ye et al., 1999</xref>) that recruits TRAFs to activate transcription factors including NF-&#x003ba;B and AP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yeh et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>TRAF1 and TRAF2 were initially identified in protein complexes that bound to the cytoplasmic domain of TNF-R2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rothe et al., 1994</xref>), together with cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (cIAP1) and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rothe et al., 1995</xref>). However, another cellular IAP homologue, XIAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duckett et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Listen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Uren et al., 1996</xref>), became the focus of attention because it was shown to directly inhibit activated downstream caspases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deveraux et al., 1997</xref>) and the N-terminally processed form of the initiator caspase, caspase 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Srinivasula et al., 2001</xref>), whereas neither cIAP1 nor cIAP2 can inhibit caspase activity at concentrations that are reached in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tenev et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eckelman and Salvesen, 2006</xref>)</p><p>Although the function of cIAP1 has remained unclear for some time, recent studies have identified genetic abnormalities in cIAP1 from patients with multiple myeloma that correlate with reduced cIAP1 protein levels and enhanced noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Annunziata et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keats et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with this work, it has recently been demonstrated that genetic deletion of cIAP1 in immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) causes constitutive noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B activity and sensitization to TNF&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vince et al., 2007</xref>), and loss of cIAP1 sensitizes cells to TNF&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaither et al., 2007</xref>). Strikingly, synthetic IAP antagonists, or smac mimetics, which deplete both cIAP1 and 2 protein levels, also activate NF-&#x003ba;B signaling and enhance TNF&#x003b1; death signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaither et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Varfolomeev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vince et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, although the intended target of Smac mimetics was XIAP, it appears that their ability to effectively inhibit cIAP1 and or cIAP2 plays a central role in tumor cell killing and that cIAP1 is a central player in regulating the survival and death signals initiated from TNF-R1 in tumor cells.</p><p>cIAP1 and 2 were identified via their indirect binding to TNF-R2, but they are also present in the TNF-R1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Micheau and Tschopp, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vince et al., 2007</xref>) and have the potential to regulate the signaling from &#x0223c;17 TNF superfamily receptors that contain TRAF2 consensus binding sites. Despite this, it is still unknown which receptors cIAP1 does bind and how it might be physiologically regulated to control signaling from these receptors.</p><p>TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) is a member of the TNF superfamily (TNFSF12) that engages a receptor termed FN14 (TNFRSF12A). FN14 has been shown to bind TRAF2 (and TRAFs 1, 3, and 5) in a yeast two-hybrid screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2003</xref>) and can initiate both canonical and noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Saitoh et al., 2003</xref>). It is unknown how FN14 activates NF-&#x003ba;B, but physiological TWEAK/FN14 signaling can inhibit cellular differentiation, promote angiogenesis, cytokine production, and cellular proliferation, and has been suggested to play a role in the wound response because of its induction in wounded tissues and organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vince and Silke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Winkles et al., 2007</xref>). TWEAK also induces apoptosis in HT29 and KATO-III cells pretreated with IFN&#x003b3; and has growth-suppressive effects on several cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Felli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maecker et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we show that binding of TWEAK to endogenous FN14 recruits a complex containing both cIAP1 and TRAF2. This complex is subsequently recruited to a lysosomal compartment where it is degraded. Consistent with lysosomal degradation, TWEAK-induced TRAF2 degradation is prevented by several different inhibitors of lysosomal function but, interestingly, still requires cIAP1 function. The loss of cIAP1 or TRAF2, but not cIAP2 or XIAP, preferentially sensitizes immortalized cells, but not primary cells, to killing by TNF&#x003b1;. In contrast, overexpression of both cIAP1 and TRAF2 correlates with tumor cell resistance to TWEAK/TNF&#x003b1;-induced cell death. These results provide mechanistic insights into how the cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2 complex functions in tumor cells to inhibit apoptosis and how this complex can be physiologically regulated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>FN14 is expressed by most tumor cell lines</title><p>To understand how endogenous cIAPs regulate TNFRSF signaling, we used TNFSF ligands to screen for cell lines containing detectable levels of endogenous TNFSF receptors. To facilitate the screen, we generated TNFSF ligands as recombinant proteins tagged with the Fc portion of human IgG (Fig. S1A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801010/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801010/DC1</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bossen et al., 2006</xref>). These molecules are cross-linked via the Fc portion that promotes higher order aggregation of the corresponding receptors, closely mimicking engagement by membrane-bound ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holler et al., 2003</xref>). The Fc portion also facilitates reliable detection of these proteins by Western blot (Fig. S1 B) and allows for their simple purification with protein A (Fig. S1 B, right) and for immunoprecipitation of interacting protein complexes (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>).</p><p>We tested the purified Fc ligands for specific binding to their cognate receptor using FlpIn stable cell lines inducibly expressing different TNFSF receptors and only observed binding when the ligand was added to cells in which expression of the corresponding cognate receptor was induced, i.e., CD27/CD70 and FN14/TWEAK (Fig. S1 C). Satisfied with the specificity of the ligands, we used them to screen a panel of tumor cell lines (including those from kidney, brain, colon, melanoma, breast, and ovarian cancers). Only one of the ligands, TWEAK, bound to a high proportion of the tumor cell lines examined (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>, Fig. S1 D, and not depicted), suggesting that in culture, many tumor cells constitutively express the TWEAK receptor FN14.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>TWEAK specifically binds to endogenous FN14 in many tumor cell lines and cIAP1 binds to FN14 via its TRAF2 binding domain.</bold> (A) Cells were harvested and incubated with Fc-CD70 or Fc-TWEAK, Tricolor-labeled anti-Fc, and analyzed by flow cytometry.

To confirm that the signal caused by binding of TWEAK correlated with expression of FN14, we used a commercial antibody against FN14. The specificity of this FN14 antibody was demonstrated by flow cytometry using cells inducible for FN14 expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Importantly, cell lines that bound TWEAK also stained strongly with the antibody to FN14 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). These results demonstrate that a large number of transformed cell lines of both human and mouse origin constitutively express the TWEAK receptor FN14.</p></sec><sec><title>TWEAK binding to FN14 recruits TRAF2 and cIAP1</title><p>Because yeast two-hybrid screens suggested a potential interaction between TRAF2 and FN14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2003</xref>), we tested whether TRAF2 could interact with FN14 in vivo. Recombinant Fc-TWEAK successfully immunoprecipitated endogenous TRAF2 and cIAP1 in D645 glioma cells, whereas in the absence of TWEAK, no TRAF2 or cIAP1 was detected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>).</p><p>To test whether cIAP1 binding to FN14 was indirectly mediated through TRAF2, we transiently transfected cIAP1 &#x00394;C6 (a stable mutant of cIAP1 lacking the last six residues) and cIAP1 &#x00394;BIR1 constructs into D645 glioma cells and immunoprecipitated endogenous FN14 with Fc-TWEAK. Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Samuel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varfolomeev et al., 2006</xref>), cIAP1 constructs that lacked a BIR1 domain were unable to bind endogenous TRAF2, whereas mutations to other regions of cIAP1 did not affect the TRAF2 interaction (Fig. S1 E and not depicted). As for endogenous cIAP1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>), transfected cIAP1 &#x00394;C6 could be immunoprecipitated by Fc-TWEAK (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>), whereas &#x00394;BIR1 cIAP1 could not be detected under the same conditions, even though endogenous TRAF2 was immunoprecipitated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Similarly, when vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)&#x02013;tagged FN14 was induced and immunoprecipitated with anti-VSV in the presence of TWEAK, cIAP1 &#x00394;C6 could be detected, whereas neither &#x00394;BIR1 cIAP1 nor &#x00394;BIR1 cIAP1 &#x00394;C6 associated with FN14 (Fig. S1 F). These results strongly suggest that endogenous cIAP1 binds indirectly to FN14 through its association with TRAF2.</p></sec><sec><title>Signaling from FN14 induces the degradation of both TRAF2 and cIAP1</title><p>The role of TRAF2 and cIAP1 in TNFSF signaling is still unclear. Several studies suggest that TRAF2 is the ubiquitin E3 ligase that ubiquitylates RIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2004</xref>), thereby promoting activation of canonical NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2006</xref>). Other studies suggest cIAP1 is the ubiquitin E3 ligase for RIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2004</xref>) and for TRAF2 itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2002</xref>). Indeed, the most widely accepted model for cIAP1 function, based largely on overexpression data, states that cIAP1 ubiquitylates TRAF2 causing its proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2002</xref>). A followup study using primary B cells also showed that TRAF2 degradation after stimulation with agonistic TNF-R2 antibodies did not occur in cIAP1 knockout cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>), lending credence to this model. We therefore tested whether TWEAK induced TRAF2 degradation. OVCAR4, SKOV3, Kym1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), and transformed MEF cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref> and not depicted) were treated with TWEAK for 0&#x02013;6 h and cellular levels of endogenous cIAP1 and TRAF2 analyzed by Western blot (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and C</xref>). After 1&#x02013;6 h of TWEAK addition, cellular levels of both TRAF2 and cIAP1 were reduced in all cell lines examined.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>FN14 signaling decreases cellular cIAP1 and TRAF2 levels by lysosomal degradation.</bold> (A) OVCAR4, SKOV3, or Kym1 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml Fc-TWEAK at 37&#x000b0;C for the indicated time, lysed, and analyzed by Western blot.

To examine the requirement of cIAP1 for TWEAK-induced TRAF2 loss, and vice versa, we used gene knockout transformed MEF cell lines and stimulated endogenous FN14 with TWEAK. Although TWEAK stimulation resulted in decreased levels of cIAP1 in wild-type MEFs, it was not degraded in TRAF2&#x02212;/&#x02212; knockout MEFs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, left). TRAF2-mediated binding of cIAP1 to FN14 is therefore required for TWEAK-induced degradation of cIAP1. Consistent with previous studies, cIAP1 was required for the degradation of TRAF2 because TWEAK-stimulated TRAF2 depletion did not occur in cIAP1&#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, left).</p><p>To examine the requirement for cIAP1 in TRAF2 degradation in greater detail, we performed further experiments where we lysed cells in Triton X-100 and examined the detergent soluble and insoluble membrane fractions. Remarkably, TRAF2 disappeared from the Triton X-100&#x02013;soluble fraction in cIAP1 knockout cells as it did from wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, right; and Fig. S2 B). These two results suggest that TRAF2 translocation to an insoluble compartment occurs in the absence of cIAP1 but its degradation requires the activity of cIAP1. This notion is consistent with previous reports demonstrating that TRAF2 relocalizes to a detergent-insoluble fraction and becomes degraded after signaling from other TNFSF receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Habelhah et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Because TWEAK did not induce proteasomal degradation of the cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2 complex, we tested other protease inhibitors. Cells preincubated with a protease inhibitor cocktail showed reduced TWEAK-mediated degradation of TRAF2 and a modest protecton of cIAP1 when serum was removed from the medium before addition of the inhibitor (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). We therefore tested whether TWEAK-mediated TRAF2 and cIAP1 depletion was dependent upon lysosomal function. Consistent with this hypothesis, inhibitors of lysosomal function, such as chloroquine and ammonium chloride, prevented TWEAK-mediated TRAF2 degradation, whereas ammonium chloride also substantially blocked TWEAK-mediated cIAP1 degradation, although not to the same extent as it blocked TRAF2 depletion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D and F</xref>).</p><p>To further test a role for lysosomal proteases, we used specific protease inhibitors. The serine protease inhibitor AEBSF failed to block TWEAK-mediated cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2 degradation, whereas TLCK, which can inhibit both serine and cysteine proteases, partially blocked TWEAK-mediated TRAF2 loss (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). The cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074Me (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>) also provided protection against loss of both cIAP1 and TRAF2, implying that lysosomal cathepsins may be important for the degradation of this complex. Importantly, neither CA-074Me nor the inhibitors of lysosomal function perturbed the proteasomal degradation pathway because they did not prevent the loss of cIAP1 induced by IAP antagonist (compound A) treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>), which we have previously shown is proteasomal dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vince et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Although endogenous TRAF2 and cIAP1 was difficult to detect by confocal microscopy, analysis of D645 cells transiently transfected with FLAG-TRAF2 revealed that in unstimulated cells, TRAF2 was exclusively cytosolic and did not overlap with the acidotropic lysosome marker lysotracker (Fig. S2, C and D). However upon stimulation with TWEAK ligand for 3&#x02013;6 h, TRAF2 showed a significant redistribution to punctate vesicles (Fig. S2, C and E). TRAF2-containing vesicles were juxtaposed with lysotracker-stained compartments and often directly overlapped (Fig. S2 E), suggesting that TRAF2 degradation occurs in the lysosome or in compartments that are in close association. It is probable that the Triton X-100&#x02013;insoluble fraction contains MVB/lysosomal membranes because the inhibitors NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and CA-074Me significantly blocked degradation of TRAF2 and cIAP1 in the Triton X-100&#x02013;insoluble fraction (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec><title>TWEAK activates noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B by depleting cIAP1 and TRAF2</title><p>TWEAK/FN14 signaling has previously been shown to activate both canonical and noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Saitoh et al., 2003</xref>).

TWEAK also induced a significant NF-&#x003ba;B response, although this was slower and not as large as the TNF&#x003b1; response (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). TWEAK-induced NF-&#x003ba;B was not dependent upon autocrine-produced TNF&#x003b1; because induction of NF-&#x003ba;B could not be blocked by anti-TNF&#x003b1; (unpublished data). To investigate whether NF-&#x003ba;B was noncanonical, we examined processing of the NF-&#x003ba;B2 subunit from the p100 form to the activated, processed p52 form.

Consistent with this model and our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vince et al., 2007</xref>), MEFs deleted for either cIAP1 or TRAF2 showed elevated p52 levels and an increase in p52 localization to a nucleus-containing fraction (Fig. S3 A). In contrast, p50 localization was unaffected by loss of these genes and was predominantly present in the unprocessed p105 form in the cytoplasm (Fig. S3 A).</p><p>If depletion of the cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2 complex is sufficient to activate NF-&#x003ba;B, then overexpression of these two proteins should inhibit TWEAK/FN14-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activity. To test this hypothesis, we used FN14-inducible NF-&#x003ba;B EGFP reporter cells in which maximal NF-&#x003ba;B activity was detected in cells that were simultaneously induced for FN14 expression and stimulated with TWEAK ligand and tested the effect of transiently transfecting cIAP1, TRAF2, or both (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>) in this system. Individual expression of either TRAF2 or cIAP1 failed to block TWEAK/FN14-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). However, the overexpression of both proteins together significantly reduced the amount of NF-&#x003ba;B activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Importantly, this was dependent on cIAP1 binding to TRAF2, because coexpression of TRAF2 with the &#x00394;BIR1 cIAP1 mutant that is unable to bind TRAF2 (Fig. S1 E), was unable to inhibit FN14/TWEAK-induced activation of NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). NIK stabilization and p100 processing to p52 could be blocked by pretreatment of cells with NH<sub>4</sub>Cl but not by pretreatment with CA-074Me (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>). This suggests that relocalization to the lysosomal compartment is sufficient to trigger stabilization of NIK and subsequent processing of p100 rather than degradation in the lysosome per se.</p><p>Because TWEAK has been reported to activate the canonical pathway, we also examined the effects of TWEAK and cIAP1 or TRAF2 loss on canonical signaling markers.

However, the binding of cIAP1 to TNF receptors other than TNF-R1 or TNF-R2, or the physiological regulation of cIAP1 by TNF receptor signaling, remains poorly characterized. In this paper, we show that when ligated with TWEAK, endogenous FN14 recruits a cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2 complex that is subsequently degraded by a cathepsin-mediated lysosomal pathway. TWEAK/FN14 signaling results in both canonical and noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B activity. Noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B activity is most probably the result of relocalization of the cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2 complex to lysosomes and subsequent degradation. In cell lines that can be killed by TWEAK, NF-&#x003ba;B induces production of TNF&#x003b1; and simultaneously sensitizes tumor cells to TNF-R1&#x02013;induced death. Transformation of MEFs renders these cells significantly more sensitive to killing by TWEAK/TNF&#x003b1; than their nontransformed progenitors, but tumor cells that express high levels of cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2 are comparatively resistant to TWEAK/TNF&#x003b1; killing (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Model for TWEAK killing.</bold> TWEAK binding to FN14 induces the recruitment of a cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2 complex. This complex is then targeted for lysosomal degradation by the MVB pathway. The loss of cIAP1 or TRAF2 induces the stabilization of NIK and subsequent activation of noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B. The canonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway is also activated in response to TWEAK. Activation of NF-&#x003ba;B drives autocrine TNF&#x003b1; production in TWEAK-sensitive cell lines. The loss of cellular cIAP1 and TRAF2 by FN14 signaling prevents their recruitment to TNF-R1 upon autocrine TNF&#x003b1; binding, and this promotes the formation of a death-inducing complex and apoptotic signaling.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1820171f08"></graphic></fig><p>Our data demonstrate that tumor cell sensitivity to TWEAK correlates with their sensitivity to synthetic IAP antagonists and that the mechanism of tumor cell killing between this class of chemical compounds and naturally occurring ligand is remarkably similar. Synthetic IAP antagonists target cIAP1 and cIAP2 for complete proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaither et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Varfolomeev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vince et al., 2007</xref>), whereas TWEAK targets a proportion of the cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2 complex (presumably the proportion that can be recruited to FN14) for degradation in a lysosomal cathepsin-dependent manner. The end result is, however, the same, with activation of NF-&#x003ba;B. In sensitive tumor cell lines, activated NF-&#x003ba;B drives TNF&#x003b1; production that, in the absence of the cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2 complex, kills them. Likewise, both TWEAK and synthetic IAP antagonists sensitize tumor cells to exogenously added TNF&#x003b1; by depleting the cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2 complex.</p><p>TRAF2-mediated loss by CD40 stimulation requires an intact ubiquitylation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2002</xref>). Previous work has implicated cIAP1 in the ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of TRAF2 by TNF-R2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conze et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>), and cIAP2 can ubiquitylate and degrade TRAF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). In this context, it was completely unexpected that inhibition of the proteasome did not prevent TWEAK/FN14-mediated loss of cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2, although TRAF2 depletion required cIAP1 function. However, TWEAK/FN14-induced cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2 degradation was prevented by several different classes of inhibitors of lysosome proteases or function and could be specifically blocked by an inhibitor of the lysosome cysteine protease cathepsin B. Consistent with this observation, TWEAK mediated relocalization of TRAF2 to punctate vesicles that often overlapped with, and were in contact with, lysotracker-stained vesicles.</p><p>Given previous reports implicating the proteasome in TRAF2 degradation, it remains unclear whether other TNFSF ligands can also stimulate cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2 loss through lysosomal mechanisms. However, it has been demonstrated that CD30-induced TRAF2 degradation was blocked by nonproteasomal inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duckett and Thompson, 1997</xref>). It is likely that lysosomal degradation of the cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2 complex occurs by the well documented multivesicular body (MVB) pathway, whereby endocytosed cell surface material is further internalized to form endosomal MVBs, which subsequently fuse with lysosomes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Williams and Urb&#x000e9;, 2007</xref>). The finding that cIAP1 was required for TRAF2 degradation raises the possibility that cIAP1-mediated ubiquitylation of TRAF2/FN14 targets the FN14 complex to the MVB pathway, as has previously been demonstrated for ubiquitin-dependent MVB targeting of several cell surface receptors. Depletion of cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2 by TWEAK/FN14 is the most likely cause of noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B activation. Both cIAP1 and TRAF2 are required to inhibit noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B activation from TNF receptors, and genetic knockout of either component alone results in spontaneous noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B activity. Underlining the requirement for their concerted action, overexpression of either cIAP1 or TRAF2 alone does not affect FN14 signaling, but overexpression of both components is able to block TWEAK-induced NF-&#x003ba;B.</p><p>The NF-&#x003ba;B activity observed after FN14 signaling resulted in an increase in production of TNF&#x003b1; in TWEAK-sensitive cells but not in TWEAK-resistant cells. TWEAK-resistant cell lines were nevertheless sensitized to exogenously added TNF&#x003b1;, emphasizing that it is the production of autocrine TNF&#x003b1; that determines sensitivity of cells to TWEAK. This finding is consistent with previous observations that activation of TNF-R2, CD30, or CD40 can also induce TNF&#x003b1; and enhance TNF-R1 apoptotic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grell et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrated TWEAK binding and FN14 expression on both primary and tumor cells in culture. Surprisingly, however, primary nontransformed MEFs were insensitive to TWEAK/TNF&#x003b1;-induced death, whereas the same MEFs transformed by SV40 Large T were efficiently killed by this treatment. It is not clear why tumor cells show heightened sensitivity to TWEAK/TNF&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis, as TWEAK stimulation of primary MEFs still resulted in the loss of cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2 and NF-&#x003ba;B activation.</p><p>Not all tumor cell lines were sensitive to TWEAK/TNF&#x003b1; treatment. In particular, PIL2 liver progenitor oval cells that express much higher levels of cIAP1 and TRAF2 than PIL4 cells were resistant to TWEAK/TNF&#x003b1;-induced death. TWEAK stimulation of PIL4 cells resulted in the loss of cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2, and these cells were highly sensitive to TWEAK/TNF&#x003b1; killing. In contrast, the increased levels of cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2 in the tumorigenic PIL2 cells appeared to block FN14 signaling, as the cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2 complex was resistant to TWEAK-induced degradation and the cells were more resistant to TWEAK/TNF&#x003b1;-induced death. These results are also consistent with our findings that the overexpression of cIAP1 and TRAF2 is sufficient to block FN14-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activity.</p><p>The fact that the cIAP1-cIAP2 locus is amplified in some human tumors and a mouse model of liver cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zender et al., 2006</xref>) and that high levels of expression of cIAP1 have been observed in several cancers argues that increased cIAP1 can contribute to oncogenesis. Our results suggest that one possible mechanism by which it does this is by regulating the balance between life and death signaling from TNFSF receptors. Our findings provide further support for using IAP antagonists as tumor therapy and extend options by highlighting the fact that TWEAK is a physiological regulator of TNFSF signaling that targets the cIAP1&#x02013;TRAF2 complex rather than the IAPs alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines, transient transfections, antibodies, and protease inhibitor</title><p>SW480, K562, MCF7, BJAB, G401, ColoF, and NIH 3T3 cell lines were a gift from L.
