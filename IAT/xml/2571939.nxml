However, early relapses and the emergence of imatinib-resistant disease are problematic. Evidence suggests that imatinib and other inhibitors may not effectively eradicate leukemic stem/progenitor cells, and that combination therapy directed to complimentary targets may improve treatment. <italic>Abelson helper integration site</italic> 1 (<italic>Ahi-1)/AHI-1</italic> is a novel oncogene that is highly deregulated in CML stem/progenitor cells where levels of <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> transcripts are also elevated. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of <italic>Ahi-1/AHI-1</italic> in murine and human hematopoietic cells confer growth advantages in vitro and induce leukemia in vivo, enhancing effects of <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>. Conversely, RNAi-mediated suppression of <italic>AHI-1</italic> in <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>&#x02013;transduced lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> human cord blood cells and primary CML stem/progenitor cells reduces their growth autonomy in vitro. Interestingly, coexpression of <italic>Ahi-1</italic> in <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>&#x02013;inducible cells reverses growth deficiencies exhibited by <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> down-regulation and is associated with sustained phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and enhanced activation of JAK2&#x02013;STAT5. Moreover, we identified an AHI-1&#x02013;BCR-ABL&#x02013;JAK2 interaction complex and found that modulation of AHI-1 expression regulates phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and JAK2&#x02013;STAT5 in CML cells. Importantly, this complex mediates TKI response/resistance of CML stem/progenitor cells. These studies implicate <italic>AHI-1</italic> as a potential therapeutic target downstream of BCR-ABL in CML.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: Ahi-1, Abelson helper integration site 1; BFU-E, burst-forming-units-erythroid; CB, cord blood; CFC, colony-forming cell; CFU-GEMM, colony-forming units-granulocyte-erythrocyte-monocyte-megakaryocyte; CFU-GM, colony-forming units-granulocyte-macrophage; CML, chronic myeloid leukemia; co-IP, coimmunoprecipitation; Dox, doxycycline; DS, dasatinib; GF, growth factor; IM, imatinib mesylate; IRES, internal ribosomal entry site; LTC-IC, long-term culture-initiating cell; NL, nilotinib; Q-RT-PCR, quantitative real-time-PCR; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; SFM, serum-free medium; TKI, tyrosine kinase inhibitor.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal, multistep, multilineage myeloproliferative disorder. It is initiated and propagated by a rare population of CML stem cells that have acquired a <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> fusion gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). The <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> fusion gene encodes a chimeric oncoprotein that displays constitutively elevated tyrosine kinase activity that drives CML pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). These features deregulate cellular proliferation and apoptosis control through effects on multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including the Ras, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), JAK&#x02013;STAT, and NF-&#x003ba;B pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Recently, imatinib mesylate (IM), which is an inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>), has shown promise in treating CML patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). However, early relapses and IM-resistant disease have emerged as significant clinical problems in some IM-treated CML patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Relapses are frequently associated with mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), accounting for 60&#x02013;90% of relapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Dasatinib (DS) and nilotinib (NL) are more recently produced small molecule inhibitors of the BCR-ABL&#x02013;encoded kinase with greater potencies than IM and predicted broader effectiveness in patients with IM-resistant disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Recent studies have indicated that CML stem/progenitor cells in chronic phase patients are less responsive to IM and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and that they are a critical target population for IM resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). In addition, CML stem cells are genetically unstable and rapidly generate IM-resistant mutants in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Thus, it is critical to identify other therapies targeting CML stem/progenitor cells to prevent acquisition of resistance. There is also an emerging imperative to develop complementary therapies that target downstream molecular events in the CML stem/progenitor cells of those patients who fail to achieve lasting remission with current treatments.</p><p><italic>Abelson helper integration site 1</italic> (<italic>Ahi-1</italic>) is a novel gene that was identified by provirus insertional mutagenesis in v-abl&#x02013;induced mouse pre&#x02013;B cell lymphoma as a candidate cooperate oncogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Mouse <italic>Ahi-1</italic> encodes a unique protein with a SH3 domain, multiple SH3 binding sites, and a WD40-repeat domain, which are all known to be important mediators of protein&#x02013;protein interactions, suggesting that the normal Ahi-1 protein has novel signaling activities and that its deregulation could affect specific cellular signaling pathways. Interestingly, the conserved human homologue (<italic>AHI-1)</italic> has an additional coiled&#x02013;coil domain in its N-terminal region. Involvement of <italic>Ahi-1</italic> in leukemogenesis is suggested by the high frequency of <italic>Ahi-1</italic> mutations seen in certain virus-induced mouse leukemias and lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). We recently demonstrated that <italic>Ahi-1/AHI-1</italic> expression is regulated at multiple stages of hematopoiesis in a fashion that is highly conserved between mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). <italic>Ahi-1/AHI-1</italic> is expressed at its highest level in the most primitive hematopoietic cells and is rapidly down-regulated as cells begin to differentiate. Interestingly, marked deregulation of <italic>AHI-1</italic> expression is seen in several human leukemic cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), particularly in a CML cell line (K562) and in Philadelphia chromosome&#x02013;positive (Ph<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> BCR-ABL<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) primary leukemic cells, but not Ph<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells, especially in highly enriched leukemic stem cells from patients with CML. In addition, levels of <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> transcripts are highly elevated in the same CML stem cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), suggesting that it may be important to cooperative activities of AHI-1 and BCR-ABL to generate a permanently expanding clone of deregulated stem cells at the early stage of leukemia development.</p><p>In this study, biological and molecular functions of <italic>Ahi-1/AHI-1</italic> and its cooperative activities with <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> were extensively investigated in primitive mouse and human hematopoietic cells using several overexpression, suppression, and inducible model systems. We found that overexpression of <italic>Ahi-1</italic> alone in primitive hematopoietic cells confers a proliferative advantage in vitro and induces a lethal leukemia in vivo; these effects are enhanced by <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>. Stable suppression of <italic>AHI-1</italic> by small interfering RNA in <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>&#x02013;transduced primitive human cord blood (CB) cells and primitive leukemic cells from CML patients reduces their growth autonomy in vitro. The regulatory role of Ahi-1/AHI-1 in mediating BCR-ABL transforming activities can be further explained by demonstration of a direct physical interaction between AHI-1 and BCR-ABL at endogenous levels in CML cells. This is associated with JAK2 and results in modulation of sensitivity to TKIs and differing levels of BCR-ABL tyrosine phosphorylation and JAK2&#x02013;STAT5 activity in BCR-ABL<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CML cells where <italic>Ahi-1/AHI-1</italic> expression is either coexpressed or inhibited.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Overexpression of <italic>Ahi-1</italic> alone can transform IL-3&#x02013;dependent BaF3 cells in vitro and in vivo, and these effects can be enhanced by <italic>BCR-ABL</italic></title><p>To investigate the transforming potential of <italic>Ahi-1</italic> in hematopoietic cells, we cloned full-length <italic>Ahi-1</italic> cDNA into a MSCV-internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-YFP (MIY) vector and overexpressed it in an IL-3&#x02013;dependent cell line (BaF3). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis (Q-RT-PCR) showed that <italic>Ahi-1</italic> transcript levels were greatly increased in <italic>Ahi-1</italic>&#x02013;transduced BaF3 clonal cell lines compared with control cells (Fig. S1 A available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072316/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072316/DC1</ext-link>). <italic>Ahi-1</italic>&#x02013;transduced cells have increased proliferative activity in the presence of IL-3, and this effect was markedly enhanced when IL-3 was not added (3&#x02013;4-fold; P &#x0003c; 0.01; Fig. S1 C). <italic>Ahi-1</italic>&#x02013;transduced cells also had greater cell viability in the presence of a low concentration of IL-3 (2 ng/ml) compared with control cells (twofold; Fig. S1 D). Interestingly, overexpressing both <italic>Ahi-1</italic> and <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> in BaF3 cells further enhanced these perturbations, compared with cells transduced with either <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> or <italic>Ahi-1</italic> alone (1.5&#x02013;3.5-fold in the absence or presence of IL-3; P &#x0003c; 0.05; Fig. S1, C and D). Western blot analysis of protein from two individual clonal lines revealed that both protein expression and tyrosine kinase activity of p210<sup>BCR-ABL</sup> were highly increased in cells cotransduced with <italic>Ahi-1</italic> and <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>, compared with <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>&#x02013;transduced cells (Fig. S1 E). We also detected higher levels of Ahi-1 protein expression in the same dually transduced cells than in those transduced with Ahi-1 alone. More interestingly, endogenous Ahi-1 expression is increased in cells transduced with BCR-ABL alone compared with control cells with expression levels being similar to those detected in Ahi-1&#x02013;transduced BaF3 cells (Fig. S1 E).</p><p>To investigate effects of overexpression of <italic>Ahi-1</italic> on the ability of transduced cells to induce leukemias in vivo, we injected transduced cells into sublethally irradiated NOD/SCID&#x02013;&#x003b2;2 microglobulin (&#x003b2;2m)<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Strikingly, mice injected intravenously with <italic>Ahi-1</italic>&#x02013;transduced BaF3 cells had a lethal leukemia within 70 d (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/per mouse; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Disease latency was shortened to 40 d with <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>&#x02013;transduced cells alone. Leukemogenic activity was further increased by introduction of cotransduced <italic>Ahi-1</italic> and <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> cells, producing a latency of 26 d (P &#x0003c; 0.05; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Mice injected with either parental BaF3 cells or vector control cells had no evidence of disease after 120 d. Leukemic mice injected with either <italic>Ahi-1</italic> or <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>&#x02013;transduced cells developed splenomegaly and hepatomegaly, with 50&#x02013;90% of YFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/Ahi-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/BCR-ABL<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, or both YFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells detectable in these tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). As expected, larger spleens and livers were observed in mice injected with both <italic>Ahi-1</italic> and <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>&#x02013;transduced cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Interestingly, despite the apparently homogeneous pro&#x02013;B cell phenotype of BaF3 cells transplanted, the leukemias generated from <italic>Ahi-1</italic>&#x02013;transduced cells revealed multilineage features that included the production of Gr-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Mac-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (myeloid), Ter119<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (erythroid), B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (B-lineage), and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (T-lineage; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>), suggesting that overexpression of <italic>Ahi-1</italic> induces abnormal differentiation (including lineage switching) in hematopoietic cells. This was also observed in mice injected with <italic>Ahi-1</italic> and <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> cotransduced cells. In addition, YFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/Ahi-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/BCR-ABL<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells purified from BM cells of diseased mice showed increased proliferation and reduced apoptosis compared with control BaF3 cells; these effects were enhanced in Ahi-1&#x02013; and BCR-ABL&#x02013;cotransduced cells (Fig. S2 available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072316/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072316/DC1</ext-link>). Thus, overexpression of <italic>Ahi-1</italic> alone in IL-3&#x02013;dependent hematopoietic cells has strong transforming activity in vitro and in vivo, and this is additive with the effects of <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Overexpression of <italic>Ahi-1</italic> induces a lethal leukemia in vivo and these effects can be enhanced by cotransduction of BCR-ABL.</bold> (A) Survival curves of NOD/SCID-&#x003b2;2M<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice injected with 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> BaF3 cells transduced with MIY, <italic>Ahi-1</italic>, <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>, and <italic>Ahi-1 plus BCR-ABL</italic>. 8&#x02013;10 mice were used per each group.

This interaction was not found in a BCR-ABL<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cell line (Hut 78; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>, lane 2) or in control antibody coimmunoprecipitated K562 cells (not depicted). The result was confirmed by detection of AHI-1 in the same cells after IP with a specific antibody to ABL (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 D</xref>). Importantly, tyrosine phosphorylated p210<sup>BCR-ABL</sup> could be detected in K562 cells using an antiphosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) after IP with the AHI-1 antibody (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 E</xref>). Interestingly, this protein interaction complex is also associated with a 120-kD tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 E</xref>). To determine whether this 120-kD protein could be an AHI-1 isoform, the same membrane was washed and reprobed with an AHI-1 antibody. The full-length (150 kD) and a 100-kD isoform of AHI-1 protein (but not a 120-kD protein) were identified by Western blot analyses (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 F</xref>). Using co-IP, we examined several candidate 120-kD tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins known to interact with BCR-ABL, including CBL and JAK2. We determined that JAK2 was associated with this protein interaction complex, as AHI-1 could be detected by an anti&#x02013;AHI-1 antibody in K562 cells after IP with a specific antibody to JAK2 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 G</xref>); this interaction was further confirmed by reverse detection of JAK2 after IP with the anti-AHI-1 antibody (not depicted). In addition, the antigenic peptide derived from the sequence of AHI-1 specifically blocked the ability of the AHI-1 antibody to precipitate both tyrosine-phosphorylated BCR-ABL and the 120-kD protein, whereas an unrelated peptide had no effect (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 H</xref>, lane 3). Interestingly, this interaction complex was found to be modulated by tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL, as IM treatment (5 &#x003bc;M) of K562 cells for 6 h resulted in inability to detect both tyrosine-phosphorylated BCR-ABL and JAK2 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 H</xref>, lane 4). These results indicate that AHI-1 and BCR-ABL can interact and form a complex involving tyrosine-phosphorylated JAK2.</p></sec><sec><title>AHI-1 regulates response of BCR-ABL<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> primitive CML cells to TKIs</title><p>To determine whether AHI-1&#x02013;BCR-ABL&#x02013;JAK2 interaction complex may mediate IM sensitivity/resistance of BCR-ABL<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>&#x02013;transduced inducible BaF3 cells and cells cotransduced with <italic>Ahi-1</italic> were treated with various doses of IM (0&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;m).

Interestingly, phosphorylated BCR-ABL, JAK2, and STAT5 levels could be restored in the AHI-1/sh4 cells when AHI-1 construct was reintroduced into the same cells. Importantly, expression of AHI-1 not only modulates phosphorylation of BCR-ABL, JAK2, and STAT5 in BCR-ABL<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> K562 cells, but also regulates protein expression of these genes, as demonstrated by significantly enhanced expression of these proteins when <italic>AHI-1</italic> is overexpressed, reduced expression when <italic>AHI-1</italic> is suppressed, and restored expression in AHI-1&#x02013;suppressed cells where <italic>AHI-1</italic> expression has been rescued by introduction of an AHI-1 construct (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 D</xref>).

Collectively, these data suggest that <italic>AHI-1</italic> plays an important role in modulating sensitivity to IM and other selective BCR-ABL TKIs in <italic>BCR-ABL<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> CML cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that <italic>Ahi-1/AHI-1</italic> is a new oncogene that cooperates in transforming activities with <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> both in vitro and in vivo through a direct physical interaction. First, in a mouse system, overexpression of mouse <italic>Ahi-1</italic> confers a proliferative advantage in vitro to IL-3&#x02013;dependent BaF3 cells and a stem cell&#x02013;enriched Sca-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> population from 5-FU&#x02013;treated mouse BM cells, and induces a lethal leukemia in vivo. This deregulated proliferative activity, GF independence, and leukemogenic potential is enhanced by introduction of <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>. Thus, there is a direct biological correlation between <italic>Ahi-1</italic> and <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> in regulating transforming activity of these cells. Second, in a human system, <italic>AHI-1</italic> expression appears to regulate transforming activities of <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>&#x02013;transduced human CB stem/progenitor cells (lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), as indicated by their significantly reduced autonomous growth when endogenous <italic>AHI-1</italic> expression is stably inhibited. These effects were further demonstrated in CML patient samples; reduced autonomous growth was observed in primary CML stem/progenitor cells in all patient samples studied with knockdown of <italic>AHI-1</italic>. The effects were more significant in CML stem/progenitor cells from IM-resistant patients and blast crisis patients who expressed relatively higher levels of <italic>AHI-1</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>AHI-1</italic> expression in <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>&#x02013;transduced human CB cells not only inhibited all differentiated myeloid cells (CFU-GM and CFU-GEMM) but also significantly inhibited differentiating erythroid cells (BFU-E; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>) that are produced at a high frequency from <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>&#x02013;transduced CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> stem/progenitor cells independent of their apparent prior lineage commitment status caused by modulation of P210<sup>BCR-ABL</sup> activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed that overexpression of <italic>Ahi-1</italic> in pro&#x02013;B BaF3 cells altered their differentiation pattern in vivo (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>), suggesting that modulation of <italic>Ahi-1/AHI-1</italic> expression alters progenitor cell differentiation, including lineage switching, as previous reports have suggested for other oncogenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Third, a regulatory role of <italic>Ahi-1</italic> in <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>&#x02013;mediated transformation is evident as coexpression of <italic>Ahi-1</italic> in <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>&#x02013;inducible cells can reverse growth deficiencies induced by down-regulation of <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>. This biological effect is associated with sustained phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and enhanced activities of JAK2&#x02013;STAT5. Finally, an AHI-1&#x02013;BCR-ABL&#x02013;-JAK2 interaction complex has been identified in human CML cells. This complex mediates sensitivity/resistance of primitive CML stem/progenitor cells to TKIs, as demonstrated by either coexpression or inhibition of <italic>Ahi-1/AHI-1</italic> expression in <italic>BCR-ABL<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> CML cells with a resulting modulation of CML cell sensitivity to these inhibitors. Collectively, these findings provide strong evidence of the importance of persistent deregulated expression of <italic>Ahi-1/AHI-1</italic> to the sustained in vitro and in vivo transforming activities associated with CML and in the modulation of <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>-mediated malignant transformation and response of CML stem/progenitor cells to TKIs. This research has further identified <italic>Ahi-1/AHI-1</italic> as a novel modulator of <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> that is specifically involved in the JAK2&#x02013;STAT5 pathway.</p><p>Identification of an AHI-1&#x02013;BCR-ABL&#x02013;JAK2 interaction complex raises many interesting questions about the nature of the interaction, how it is regulated, and how it contributes to malignant transformation, altered BCR-ABL signaling, and IM response/resistance of CML stem/progenitor cells. Particularly notable is the observation that coexpression of <italic>Ahi-1</italic> in <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>&#x02013;inducible cells can rescue GF-independent cell growth that is inhibited by down-regulation of <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>. Interestingly, this renewed GF independence with introduction of <italic>Ahi-1</italic> appears to be regulated by sustained phosphorylation of BCR-ABL, rather than its continual expression, as these effects were observed in cotransduced cells where <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> expression was inducibly suppressed in vitro (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>). These results suggest that physical interaction between Ahi-1 and BCR-ABL may stabilize a protein&#x02013;protein interaction complex that enables constitutively active BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity and further alters specific downstream BCR-ABL signaling pathways that deregulate cellular proliferation and apoptosis control (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 B</xref>). This is further supported by identification of JAK2 as an associated protein in this interaction complex and observation of enhanced activity of the JAK2&#x02013;STAT5 pathway in <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>&#x02013;inducible cells with cotransduction of <italic>Ahi-1</italic> in the presence of GF stimulation with IL-3 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Interestingly, all these findings can be replicated significantly in a human CML cell line system in which changes in AHI-1 expression are found to modulate tyrosine phosphorylation and protein expression of BCR-ABL and JAK2&#x02013;STAT5 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 D</xref>). It is known that BCR-ABL signaling closely mimics signaling pathways of cytokine receptors and that both IL-3/GM-CSF receptor activation and the BCR-ABL oncoprotein can induce a tyrosine phosphorylation cascade of which numerous proteins, including JAK2 and STAT5, are common substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>&#x02013;expressing cells have many similarities to cells induced by IL-3 stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>) or cells with forced <italic>IL-3</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Early studies have shown that BCR-ABL can interact with the common &#x003b2; chain of IL-3/GM-CSF receptor and constitutively activate JAK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). In particular, increased phosphorylation of STAT5, which was previously thought to be an immediate function of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein, has now been shown in primary CML CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> progenitor cells to occur largely as a consequence of BCR-ABL&#x02013;induced activation of IL-3 autostimulation, leading to activation of STAT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). It has been reported that targeted disruption of the <italic>STAT5A</italic> and <italic>STAT5B</italic> genes reduces myeloid progenitor numbers, suggesting a nonredundant role for STAT5 in primitive normal hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Recent studies further suggest that autocrine production of GM-CSF may contribute to IM and NL-resistance in BCR-ABL<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> progenitors through activation of JAK2 and STAT5 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), and inhibition of <italic>STAT5</italic> expression by a shRNA approach significantly reduced colony formation of CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CML progenitor cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). In addition, JAK2 is known to interact with the C-terminal region of BCR-ABL, and recent studies further show that mouse hematopoietic cells transformed by the T315I mutant of <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> can be induced to undergo apoptosis by a JAK2 inhibitor (AG490) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that activation of the JAK2&#x02013;STAT5 pathway in CML stem/progenitors is likely to be an important mechanism contributing to responses to BCR-ABL&#x02013;targeted therapies and identification of Ahi-1/AHI-1 as a novel mediator involved in this pathway suggests AHI-1 alone or in combination with JAK2 and STAT5, as potential additional therapeutic targets.</p><p>The most revealing result presented here is the finding that expression of <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> was consistently associated with an up-regulation of endogenous <italic>Ahi-1/AHI-1</italic> transcripts and an increase in Ahi-1/AHI-1 protein expression in several overexpression and inducible experimental systems. Up-regulated <italic>AHI-1</italic> expression has been noted in K562 cells, a cell line derived from a patient with CML in blast crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). In particular, modulation of <italic>AHI-1</italic> expression in K562 cells regulates BCR-ABL and JAK2&#x02013;STAT5 activities, as described above. Importantly, <italic>AHI-1</italic> is highly deregulated in primary CML stem/progenitor cells where levels of <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> transcripts are also highly elevated, suggesting that deregulated expression of <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> and <italic>AHI-1</italic> may be clinically relevant to their cooperative activities that result in a permanently expanding clone of deregulated stem cells during leukemia development. Indeed, our study further demonstrates that highly elevated levels of <italic>AHI-1</italic> in CML stem/progenitor cells from IM nonresponders and blast crisis patients correlate with their relative resistance to TKIs. Similarly, a potential mechanism for a physical interaction between Ahi-1/AHI-1 and BCR-ABL is revealed based on their molecular structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>), which are compatible with specific protein&#x02013;protein interactions. Ahi-1 may interact with BCR-ABL through its SH3 domain or its SH3 binding sites (i.e., the SH3 domain of one protein interacting with the SH3 binding sites of the other) or through the SH2 domain of BCR-ABL if Ahi-1 is tyrosine phosphorylated (Ahi-1 contains two potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites). In addition, Ahi-1 may bind to a SH2-containing protein that is a substrate of BCR-ABL, thus forming a complex, as it is known that BCR-ABL is extensively tyrosine-phosphorylated, providing numerous, potential docking sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). Moreover, Ahi-1 may interact with multiple domains of BCR-ABL, as demonstrated by other BCR-ABL&#x02013;interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). Although more detailed structural mapping will be required to define specific protein&#x02013;protein interactions between Ahi-1 and BCR-ABL, in association with JAK2, our findings that coexpression of <italic>Ahi-1</italic> in <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>&#x02013;transduced cells can completely rescue IM-induced suppression of cell growth in the presence of IL-3 suggests that Ahi-1 may not be a direct substrate of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, but rather a modular protein that forms a stable protein interaction complex with other tyrosine phosphorylated proteins to mediate IL-3&#x02013;dependent BCR-ABL and JAK2&#x02013;STAT5 activities. In addition, this protein interaction complex seems to be disrupted by suppression of tyrosine phosphorylation of BCR-ABL by IM. Studies are underway to define how AHI-1 specifically interacts with BCR-ABL and JAK2. It was interesting to note that enhanced phosphorylation of Src was observed in <italic>Ahi-1</italic> coexpressed <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>&#x02013;inducible cells in the presence of IL-3 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>), suggesting that other kinases are also activated with stimulation of IL-3 when BCR-ABL and AHI-1 are coexpressed. This finding also explains the observation that CML progenitor cells with suppression of <italic>AHI-1</italic> experienced greater inhibition of CFC generation in response to dasatinib, a more potent TKI that also inhibits Src activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that Ahi-1/AHI-1 is a novel BCR-ABL interacting protein that is also physically associated with JAK2. This AHI-1&#x02013;BCR-ABL&#x02013;AK2 complex seems to modulate BCR-ABL&#x02013;transforming activity and TKI response/resistance of CML stem/progenitor cells through the IL-3&#x02013;dependent BCR-ABL and JAK2&#x02013;STAT5 pathway. These results suggest that a more promising potential therapeutic approach would be the combined suppression of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity, Ahi-1/AHI-1 expression, and JAK2&#x02013;STAT5 signaling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Retroviral and lentiviral vectors and virus production.</title><p>An MSCV-Ahi-1-IRES-YFP retroviral vector was constructed by ligating a 3.5-kb fragment containing full-length <italic>Ahi-1</italic> cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>) to the upstream IRES of the MIY vector.
