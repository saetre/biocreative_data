Here we demonstrate that HLA-DR alpha 2 domain (sHLA-DR&#x003b1;2) also induces negative signals by engaging TIRC7 on lymphocytes. This interaction inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in CD4&#x0002b; and CD8&#x0002b; T-cells via activation of the intrinsic pathway. Proliferation inhibition is associated with SHP-1 recruitment by TIRC7, decreased phosphorylation of STAT4, TCR-&#x003b6; chain &#x00026; ZAP70, and inhibition of IFN-&#x003b3; and FasL expression. HLA-DR&#x003b1;2 and TIRC7 co-localize at the APC-T cell interaction site. Triggering HLA-DR - TIRC7 pathway demonstrates that sHLA-DR&#x003b1;2 treatment inhibits proinflammatory-inflammatory cytokine expression in APC &#x00026; T cells after lipopolysaccaride (LPS) stimulation in vitro and induces apoptosis in vivo. These results suggest a novel antiproliferative role for HLA-DR mediated via TIRC7, revise the notion of an exclusive stimulatory interaction of HLA-DR with CD4&#x0002b; T cells and highlights a novel physiologically relevant regulatory pathway.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>TIRC7 (TCIRG1) is a seven transmembrane protein induced early after allo-activation of human lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001576-Utku1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001576-Kumamoto1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Cell surface expression profiles and results obtained from antibody blocking studies suggested that TIRC7 interacts with a ligand at the cell surface. Here we report that the HLA-DR alpha 2 domain is a ligand for TIRC7. HLA-DR molecule consists of an alpha and beta chain expressed on antigen presenting cells and activated T cells. Binding of HLA-DR to T cell receptor on CD4&#x0002b; T cells is known to initiate immune activation and accordingly HLA-DR molecules are considered to be immune stimulatory.</p><p>We extend this view by providing evidence for an important novel negative regulatory role of HLA-DR executed via binding with its non-polymorphic alpha 2 domain to TIRC7, a negative regulator of immune activation expressed on activated lymphocytes. Binding of HLA-DR alpha 2 to TIRC7 delivers antiproliferative signals to lymphocytes which is not solely restricted to CD4&#x0002b; cells. Induction of the HLA-DR alpha 2 - TIRC7 pathway leads to activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway resulting in apoptosis of CD4&#x0002b; and CD8&#x0002b; lymphocytes. The downregulatory mechanism of the immune response is associated with SHP-1 recruitment and include the inhibition IFN-&#x003b3; expression, phosphorylation of STAT4, TCR-&#x003b6; chain, ZAP70 and expression of FasL in T cells. Ligation of TIRC7 using soluble HLA-DR&#x003b1;2 (sHLA-DR&#x003b1;2) causes apoptosis in lymphocytes via activation of caspase 9 and 7. TIRC7 and HLA-DR are co-localized at the site of T cell - APC interaction. Accordingly, targeting of TIRC7 with sHLA-DR&#x003b1;2 controls proinflammatory cytokine release in APC and T cells in vitro. Physiological relevance of TIRC7 and HLA-DR &#x003b1;2 binding is shown in acute inflammatory setting in vivo after LPS. Treatment of mice with sHLA-DR&#x003b1;2 inhibits APC and T cell cytokine expression and induces apoptosis in vivo underlining the physiological importance of TIRC7-HLA-DR alpha 2 binding. Notably, the modulation of the HLA-DR alpha 2 - TIRC7 pathway in vivo allows to reduce significantly the inflammatory response and cytokine release induced by APC-T cell interaction during immune activation. Thus, our results demonstrate that binding of HLA-DR alpha 2 to TIRC7 at the APC-T cell interaction side provides negative signalling events during immune activation leading to downregulation of the immune response.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>TIRC7 protein binds to the alpha 2 domain of HLA-DR molecule</title><p>To investigate the ligand(s) interacting with TIRC7 we established a yeast two-hybrid screen using a cDNA library of allo-activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL).

The growth of combined clones on Histidine-negative agar plates indicate a specific interaction between the HLA-DR alpha 2 and TIRC7 extracellular domain whereas no interaction between HLA-DR alpha 2 to the C &#x02013; terminal or N- terminal domain of TIRC7 was observed.

Human PBL were activated with PHA for 48 h and co-cultured with either sHLA-DR&#x003b1;2 or control protein. Supernatants were subjected to quantitative sandwich ELISA. sHLA-DR&#x003b1;2 at a concentration of 50 &#x000b5;g/ml significantly inhibited the IFN-&#x003b3; expression of stimulated PBL, whereas control protein exhibited no significant effect. B. No inhibition of IL-10 expression was observed. The results shown represent the means of five independent experiments, respectively. C. Human PBL were allo-activated for 4 h in the presence of anti-TIRC7 mAb and subjected to Western blot analysis. Equal volume of cells were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylation status of STAT4 and STAT6 was determined by Western blot analysis. STAT4 phosphorylation was decreased in the presence of sHLA-DR&#x003b1;2 whereas pSTAT6 remained unchanged. No changes were observed using STAT4, and anti-Tubulin mAb. Shown is one representative experiment out of three independent experiments. D. Human PBL were isolated using standard Ficoll gradient centrifugation protocol. Cells were activated with PHA, anti-CD3/CD28 mAb, and MLR, respectively, and co-cultured with either sHLA-DR&#x003b1;2 or control protein in varying concentrations (50, 100, and 150 &#x000b5;g/ml). Cells were subjected to CFSE proliferation assays. A significant inhibition of proliferation was observed using sHLA-DR&#x003b1;2 in all proliferation assays whereas the control protein did not show any inhibition. The results shown represent the means of four independent experiments, respectively. E. The inhibition of proliferation of 48 h anti-CD3/CD28 stimulated human PBL by sHLA-DR&#x003b1;2 (100 &#x000b5;g/ml) was prevented by co-incubation of the anti-TIRC7 mAb 136 (100 &#x000b5;g/ml). F. Cell lysates were prepared from 1 h allo-activated PBL and immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-TIRC7 mAb and subjected to western blot analysis.

As determined by BrdU incorporation, incubation of lymphocytes with sHLA-DR&#x003b1;2 resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of proliferation in these proliferation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001576-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). To demonstrate the specificity of HLA-DR&#x003b1;2 binding to TIRC7 a displacement ELISA was performed using an anti-TIRC7 monoclonal antibody (mAb136) which was generated by immunization of mice with TIRC7 protein. This antibody binds specifically to TIRC7 and prevents binding between TIRC7 and HLA-DR as observed in Elisa assays (data not shown). The antiproliferative signals induced by binding of sHLA-DR&#x003b1;2 to TIRC7 in human lymphocytes were prevented by blocking the binding of sHLA-DR&#x003b1;2 to TIRC7 using mAb 136 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001576-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). The inhibitory effects induced by TIRC7 ligation could be mediated by the recruitment of the phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 which plays an important negative regulator role on lymphocyte signaling pathways for a variety of receptors involved in lymphocyte activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001576-Watanabe1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001576-Han1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. SHP-1 was shown to bind via the ITIM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif) motif to cell surface molecules with signaling capacity resulting in the down-regulation or termination of signal transduction events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001576-Hsu1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001576-Han1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The hypothesis that SHP-1 might be involved in TIRC7 signaling was based on the fact that an ITIM motif (VIYKWL, aa 371-377) was identified within the TIRC7 protein which would potentially allow for the recruitment of SHP-1. Using an anti-TIRC7 mAb, immune precipitation of lysates from allo-activated PBL revealed co-precipitation of TIRC7 and SHP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001576-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). Thus, the recruitment of SHP-1 by TIRC7 upon cell activation is a possible mechanism for the down-regulation of signaling events. SHP-1 was previously demonstrated to induce the dephosphorylation of ZAP70 causing an inhibition of proximal TCR-induced signaling events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001576-Brockdorff1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001576-Kovacs1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Indeed, the phosphorylation of TCR-&#x003b6; chain and ZAP70 were found to be decreased to a level similar to that of non-activated cells, whereas the expected phosphorylation was observed in activated lymphocytes not treated with sHLA-DR&#x003b1;2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001576-g002">Figure 2G</xref>).

The HLA-DR alpha 2 domain, which is highly conserved in humans, has not been heretofore recognized as a ligand for other molecules.</p><p>Several conclusions can be drawn from our work. The first novel aspect of the work presented here is the identification of the interaction between HLA-DR&#x003b1;2 and TIRC7, and the demonstration of functional relevance of this binding. Soluble HLA-DR&#x003b1;2 delivers distinct and selective signals via inhibition of IFN-&#x003b3;, but not IL10 response, strong inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. The inhibitory effect observed in the lymphocyte cultures is solely due to binding between HLA-DR alpha 2 and TIRC7 as the specific anti-TIRC7 mAb prevents the inhibition of immune activation.</p><p>The second novel aspect of our work relates to the finding that the HLA-DR protein, beyond its well-known role in initiating lymphocyte activation by presenting peptides to the TCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001576-g004">Figure 4F, left panel</xref>) is also able to induce negative signals via binding of its non-polymorphic alpha 2 domain to TIRC7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001576-g004">Figure 4F, left panel</xref>). This binding is not restricted to CD4&#x0002b; cells but also includes CD8&#x0002b; cells and B cells. The findings of dampening effects on cell activation provided by the HLA-DR protein and its binding to cell surface molecules other than CD4 and TCR substantially extends the understanding of the regulation of the immune activation process and the interactions involved. It is unclear whether the co-localization of both molecules at the site of cell interaction, as is shown in the present manuscript, may indicate also cis-acting ligation of TIRC7 and HLA-DR on the same cell and whether such interaction bears functional relevance. Our data, however, demonstrate unanimously that the trans-acting ligation between both molecules induces strong antiproliferative effects in various lymphocyte populations.</p><p>The third aspect of this work relates to the finding that the strong antiproliferative response triggered by TIRC7 ligation is induced on at least two levels of interference. On the one hand, the antiproliferative effect is induced by dephosphorylation of early signaling molecules such as TCR-&#x003b6; and ZAP70 which is associated with down-regulation of FasL. This result is in accordance with the fast upregulation of TIRC7 at the cell membrane upon lymphocyte activation and the clustering of the molecule at the cell &#x02013; cell adhesion site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001576-Bulwin1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> where the immunological synapse is formed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001576-Grakoui1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, TIRC7 mediates antiproliferative signals early in the activation process. On the other hand, the induction of apoptosis via caspase 9 indicates that the pro-apoptotic pathways include additional important mechanisms which are orchestrated, at least in part, by the TIRC7 engagement with HLA-DR alpha 2. In accordance with this FasL which is the extracellular receptor of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via caspase 8 was shown to be downregulated. After stimulation, in splenocytes obtained from TIRC7 deficient mice apoptosis was decreased in comparison to WT splenocytes (unpublished observation) indicating that TIRC7 is central to the induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes. These results also support the agonistic effect of the compounds used in this study on the TIRC7-HLA-DR&#x003b1;2 pathway.</p><p>The fourth aspect of our work relates to the observation that binding between HLA-DR&#x003b1;2 and TIRC7 is functional in T cells and APC. Crosslinking of TIRC7 with HLA-DR&#x003b1;2 in T cells and macrophages demonstrates that TIRC7-HLA-DR interaction mediated signals control the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-12 which naturally potentiates inflammation via the induction of IFN-&#x003b3; expression. The data obtained from the LPS induction in vivo demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory and apoptotic mode of action of sHLA-DR&#x003b1;2 is physiologically relevant. The reduction of cytokines such as IL-6, Rantes and IFN-&#x003b3; in cells obtained from mice treated with HLA-DR&#x003b1;2 indicates that TIRC7 targeting might be potentially translated into clinical use to prevent acute inflammatory response.</p><p>The clinical data and cytokine expression results obtained from acute inflammatory disease, LPS induction, in mice demonstrate that treatment with sHLA-DR&#x003b1;2 can control inflammatory conditions supporting the anti-inflammatory mode of action of the protein. Accordingly, a substitution of the signal to modulate TIRC7 pathway using sHLA-DR&#x003b1;2 might lead to a therapeutic approach unifying both, T cell and APC therapeutic targeting as TIRC7 is expressed in 30&#x00025; of all lymphocytes.</p><p>In summary, this work provides novel data for the interaction between HLA-DR alpha 2 and TIRC7 and the functional relevance of this binding in lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo after immune activation. For the first time, it is here reported that the HLA-DR molecule, which is classically described to initiate the cellular immune response also mediates inhibitory signals and apoptosis via binding to TIRC7 in lymphocytes, thereby modulating the decisive first phase of the immune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001576-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

The CFSE-labeled PBL were stimulated with PHA (1 &#x000b5;g/ml, Sigma) or anti-CD3/CD28 mAb (10 &#x000b5;g/ml) and incubated for 3 days at 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>, at 37&#x000b0;C in the presence of sHLA-DR &#x003b1;2 or control protein, respectively, at a concentration ranging between 50&#x02013;150 &#x000b5;g/ml. For alloactivation, mixed lymphocytes culture reaction was performed using donor cells which were inactivated and incubated with equal cell number of recipient lymphocytes (200.000 total cells/well) for 72 h at 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>, at 37&#x000b0;C. These cultures were incubated with either with sHLA-DR &#x003b1;2 or control protein at a concentration of 50 and 100 &#x000b5;g/ml. The proliferation rate of PBL was determined by FACS analysis. For proliferation assays, various human T- and B- cell lines were incubated for 48 h at 37&#x000b0;C, 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2,</sub> in the presence of chimeric anti-TIRC7 mAb or control mAb (50 &#x000b5;g/ml), labelled with 10 &#x000b5;l/well BrdU labelling solution and incubated for 16 h at 37&#x000b0;C. Cell Proliferation ELISA BrdU-Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) was used. The measurement of the samples was performed 10&#x02013;30 minutes after substrate addition at 370 nm (reference wavelength: 492 nm) in an ELISA reader. For detection of apoptosis detection, human PBL or cell lines were stained with 7-AAD for 20 minutes at RT. Samples were measured and analyzed by flow cytometry.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>ELISA cytokine analysis</title><p>PBL of human healthy donors isolated according to the Ficoll-Paque density centrifugation protocol were incubated with 1 &#x000b5;g/ml PHA (Sigma) in 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>, at 37&#x000b0;C for 48 h in the presence of sHLA-DR&#x003b1;2 and control protein, respectively. IFN-&#x003b3; or IL-10 was quantified in supernatants of PHA stimulated cells. Samples were run in triplicates on 96-well microtiter plates.
