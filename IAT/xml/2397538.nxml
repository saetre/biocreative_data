In accordance, TNK2 overexpression was shown to promote invasion of cancer cells &#x02013; but the mechanism by which TNK2 mediates these effects is unresolved. TNK2 was suggested to regulate Cdc42-driven migration by activation of breast cancer antioestrogen resistance 1 (BCAR1); however, distinct from this effect is evidence for a role of TNK2 in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) endocytosis and degradation. In the present study we sought to investigate whether negative targeting of TNK2 by siRNA could be used to inhibit cancer cell invasion, to establish the contribution of its effect on the EGFR and to consequently attempt to resolve the issue of TNK2's mechanism of action.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We used siRNA to knockdown expression of TNK2 and its proposed effector BCAR1 in order to analyse the effect of this knockdown on cancer cell behaviour <italic>in vitro</italic>. We examined morphological changes using phase-contrast microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Functional parameters examined included apoptosis, proliferation, migration and invasion. We also performed flow cytometry analysis to examine EGFR cell surface expression and carried out western blot to examine the total EGFR levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We observed that targeting of TNK2 by siRNA in breast cancer cells resulted in distinct morphological changes characterised by a stellate appearance and an absence of protrusions at membrane edges. These changes were not recapitulated upon siRNA targeting of BCAR1. We thus hypothesised that a component of the effects induced by TNK2 may be independent of BCAR1. Consistent with the idea of an alternative mechanism for TNK2, we observed that TNK2 associates with activated EGFR in breast cancer cells in a TNK2-kinase-independent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TNK2 functions to maintain EGFRs on the cell surface. We could demonstrate that the main functional effect of activating these surface EGFRs in breast cancer cells is stimulation of migration. In accordance, TNK2 silencing by siRNA led to a significant reduction in cell surface EGFR and to a concomitant decrease in the migratory and invasive capacity of breast cancer cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data suggest that TNK2 can enhance migration and invasion of breast cancer cells via preservation of EGFR expression, notwithstanding its previously reported signalling via BCAR1, explaining its oncogenic behaviour <italic>in vitro </italic>and correlation with metastatic human breast cancer <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in up to 20% of patients diagnosed with breast cancer and is associated with reduced survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The work on molecular profiling of invasive breast cancer has led to the identification of at least five distinct subtypes in which the most invasive and malignant type is entitled basal-like breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This molecular subtype is predominantly oestrogen receptor alpha-negative, progesterone receptor-negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative and EGFR-positive. The basal-like subtype is linked with poor clinical outcome and represents the most likely subgroup of breast tumours that could benefit from EGFR targeted therapy as they lack the other conventional receptor drug targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Similar to other receptor drug targets, however, clinical resistance to EGFR inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies is known to occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Developing alternative drug targets in the EGFR signalling pathway as means to treat EGFR-dependent invasive and metastatic breast cancer is therefore imperative.</p><p>Increased migration is a crucial component of increased invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. Key signalling molecules in the regulation of normal cell as well as cancer cell migration are the Rho GTPases, most notably Rho, Rac and Cdc42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Indeed, the acquisition of motile and invasive properties is a prerequisite to the development of a metastatic phenotype. These properties are dependent on the RhoGTPases, which are most widely recognised for their role in dynamic cytoskeletal remodelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. RhoGTPases control diverse downstream actions through distinct effector proteins. Transfection of T47D breast cancer cells with constitutively active Cdc42 has been shown recently to drive migration via the Cdc42-specific effector TNK2 (formally known as Ack1), which binds to activated cdc42 but not to Rho or Rac, and subsequent activation of breast cancer antioestrogen resistance 1 (BCAR1) (formally known as p130Cas) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. (Some confusion has arisen in the literature regarding the nomenclature and identity of Ack1 &#x02013; we herein refer to human Ack1 (NCBI Entrez GeneID 10188) as TNK2; it is not equivalent to Ack2, of which there is in fact no such human gene, but was originally the name of a bovine homologue of Ack1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].) TNK2 has also been suggested to function as an oncogene when overexpressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This hypothesis was supported by the finding that amplification of the TNK2 gene and mRNA, in primary tumours, correlates with poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Cdc42 has been linked previously with EGFR function. Cdc42 is proposed to function in a positive feedback loop with the EGFR whereby epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates activation of Cdc42 and its interaction with specific target proteins: Cdc42, in turn, inhibits EGFR degradation by preventing binding of c-Cbl to EGFR. This leads to aberrant accumulation of EGFR on the cell surface and subsequent malignant transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, TNK2 &#x02013; a downstream effector of Cdc42 &#x02013; can also be activated in response to EGF and interacts with EGFR via a previously characterised EGFR binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It has also been reported, however, that TNK2 regulates clathrin-mediated EGFR endocytosis and facilitates receptor degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. While Cdc42 maintains EGFR on the cell surface, therefore, TNK2 in contrast has paradoxically been reported to facilitate degradation, which is at odds with its potential role as an oncogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Importantly, no functional effects of the TNK2/EGFR interaction have been established in a cancer context to date &#x02013; and, more importantly, it is not known how aberrant expression of EGFRs often found in cancer cells affects this protein&#x02013;protein interaction.</p><p>In the present article we demonstrate the efficacy of targeting TNK2, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, by siRNA, and its effect on inhibiting EGFR cell surface expression and the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Significantly we found that silencing of BCAR1, a proposed downstream mediator of TNK2, inhibits breast cancer cell invasion via a mechanism distinct from the EGFR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 500 U/ml penicillin 500 &#x003bc;g/ml, and 2 mM L-glutamine.

To investigate the functional consequences of the observed TNK2/EGFR interaction, we wanted to examine how EGFR dynamics might be affected in cancer cells in which TNK2 had been silenced by siRNA treatment. In particular, we wanted to investigate the effect on cell surface EGFRs, as this population of receptors is responsible for initiation of signalling in response to extracellular ligands. Additionally, this cell surface population has not been examined in previous reports, which investigated only the total intracellular levels of EGFR. Accordingly, MDA-MB-231 cells were serum-starved overnight, incubated with 100 ng/ml EGF for up to 90 minutes and analysed by flow cytometry (FACS) to determine the relative number of cell surface EGFRs using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody.</p><p>Although there was little difference in the ability of the TNK2-silenced cells relative to nontargeting siRNA control cells (N) to internalise EGFR in response to ligand (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>; both values fall when exposed to EGF), we found that there was in fact a significantly reduced number of basal cell surface EGFRs (timepoint 0) in TNK2-silenced cells (S1) relative to nontargeting siRNA control cells (N) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). One caveat is that if we take the relative rates by defining the percentage of receptors lost over the 90 minutes, there appears to be a slightly slower rate of internalisation in the TNK2 siRNA-treated cells. This finding argues that increased internalisation may not be the mechanism that leads to decreased cell surface EGFR. Of course, the finding may also simply reflect the fact that, in these cells, a reduced cell surface population results in a reduced internalisation rate. The experiment was repeated four times and represents four separate transfections. On average, a 27% reduction of cell surface receptors can be seen at timepoint 0 (<italic>P </italic>= 0.0135) prior to any ligand stimulation. A representative western blot is shown illustrating siRNA downregulation of TNK2 (S1) relative to the control (N) over the course of the experiment.</p></sec><sec><title>EGFR activation enhances the migration of breast cancer cells with high and low EGFR expression</title><p>EGFR activation at the plasma membrane has been proposed to control or to contribute towards a multitude of cell processes in normal and cancerous cells, including proliferation and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Because of the effect of TNK2 siRNA on the cell surface EGFR population, we wanted to determine the effect of EGFR activation on breast cancer cell behaviour. Interestingly, we could demonstrate that addition of EGF to serum-starved cells (or nonstarved cells, data not shown) had no significant effect on the rate of proliferation over 72 hours as shown by an Alamar Blue proliferation assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). In contrast, we show that activation of EGFR in breast cancer cells significantly alters the motile properties of these cells. This was true of cells with high (MDA-MB-231) or low (MCF-7) relative levels of EGFR. MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were allowed to grow to a confluent monolayer, after which a scratch wound was made using a pipette tip. Migration was measured as the percentage area refilled over the time periods, as indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>.

We consequently investigated the migratory capacity of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells transfected with targeting siRNA (S1, S3) and nontargeting siRNA (N) using the scratch-wound migration assay.

A representative western blot is shown, illustrating relative total protein levels in the samples investigated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Initially, we observed that targeting of TNK2 by siRNA in human breast cancer cells resulted in distinct cytoskeletal and morphological changes, potentially indicative of changes in the motile properties of these cells. Such changes were not seen upon siRNA targeting of its proposed downstream effector BCAR1. This finding led us to hypothesise that the observed cytoskeletal effects induced by TNK2 must be independent of BCAR1. We subsequently observed that TNK2 associates with activated EGFR in breast cancer cells in a TNK2-kinase-independent manner, and furthermore that it functions to maintain EGFRs on the cell surface. We contend that this observation implies TNK2 may ordinarily function downstream of Cdc42 in the reported positive feedback loop whereby activated Cdc42 maintains cell surface EGFR expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This effect of Cdc42 on EGFR stability has been previously shown to contribute to enhanced cell migration by activated Cdc42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Our data now indicate that the same is true for TNK2, since the significant reduction of cell surface EGFRs we observed by TNK2 silencing was accompanied by a parallel decrease in the migratory capacity of the breast cancer cells. We also show that TNK2 siRNA has the same effect on invasion. In contrast, however, there is no affect of TNK2 siRNA on proliferation or apoptosis, which is in agreement with our findings that the main functional effect of EGFR activation in these breast cancer cells is stimulation of motility.</p><p>Previous studies claiming that TNK2 functions to promote degradation of EGFR appear to be at odds with the functional role of TNK2 <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>and with the results we now present. One important caveat, however, is that these previous studies examined total receptor expression in cleared cell lysates, which does not account for changes in the detergent insoluble cytoskeletal bound EGFR fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The cytoskeleton or actin-bound EGFR fraction is reported to comprise the type I, high-affinity EGFRs that are primarily responsible for induction of cellular responses to ligand stimulation at the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. As such, it is imperative that any study analysing changes in EGFR levels include the cytoskeletal-bound EGFR fraction. Our results show that the total EGFR content, including the detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction, is in fact slightly reduced with TNK2 siRNA treatment. The reduction of EGFR in the whole cell amounts to ~10%, whereas there is between 27% and 35% of cell surface receptors lost from the cell surface population. The percentage lost from the surface is higher than the average percentage lost from the whole cell, indicating that there is actually a selective reduction in cell surface EGFRs induced by TNK2 siRNA treatment and that the reduced cell surface receptor content is not solely as a result of increased EGFR degradation.</p><p>In the present study we have established that, even if constitutively active Cdc42 has not been introduced into the cells, TNK2 silencing alone is sufficient to both inhibit migration and to reduce the amount of EGFR on the cell surface. We also show here that BCAR1 siRNA silencing can function to inhibit invasion of breast cancer cells, even when the cells were not transfected with constitutively activated Cdc42 as was previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Importantly, however, we show that BCAR1 silencing does not effect EGFR basal cell surface expression, demonstrating a distinct and independent effect of TNK2. This confirms our hypothesis that TNK2 can operate separately from BCAR1 to facilitate migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Finally, these independent mechanisms and disparate effects can also explain the discrepancy in the morphological changes we observed following TNK2 and BCAR1 siRNA treatments. As EGFR activation can directly induce morphological changes via cytoskeleton remodelling, this supports our assertion that the morphological changes we see with TNK2 but not with BCAR1 siRNA treatment can be related to the ability to of TNK2 to affect the EGFR.</p><p>A prerequisite for classifying a molecule as a target for pharmacological intervention is demonstrating not only that it possesses oncogenic properties, but that abolition of its activity, by selective targeting, actually causes a positive anticancer effect that could be potentially useful in the treatment of disease. We have now established the potential of TNK2 in this regard by a siRNA-silencing approach. It is also of interest to note the effectiveness of TNK2 silencing in suppressing migration of not only cells that highly overexpress EGFR, such as MDA-MB-231 cells, but also those that do not overexpress EGFR but harbour functional EGFRs, such as the MCF-7 cells. While both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells expressed appreciable amounts of TNK2, MCF-7 cells are oestrogen-responsive breast cancer cells and have low levels of EGFR while MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells do not express oestrogen receptor alpha, progesterone receptor or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 but have very high levels of EGFR. Both cell lines, as we have shown, respond to EGFR activation by increased migration. MDA-MB-231 cells, however, are more reflective of the basal-like subtype of breast cancer as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Owing to the wide range of different tumour subcategories and levels of EGFR expression within basal-like tumours, it is significant that we can demonstrate here the effectiveness of silencing TNK2 even when the EGFR pathway is active but not hyperactivated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on our present findings we propose that TNK2 may employ at least two distinct mechanisms to enhance breast cancer cell migration and invasion, but we note that these are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> illustrates this proposition schematically. Furthermore, our findings suggest that TNK2 is potentially an attractive target for EGFR-dependent cancers or for cancers where the only available drugable receptor is the EGFR. There remains a need for alternative drug targets due to the unfortunate reality that the vast majority of cancers become resistant to conventional drug therapies.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Proposed role of TNK2 in invasion and metastasis</bold>. <bold>(a) </bold>We propose that the effects of TNK2 on cell migration and the cytoskeleton are mediated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).

Previous work showed Cdc42 functions in a positive feedback loop to maintain EGFR on the cell surface, and we suggest that TNK2 functions as part of this loop.
