One of the best studied &#x0002b;TIPs is EB1, which forms comet-like structures at the tips of growing microtubules. The molecular mechanisms by which EB1 recognizes and tracks growing microtubule ends are largely unknown. However, one clue is that EB1 can bind directly to a microtubule end in the absence of other proteins. Here we use an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay for dynamic microtubule growth with two-color total-internal-reflection-fluorescence imaging to investigate binding of mammalian EB1 to both stabilized and dynamic microtubules. We find that under conditions of microtubule growth, EB1 not only tip tracks, as previously shown, but also preferentially recognizes the GMPCPP microtubule lattice as opposed to the GDP lattice. The interaction of EB1 with the GMPCPP microtubule lattice depends on the E-hook of tubulin, as well as the amount of salt in solution. The ability to distinguish different nucleotide states of tubulin in microtubule lattice may contribute to the end-tracking mechanism of EB1.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microtubules are dynamic cytoskeletal polymers that play important roles in intracellular transport, mitosis and cell polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007585-Howard1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

The same studies show that the mechanism of EB1 tip-tracking most likely relies on the recognition of a structural feature at the microtubule end. However, the specifics of this structural feature are not known and several possibilities remain open.</p><p>One possible feature that EB1 might be recognizing at the plus end is the GTP cap. GTP-tubulin undergoes the process of GTP-hydrolysis as it becomes incorporated in the microtubule lattice, resulting in a GDP-tubulin lattice, which is more unstable than the GTP-tubulin lattice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007585-Howard1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007585-Desai1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Furthermore, using GMPCPP, a slowly hydrolyzable analogue of GTP, we find that EB1 preferentially binds GMPCPP- over GDP-tubulin lattice.

We do not attribute the absence of EB1 tip-tracking in GMPCPP tubulin to the low microtubule growth rate (and therefore small comet), since EB1 tip-tracking in GTP tubulin was observed at comparably low growth rates. This experiment also served as a control for the potential surface effects and effects of rhodamine-labeling, since it showed that EB1 bound equally well to the surface-bound rhodamine-labeled seeds as to the unlabeled non surface-bound extensions.</p><fig id="pone-0007585-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007585.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>EB1-GFP binds GMPCPP-tubulin in the seed and the extension.</title><p>Kymograph of EB1-GFP (50 nM) binding growing microtubule lattice (6 &#x000b5;M unlabeled tubulin with GMPCPP).

Specifically, EB1 binds more strongly to the GMPCPP microtubule lattice than to the GDP microtubule lattice. This ability to recognize the nucleotide state of tubulin in the lattice could play a role in the microtubule end-tracking mechanism of EB1, since the growing microtubule end is thought to maintain a GTP-tubulin cap (and GMPCPP is an analogue of GTP). Further support for such an end-recognition mechanism is our observation of no enhanced EB1 binding to microtubule ends growing in GMPCPP tubulin. This latter observation is consistent with a recent report that EB1-dependent CLIP170 microtubule end-tracking is not seen when GMPCPP tubulin is used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007585-Dixit1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, several observations suggest that EB1 may be recognizing the nucleotide state of the tubulin at the growing end of the microtubule.</p><p>Does EB1 also recognize a non-nucleotide dependent structure specific to the GTP-tubulin growing end? Such a possibility would explain our finding that increasing the amount of salt in solution suppresses GMPCPP lattice binding, while tip-tracking of growing GTP-tubulin ends is maintained. However, an alternative explanation for the preferential end-binding in GTP tubulin over GMPCPP-seed binding is that GMPCPP is not an exact analogue of GTP: EB1 might have a higher affinity for tubulin in the GTP or GDP-Pi state (at the growing end), compared to the GMPCPP state (in the seed). Thus, while our evidence supports a nucleotide-recognition mechanism, it does not rule out the possibility of an additional non-nucleotide-dependent mechanism.</p><p>It has recently been suggested that EB1 induces changes in the lattice structure of microtubules grown in its presence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007585-desGeorges1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, which could also provide a distinguishing feature between the microtubule seeds and extensions in our experiments. If this were the case, one would expect enhanced binding on the extensions rather than the seeds, because the extensions and not the seeds are grown in the presence of EB1. However, we never observed stronger binding on the extensions.</p><p>In addition to the effect of nucleotide state, we find that EB1 lattice binding also depends on the E-hook of tubulin. This is interesting because the GTP binding site on tubulin is concealed within the interdimer surface, whereas the E-hook is an unstructured peptide located on the outer surface of the microtubule. One possibility is that EB1 uses both the E-hook as well as the GTP dimer conformation to preferentially bind to the growing end of the microtubule. An alternative possibility is that the GTP-state of tubulin modulates the accessibility of the E-hook for EB1 binding.</p><p>We do not know how many microtubule-associated proteins recognize the nucleotide state of the microtubule. A previous study reported GTP-tubulin lattice as a preferred binding partner of the 10-protein Dam1 ring complex in budding yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007585-Westermann1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.
