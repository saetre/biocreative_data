In zebrafish, loss-of-function mutations in <italic>moe </italic>result in defects in brain ventricle formation, retinal pigmented epithelium and neural retinal development, pericardial edema, and tail curvature. In humans and mice, there are two major alternately spliced isoforms of the Moe orthologue, Erythrocyte Protein Band 4.1-Like 5 (Epb4.1l5), which we have named Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>and Epb4.1l5<sup>short</sup>, that differ after the FERM domain. Interestingly, Moe and both Epb4.1l5 isoforms have a putative C' terminal Type-I PDZ-Binding Domain (PBD). We previously showed that the N' terminal FERM domain in Moe directly mediates interactions with Crumbs proteins and Nagie oko (Nok) in zebrafish, but the function of the C'terminal half of Moe/Epb4.1l5 has not yet been examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To define functionally important domains in zebrafish Moe and murine Epb4.1l5, we tested whether injection of mRNAs encoding these proteins could rescue defects in zebrafish <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>embryos. Injection of either <italic>moe </italic>or <italic>epb4.1l5</italic><sup><italic>long </italic></sup>mRNA, but not <italic>epb4.1l5</italic><sup><italic>short </italic></sup>mRNA, could rescue <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>embryonic defects. We also tested whether mRNA encoding C' terminal truncations of Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>or chimeric constructs with reciprocal swaps of the isoform-specific PBDs could rescue <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>defects. We found that injection of the Epb4.1l5<sup>short </sup>chimera (Epb4.1l5<sup>short+long_PBD</sup>), containing the PBD from Epb4.1l5<sup>long</sup>, could rescue retinal and RPE defects in <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants, but not brain ventricle formation. Injection of the Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>chimera (Epb4.1l5<sup>long+short_PBD</sup>), containing the PBD from Epb4.1l5<sup>short</sup>, rescued retinal defects, and to a large extent rescued RPE integrity. The only construct that caused a dominant phenotype in wild-type embryos, was Epb4.1l5<sup>long+short_PBD</sup>, which caused brain ventricle defects and edema that were similar to those observed in <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants. Lastly, the morphology of rod photoreceptors in <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants where embryonic defects were rescued by <italic>moe </italic>or <italic>epb4.1l5</italic><sup><italic>long </italic></sup>mRNA injection is abnormal and their outer segments are larger than normal.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, the data reveal tissue specificity for the function of the PBD in Epb4.1l5<sup>long</sup>, and suggest that additional C' terminal sequences are important for zebrafish retinal development. Additionally, our data provide further evidence that Moe is a negative regulator of rod outer segment size.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The mechanisms underlying the acquisition and maintenance of apical cell polarity are beginning to be understood and the importance of cell polarity in development is now widely appreciated. Drosophila Crumbs (Crb) and vertebrate Crumbs orthologues are important determinants of apical polarity and are critical for epithelial morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The establishment of cell polarity within the developing retinal neuroepithelium is crucial for normal retinal development, as zebrafish with loss-of-function mutations in the polarity determinants <italic>aPKC&#x003bb;/heart and soul </italic>(<italic>has</italic>), <italic>pals1/mpp5/nagie oko </italic>(<italic>nok</italic>), <italic>crb2a/oko meduzy </italic>(<italic>ome</italic>), and <italic>mosaic eyes </italic>(<italic>moe</italic>), fail to properly form cell-specific laminae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In addition, ablation of <italic>aPKC&#x003bb; </italic>in differentiating photoreceptors in a conditional knockout mouse results in a loss of retinal lamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Crumbs proteins are also important for normal photoreceptor morphogenesis and zonula adherens/adherens junction formation and/or maintenance in Drosophila [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In humans, mutations in the <italic>CRUMBS HOMOLOGUE-1 </italic>(<italic>CRB1</italic>) gene cause retinal degeneration diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Mouse models lacking functional Crb1 exhibit a compromised outer limiting membrane (OLM) in the retina and defects in photoreceptor morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, data from our lab and others have implicated the Crumbs complex as a key regulator of apical membrane size in photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>moe </italic>mutant was discovered in a zebrafish mutagenesis screen, and the <italic>moe </italic>mutations affect retinal lamination, brain ventricle formation, and heart and body morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Orthologues have been identified in Drosophila (Yurt) and mammals (Erythrocyte Protein Band 4.1-Like 5, Epb4.1l5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

We and our colleagues have shown that Moe and Moe orthologues form a complex with Crumbs proteins that is mediated by the FERM domain, and this interaction is important for Crumbs protein function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The mouse mutant <italic>lulu </italic>has a null-allele mutation in <italic>epb4.1l5</italic>, and has defects in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cells at the primitive streak and abnormal neural plate morphology that is accompanied by defects in the actin-cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In this study we use a comparative genomic and proteomic approach to identify functionally important sequences within Moe and Epb4.1l5 by testing whether injection of mRNA encoding the long and short isoforms of Epb4.1l5 (Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>and Epb4.1l5<sup>short</sup>) can functionally substitute for <italic>moe </italic>function in zebrafish. We further investigate the role of Moe within different tissues by defining what Epb4.1l5 domains are necessary to rescue distinct <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>defects. Lastly, we report the histological and morphological consequences of losing Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>protein in the rescued zebrafish retina after the depletion of rescue construct.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Injection of <italic>moe </italic>mRNA rescues embryonic defects in <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants</title><p>We tested whether injecting <italic>moe </italic>mRNA into <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>embryos could rescue embryonic and early larval defects.

We examined whether injection of <italic>moe </italic>mRNA into <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants could rescue the apical localization of Crumbs proteins and ZO-1 in the retina and brain. In order to examine Crumbs proteins in zebrafish, we used an antibody we raised against the highly conserved C' terminal peptide and because this antibody recognizes all zebrafish Crumbs proteins by western blot (data not shown) we call this antibody a panCrb antibody. In wild-type embryos at 60 hpf, anti-panCrb and anti-ZO-1 labeling localize to the apical/ventricle surface in the brain, and the apical surface and the newly forming outer limiting membrane in the retina (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J, M, N</xref>).

An additional band migrates at 75 kDa, which is probably non-specific. Two bands are recognized by the affinity purified Epb4.1l5<sup>short </sup>antibody. A lower band migrates at the predicted molecular weight of 56 kDa and is present in brain, liver, lung, kidney, pancreas, and gut.

In <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants, very little Crb2a/b protein is detected in the area surrounding GFP<sup>+ </sup>rod photoreceptors, ZO-1 labeling is highly disorganized suggesting the OLM has not formed, and there is no spatial relationship between Crb2a/b and ZO-1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). In <italic>epb4.1l5</italic><sup><italic>long </italic></sup>mRNA injected <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants, Crb2a/b labeling is evident, but reduced compared to wild-type retinas, and like <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants, ZO-1 labeling is disorganized indicating the absence of the OLM, and we also observed no spatial relationship between Crb2a/b and ZO-1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>).</p><p>Although labeling of rods with anti-Rhodopsin antibodies in <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutant and <italic>epb4.1l5</italic><sup><italic>long </italic></sup>mRNA injected <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutant larvae suggest that outer segments form (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D, F, G, I</xref>), we wanted to determine whether these outer segments were normal ultrastructurally, in particular, whether disk morphology and packing is normal.

Our strategy was to use evolution, comparative genomics, and protein engineering to discover regions and sequences necessary for rescue of embryonic and early larval defects in <italic>moe </italic>deficient zebrafish. We first established that injection of wild-type <italic>moe </italic>mRNA into <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>embryos rescued all embryonic defects with the exception that mild pericardial edema persisted. In mammalian EST databases there are two major splice isoforms of Epb4.1l5, Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>that is 731 amino acids in length and is similar in length and shares sequence identity with Moe beyond the FERM domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and Epb4.1l5<sup>short </sup>that is 504 amino acids. These two isoforms are identical until amino acid 444 and interestingly both contain a predicted PDZ-binding domain at their C' terminus. We raised isoform-specific antibodies and examined expression of the two orthologues by western blot of different mouse tissues. Both antibodies recognized a protein of about 75 kDa in all tissues, which is likely to be non-specific reactivity. Anti-Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>recognized a protein of the expected molecular weight of about 100 kDa in eye, brain, heart, lung, kidney and testis; this expression profile agrees well with recently published immunohistochemical and mRNA expression (in situ hybridization) data in mammalian retinal, brain, and kidney tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Anti-Epb4.1l5<sup>short </sup>recognized protein of the expected molecular weight of about 56 kDa in brain, liver, lung, kidney, pancreas, spleen and gut. Not all tissues expressed both isoforms, for instance Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>but not Epb4.1l5<sup>short </sup>is found in the eye and Epb4.1l5<sup>short </sup>but not Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>is found in the gut, suggesting that the two isoforms may have non-overlapping functions.</p><p>We tested whether either of these Epb4.1l5 isoforms could functionally substitute for Moe during embryonic and early larval development. Injection of mRNA encoding Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>into <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants rescues <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutant defects and leads to the restoration of retinal lamination, RPE integrity, normal brain ventricle morphology, and the apical localization of Crumbs proteins and ZO-1 in the developing retina and brain, similar to injection of <italic>moe </italic>mRNA. Like injection of <italic>moe </italic>mRNA into <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants, mild pericardial edema persisted in these <italic>epb4.1l5</italic><sup><italic>long </italic></sup>mRNA injected <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants. We found that injection of <italic>epb4.1l5</italic><sup><italic>short </italic></sup>mRNA into <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants failed to rescue any phenotypic defects and also failed to relocalize Crumbs proteins and ZO-1 to the apical surface of the retina and brain. Interestingly, while exogenous Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>protein is cortically localized in neuroepithelial cells similar to endogenous Moe protein, Epb4.1l5<sup>short </sup>is localized cytoplasmically, suggesting that either the PBDs or sequences unique to Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>underlie Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>protein localization.</p><p>Although edema was reduced in <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants by injection of <italic>moe </italic>or <italic>epb4.1l5</italic><sup><italic>long </italic></sup>mRNA, it was never abolished by mRNA injection. We presume that the edema in <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants is caused by kidney dysfunction. There are several possible reasons for failure of mRNA injection to rescue kidney function. It is possible that Moe/Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>function is required for a longer period of time or perhaps continually in the kidney and protein from injected mRNA is not around long enough completely restore kidney function. A second possibility is that the Moe and Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>constructs we used lack the sequence(s) needed to rescue kidney function. If this is the case, then those specific sequence(s) do not seem to reside in Epb4.1l5<sup>short</sup>, since injection of <italic>epb4.1l5</italic><sup><italic>short </italic></sup>mRNA failed to rescue any pericardial edema, and the severity of edema was as severe as uninjected <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants. There are, however, many minor splice variants of Moe and Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>in the zebrafish and mammalian EST databases.</p><p>Because all the proteins so far identified that interact with Moe and Epb4.1l5 (also known as Ymo1) do so via the FERM domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], we tested whether expression of a Epb4.1l5 construct encoding the first 346 amino acids (Epb4.1l5<sup>FERM</sup>), which includes the FERM domain, could rescue apical Crumbs proteins and ZO-1 localization or any defects in <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants. This construct failed to rescue apical Crumbs protein and ZO-1 localization and any <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>defects, however, we could not detect Epb4.1l5<sup>FERM </sup>protein after 6 hpf, suggesting that this mRNA or protein is unstable. The same result was observed when the PDZ-binding domain in Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>was deleted (Epb4.1l5<sup>long_&#x00394;PBD</sup>); there was no phenotypic rescue in <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants and no apical Crumbs protein and ZO-1, and we did not detect Epb4.1l5<sup>long_&#x00394;PBD </sup>protein after 6 hpf. These observations suggest that the PDZ-binding domain might be important for stability of Moe/Epb4.1l5 protein.</p><p>PDZ domains are important mediators of protein interactions and have been shown to be important during the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We sought to identify the importance of the PDZ-binding domain in Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>by replacing it with the PDZ-domain from Epb4.1l5<sup>short </sup>to generate the chimeric protein Epb4.1l5<sup>long+short_PBD </sup>and by replacing the PDZ-domain in Epb4.1l5<sup>short </sup>with the PDZ-domain from Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>to generate the Epb4.1l5<sup>short+long_PBD </sup>chimera. We found that injection of <italic>epb4.1l5</italic><sup><italic>long+short_PBD </italic></sup>or <italic>epb4.1l5</italic><sup><italic>short+long_PBD</italic></sup> mRNA into <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants rescued apical localization of Crumbs proteins and ZO-1 in the retinal and brain neuroepithelium, RPE integrity (<italic>epb4.1l5</italic><sup><italic>long+short_PBD </italic></sup>almost complete rescue), and retinal lamination, but did not rescue brain ventricle morphology. Furthermore, injection of <italic>epb4.1l5</italic><sup><italic>long+short_PBD </italic></sup>mRNA into wild-type embryos caused a dominant negative phenotype-brain ventricles were small or failed to form. These observations have revealed important insights into the function of Moe/Epb4.1l5 and suggest that both the PDZ-binding domain of Moe/Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>and additional internal sequences in the C'terminal domain Moe/Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>(aa 444&#x02013;727) are important for the localization of ZO-1 and Crumbs proteins, RPE integrity and retinal lamination.</p><p>Several observations support the importance of both the PDZ-binding domain of Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>and internal sequences in Epb4.1l5<sup>long</sup>. The importance of the PDZ domain in Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>is shown by the experiment where injection into <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants of the chimeric construct <italic>epb4.1l5</italic><sup><italic>short+long_PBD</italic></sup>, in which the PDZ-binding domain of Epb4.1l5<sup>short </sup>is replaced by the PDZ-binding domain from Epb4.1l5<sup>long</sup>, rescues apical ZO-1 and panCrb, retinal lamination and RPE integrity, whereas, injection of <italic>epb4.1l5</italic><sup><italic>short </italic></sup>mRNA does not. This result suggests that there is some specificity between the PBD of Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>and the PBD of Epb4.1l5<sup>short</sup>. The importance of the internal sequence in Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>(aa 444&#x02013;727) is shown by the experiment where injection into <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants of the chimeric construct <italic>epb4.1l5</italic><sup><italic>long+short_PBD</italic></sup>, in which in which the PDZ-binding domain of Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>is replaced by the PDZ-binding domain from Epb4.1l5<sup>short</sup>, rescues apical ZO-1 and panCrb, retinal lamination and mostly RPE integrity, whereas, injection of <italic>epb4.1l5</italic><sup><italic>short </italic></sup>mRNA does not. Unexpectedly, injection of <italic>epb4.1l5</italic><sup><italic>long+short_PBD </italic></sup>mRNA into wild-type embryos caused a dominant phenotype that included brain ventricle defects and edema that are similar to those in <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants. One possibility is that Epb4.1l5<sup>long+short_PBD </sup>competes with endogenous Moe and takes a protein necessary for brain ventricle formation away from the Crumbs complex. Taken together, our experiments have suggested that Moe/Epb4.1l5 proteins are modular proteins and that the PDZ-binding domains have specificity in some tissues.</p><p>Moe and other cell polarity determinants, Crb2a/Ome, aPKC&#x003bb;, and Nok, are required for proper lamination of the zebrafish retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The time at which these proteins are needed for lamination has not been determined. Since we see very little Moe or Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>protein after 60 hpf, we suggest that early Moe or Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>function is sufficient to rescue retinal lamination and function. In <italic>moe </italic>or <italic>epb4.1l5</italic><sup><italic>long </italic></sup>injected <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants at 6 dpf, M&#x000fc;ller glial cell processes are properly oriented and span the thickness of the retina, and the retina has distinct nuclear layers. Furthermore, the vast majority of rod and double cone photoreceptors localize correctly to outer most portion of the retina to form an outer nuclear layer.</p><p>Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analysis of Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>rescued <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutant retinas, revealed that rescued rods form outer segments, but they were not always oriented with their outer segments toward the RPE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D-I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D-F</xref>). This may be a consequence of the failure of the rescued individuals to establish or maintain the OLM (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Despite the morphological defects of rods and cones in the <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants injected with <italic>epb4.1l5</italic><sup><italic>long </italic></sup>mRNA, many of these larvae are visually competent as tested by optokinetic response. Interestingly, our ultrastructural analysis revealed that <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>rods formed outer segments, complete with organized membranous discs, suggesting that mechanisms that dictate apical opsin transport and disc formation do not require <italic>moe </italic>function.</p><p>Previously, we showed that Moe function is required for the localization of Crb2a and ZO-1 protein at the apical surface of the developing retina in zebrafish embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We show here that in the wild type retina at 6 dpf, anti-panCrb labeling localizes just above the OLM in the subapical region. In <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>photoreceptors, anti-panCrb labeling is not detectible, and ZO-1 appears disorganized. When we examined photoreceptors in <italic>epb4.1l5</italic><sup><italic>long </italic></sup>mRNA rescued <italic>moe- </italic>mutants at 6 dpf, which is several days after detectable Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>protein, we observed that both ZO-1 and Crumbs proteins are present in the photoreceptor region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). The design of our rescue experiment allowed us to analyze the localization of Crumbs proteins and ZO-1 in rescued <italic>moe- </italic>photoreceptors several days after exogenous Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>was gone. In <italic>epb4.1l5</italic><sup><italic>long </italic></sup>mRNA injected <italic>moe- </italic>mutants, ZO-1 and panCrb labeling is not normal and mislocalized ectopic plagues of ZO-1 and panCrb labeling appears to be at the interface of photoreceptors, and/or photoreceptors and M&#x000fc;ller glia and there is no clear relationship between ZO-1 and anti-panCrb labeling. Thus, Epb4.1l5/More function is required to maintain, or establish, the OLM and the localization of Crumbs proteins relative to it.</p><p>We measured the size of rod outer segments in <italic>moe</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants that had been injected with <italic>epb4.1l5</italic><sup><italic>long </italic></sup>mRNA but that lack measurable Moe protein during photoreceptor morphogenesis, and found that these genetically <italic>moe</italic>-deficient rods were nearly twice the normal size (362 &#x003bc;m<sup>3 </sup>compared to wild-type outer segments 197 &#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup>). This observation is in agreement with previous data from our lab and others implicating Moe and the Drosophila orthologue, Yurt, as negative regulators of apical membrane size in photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We observed that in uninjected <italic>moe- </italic>mutants, rod outer segments are smaller than wild-types (90.9 &#x003bc;m<sup>3 </sup>compared to 362 &#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup>), this could be a consequence of the general ill health of <italic>moe </italic>mutants at 6 dpf, and/or the isolation of photoreceptors from factors secreted by the RPE and M&#x000fc;ller glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our strategy to use comparative genomics and protein engineering has revealed that the function of Moe/Epb4.1l5 protein is modular and that particular regions can be assigned particular functions. We also show that the C' terminal domain that encodes the PDZ-binding domain in Moe and Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>is important but not sufficient to confer full protein function to the FERM domain and that other sequences in Moe and Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>are important. The next challenge will be to identify the PDZ-containing protein that interacts with the PDZ-binding domain in Moe/Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>and the additional protein(s) that interact with the unique sequences in Epb4.1l5<sup>long</sup>. Although the role of the Crumbs complex in epithelial morphogenesis has been much studied, the molecular mechanism of the Crumbs complex function is still unknown. The identification of additional proteins that interact with Moe/Epb4.1l5<sup>long </sup>may help to determine the mechanistic function of the Crumbs complex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>AB wild-type strain and the <italic>moe</italic><sup><italic>b</italic>781 </sup>allele were maintained and staged as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].
