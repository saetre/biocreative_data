It is secreted in pulses, and its effects depend on pulse frequency, but decoding mechanisms are unknown. Here we have used (nuclear factor of activated T-cells 2 (NFAT2)-emerald fluorescent protein) to monitor GnRH signaling. Increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> causes calmodulin/calcineurin-dependent nuclear NFAT translocation, a response involving proteins (calmodulins and NFATs) that decode frequency in other systems. Using live cell imaging, pulsatile GnRH caused dose- and frequency-dependent increases in nuclear NFAT2-emerald fluorescent protein, and at low frequency, translocation simply tracked GnRH exposure (albeit with slower kinetics). At high frequency (30-min intervals), failure to return to basal conditions before repeat stimulation caused integrative tracking, illustrating how the relative dynamics of up- and downstream signals can increase efficiency of GnRH action. Mathematical modeling predicted desensitization of GnRH effects on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> and that desensitization would increase with dose, frequency, and receptor number, but no such desensitization was seen in HeLa and/or L&#x003b2;T2 cells possibly because pulsatile GnRH did not reduce receptor expression (measured by immunofluorescence). GnRH also caused dose- and frequency-dependent activation of &#x003b1;GSU, luteinizing hormone &#x003b2;, and follicle-stimulating hormone &#x003b2; luciferase reporters, effects that were blocked by calcineurin inhibition. Pulsatile GnRH also activated an NFAT-responsive luciferase reporter, but this response was directly related to cumulative pulse duration. This together with the lack of desensitization of translocation responses suggests that NFAT may mediate GnRH action but is not a genuine decoder of GnRH pulse frequency.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>2</sup></xref> acts via seven-transmembrane region receptors to stimulate the synthesis and secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and thereby mediates control of reproduction. It acts via type I GnRH receptors (GnRHR) to stimulate phospholipase C, activating protein kinases C, and mobilizing Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Consequent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and Ca<sup>2+</sup> effectors such as calmodulin mediates its effects on exocytotic gonadotropin secretion as well as its effects on expression of many genes including those for the gonadotropin subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). GnRH is secreted in brief pulses, with pulse frequency varying under different physiological conditions. For example, frequency varies over the menstrual cycle with pulses on average every 6 h in mid- to late-luteal phases and every 90 min during follicular and early luteal phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Frequency is higher in rats and mice with physiological pulse intervals of 8&#x02013;240 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). GnRH effects depend upon pulse frequency as illustrated by early studies showing that constant GnRH suppresses LH and FSH secretion, whereas restoration of GnRH pulses restores gonadotropin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Similarly, expression of genes encoding rodent LH&#x003b2;, FSH&#x003b2;, and the GnRHR are all increased more effectively at low or intermediate GnRH pulse frequency (pulses at 30&#x02013;120 min) than at high frequency (pulses at 8&#x02013;30 min) or with sustained stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11 B12">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Pulsatile stimulation with GnRH agonists is used to stimulate gonadotropin secretion, whereas sustained treatment ultimately reduces gonadotropin secretion, and this underlies agonist efficacy against steroid hormone-dependent cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Given its physiological and pharmacological relevance, there is much interest in the mechanisms by which gonadotrophs decode GnRH pulse frequency, and this provides a particularly attractive model for exploring pulsatile hormone signaling because of the unique structural and functional characteristics of GnRHR. Type I mammalian GnRHRs lack C-terminal tails, structures that are phosphorylated in many seven-transmembrane receptors to facilitate arrestin binding, arrestin-dependent desensitization, and arrestin-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Consequently, decoding of pulsatile signals can be explored in this system without the complications of rapid homologous receptor desensitization or G-protein-independent signaling.</p><p>Pulsatile signals are used in many biological systems. In the simplest situation a train of brief stimuli elicits a series of corresponding responses in a process known as digital tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). However, where downstream responses have slower inactivation kinetics, responses may not have returned to the basal level before repeat stimulation, and this can cause cumulative (or saw-tooth) responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). This process of integrative tracking can amplify signaling but cannot alone explain the bell-shaped frequency-response relationships seen in many systems. These require more complex systems involving positive or negative feedback or feed-forward circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>GnRHR-mediated activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin pathway can influence gonadotropin subunit gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), and mechanisms by which calmodulins interpret frequency-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). More recently, the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), a transcription factor activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent activation of the protein phosphatase calcineurin (which dephosphorylates NFAT), has been implicated in transcriptional regulation by GnRH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). This is of particular interest in light of the well established role of NFATs as frequency decoders in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33 B34">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) and the fact that NFATs often generate combinatorial signals with mitogen-activated protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), which also control gonadotropin transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>With regard to feedback mechanisms, it is known that type I mammalian GnRH do not desensitize, but agonists stimulate their internalization and thereby reduce cell surface GnRHR number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). GnRH also causes down-regulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) and increases expression of regulator of G-protein signaling-2 (RGS2) that can inhibit G<sub>q/11</sub> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Similarly, GnRH increases expression of a number of dual-specificity phosphatases including DUSP1 and DUSP4 (mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases 1 and 2), both of which dephosphorylate (and inactivate) ERKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Any of these processes could generate negative feedback loops reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling or ERK activity, thereby contributing to the frequency dependence of transcriptional regulation. Alternatively, it has been suggested that frequency decoding at the LH&#x003b2; promoter involves interplay between Egr-1 and a co-regulator (Nab-2). In this model low GnRH pulse frequency causes transient Egr-1 expression, driving expression of Nab-2, which inhibits LH&#x003b2; expression, but at high pulse frequency there is a more sustained increase in Egr-1, and this quenches Nab-2, increasing LH&#x003b2; transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). However, it is not clear whether this occurs <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Similar interplay between c-Fos and the co-regulator TGIF has been proposed to underlie preferential activation of the FSH&#x003b2; promoter at low GnRH pulse frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Here it is important to recognize that GnRH effects on gonadotropin secretion and gonadotropin subunit expression are both frequency-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11 B12">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and that frequency decoding mechanisms may well differ for these distinct GnRH effects. The upstream feedback mechanisms described above could underlie decoding for both exocytotic and transcriptional responses, whereas altered expression and/or activity of transcription factors could only directly influence transcriptional responses.</p><p>The models outlined above raise the fundamental question of whether feedback effects shaping cytoplasmic signals are actually pertinent to GnRH pulse frequency decoding. This in turn raises the concern that few studies have actually monitored GnRH signaling during pulsatile stimuli so that characteristics of signals passing from the cytoplasm to the transcriptome with pulsatile stimulation are largely unknown. Here we have used recombinant adenovirus (Ad) to express GnRHR and signaling reporters in HeLa and L&#x003b2;T2 cells. Using the nuclear translocation of NFAT2-EFP as a live cell readout for Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin/calcineurin activation, we have determined how its translocation is related to stimulus amplitude and frequency as well as GnRHR number. We have also used mathematical modeling to predict signaling and luciferase transcriptional reporters to monitor promoter activation in cells receiving pulsatile or sustained GnRH stimulation. We find that integrative tracking occurs with high frequency stimulation, but we find no evidence for desensitization of NFAT2-EFP responses during pulsatile stimulation. GnRH effects on an NFAT-responsive luciferase reporter were also dependent upon cumulative pulse duration, and together these data argue against a major role for negative feedback circuits in shaping frequency-response relationships through the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin/calcineurin pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Engineering of Plasmids and Viruses</title><p>Ad-expressing mouse (m) GnRHR were prepared, grown to high titer, and purified as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>).

When HeLa cells were transduced with NFAT2-EFP, the reporter was largely cytoplasmic in unstimulated cells, but GnRH caused a pronounced translocation to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.063917/DC1">supplemental Fig. 1</ext-link>). We quantified this effect using an automated imaging system to define NFAT2-EFP fluorescence intensity in the nucleus and cytoplasm and the N:C NFAT2-EFP ratio for each individual cell (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.063917/DC1">supplemental Fig. 1</ext-link>). As shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>), GnRH caused an increase in NFAT2-EFP N:C ratio that was dose-dependent (pEC<sub>50</sub> 8.4 &#x000b1; 0.1), slow in onset (maximal at 20&#x02013;40 min for the highest doses), and sustained (for at least 1 h). This effect was blocked by pretreatment with a GnRH antagonist (cetrorelix, 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup><sc>m</sc>) or by the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A (10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup><sc>m</sc>), and GnRH failed to cause NFAT2-EFP translocation in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore ionomycin (10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup><sc>m</sc>) also caused NFAT2-EFP translocation to the nucleus, and this effect was also blocked by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium or cyclosporin A but was not inhibited by cetrorelix. Accordingly, NFAT2-EFP translocation provides a readout for GnRHR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and consequent calcineurin activation but has slower onset and offset than GnRH effects on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>. We calculated signal:noise ratios which revealed NFAT2-EFP translocation as a relatively robust readout, whereas this ratio was much lower with the fluo-4 assays (not shown). We also observed a time-dependent reduction in whole cell fluo-4 fluorescence (even in control cells) that was suggestive of dye washout and prevented longer experiments (not shown).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Image-based readouts of GnRH-mediated calcium mobilization.</bold> HeLa cells were transduced with Ad-mGnRHR alone (<italic>panel A</italic>) or together with Ad-NFAT2-EFP (<italic>panels B</italic> and <italic>C</italic>). <italic>Panels A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>, cells were treated with fluo-4/AM (<italic>panel A</italic> only) and Hoechst stain before GnRH stimulation (from 0 min) at the indicated concentrations. <italic>Panel C</italic>, cells were pretreated with cetrorelix (<italic>Cetrx</italic>; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup><sc>m</sc>, 5 min), cyclosporin A (<italic>CyA</italic>; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup><sc>m</sc>, 15 min), or media replaced with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free physiological salt solution (5 min) before stimulation with GnRH (10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup><sc>m</sc>) or ionomycin (10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup><sc>m</sc>) for 20 min.

Here, the key issue is whether the responses observed are simply triggered by the initial GnRHR activation or are dependent upon ongoing GnRHR activation. We loaded cells with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive dye fura-2 and used a previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>) ratiometric imaging system to monitor the effects on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>.

In contrast, when cells were washed during the plateau phase (to remove GnRH), the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> declined to near basal values at 15 min. Accordingly, the wash was effective at removing GnRH, and as expected, the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> elevation was dependent on ongoing receptor activation. We also used a published mathematical model to estimate signaling parameters under these conditions. The model predicts a rapid increase in GnRHR occupancy, activation of an immediate effector (<italic>i.e.</italic> phospholipase C), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate concentration and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>, with maximal responses occurring within 2 min of stimulation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.063917/DC1">supplemental Fig. 3</ext-link>).

We next tested for dose- and frequency-dependent desensitization by monitoring NFAT2-EFP translocation in live cells receiving a train of 4 GnRH stimuli of 5 min duration and at 1-h intervals. As expected, GnRH caused a dose-dependent translocation of NFAT2-EFP to the nucleus (pEC<sub>50</sub> 8.7 &#x000b1; 0.2 to 9.3 &#x000b1; 0.2). These responses had comparable kinetics at all doses, increasing to maxima at 5&#x02013;15 min and reducing toward basal values over the next 45 min. Repeat stimulation with GnRH resulted in recurrent NFAT2-EFP translocation, with each pulse of GnRH causing a corresponding translocation response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). No desensitization was seen, as ANOVA revealed the GnRH dose (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) but not pulse number or pulse-dose interaction as a significant source of variation.

The responses were reproducible with repeat stimulation, and there was no evidence of desensitization during a train of four GnRH pulses.

Using this as a cutoff to define activated cells, we found that GnRH caused a dose-dependent increase in the proportion of cells in which NFAT2-EFP was activated and also caused a dose-dependent increase in the N:C ratio within these activated cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.063917/DC1">supplemental Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></ext-link>).

To test this we compared the effects of GnRH on N:C NFAT2-EFP ratio for individual cells receiving repeated pulses of GnRH.

Thus, although the response is extremely variable from cell to cell, there is considerable reproducibility over time within individual cells.

Accordingly, we sought to determine the effects of GnRHR number on the NFAT2-EFP translocation response. To do so HeLa cells were transduced with Ad mGnRHR at 0.3, 1, or 3 pfu/nl. In radioligand binding experiments (not shown) these titers gave cell surface expression of &#x0223c;40,000, 80,000, and 160,000 sites/cell and were selected to give low physiological, high physiological, and super-physiological levels of expression as compared with the physiological range (&#x0223c;20,000&#x02013;85,000 sites per cell) in rat gonadotroph and gonadotroph-derived cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>).

Intermittent treatment also dose-dependently increased NFAT-RE-Luc activity, but this was not statistically significant (most probably because of the high basal activity seen with pulsatile stimulation) so frequency dependence was assessed in cells transduced with NFAT2-EFP (as well as the mGnRHR and NFAT-RE-Luc).

It is secreted in brief pulses, with pulse frequency varying under different physiological conditions. GnRH effects on gonadotropin synthesis and secretion are dependent upon pulse frequency, and although this has clear physiological and pharmacological relevance, the molecular and cellular mechanism of frequency decoding by gonadotrophs is essentially unknown. To address this issue we considered it essential to monitor key aspects of GnRHR signaling during pulsatile and sustained stimulation. Accordingly, we have used an ERK2-green fluorescent protein translocation assay as a live cell readout for ERK activation<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4"><sup>3</sup></xref> and the NFAT2-EFP translocation assay as a downstream readout for cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (data herein). With this assay GnRH caused a robust translocation response, increasing both the proportion of cells with high levels of NFAT2-EFP in the nucleus and the N:C NFAT2-EFP ratio in those cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.063917/DC1">supplemental Figs. 1 and 2</ext-link>). Its effect was dose-dependent with a pEC<sub>50</sub> of 8.4, which is comparable to the pEC<sub>50</sub> of 8.5 for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> elevation as measured with fluo-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Its effect was blocked by a GnRH antagonist or by cyclosporin A and was mimicked by stimulation with a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), consistent with GnRH acting via its receptors to increase [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>, causing a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent activation of calcineurin that dephosphorylates cytoplasmic NFAT and thereby facilitates its translocation to the nucleus. We noted that the NFAT2-EFP translocation response was reversible (<italic>i.e.</italic> the response was more sustained with a constant GnRH stimulus than with a 5-min stimulus), although as expected for a downstream effector, the NFAT2-EFP translocation response was slower in onset and reversal than the effects of GnRH on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). These features are important as reversibility is expected for a frequency-decoding system, and the slow downstream response provides the possibility for integrative tracking.</p><p>A mathematical model has been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>) for GnRH effects on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> and LH secretion, and this predicts that pulsatile GnRH stimulation will elicit reproducible [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> responses at low frequency and dose but that desensitization will occur as dose and frequency are increased, approaching the pronounced desensitization seen with sustained stimulation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.063917/DC1">supplemental Fig. 4</ext-link>). However, when we used live cell imaging to monitor the effects of GnRH pulses (5-min pulses at 60-min intervals) on NFAT2-EFP in mGnRHR-expressing HeLa cells we saw clear dose-dependent translocation without desensitization (<italic>i.e.</italic> response amplitude and pEC<sub>50</sub> were comparable during the first and fourth pulse with GnRH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). We also saw no evidence for desensitization when pulse frequency was varied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), although pronounced integrative tracking was seen in cells stimulated every 30 min. The dose- and time-dependent desensitization of GnRH signaling anticipated from the mathematical modeling (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.063917/DC1">supplemental Fig. 4</ext-link>) is largely due to an assumed reduction in cell surface GnRHR number, so we tested for this by expressing mGnRHR with N-terminal (exofacial) HA tags in HeLa cells and using an imaging assay that quantifies cell surface HA-GnRHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). This revealed that although sustained GnRH (10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup><sc>m</sc>) stimulation caused a pronounced down-regulation of cell surface GnRHR, no such reduction was seen with a 5-min stimulation. Accordingly, the lack of dose- or frequency-dependent desensitization of the NFAT2-EFP translocation response could simply reflect the absence of GnRHR down-regulation. An alternative concern is that the absence of desensitization could be due to the use of a heterologous expression system so we performed similar experiments activating GnRHR in L&#x003b2;T2 cells transduced with Ad NFAT2-EFP. The results obtained were remarkably similar (in terms of dose dependence and kinetics) to those in HeLa cells (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) with no evidence for dose- or frequency-dependent desensitization but clear integrative tracking at the highest pulse frequency in both models. L&#x003b2;T2 are gonadotroph-lineage cells that express endogenous mGnRHR as well as all three gonadotropin subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). Importantly, GnRHR-mediated effects on transcription of numerous endogenous genes has been found to be dependent upon pulse frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), and bell-shaped frequency-response curves are seen for GnRH effects on LH&#x003b2;-, FSH&#x003b2;-, and GnRH-Luc reporters in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Thus, we see no evidence for negative feedback regulation of the NFAT-EFP translocation response in a relatively mature gonadotroph model where GnRH frequency decoding is well established.</p><p>We also explored the possible relationship between receptor number and NFAT2-EFP translocation response because mathematical modeling predicts greater desensitization for responses to pulsatile GnRH at higher receptor numbers (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.063917/DC1">supplemental Fig. 5</ext-link>) and because the effects of GnRH on gonadotropin subunit promoter activity have been shown to be related to receptor number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). When Ad titer was varied to set the GnRHR number to low, high, or super-physiological levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>), GnRH-stimulated NFAT2-EFP translocation increased as the receptor number increased, but the responses to hourly GnRH pulses were qualitatively similar at all receptor densities. Importantly, no desensitization was observed (comparing the first and last pulse) with either dose (10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> or 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup><sc>m</sc>) or at any receptor expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Again, it is possible that the discrepancy between the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>) and the mathematical model predictions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.063917/DC1">supplemental Fig. 5</ext-link>) reflects the absence of GnRHR down-regulation with 5 min of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>We also used a number of luciferase reporters to monitor GnRH effects on transcription. As expected, we found that sustained stimulation (8 h) with GnRH caused robust dose-dependent increases in activity of &#x003b1;GSU-Luc, LH&#x003b2;-Luc, and FSH&#x003b2;-Luc and also increased NFAT-RE-Luc activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Similar dose-dependent stimulation was seen with pulsatile GnRH (5-min pulses at hourly intervals for 8 h) but for each reporter basal activity was greatly increased (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figs. 7</xref><italic>A</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref><italic>A</italic>). This increase in basal luciferase activity may well be due to the mechanical stimulation (the repeated stimulation and washing) with the pulsatile protocols because more robust responses were observed when superfusion systems were used to activate similar gonadotropin subunit reporters with GnRH pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Nevertheless, we were able to use our static culture system to test for pulse frequency dependence of GnRH effects, and this revealed maximal activation of LH&#x003b2;-Luc and FSH&#x003b2;-Luc at 60- or 120-min intervals, as compared with maximum activation of &#x003b1;GSU-Luc and NFAT-RE-Luc at the highest pulse frequency (30-min intervals). Thus, GnRH exerts frequency-dependent and reporter-specific effects on transcription in this model, and frequency decoding of GnRH effects on transcription are clearly not restricted to gonadotrophs or gonadotroph-lineage cell lines. We also found that cyclosporin A inhibited the effects of GnRH on the &#x003b1;GSU-Luc, FSH&#x003b2;-Luc, and LH&#x003b2;-Luc reporters irrespective of whether sustained or pulsatile stimulation was used. This is consistent with a possible role for NFAT in mediating the GnRH effects on these promoters, although it is important to recognize that calcineurins target proteins other than NFAT so the roles of NFATs in GnRH signaling remain to be explored in detail.</p><p>The saw-tooth NFAT2-EFP translocation response seen with high frequency GnRH stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) illustrates how integrative tracking can amplify signaling. Assuming that the transcriptional effect of NFAT2 is related to the integral of nuclear NFAT2 (<italic>i.e.</italic> to the areas under the curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), transcription would be activated as effectively with 5-min pulses at 30-min intervals as it is with continuous stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>C</italic>). <italic>In vivo</italic> a small number of neurons (hundreds) release GnRH into the hypothalamo-pituitary portal circulation from which it is rapidly cleared, so continuous GnRHR stimulation would require continuous secretion. Extrapolation of our data to the <italic>in vivo</italic> system suggests that this effector could be maximally activated, with pulsatile secretion increasing biological efficiency of the system (as compared with continuous secretion for continuous activation).</p><p>Although integrative tracking can increase the efficiency of signaling (as above), frequency decoding requires involvement of feedback or feed-forward pathways. A number of potential feedback mechanisms have been identified (<italic>e.g.</italic> down-regulation of cell surface GnRHR or intracellular inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors and induction of RGS-2) that could underlie GnRH frequency decoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), but these would all be expected to influence the GnRH effects on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> and thereby influence its effects on NFAT2-EFP translocation. The fact that we have not seen any evidence for desensitization of the NFAT2-EFP translocation response under any of the experimental conditions used in HeLa or L&#x003b2;T2 cells clearly argues against a role for NFATs in GnRH frequency decoding despite the fact that NFATs clearly do act as a frequency decoder in other systems.</p><p>In exploring frequency decoding it is important to distinguish between dependence upon pulse duration and frequency. Where increasing frequency increases responses, this could reflect either the increased cumulative pulse duration or the reduced interpulse interval. True frequency decoders sense interpulse intervals independently of cumulative pulse duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) as illustrated by the GnRH effects on rodent LH&#x003b2; and FSH&#x003b2; expression, both of which are increased more effectively at low or intermediate (30&#x02013;120 min) pulse frequency than at high (8&#x02013;30 min) frequency or with sustained stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11 B12">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In this regard it is important that NFAT-RE-Luc activity increased as GnRH pulse frequency increased and that the responses were directly proportional to cumulative GnRH pulse duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>B</italic>). These data, therefore, reinforce the conclusion that NFATs (and their upstream activators) do not act as genuine GnRH pulse frequency decoders in this model. The alternative possibilities are that frequency decoding occurs within other signaling pathways (such as the ERK cascade) and/or that it occurs downstream of these pathways. The latter possibility is implicit in models where differential regulation of FSH&#x003b2; and LH&#x003b2; expression is attributed to the interplay of transcription factors and coactivators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Moreover, a recent study has showed how DUSP effects on ERK activation could underlie frequency decoding with pulsatile GnRH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). This is consistent with our own data as this mechanism could generate frequency decoding without negative upstream adaptive responses (<italic>i.e.</italic> GnRHR down-regulation or RGS activation) that would also affect Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin/calineurin/NFAT signaling.</p><p>In summary, we show that NFAT2-EFP translocation provides a robust readout for GnRHR-mediated and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation of calmodulin/calcineurin signaling and that the GnRH effect on NFAT2-EFP location is reversible but is slower in onset and offset than the underlying change in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>. Pulsatile GnRH causes dose- and frequency-dependent NFAT2-EFP translocation, and at low pulse frequency NFAT2-EFP translocation effectively tracks GnRHR occupancy. In contrast, integrative tracking is seen at high GnRH frequency (pulses every 30 min), illustrating how the relative dynamics of upstream and downstream signals can increase efficiency of GnRH action. Mathematical modeling predicted desensitization of GnRHR-mediated effects on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> and that such desensitization would increase with dose, pulse frequency, and receptor number, but no such desensitization was seen in HeLa or L&#x003b2;T2 cells, possibly because pulsatile GnRH did not reduce cell surface GnRHR expression. GnRHR activation also caused dose- and pulse frequency-dependent activation of &#x003b1;GSU, LH&#x003b2;, and FSH&#x003b2; luciferase reporters, and each of these responses was prevented by cyclosporin A, indicating dependence upon the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin/calcineurin pathway. Pulsatile GnRH also activated an NFAT-responsive luciferase reporter, but in this case the response was directly related to cumulative pulse duration. This together with the fact that we saw no desensitization of the NFAT2-EFP translocation responses argues that although NFATs may mediate GnRH action, they are not genuine decoders of GnRH pulse frequency.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by Wellcome Trust Grants 084588 and 078407 (to C.
