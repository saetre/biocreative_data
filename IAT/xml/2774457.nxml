This immune deviation is termed anterior chamber-associated immune deviation (ACAID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. It is characterized by impaired Ag-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), expanded clones of precursor cytotoxic T cells, and elevated serum levels of noncomplement-fixing Abs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. During the induction of ACAID, intraocular antigen-presenting cells capture the antigen placed in the eye and carry it to the marginal zone of the spleen. In the presence of thymus-derived natural killer T cells and marginal zone B cells, a microenvironment capable of activating antigen-specific T cells to differentiate into regulatory cells is created in the spleen. A number of studies have demonstrated that there are two distinct populations of regulatory T cells (Tregs) involved in the suppression of DTH responses in ACAID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. One population comprises CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which block the induction or afferent component of the immune response. Another population consists of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which inhibit the expression of DTH through previously sensitized T cells.</p><p>The crucial role of Tregs in the maintenance of immune tolerance and in the control of autoimmunity has been intensively investigated during the last decades. Up to now, several markers, such as CD25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>], GITR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>], CTLA-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>], and LAG-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>], have been used to define Tregs. However, they are also associated with the activation of T cells. Foxp3, a kind of forkhead transcription factor encoded by the X chromosome, has been considered a specific marker of Treg lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. It is not upregulated in recently activated CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>-</sup> T cells. Mice with a deficiency in Foxp3 show a rapid, fatal lymphoproliferative autoimmune syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. Ectopic expression of Foxp3 can confer suppressor activity on some nonregulatory T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. Since the great majority of Foxp3-expressing cells are CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>], most studies have addressed the role of CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs in immune tolerance. More recently, the role of CD8<sup>+</sup> Tregs during immune tolerance has also been emphasized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. Increasing evidence has indicated that CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells can express Foxp3 in both humans and rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. The expression of Foxp3 on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during ACAID is not well known and was, therefore, the subject of our study. Here we show that splenic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from ACAID mice express Foxp3 after polyclonal and specific antigen stimulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>Specific pathogen-free female C57BL/6 (B6; H-2<sup>b</sup>), 6-8-week-old mice were purchased from the animal facility at the Sun Yat-Sen University, P.R.

The numbers of mice used in the various experiments are described below.</p></sec><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>OVA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany) and dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) containing heat-killed <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> strain H37Ra was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Phycoerythrin-Cy5.5 (PE-Cy5.5)-conjugated antimouse CD8a (clone 5H10) was purchased from Caltag Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). FITC-conjugated antimouse F4/80 antigen (clone CI:A3) was purchased from Serotec (Oxford, UK).</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment of mice</title><p>ACAID was induced as described previously using microinjection of antigen into the AC of the eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. Briefly, mice were anesthetized and 5 &#x003bc;l OVA (20 mg/ml) was injected into the AC by a glass micropipette with a sterile infant feeding tube mounted onto a 0.1 ml Hamilton (Hamilton, Reno, NV) syringe. Mice receiving an AC-injection of PBS served as a control (PBS-AC-injected mice). Primed mice received a subcutaneous (SC) injection of 250 &#x003bc;g of OVA in PBS. To induce a DTH response, we gave the mice soluble antigen emulsified 1:1 in CFA. Each animal received a total volume of 200 &#x003bc;l antigen in CFA.</p></sec><sec><title>Impaired Ag-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity assay</title><p>The ear-swelling response was measured to indicate DTH response to OVA as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>].

In these experiments, primed mice served as positive controls and untreated mice served as negative controls. OVA (400 &#x003bc;g) in 20 &#x003bc;l PBS was injected SC into the right ear pinnae. The left ear pinnae received 20 &#x003bc;l sterile PBS alone. Both ears were measured 24 h later, and the difference in thickness was used as a measurement of DTH. Results were expressed as follows: specific ear swelling (24 h measurement-0 h measurement) of the right ear (24 h measurement-0 h measurement) of the left ear. Five mice were used for each group through one experiment and the experiment was repeated twice.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of peritoneal exudate cells</title><p>Peritoneal exudates cells (PECs) were harvested from C57BL/6 mice that had received 2.5 ml of thioglycolate (Sigma-Aldrich) intraperitoneally three days earlier. As described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>], the recovered cells were washed and resuspended, placed in 24-well culture plates (1x10<sup>6</sup> cells/well), and incubated in complete RPMI 1640 medium at 37 &#x000b0;C in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After overnight culture, plates were washed three times with culture medium to remove nonadherent cells. Adherent cells were retained in the wells and used as antigen-presenting cells in subsequent experiments. To test the purity of the adherent cells through FCM, we harvested these cells after incubation on ice for 1 h and then gently removed them with a cell-lifter. More than 90% of the adherent cells were identified as being F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell isolation and culture</title><p>Fourteen days after AC injection, single cell suspensions of splenocytes were prepared by passing cells through a sterile wire mesh. Red blood cells in spleens were lysed with Tris-NH<sub>4</sub>Cl or removed through density gradient centrifugation. In some experiments, the total splenocyte population was cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium with stimulation of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAb or with OVA for 36 h and used for FCM analysis of Foxp3 expression. These splenocytes were cultured in a density of 2x10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in 24-well culture plates. The volume was 1 ml for each well. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were isolated from splenocytes, using magnetic separation columns (MiniMACS, MS columns; Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After positive selection, the purity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was &#x0003e;95% according to subsequent FCM analysis. The purified CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were then cultured in 24-well culture plates (2x10<sup>6</sup> cells/well) containing isolated PECs with 200 &#x003bc;g/ml of OVA at 37 &#x000b0;C in complete RPMI 1640 medium for 36 h and used for RT-PCR analysis of Foxp3 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Local adoptive transfer assay</title><p>A local adoptive transfer (LAT) assay was developed to test suppressor cells during ACAID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. Putative suppressor cells consisting of purified CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were separated from splenocytes of AC-injected mice. Immune cells were collected from splenocytes of primed mice. Both suppressor cells and immune cells were harvested on day 14 after injection and were suspended at 5x10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml in 10 mg/ml OVA in PBS. The immune and suppressor cells populations were then mixed 1:1 in the presence of antigen (10 mg/ml). Both ears of na&#x000ef;ve C57BL/6 mice were measured with an engineer's micrometer immediately before challenge. The right ear pinnae of na&#x000ef;ve C57BL/6 mice were injected with 20 &#x003bc;l (1x10<sup>6</sup> cells) of the mixed-cell population. The left ear pinnae were injected with 10 mg/ml of OVA in PBS (negative control). Ear swelling was measured 24 h later to evaluate DTH. Na&#x000ef;ve T cells from nonmanipulated mice were used as immune cells and purified CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from these mice were used as suppressor cells for negative controls. Primed T cells were used as immune cells, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were purified from nonmanipulated mice and used as suppressor cells for positive controls. In one experiment, two ACAID mice and three normal mice were used to generate putative suppressor cells, and one primed mouse was used to generate immune cells. Five na&#x000ef;ve mice were used for measuring the ear-swelling response for each group in one experiment.

Briefly, 1x10<sup>6</sup> cells were first stained with FITC-CD3e mAb and Pecy5.5-CD8a mAb at 4 &#x000b0;C for 30 min, then fixed and permeabilized using fixation/permeabilization buffer at 4 &#x000b0;C for 2 h. Cells were washed in permeabilization buffer and then incubated with Fc blocker for 15 min. The cells were not washed prior to being incubated with APC-Foxp3 at 4 &#x000b0;C for another 30 min. After washing, the cells were resuspended and subjected to FCM. Cells stained with APC-conjugated rat IgG2a served as isotype controls. In vitro, the cells stimulated with BSA served as irrelevant antigen controls. Four mice were used for each group in one experiment.

The expression of Foxp3 protein in the splenic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in ACAID was increased after stimulation with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 mAb or specific antigen in vitro. The Foxp3 mRNA was also upregulated in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in ACAID after polyclonal stimulation. These results suggest that expression of Foxp3 may be a property of efferent CD8<sup>+</sup> Tregs in ACAID.</p><p>It has been shown that CD8<sup>+</sup> Tregs are necessary for inhibiting the expression of DTH in ACAID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. However, the phenotype of this population remains unclear. For the purpose of studying the phenotype of these Tregs, we first investigated the frequency of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the spleen. Our study revealed that the frequency of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was increased significantly in the spleen of ACAID mice. This result is consistent not only with expanded clones of precursor cytotoxic T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>], one feature of ACAID, but also with the findings presented by McKenna and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. They found that injection of soluble antigen into the AC of the eye induced expansion of antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. A further study using a LAT assay was performed to determine the suppressive property of this population. The result showed that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the spleen of ACAID mice could inhibit the ear swelling of na&#x000ef;ve mice produced by primed T cells. This result indicated that efferent suppressor cells were present in the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell population residing in the spleen of ACAID mice.</p><p>Since Foxp3 has been generally considered to be a specific marker for Tregs both in rodents and humans in spite of CD4 or CD8 lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>], a study was performed to examine the expression of Foxp3 in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells at both the mRNA level and protein level during ACAID. The results showed that an upregulated expression of Foxp3 in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells could only be shown at both the mRNA level and protein level when cells were stimulated using polyclonal activation. These results suggest that a subset of CD8<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells were induced in the ACAID mice and that these T cells were detectable only after stimulation. It was interesting to note that the expression of Foxp3 was up-regulated at the protein level, but not at mRNA level, after specific (OVA) stimulation. A significantly higher expression of Foxp3 protein was also observed with polyclonal stimulation than with specific stimulation. The reasons for a discrepancy between mRNA expression and protein expression after specific stimulation are not fully understood. One explanation is that posttranscriptional control mechanisms may be important for Foxp3 protein expression. This discrepancy was also found in a study by Fontenot et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>], who demonstrated that Foxp3 protein expression, but not Foxp3 mRNA expression, was increased following an in vitro activation of naturally existing CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> Tregs. It is also possible that the findings reflect a difference in sensitivity of the Foxp3 protein versus the mRNA signal. The aforementioned result also suggested that polyclonal stimulation was stronger than specific antigen stimulation in promoting the expression of Foxp3 in both ACAID mice and normal mice using FCM. This result was consistent with the findings by Fontenot et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. They found the expression of Foxp3 to be associated with the strength of TCR signals during thymic selection.</p><p>In order to exclude the influence produced by AC-injection, we performed a study using mice receiving an AC-injection of PBS as a control. The result showed that there was no difference between stimulated and unstimulated PBS-AC-injected control mice and normal mice concerning the expression of Foxp3 in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. This finding suggests that the increased expression of Foxp3 in ACAID is an intrinsic feature of this type of immune tolerance and not a concomitant phenomenon merely induced by AC-injection.</p><p>It is interesting to note that the frequency of CD8<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells in ACAID mice was only about 2% even after polyclonal stimulation. This is contrary to a much higher frequency of Foxp3 in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> Tregs in ACAID mice (up to 90% in a study in our laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>]). The wild-type mice used in this study may have affected the lower frequency. In these wild-type mice, the great majority of Foxp3-expressing cells are CD4<sup>+</sup>, but not CD8<sup>+</sup>, T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. A previous study from our laboratory found that the frequency of CD8<sup>+</sup> cells specific to OVA in wild-type mice was very low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. In "OVA T cell receptor" transgenic mice, the frequency of CD8<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells can be expected to be much higher. Sasaki and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>] found that the expression of Foxp3 was almost 88% in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from such transgenic mice when these T cells were exposed to TGF-&#x003b2;2-treated OVA-pulsed APC in vitro.</p><p>Foxp3 expression in CD8+ T cells has also been reported in another immune tolerance model in lupus-prone mice. Hahn et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>] injected artificial peptide intravenously into these mice and found induction of Foxp3-expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Functional studies showed that these CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells suppressed anti-DNA IgG production both in vitro and in vivo. These results, together with ours, suggested that the increased expression of Foxp3 in CD8<sup>+</sup> Tregs may play a role in the expression of immune tolerance induced either via the AC of the eye or the intravenous route.</p><p>Our study has revealed an increased expression of Foxp3 in the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in ACAID mice. To play a role in the inhibition of the DTH response one would expect these cells to express IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2;. Since the population of these cells is low in ACAID mice, it is currently not yet possible to assay the production of these cytokines. Further resolution of this issue awaits the development of more sensitive techniques. Alternatively, TCR transgenic mice, which have been shown to have numerous CD8<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells, may be suitable for the aforementioned cytokine analysis. A direct role for CD8<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T in the induction of ACAID has not yet been proven by the data presented by our study. At present we have not succeeded in isolating sufficient numbers of CD8<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells. Other techniques, such as the use of SiRNA for Foxp3, may be used in future experiments to block the function of these cells and definitely prove their role in ACAID.</p><p>There are at least two functionally distinct types of Tregs involved in the development of ACAID. They exert a suppressive function during different phases of ACAID. The afferent regulatory cells are CD4<sup>+</sup>, and the efferent regulatory cells are CD8<sup>+</sup>. A recent study by Keino et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>] showed the expression of Foxp3 in the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> ACAID Tregs. We confirmed these findings and moreover showed that the frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells was higher in ACAID mice than in normal mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>]. However, the exact mechanisms whereby CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells mediate ACAID have however not yet been clarified. Since both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing Foxp3 play a role in ACAID, it is interesting to find out which Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cell population is indispensable or whether both populations are needed for the development of ACAID.</p><p>In conclusion, our study revealed an inhibitory effect of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells on the expression of the DTH response and an increased expression of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in an OVA-induced ACAID model. These results suggest that CD8<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells may play a role in the development of ACAID. However, the exact role of this subpopulation of cells in ACAID requires further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Professor Changyou Wu for his constructive suggestions.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Streilein</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Immune regulation and the eye: a dangerous compromise.</article-title><source>FASEB J</source><year>1987</year><volume>1</volume><fpage>199</fpage><lpage>208</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2957263</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="r2"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Streilein</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name><name><surname>Ksander</surname><given-names>BR</given-names></name><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>AW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Immune deviation in relation to ocular immune privilege.</article-title><source>J Immunol</source><year>1997</year><volume>158</volume><fpage>3557</fpage><lpage>60</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9103414</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="r3"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Streilein</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name><name><surname>Masli</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Takeuchi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Kezuka</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The eye's view of antigen presentation.</article-title><source>Hum Immunol</source><year>2002</year><volume>63</volume><fpage>435</fpage><lpage>43</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12039518</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="r4"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wilbanks</surname><given-names>GA</given-names></name><name><surname>Streilein</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Characterization of suppressor cells in anterior chamber-associated immune deviation (ACAID) induced by soluble antigen.
