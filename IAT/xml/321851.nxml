These putative insertions, each about 1000 bp in length, mapped near a repetitive element. To determine the precise position of these alleged insertions, their target sites, and the nature of their boundaries, we cloned and sequenced the appropriate regions of both chromosomes. One of the two segments is not an insertion but rather a region between two independently integrated L1 repetitive elements (LINEs) (2), one in Hbbd and the other in the Hbbs chromosome. The other segment is an insertion of 940 bp which is located within the L1 element in the Hbbd chromosome. This insert is unusual in that it exists in only one copy in the BALB/c genome.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0086.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5085"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0087.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5086"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5087"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0089.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5088"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0090.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5089"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0091.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5090"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0092.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5091"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0093.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5092"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5093"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
