P63 loss of function drastically prevents ectodermal cells to commit to the K5/K14-positive stratified epithelial pathway while gain of function experiments show that &#x00394;Np63 allows this commitment. Interestingly, other epithelial cell fates are not affected, allowing the production of K5/K18-positive epithelial cells. Therefore, our results demonstrate that &#x00394;Np63 may be dispensable for some epithelial differentiation, but is necessary for the commitment of ES cells into K5/K14-positive squamous stratified epithelial cells.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>During embryonic development, the body surface is first covered by a single layer of basal epithelial cells. As development proceeds, this primitive epithelium switches on a differentiation program leading to stratification: the ectodermal cytokeratins K8/K18-positive cells of the primitive epithelium are replaced by basal epidermal K5/K14-positive cells, and progressively, several layers of suprabasal differentiated cells appear offering an efficient resistance against environmental stress. In the adult skin epidermis, the stratified squamous epithelium maintains a basal layer of proliferating cells that gives rise to multiple layers of terminally differentiating cells that continually reach the body surface from where they are shed. Epidermal stem cells located interfollicularly and within the bulge region of the hair follicles retain a self-renewing capacity, critical to preserve the tissue integrity during the life of the organism. The molecular mechanisms inducing the stratification program and those regulating the self-renewing process still remain to be clearly defined.</p><p>The p63 transcription factor, a homologue of the tumour suppressor gene p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Yang1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, is characterized by six different isoforms under the control of two distinct promoters and three different alternative splicings leading to the production of &#x00394;N- or TA-p63, and alpha, beta or gamma isoforms, respectively. Recently p63 has been implicated in both the development and the maintenance of stratified epithelia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Mills1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Yang3">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In loss-of-function models generated by two different groups, mice lacking p63 have been shown to be severely compromised in their ability to generate an epidermis, many other stratified epithelia as well as the limbs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Mills1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Yang2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent reports convincingly demonstrated the implication of p63 in epithelial stem cell renewal potential, as the absence of p63 was shown to induce a loss of proliferative potential of epidermal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Pellegrini1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Senoo1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, corneal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-DiIorio1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> or thymic epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Senoo1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Candi1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, experiments to complement the absence of p63 during development were designed by crossing p63-null mice with transgenic mice expressing different isoforms of p63 under the control of a K5-promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Candi2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Those mice expressing TAp63 and &#x00394;Np63 developed patches of epidermal differentiated cells, but the overall rescue of the epidermal phenotype remained partial, suggesting an earlier role of p63 during epidermal morphogenesis, before the K5-promoter is activated. Accordingly, Koster et. al showed that the exogenous expression of p63 in single-layered lung K8/K18-positive epithelial cells was able to initiate a stratification program, with formation of K14-positive cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Koster1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that p63 is required for the initiation of epidermal stratification, a process mediated in part by the direct induction of AP-2&#x003b3; expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Koster2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the precise role of p63 in the morphogenesis of epidermal cells remains to be defined.</p><p>Embryonic stem (ES) cells, derived from blastocyst-stage early mammalian embryos, are pluripotent and can initiate lineage-specific differentiation programs of many tissues and cell types <italic>in vitro</italic>. ES cells are thus an effective tool in recapitulating <italic>in vitro</italic> the main steps of embryonic development. We have recently reported the efficient derivation of ectodermal and K5/K14-positive epidermal cells from murine ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Coraux1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and clarified the molecular mechanism of BMP-4 in the neuroectodermal fate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Gambaro1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study, we show that the &#x00394;Np63 isoform is expressed soon after BMP-4 treatment, along with the simultaneous expression of direct or indirect p63-target genes associated with epidermal morphogenesis. Furthermore, p63 knockdown drastically inhibits the progression of ES cells along the pluristratified epithelial fate, while de novo expression of p63 is compulsory for pluristratified epithelial commitment once the ectodermal stage has been reached. Finally, ectopic expression of &#x00394;Np63 in ES-derived ectodermal cells is able to induce their commiment. Therefore, our results demonstrate that &#x00394;Np63 is absolutely necessary at the ectodermal stage for the proper commitment of ES cells into K5/K14-positive epithelial cells, and therefore suggest that &#x00394;Np63 function is required for the embryonic development of pluristratified squamous epithelia.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>&#x00394;Np63 is expressed during epithelial differentiation of mouse ES cells</title><p>We have previously established a cellular model that recapitulates <italic>in vitro</italic>, the main steps of embryonic neuroectodermal fate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003441.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).

Transcription of the K18, K14 and K5 genes was induced after BMP-4 treatment (days 5 and 8). Following serum addition (day 14), K18 gene expression was reduced while transcription of K5 and K14 genes were enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003441-g001">Fig. 1-C, panel a</xref>).

In the presence of BMP-4, nuclear-stained &#x00394;Np63-positive cells became detectable among K18-positive ectodermal cells by immunofluorescence staining at day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003441-g002">Fig. 2-C</xref>).

Finally, we were not able to detect TAp63-positive cells using a specific antibody, confirming the absence of TAp63 transcripts (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>&#x00394;Np63 expression is required for the commitment of mouse ES cells into keratinocytes</title><p>To evaluate whether &#x00394;Np63 was required for stratified epithelial commitment, stable ES cell clones that express a small hairpin (sh) RNA inhibiting p63 expression were produced. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003441-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, two independent ES cell clones (sh-p63-cl1 and sh-p63-cl2) displayed, by Western-blot analysis, a strong inhibition of exogenously expressed &#x00394;Np63, which was not observed with the sh-control clone. Upon differentiation with BMP-4 and serum, the sh-p63 clones produced, at day 14, a number of ectodermal K18-positive cells similar to the wild type control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003441.s003">Fig. S3-A, B</xref>). It confirmed that the ectodermal differentiation of ES cells was independent of the expression of &#x00394;Np63. However, while large patches of K14-positive cells were observed within the sh-control clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003441-g003">Fig. 3-B</xref>), very few isolated K14-positive cells were detected with sh-p63-cl1 and sh-p63-cl2 clones at day 14. Analysis by FACS confirmed that the absence of &#x00394;Np63 resulted in a strong reduction of K14 and K5-expressing cells at day 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003441-g003">Fig. 3-C</xref>). At the transcriptional level, we further confirmed the strong inhibition of the K14 mRNA level in differentiating sh-p63-ES clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003441-g003">Fig. 3-D</xref>). Accordingly, lama3 gene expression, as well as terminal differentiation markers such as K1, K10, involucrin and filaggrin were completely repressed when p63 was knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003441-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). The two other genes encoding for laminin-5 (lamb3 and lamc2) were repressed as well in sh-p63 ES cells (data not shown). Interestingly, while K14 expression was drastically reduced, the expression of K5 mRNA was not modulated by the absence of &#x00394;Np63 and a significant percentage of K5-positive cells was still observed by FACS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003441-g003">Fig. 3-C</xref>) with the two sh-p63-ES clones (5.6&#x00025; and 5.7&#x00025;, respectively), as compared to sh-control and wt-ES cells (17.4&#x00025; and 18.0&#x00025;, respectively). In the absence of K14, K5-positive cells were not able to produce keratinocytes and accordingly we could no longer observe the patches of K14/K5-positive cells obtained during the differentiation of control ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003441-g003">Fig. 3-B</xref>). Instead, the K5-positive cells, orphans of K14, were systematically detected within structures of rounded flat clones still positive for the K18 ectodermal marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003441-g003">Fig. 3-B</xref>). Actually, this particular structure was also detectable within wt and sh-control ES cell differentiation along with the large K14/K5-positive patches.

The relatively low activation of some of them (2&#x02013;5 fold) as compared to the very pronounced induction of &#x00394;Np63 (100 fold) reflected that &#x00394;Np63 was not expressed at all before BMP-4 treatment (&#x0003e;35 cycles of qPCR) while mRNA of these genes were already detected before (22&#x02013;25 cycles). To demonstrate that p63 is directly responsible for at least part of this modulation, the expression of potential p63-target genes were tested at day 14 in sh-63-cl2 ES cells as compared to control ES cells. Absence of p63 drastically reduced the expression of each gene during epidermal commitment, with the exception of BMP-7, which could be activated by an alternative mechanism, independent of the epidermal commitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003441-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).

ES cells were transduced, at day 4 of differentiation, with a lentiviral vector expressing &#x00394;Np63. At days 8 and 14, expression of keratinocyte-specific gene was barely detected after infection with &#x00394;Np63-lentivirus, as compared to cells cultivated in the presence of BMP-4 and serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003441-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Careful systematic counting of large areas under the microscope detected very few K14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (data not shown). Thus, &#x00394;Np63 is not able to induce keratinocyte differentiation in absence of BMP-4. To define if &#x00394;Np63 can synergize the effect of BMP-4, a &#x00394;Np63-expressing construct was stably inserted into ES cells which were induced to differentiate with and without BMP-4.

Here, we demonstrated that &#x00394;Np63 is a key factor necessary for embryonic epidermal differentiation. In absence of p63, committed ectodermal cells are not able to produce neither proliferating (K14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) nor terminally differentiated (K1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K10<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) keratinocytes. The implication of p63 in pluristratified epithelia morphogenesis/maintenance in mice was revealed by the severe phenotype of p63-deficient mice, born with a defect in all pluristratified epithelia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Mills1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Yang2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, a key question remained regarding the precise role of p63 in such epithelial developments. Indeed, the presence of uncommitted, single layered, primitive ectodermal cells covering the body surface of p63-deficient mice suggested that the p63-null phenotype leads to an absence of progression along the epidermal lineage with an early block in the epithelial stratification program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Mills1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Koster1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In that case, the expression of p63 must occur very early during epidermal development before the stratification program will commit ectodermal cells into epidermal cells, as already suggested by Koster and Roop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Koster1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Accordingly, in our cell model, the expression of the &#x00394;Np63 isoform occurred very early along the development pathway, soon after the ectodermal cell fate was induced by BMP-4 treatment and prior to the formation of K14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells. Interestingly, modulation of &#x00394;Np63 expression in zebrafish embryos has demonstrated its role in early dorsal/ventral ectodermal patterning as well as neural/epidermal specification: <italic>in vivo</italic> inhibition of p63 was shown to prevent skin formation, while its exogenous expression promoted epidermal specification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Bakkers1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Lee1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, it has been recently reported that in an organotypic reconstitution assay, p63-knockdown keratinocytes dedifferentiated toward an ectodermal fate, as they expressed <italic>de novo</italic> K8/K18 genes, and became unable to stratify <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Truong1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, ectopic expression of p63 was shown to be able to initiate a stratification program in single-lung epithelia, as demonstrated by histological and molecular analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Koster1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. All this strengthens the notion that K14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> epithelial cells can only be produced when &#x00394;Np63 is expressed, as clearly demonstrated in the present study.</p><p>On the other hand, clumps of terminal-differentiated cells in epidermis of p63-deficient mice were observed by McKeon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Yang2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Senoo1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Candi2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the authors suggested that the phenotype of these mice was not due to a default in embryonic epidermal differentiation but resulted from the inability of the epithelial stem cells to self renew. Accordingly, they recently demonstrated that &#x00394;Np63 is required for adult epithelial stem cells to maintain their proliferative potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Senoo1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. We believe that, instead of a contradiction, our data along with those described by Roop's team, strongly support a dual function for &#x00394;Np63 during embryonic epidermal fate and in epithelial homeostasis. Indeed, self renewal deficiency in absence of p63 cannot explain that embryonic commitment of thymic epithelial cells is not affected in p63-deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Senoo1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Candi1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, these thymic p63-deficient epithelial cells do not express K14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> but K5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K18<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and cannot therefore be considered as equivalent of epidermal stem cells. It suggests that mechanisms, in addition to the proliferative capability, are affected by the absence of p63 in order to explain the lack of K5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> epidermal cells in our <italic>in vitro</italic> model, as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> in p63-null mice.</p><p>Finally, we observed in absence of p63, the presence of structures composed of epithelial cells positive for K5 and K18. Interestingly, as for thymic K5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> epithelial cell commitment shown in p63-deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Senoo1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, the differentiation of these ES-derived K18/K5-positive cells was not inhibited by the absence of p63. Altogether, these and our results suggest that epithelial lineages are differently affected by the absence of p63 during their morphogenesis. Distinct functions that might be activated sequentially during embryogenesis and the adult life span can then be attributed to p63. It is clear that p63 will have a major contribution in epithelial cell development through its regulatory impact on stem cell proliferative potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Senoo1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. But it also appears that p63 may contribute to the required molecular steps implicated in other epithelial cell commitments, a role which is in accordance with the severe phenotype described for the p63-deficient mice. In this regard, we propose that, during embryogenesis, the ectodermal inducing phase (triggered by BMP-4 in our system) must include, as a necessary step, the expression of &#x00394;Np63 to allow pluristratified epithelial cell fate to occur.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture and neuro-ectodermal differentiation</title><p>The mouse ES cell line CGR8 and derived clones were maintained as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003441-Gambaro1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.
