The autotransporter proteins of Gram-negative bacteria form a family of proteins that share a common mechanism for autonomous secretion. All such proteins possess an N-terminal signal sequence for secretion across the inner membrane, a secreted mature protein referred to as the passenger or functional domain and a dedicated C-terminal domain which forms an amphipathic &#x003b2;-barrel pore that allows passage of the functional domain across the outer membrane. Exported proteins may remain tethered to the cell surface or be released from the cell by proteolytic cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008223-Henderson1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

SigA is a temperature-regulated serine protease capable of degrading casein; it shows no proteolytic activity for IgA. As with the autotransporters Tsh and Pic, bacterial cells transiently expressing SigA on the surface agglutinate erythrocytes (K. Al-Hasani, unpublished data), indicating a cell-binding activity that may be related to its role in pathogenesis. We have shown that SigA is cytopathic for HEp-2 cells, inducing morphological changes similar to, but less pronounced than, those induced by Pet, a related autotransporter toxin in enteroaggregative <italic>E. coli</italic>. SigA causes a &#x0201c;rounding up&#x0201d; of HEp-2 cells, consistent with disruption of the cytoskeleton, causing a loss in the integrity of the cell monolayer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008223-AlHasani2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, SepA and Pic from <italic>S. flexneri</italic> 2a induced no morphological changes on cell monolayers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008223-Dutta1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. We have also demonstrated that SigA plays a role in the intestinal fluid accumulation associated with <italic>S. flexneri</italic> infections; a <italic>sigA</italic> mutant induced 30&#x00025; less fluid accumulation in ligated rabbit ileal loops than its wild type parent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008223-AlHasani2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The mechanism by which this occurs is unknown, but is likely to be related to the cytopathic effect of SigA on epithelial cells. The Pet toxin which shares 58&#x00025; identity with SigA, degrades components of the cytoskeleton, fodrin (spectrin analog)/spectrin, in HEp-2 cells and erythrocytes respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008223-Villaseca1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on the similarities in sequence and action of SigA to Pet, it is likely that SigA acts on the same cellular substrate. In agreement with this hypothesis, this work shows that SigA binds to epithelial HEp-2 cells as well as being able to induce fodrin degradation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in situ</italic>, further extending its documented role in virulence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Animal experimentation was approved by the Monash University School of Biomedical Sciences Animal Ethics Committee.

Notably, complete degradation of recombinant &#x003b1;-fodrin was not observed even following overnight incubation with SigA (data not shown), whereas with Pet complete degradation of fodrin occurred within 2 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008223-CanizalezRoman1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. As was reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008223-AlHasani2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, when compared to SigA, purified Pet toxin, induced a more pronounced level of toxicity which may result from the differences in their abilities to degrade fodrin. The basis for this differential effect remains to be resolved but may be to due differences relating to their binding affinities to fodrin.</p><p>It has been shown that Pet degrades fodrin, causing its redistribution in HEp-2 cells. Since SigA has affinity for recombinant &#x003b1;-fodrin, we investigated whether SigA was able to induce fodrin redistribution. To address this issue, HEp-2 cells were incubated with or without SigA or &#x00394;SigA for 3 h, and the actin cytoskeleton and &#x003b1;-fodrin were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin and anti-&#x003b1;-fodrin antibodies and visualized by confocal microscopy. Staining of control cells (treated with supernatants from pPBA1100) with anti-fodrin antibodies revealed small green fluorescent spots along the epithelial cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008223-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). In contrast, a clear change in fodrin distribution was observed after 3 h of exposure with SigA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008223-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Fodrin was redistributed to form intracellular aggregates, which were located in membrane blebs, an indication that it may serve as an important substrate for SigA during the course of human infection. However, when cells were treated with the supernatant extract from the &#x00394;SigA mutant, this characteristic redistribution was not observed and was comparable to the untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008223-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). It is of interest that EspC, a SPATE autotransporter of EPEC, did not produce redistribution of fodrin in epithelial cells, as SigA and Pet do, suggesting differences among these closely related toxins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008223-NavarroGarca1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. These results do not exclude the possibility that additional cellular subtrates for SigA exist; thus the ability of SigA to proteolytically cleave other substrates warrants further investigation.</p><fig id="pone-0008223-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008223.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Effects of SigA on fodrin redistribution in epithelial cells.</title><p>HEp-2 cells were treated for 3 h with supernatant from SigA clone (A), or &#x00394;SigA (B) or vector only used as a control (C).

Recently, there was a report on the detection of specific antibodies to two serine protease autotransporters, Pet and Pic, during the course of a natural EAEC infection in children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008223-Bellini1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. To our knowledge, nothing is known about the <italic>in vivo</italic> expression of SigA during infection, and therefore, to gain a better understanding of the expression of SigA <italic>in vivo</italic>, we examined the antibody response against SigA with a volunteer infected with <italic>S. flexneri</italic> 2a. Concentrated culture supernatant extracts from the parental strain (<italic>S. flexneri</italic> 2a YSH6000T), SBA1356 (SepA and Pic deficient double mutant; previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008223-AlHasani2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>), and SBA1359 (SigA, SepA and Pic triple mutant) were used in an immunoblot assay. The serum showed reactivity against three major bands with apparent molecular masses above 100 kDa, including native SigA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008223-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, Lane 2). In contrast, these three immunoreactive bands were not detected in the culture supernatant preparation of SBA1359 (previously described) which has all known <italic>S. flexneri</italic> 2a SPATE encoding genes (<italic>sigA, sepA</italic> and <italic>she</italic>) insertionally inactivated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008223-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, Lane 4). In the culture supernatant of SBA1356, a <italic>sepA</italic> and <italic>she</italic> defective strain, immunoreactivity with SigA was detected. However, the two immunoreactive bands which we suspect correspond to SepA and Pic (encoded by <italic>pic(she)</italic>) were absent. Normal human serum used as a negative control did not react against SigA (data not shown). To our knowledge, there are no published studies reporting on human antibody recognition of SepA. However, Pic from Enteroaggregative <italic>E. coli</italic> (EAEC) has been shown to be immunogenic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008223-Bellini1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Overall, this observation suggests the existence of antibodies against SigA, and possibly against all three <italic>Shigella</italic> SPATES. This serological investigation will provide the foundations for future work aimed at deciphering in more detail the host immune response against SigA, so as to eventually map the specific epitopes implicated in this induction as a prerequisite to the development of vaccines against shigellosis. Recently, Kotloff et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008223-Kotloff2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> inactivated the genes encoding the <italic>Shigella</italic> enterotoxins (ShET1 and 2) present on the <italic>she</italic> PAI and on the virulence plasmid respectively, and demonstrated in human clinical trials using this live, attenuated oral <italic>Shigella</italic> vaccine, their effectiveness in eliminating reactogenicity and reaching immune response levels that are likely to translate into clinical protection. This finding reinforces the need to comprehensively understand the biological relevance of the <italic>she</italic> PAI in establishing disease, in particular that of SigA, given the documented role of <italic>sigA</italic>. Taken together, this study clearly extends and further substantiates the role for SigA in the pathogenesis of <italic>Shigella</italic> infections.</p><fig id="pone-0008223-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008223.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Antibody response against <italic>S. flexneri</italic> 2a SigA in a human volunteer.</title><p>Concentrated culture supernatant extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoreacted with human post-challenge serum.
