Known endogenous SR-A ligands are polyanionic and include modified lipoproteins, advanced glycation end products, and extracellular matrix proteins. No native plasma ligands have been identified, but it is known that SR-A recognition of unidentified serum components mediates integrin-independent macrophage adhesion, which may drive chronic local inflammation. In this study, we used a high-throughput fractionation and screening method to identify novel endogenous SR-A ligands that may mediate macrophage adhesion. SR-A was found to recognize the exchangeable apolipoproteins A-I and E (apo A-I and apo E, respectively) in both lipid-free and lipid-associated form, suggesting the shared amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix as a potential recognition motif. Adhesion of RAW 264.7 macrophages to surfaces coated with apo A-I and apo E4 proved to be integrin-independent and could be blocked by anti-SR-A antibodies. The presence of apo A-I and apo E in pathological deposits, such as atherosclerotic lesions and neurotoxic Alzheimer&#x02019;s plaques, suggests a possible contribution of SR-A-dependent adhesion of macrophages to an inflammatory microenvironment.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement><funding-source>National Institutes of Health, United States</funding-source></funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>bi9013769</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>bi-2009-013769</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fs1" fn-type="funding-statement"><label>&#x02020;</label><p>This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (Grant 076256/Z/04/Z to C.N.), the MRC (A.P., P.R., R.B.S., and S.G.), National Institutes of Health Grant P01HL086670 (D.R.v.d.W.), and the Ministry for Culture, Research and Higher Education of Luxembourg (C.N.).</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p id="sec1">Scavenger receptor A (SR-A)<xref rid="fn66" ref-type="fn">1</xref> is a multifunctional, multiligand receptor expressed mainly by myeloid cells, which plays a role both in innate immune defense and removal of modified or aged self and has been termed molecular flypaper for its low-affinity, broad specificity ligand binding capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Most known SR-A ligands are exogenous compounds discovered and defined by their ability to inhibit binding of receptor to the archetypal ligand acetylated LDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). The majority of endogenous SR-A ligands are connected to age-related degenerative diseases, oxidized lipoproteins being the driving force behind atherosclerosis, AGE-modified proteins resulting from diabetic glucose overload, and &#x003b2;-amyloid fibrils representing major components of neurotoxic Alzheimer&#x02019;s plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). A characteristic shared by all known SR-A ligands is their structurally defined, repetitive anionic charge distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). Ligand binding and specificity are controlled by a positively charged stretch of lysines in the collagenous binding domain of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>), and receptor engagement is followed by endocytic uptake, dissociation of the receptor&#x02212;ligand pair at acidic pH, and lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>).<fn id="fn66"><label>1</label><p>Abbreviations: SR-A, scavenger receptor A; BMM&#x003c6;, bone marrow-derived macrophage; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; acLDL, acetylated LDL; oxLDL, oxidized LDL; apo, apolipoprotein; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MalBSA, maleylated BSA; AGE, advanced glycation end product; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, room temperature; IgG, immunoglobulin G; PMSF, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride; SDS&#x02212;PAGE, sodium dodecyl sulfate&#x02212;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; WB, Western blot.</p></fn></p><p>Macrophage retention within tissues relies on both metal ion-dependent and -independent mechanisms, the former including integrins and selectins and the latter scavenger receptors and immunoglobulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). Prolonged or pathological retention of macrophages may create an inflammatory microenvironment, which in many cases drives disease, as seen for atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration, or diabetes-induced nephropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). Previous studies established a role for SR-A in integrin-independent adhesion of macrophages to an uncharacterised serum ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). Subsequent adhesion studies have implicated SR-A in adhesion of macrophages to various extracellular matrix molecules, including glycated type IV collagen in diabetic patients, denatured type I and II collagens, and the proteoglycans biglycan and decorin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>).</p><p>To identify plasma-borne endogenous SR-A ligands that contribute to SR-A-mediated macrophage adhesion, we screened human plasma for candidate ligands and tested their ability to sustain macrophage adhesion. Identification of single molecules from a highly complex mixture such as plasma requires a combination of separation techniques to reduce complexity and a stringent large-scale screening method. As the whole-cell adhesion assays or standard ligand competition assays used to identify most known SR-A ligands are poorly adapted to multisample analyses, a rapid high-throughput screening assay for identifying novel bacterial and endogenous SR-A ligands was developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). In this ELISA-based assay, lysate from bone marrow-derived macrophages from WT and SR-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is used in combination with a monoclonal anti-SR-A antibody to detect receptor&#x02212;ligand interactions. This allowed an extensive and rapid screen of individual chromatography fractions. In addition, SR-A is mostly intracellular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>), rendering binding studies with whole cells suboptimal, while lysis increases receptor availability by releasing this intracellular receptor pool. Since human, murine, bovine, and rabbit SR-A share a high degree of homology and similar ligand affinities, SR-A from any available species can be used to screen human plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). In particular, the basic residues in the collagenous domain responsible for ligand binding are conserved between human and murine SR-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). Our results represent a successful application of this novel ligand identification strategy. We propose that apolipoproteins A-I and E are novel ligands for SR-A, bind to the receptor via the known polyanion binding site, and, when immobilized, contribute to SR-A-mediated macrophage adhesion. This may have consequences for local macrophage-driven microinflammation at sites of apolipoprotein deposition, such as atherosclerotic lesions or Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease plaques.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Human pooled outdated citrated plasma was obtained from HD Supplies (Aylesbury, U.K.).

Although serum and plasma exhibit comparable ligand activity (data not shown), plasma was used for fractionation to prevent unwanted modifications induced by the proteases activated during the clotting cascade. Since all known SR-A ligands are polyanions, the complexity of the plasma was first reduced by anion exchange, followed by an ELISA screen with lysates from WT and SR-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMM&#x003c6; on the eluted fractions. The resulting two-peak SR-A binding pattern is shown in Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A. Ligand detection was selective for specific proteins as the SR-A binding trace did not simply reflect the protein elution profile. The two specific ligand peaks eluted at &#x0223c;300 mM NaCl (30% high-salt buffer) and after 1 M salt had been reached, suggesting either a very highly charged ligand or one that interacts with the column resin. Unbound material eluting before the salt gradient gave an equal signal in the presence and absence of detecting SR-A in ELISA (Figure 2A of the <xref rid="notes-1">Supporting Information</xref>). The same was observed when an isotype control antibody instead of anti-SR-A was used (Figure 2B of the <xref rid="notes-1">Supporting Information</xref>), but not when IgG-depleted plasma was fractionated, demonstrating that this signal was due to cross-reaction of the secondary antibody with immunoglobulins and not to specific SR-A ligands in these neutral or basic fractions. To remove nonspecific background from subsequent screens, either plasma was cleared of IgG prior to fractionation [which did not affect the two-peak SR-A binding pattern (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A)] or binding was expressed as the SR-A-specific signal (WT minus SR-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>).

Nonreducing SDS&#x02212;PAGE and far-Western analysis (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C) of the corresponding fractions revealed several areas of SR-A reactivity, corresponding to apparent molecular masses of approximately 160, 75&#x02212;35, and 25 kDa, suggestive of a ligand that would form a protein complex or aggregate in solution but (partially) dissociate into monomers under denaturing conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>Identification of Candidate Ligands by Mass Spectrometry</title><p>Four strong SR-A-reactive bands from fractions 9 and 10, at apparent molecular masses of &#x0003c;75, &#x0003e;50, 35, and 25 kDa (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C), were excised and subjected to in-gel tryptic digest, and peptides were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry. The first candidate list (Table 1 of the <xref rid="notes-1">Supporting Information</xref>, first run) included a large number of complement breakdown products (C3), protease inhibitors (inter-&#x003b1;-trypsin inhibitor, C1 inhibitor), and numerous hits of apolipoprotein A-I. To increase the reliability of mass spectrometry hits, the described ligand purification (ion exchange, size exclusion) was repeated at a larger scale and seven putative SR-A-reactive bands were excised and subjected to mass spectrometry. The second candidate list (Table 1 of the <xref rid="notes-1">Supporting Information</xref>, second run) confirmed initial hits and made it possible to select complement C3 (C3) and apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) as the two most promising candidate ligands. While both C3 and apo A-I were found in all four bands of the first run, C3 scored better than apo A-I (average scores of 558 and 211, respectively) and was identified by a higher average number of unique peptides (12 and 3.75, respectively). However, average sequence coverage was higher for apo A-I (16.25%) than for C3 (8%). As both the number of unique peptides and sequence coverage are somewhat dependent on the length of the protein, score was considered the most reliable rating criterion.</p><p>In a manner independent of score, however, several considerations argued in favor of apo A-I being the main candidate ligand. Since the constitutive low level of complement activation in plasma leads to covalent association of C3 with random plasma proteins, it is highly likely to find complement components in mass spectrometry searches. Similarly, high-abundance plasma proteins (albumin, immunoglobulins, antitrypsin, transferrin, and haptoglobin) are known to interfere with mass spectrometry sensitivity because they mask minor components. Apo A-I is the main protein constituent of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which spans a size range from 155 to 416 kDa in healthy subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). This agrees with the apparent molecular mass of the SR-A ligand determined by size exclusion chromatography (160 kDa). In addition, most table entries belonged to functional classes (proteinase inhibition, complement regulation, acute phase response, and lipid metabolism) recently found to be associated with HDL by shotgun proteomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). Therefore, apo A-I was retained as the main SR-A candidate ligand.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>Novel SR-A Ligands Are Derived from HDL</title><p>To test whether the identified SR-A-reactive compound was carried on HDL, total plasma lipoproteins were isolated by ultracentrifugation, subjected to size exclusion chromatography, and assessed for SR-A reactivity via an ELISA (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Consistent with SR-A recognition of modified LDL, which occurs at basal levels in plasma, the LDL peak showed weak SR-A binding. Astonishingly, the HDL peak bound SR-A strongly, contradicting the established conviction that HDL is not an SR-A ligand. However, oxidation of HDL by plasma enzymes such as myeloperoxidase is a physiologically occurring modification and has been shown to target HDL to various scavenger receptors, including SR-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>). Oxidation results in a ladderlike running pattern of HDL proteins on gels, mainly due to covalent aggregation of apo A-I and/or apo A-II. When HDL fractions were tested for SR-A reactivity by far-Western blot (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B), the observed banding pattern was similar to that in Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C, with SR-A-reactive bands at &#x0003c;75, 50, and 25 kDa. A parallel apo A-I Western blot proved the presence of apo A-I in four different bands, at &#x0003c;75, 50, &#x0003c;35, and 25 kDa (filled arrowheads, Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Note that the relative intensities of SR-A- and anti-apo A-I antibody-dependent recognition of higher-order apo A-I aggregates differ, suggesting preferential recognition of aggregated material by SR-A. The additional SR-A-reactive band at 14 kDa (empty arrowhead, Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B) was not identified on the apo A-I blot and might correspond to apo A-II, the second-most abundant apolipoprotein of HDL and structurally similar to apo A-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>). These findings point toward recognition of oxidized or aggregated rather than native apo A-I. To verify whether signatures of enzymatic oxidation could be found among the apo A-I peptides identified by mass spectrometry in our study, we reanalyzed all peptides with search criteria modified to include oxidative modifications. Myeloperoxidase specifically oxidizes selected methionine and tyrosine residues of apo A-I, including Met86 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>), which was indeed identified on several distinct peptides.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of SR-A binding activity in plasma lipoproteins.

Both the lipid-free plasma and the apolipoprotein-enriched eluates from the resin were then subjected to SDS&#x02212;PAGE and far-Western blot (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). On SDS&#x02212;PAGE (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, left panel), note the absence of strong bands in the apo A-I size region (25&#x02212;30 kDa) in delipidated plasma and the resin wash, and corresponding strong bands in eluates, indicating efficient removal of apo A-I by the delipidation step and enrichment on the resin. On the far-Western blot (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, right panel), four size areas reacted with SR-A, among which bands above 105 kDa were seen on both WT and SR-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> overlays, corresponding to cross-reaction of the secondary antibody with plasma immunoglobulins. A strong SR-A-specific band around 67 kDa (similar in size to the control SR-A ligand MalBSA) potentially corresponds to some form of modified albumin, as it is abundantly present in plasma and was unaffected by delipidation. Indeed, AGE-modified albumin occurs at low levels even in non-diabetic patients and has been proven to be a ligand for SR-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>). Two lipid-associated SR-A-specific bands localized above 35 kDa (the size of apo E) and below 30 kDa, the latter likely corresponding to apo A-I. The far-Western assay used in this work may detect only ligands that are resistant to denaturation or that may renature at least partially on blotting. The ELISA, however, does not involve ligand denaturation and so might detect additional ligands that are more fragile. Therefore, delipidated plasma was fractionated by ion exchange, and all fractions were screened for the presence of apo A-I and SR-A reactivity via an ELISA (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, bottom panel). Fractionation of delipidated plasma was compared to an identical fractionation of total plasma (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, top panel). As in Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A, ion exchange fractionation of plasma yielded two separate zones of SR-A binding activity, and again the second zone had very weak absorbance at 280 nm and eluted at a high salt strength. In plasma fractions, both zones contained apo A-I, with close overlap between SR-A binding and apo A-I content in zone 1. In delipidated plasma fractions, the SR-A-reactive, apo A-I-containing zone 1 was absent, confirming the hypothesis of lipid-associated apo A-I as a major SR-A ligand. However, binding and apo A-I traces in zone 2 were unaffected by delipidation, suggesting that zone 2 corresponds to small amounts of intact or fragmented lipid-free apo A-I and potentially additional ligands. Filtration on centrifugal columns with different molecular mass cutoffs showed that ligand activity in zone 2 was associated with a molecular entity above 10 kDa. Traces of apo A-I could be proven by Western blot, and SDS&#x02212;PAGE showed additional bands between 10 and 14 kDa potentially corresponding to apo A-II (not shown). Similar to the oxidative hypothesis raised above, this suggested that fragmentation and/or aggregation generates SR-A ligands from apo A-I.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Plasma contains lipid-associated and lipid-free SR-A binding activity.

Further, receptor binding seemed to be induced or enhanced by oxidative modifications, aggregation or degradation. To test whether native apolipoproteins are novel ligands for SR-A and to prove specificity for select apolipoproteins, various purified human apolipoproteins, including apo A-I and A-II, all three human apo E isoforms (E2, E3, and E4), and serum amyloid A (apo SAA), which replaces apo A-I in HDL during the acute phase response, were tested for SR-A reactivity. When WT was compared to the SR-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> signal via an ELISA (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A), significant binding was detected for apo A-I, HDL (containing both apo A-I and apo A-II), and all apo E isoforms, but not apo SAA. Comparison of WT and SR-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> far-Western blots (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B) confirmed this recognition pattern, with a strong SR-A-specific signal for all apo E isoforms and apo A-I, but not for apo A-II or monomeric apo SAA. The band above 50 kDa in the apo SAA lane most likely corresponds to aggregated or multimeric apo SAA, in agreement with known SR-A recognition of amyloid aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>). An additional proof of receptor specificity is the ability to compete with established ligands. Therefore, the ELISA was repeated in the presence of competitors. OxLDL and, to some extent, acLDL blocked recognition of all novel SR-A ligands (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C), suggesting that the novel ligands share the same receptor binding site as known ligands. Taken together, these experiments suggested that SR-A recognition of apolipoproteins is lipid-independent and selective and does not seem to depend on oxidative modification.

Therefore, the novel candidate ligands were tested in an SR-A-specific adhesion assay. First, adhesion of RAW 264.7 macrophages was assessed on a matrix of gelatin, which does not sustain SR-A-dependent adhesion, or on a mix of gelatin matrix and plasma or HDL (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). In the latter setting, macrophage adhesion is expected to occur through integrins, which can be inhibited by divalent metal ion chelation with EDTA, and through SR-A, which can be abolished by a monoclonal blocking antibody against SR-A, while a combination of both completely abrogates adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). Macrophages adhered to plasma and HDL in an SR-A-dependent manner, proving that plasma contains an adhesion ligand that copurifies with HDL. Next, protein candidate ligands apo A-I and apo E were tested for their capacity to mediate SR-A-specific macrophage adhesion. Apo A-I is found in atherosclerotic vascular plaques and apo E in neurodegenerative lesions of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, both macrophage-driven chronic inflammatory pathologies characterized by amyloid-associated deposits of denatured, unfolded, or truncated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>). Among the apo E isoforms, apo E4 was deemed the most physiologically relevant since the APOE4 allele is associated with late-onset Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>). Integrin-independent adhesion of macrophages to immobilized apo A-I or apo E4 was dose-dependent, completely blocked by anti-SR-A antibodies, and specific for the novel ligands, since no adhesion was observed with gelatin and BSA (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). Although RAW 264.7 macrophages secrete apo E at a rate comparable to that of immature monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>), the lack of adhesion to BSA-coated wells proved this endogenous apo E did not contribute to adhesion in our assay.

Competition between known SR-A ligands (acLDL and oxLDL) and the novel ligands identified here (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C) already established that both groups likely bound to overlapping or identical sites on the receptor. It would thus seem plausible that recognition relied on interaction between positive receptor residues and negative ligand residues, either present in the native state or induced by modification. Since purified and recombinant apolipoproteins were able to bind the receptor (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A,B), modification did not seem an absolute prerequisite, and native negative charge was favored as a hypothesis. Apo A-I and apo E belong to an evolutionarily conserved family of exchangeable apolipoproteins, which are characterized by amphipathic &#x003b1;-helical repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>). Superposition of electron density maps of lipid-free apo A-I and apo E has revealed that both molecules exhibit a large negative surface, which results from parallel packaging of &#x003b1;-helices and remains solvent-exposed even after rearrangement of helices around lipid globules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>). 4F is an apo A-I mimetic peptide 18 amino acids in length, which reproduces the features of apo A-I amphipathic &#x003b1;-helices based on a hydrophobic, lipid-associating and a negatively charged, solvent-exposed side without having any sequence similarity, and displays manifold anti-atherogenic and broadly anti-inflammatory properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>). If the shared amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix was a minimal binding motif, then 4F should be able to compete with known and novel SR-A ligands alike, since both seem to bind the same receptor site. In an ELISA-based competition assay, soluble 4F, but not a scrambled control peptide (scr4F), blocked binding of SR-A to known ligands acLDL and oxLDL, as well as to novel ligands apo A-I, E2, E3, and E4, while nonligands BSA and apo SAA were unaffected (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). In the whole-cell adhesion assay, the apo A-I mimetic peptide dose-dependently inhibited integrin-independent adhesion of RAW 264.7 macrophages to apo A-I and apo E4 (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). We therefore assumed short amphipathic &#x003b1;-helices containing a negatively charged side represented a minimal binding motif as the basis of selective apolipoprotein recognition by SR-A.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Identification of a minimal binding motif on novel apolipoprotein ligands.

No structure is available for the complex trimeric transmembrane receptor SR-A; however, its collagenous ligand binding domain closely resembles collagen I, and the SRCR domains of class A scavenger receptors SR-A and MARCO are highly conserved, allowing three-dimensional modeling of the binding and head regions (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A, residues involved in binding highlighted in red). The three-dimensional structures of apo A-I and apo E have been determined at 2.4 and 1.95 &#x000c5;, respectively (PDB entries <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2a01">2a01</ext-link> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1ea8">1ea8</ext-link>, respectively) and show considerable overlap in structure. Most importantly, when bundled in a lipid-free state, they present a large solvent-accessible negative patch, which unfolds into smaller negative stretches upon association with lipid bilayers or disks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>). The four-helix domain common to both apo A-I and apo E (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B), corresponding to amino acids 1&#x02212;190 of human apo A-I or amino acids 23&#x02212;162 of human apo E3, was used to model the interaction with SR-A, as it contains the negative residues potentially involved in SR-A binding. Both apo A-I and apo E3 helix domains were separately docked with the model for the SR-A receptor; in both docking calculations, the only restraint imposed was that one of the known contact residues on the receptor side would contact the apolipoprotein. Of 200 possible receptor&#x02212;ligand pairs in both docking calculations, the energetically most favorable pairs with maximal interaction surfaces were selected. All involved the apolipoprotein docking to the receptor binding domain in a parallel manner, with consecutive negative residues (Asp or Glu) on ligand helices locking one or more positive residues in the receptor binding domain (Arg317, Arg325, or Lys338) (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>C, SR-A:apo AI, and Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>D, SR-A:apo E). The energetically most favorable models used a single helix for interaction, a finding compatible with lipid-free apolipoprotein (helix bundle), HDL (unfolded helices), or short lipid-free &#x003b1;-helical peptides binding to SR-A. Modeling with the murine collagenous receptor domain produced comparable interactions (not shown). The models are therefore consistent with the hypothesis of an interaction pair involving negative residues of a ligand &#x003b1;-helix contacting the known binding site on SR-A.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Proposed model of interaction of human SR-A with apolipoproteins A-I and E3.

We propose that exchangeable apolipoproteins A-I and E represent a novel class of endogenous SR-A ligands, compete with known ligands acLDL and oxLDL for the known binding site on the receptor, and use their shared amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix as a minimal recognition motif for binding to SR-A. Immobilized apo A-I and apo E sustain integrin-independent, SR-A-mediated macrophage adhesion, which may represent a mechanism through which SR-A contributes to the trapping of macrophages at sites of pathological apolipoprotein deposition.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Structural Considerations</title><p>Exchangeable apolipoproteins are structurally conserved from insect apolipophorins to human apolipoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref>). Their lipid-free conformation is based on a helix bundle with hydrophobic domains shielded from the solvent and a large solvent-exposed negative domain. During lipid association, the amphipathic helix bundle unfolds and concatenates its helices to wrap around lipid disks or globules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>). This implies that SR-A could recognize exchangeable apolipoproteins via their solvent-exposed negative domains in both lipid-free (bundled) or lipid-associated (unfolded, concatenated) conformations. In addition, recognition of a small peptide containing as few as four negative residues supports the concept of a short, robust minimal binding motif, potentially found in unrelated molecules. However, not all apolipoproteins tested in this study bound to SR-A. Apo SAA presents only limited &#x003b1;-helical content; apo A-II, despite its amphipathic &#x003b1;-helical structure, is considerably shorter than apo A-I or apo E, and its charge distribution may differ. Interestingly, known SR-A ligands acLDL and oxLDL differed slightly in their ability to compete with the novel ligands (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C), and reciprocally, the apo A-I mimetic peptide differentially inhibited SR-A recognition of acLDL and oxLDL (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). While this may simply reflect the differential receptor binding residue usage underlying the nonreciprocal cross-competition of oxLDL and acLDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>), it could also indicate that exchangeable apolipoproteins recapitulate an oxidation-specific epitope present exclusively on oxLDL.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>Novel SR-A Ligands Are Derived from High-Density Lipoprotein</title><p>A shotgun proteomics study comparing HDL from healthy subjects and coronary artery disease patients identified proteins involved in the acute phase response, proteinase inhibition, and complement regulation in addition to lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). Overlapping hits between this and our study include acute phase proteins kininogen-1 and serum albumin, protease inhibitors inter-&#x003b1;-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 and &#x003b1;-1-antitrypsin, complement components C3 and C4, and HDL-associated antioxidant enzyme paraoxonase, validating the accuracy of mass spectrometry-based identification of candidate ligands. To ascertain that apo A-I was the only HDL protein involved in SR-A binding, several high-scoring hits were tested for binding to SR-A. &#x003b1;-1-antitrypsin and &#x003b1;-1-antichymotrypsin both tested negative. Complement iC3b is known to promote macrophage adhesion via complement receptor CR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>), a mechanism that is divalent metal ion-dependent and would thus not account for the EDTA-resistant adhesion mechanism with respect to serum-coated surfaces at the base of this study.</p><p>Initial receptor binding studies described here involved immobilization of the ligands, which might have induced conformational changes or aggregation, thereby deriving SR-A ligands from HDL. It cannot immediately be concluded that apolipoproteins are sufficient for receptor interaction with HDL, even though apo A-I mimetic peptides in solution were able to compete with known ligands for receptor usage. Rather, SR-A is defined by its ability to scavenge obsolete material, including oxidized, denatured, and aggregated molecules, and is not known to bind native lipoproteins or HDL in particular. Indeed, preliminary cell association assays with HDL protected from oxidation by the addition of the antioxidant probucol showed no difference between WT and SR-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMM&#x003c6;, in line with the lack of detectable HDL phenotype in SR-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. This may indicate that additional factors, like oxidative modification, are needed to increase negative charge or that aggregation or unfolding on surfaces is necessary to confer SR-A binding capacity to apolipoproteins. In vivo enzymatic oxidation of HDL specifically targets tyrosine and methionine residues of apo A-I, which results in impaired acceptance of cholesterol from ABCA1 and SR-BI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). SR-A has been implicated in the metabolism of myeloperoxidase-modified HDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>) and may constitute a scavenging mechanism for the removal of this nonfunctional entity from the organism. Whether this relies partially or at all on recognition of apo A-I remains to be determined.</p><p>Similarly, whether SR-A-dependent adhesion to apo A-I and apo E is a phenomenon of frustrated endocytosis or a distinct mechanism remains to be investigated. Different cytoplasmic domains of SR-A are involved in adhesion and receptor internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>), and cell spreading after adhesion has been shown to induce distinct signaling pathways from ligand-activated receptor internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref>). Bound SR-A ligands usually undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis followed by lysosomal delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>), but since HDL does not seem to be an endocytic ligand, it is likely that apolipoprotein recognition will solely elicit adhesion pathways.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><title>Pathophysiological Implications and Therapeutic Potential</title><p>Age-related chronic inflammatory pathologies such as atherosclerosis and Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease are characterized by combined accumulation of activated macrophages and microglia, which express high levels of SR-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref>), and pathological deposition of apolipoproteins. Macrophage adhesion through scavenger receptors is well-characterized, including binding of SR-A to extracellular matrix proteins, biglycan and decorin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>), glycated collagen IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>), and &#x003b2;-amyloid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>), as well as adhesion of CD36 to myeloperoxidase-modified LDL (oxLDL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref>). Surprisingly, ablation of both receptors in atherosclerosis-prone apo E<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or C57BL/6 mice does not decrease overall lesion area, suggesting that additional adhesion mechanisms share the responsibility of lesional macrophage retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">64</xref>). However, engagement of both receptors activates cell responses that contribute to the progression of disease: engagement of SR-A or CD36 with immobilized ligands induces a spread morphology with formation of filopodia and focal adhesion complexes, through a common signaling pathway (Src nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases, MAPK serine/threonine kinases) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">65</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68">68</xref>), and blocks macrophage chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">70</xref>), suggesting both receptors are involved in macrophage accumulation in lesions. SR-A- and CD36-mediated adhesion to amyloid substrata or immobilized but not soluble oxLDL induces ROS production in microglia and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">71</xref>), increasing the oxidative stress on their immediate environment. Our findings suggest that the novel SR-A ligands, which are found as insoluble deposits at sites of chronic inflammation, contribute to retention of macrophages and induce a pro-inflammatory, oxidative state, which in turn would drive accumulation of pro-atherogenic oxidized lipoproteins in the arterial wall or induce neurological damage in the brain. Indeed, several studies have proven the presence of apo A-I within atherosclerotic lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref72">72</xref>), along with apo A-II and apo B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">73</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">75</xref>). In many cases, apolipoproteins colocalize with extracellular matrix proteoglycans, many of which are scavenger receptor ligands in their own right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref76">76</xref>). Similarly, senile Alzheimer&#x02019;s plaques contain a plethora of apolipoproteins, including apo A-I and apo E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>). Apo A-I is present throughout all stages of lesion development, suggesting that SR-A- and apo A-I-dependent macrophage retention could occur from an early stage of disease. Early immunohistochemistry studies have shown colocalization of macrophages with apo A-I and/or apo E in human coronary artery lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref76">76</xref>), but the direct functional relationship between SR-A and apo A-I in tissues remains to be proven. Interestingly, the novel ligands identified here are in part derived from the same macrophages they retain. Repopulation of irradiated apo E<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with either WT or apo E<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow indicates that macrophage secretion alone is able to reconstitute plasma apo E levels to approximately 10% (&#x0223c;130 &#x003bc;g/dL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref77">77</xref>), sufficient to maintain a normal cholesterol profile in the absence of metabolic challenge. These studies further show that most lesion apo E is derived from resident macrophages, as opposed to infiltrated plasma lipoproteins. Macrophage apo E secretion is stimulated by cholesterol loading and can represent up to 16% of the total secreted protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref79">79</xref>). It would thus appear that apo E deposition, SR-A- and apo E-mediated macrophage retention, foam cell formation, and subsequent apo E production would form a self-propagating loop, exacerbating lesion progression. While it is technically challenging to determine the exact lesional concentration of apolipoproteins in vivo, several considerations justify the physiological relevance of apolipoprotein concentrations used in our in vitro assays. Secreted apo E is retained and enriched on the surface of macrophages through interaction with cell surface and extracellular matrix components, and constitutive apo E re-uptake and degradation is slowed by the lysosomal blockage that occurs in foamy macrophages saturated with nondegradable oxidized lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref80">80</xref>). Hence, the apo E concentration in the extracellular space surrounding macrophages might reach levels higher than those corresponding to secretion.</p><p>The hypothesis of a pathological role for apo E proposed above is in contradiction with the atheroprotective role of plasma apo E established in hypercholesterolemic apo E<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref81">81</xref>). However, it is important to distinguish between peripheral (macrophage-derived) and hepatic apo E. Indeed, hepatic apo E plays an essential role in lipoprotein catabolism through its interaction with hepatic lipoprotein receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref81">81</xref>), and overexpression studies suggest that hepatic apo E, rather than macrophage apo E, is essential in lesion regression through reverse cholesterol transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref83">83</xref>). In contrast, macrophage-specific deletion of apo E in an atherosclerosis-prone background (C57Bl/6) and under metabolic challenge inhibits rather than enhances atherosclerosis development, consistent with a pro-atherogenic role of macrophage-derived, local apo E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref84">84</xref>).</p><p>Along with CD36 and LOX-1, SR-A is one of the major receptors involved in cholesterol accumulation in macrophages. Our finding that 4F is able to compete efficiently with modified LDL suggests it may prevent foam cell formation by inhibiting oxLDL uptake via SR-A. The capacity of the small peptide 4F to abrogate the pro-atherogenic SR-A-mediated processes of oxLDL binding and adhesion of macrophages to lesional substrata may add therapeutic potential to this molecule, which is already on the way to medical approval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref85">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref86">86</xref>). In addition, 4F provides a useful tool for potentially targeting one class A scavenger receptor family member specifically, as it is not recognized by the class A member MARCO (S.
