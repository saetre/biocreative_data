A member of the RTK family, the kinase-deficient erbB3 can activate downstream signaling via heterodimer formation with erbB2. We studied the expression of RTK receptors in mammary tumors from the wild-type (wt) rat c-<italic>neu </italic>transgenic model.

Co-immunoprecipitation methods were employed to quantitate heterodimerization between the transgene-encoded protein erbB2 and the endogenous mouse erbB3. Tumor cell growth in response to growth factors, such as Heregulin (HRG), epidermal growth factor (EGF), or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), was also studied. Post-HRG stimulation, activation of the RTK downstream signaling was determined by Western blot analyses using antibodies against phosphorylated Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), respectively. Specific inhibitors were then used with cell proliferation assays to study the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI-3K)/Akt and MAPK kinase (MEK)/MAPK pathways as possible mechanisms of HRG-induced tumor cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mammary tumors and tumor-derived cell lines frequently exhibited elevated co-expression of erbB2 and erbB3.

HRG treatment activated both the Akt and MAPK pathways in a dose- and time-dependent manner.

Type I RTKs are expressed by epithelial, mesenchymal and neural tissues to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation and other important biological functions critical to species development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Dysregulated expression of erbB receptors or mutational events thereof have been implicated in diverse types of human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Members of the family include: ErbB1 (also known as EGFR), ErbB2 (also known as Her-2 or <italic>neu</italic>), ErbB3 (or Her-3) and ErbB4 (or Her-4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. erbB2 is an orphan receptor whereas other family members directly bind ligands (like the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-&#x003b1; (TGF-&#x003b1;) for EGFR, and HRG for erbB3 and erbB4) to initiate intracellular signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>ErbB2 may be activated via either ligand-dependent heterodimeric, or ligand-independent homodimeric processes. In the former, erbB2 is the preferred heterodimerization partner for other erbB family receptors with bound ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In ligand-independent signaling, erbB2 may be upregulated as a result of gene amplification, promoting homodimerization, or be activated through mutational events. <italic>ErbB2 </italic>amplification with enhanced protein expression is noted in approximately one-third of invasive human breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Selected heterodimers may enhance receptor activation and downstream signaling as compared with homodimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Although erbB3 lacks a functional kinase to initiate cell signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], the erbB2/erbB3 heterodimer complex is believed to be the most biologically active and pro-tumorigenic form of these receptor complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The erbB receptors and their respective ligands influence a wide range of cellular processes such as proliferation, maturation, survival, apoptosis and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In general, activated RTKs add phosphorylated tyrosine residues to downstream signaling molecules, such as the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K), Shc and/or Grb2 of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. However, because of the complexity of RTK ligand-dependent and -independent mechanisms, the downstream signaling effects may be highly diverse and interactive. RTK-induced signaling is also influenced by, and may modulate, other molecular factors and signaling pathways.</p><p>The <italic>ErbB2 </italic>gene-encoded protein is over-expressed in 25 to 30% of invasive breast and ovarian cancers and has been associated with a poor clinical outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Evidence of a causal relationship in human breast cancer has been derived from numerous prognostic studies and clinical trials. <italic>In vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>model systems including transgenic mouse models support a relationship between erbB2 alterations and mammary tumorigenesis. Overexpression of erbB3 is also frequently reported in erbB2 altered breast, ovarian and bladder cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Human breast cancer cell lines commonly co-overexpress both erbB2 and erbB3, further supporting their role in breast carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>To investigate the role of RTKs in mammary tumorigenesis, transgenic mice bearing the wild-type (wt) or mutated, activated rat c-<italic>neu </italic>(<italic>ErbB2</italic>) were generated, and have been widely studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Transgenic mice expressing the activated rat c-<italic>neu </italic>(with deletion mutations) bear mammary tumors with elevated co-expression of the mutant c-<italic>neu</italic>/<italic>ErbB2 </italic>and the endogenous mouse <italic>ErbB3</italic>-encoded protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Functional and physical interactions between these two cross-species receptors have not been reported, although interactions have been widely speculated. Transgenic mice bearing the wt-rat c-<italic>neu</italic>, under control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (MMTV-LTR), typically develop unifocal, well-circumscribed, low-grade tumors after a long latency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In addition to transgene expression and, in some cases, mutation, upregulation of EGFR and p53 have been reported in derived tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>We have used the wt-erbB2 transgenic mouse model to study the effects of exogenous pharmacological or dietary estrogens and anti-estrogens. In particular, we have studied interactions between RTK-associated mammary tumorigenesis and steroid hormones. From the derived mouse tumors, we have established over 150 novel murine cell lines which have proven useful for <italic>in vitro </italic>studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Most tumor-derived cell lines express significant mouse <italic>ErbB3</italic>-encoded protein, in addition to high levels of the rat c-<italic>neu</italic>/<italic>ErbB2 </italic>transgene. These are also typically negative for ER&#x003b1; but show ER&#x003b2; protein expression. A similar pattern of receptor expression has also been detected in the mouse mammary tumors.</p><p>The co-expression of erbB3 with erbB2 in both the activated and wt-<italic>neu</italic>/<italic>ErbB2 </italic>transgenic model systems suggested a biological role for erbB3 in mammary tumor pathogenesis. We hypothesized that physical and functional interactions between these RTK receptors should occur, despite their cross-species molecular structures. Signaling initiated by activated erbB2/erbB3 heterodimers should provide a more potent oncogenic signal than erbB2 homodimers alone. This would require ligand binding, most likely HRG, to activate erbB3. To test this hypothesis, we studied the responsiveness of tumor-derived cell lines to growth factors, including HRG, EGF and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1); we evaluated the effects of ligand stimulation and heterodimer formation on downstream signaling activation; and we sought evidence of physical interactions between the wt-rat c-<italic>neu</italic>/erbB2 and the endogenous mouse erbB3.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cells and cell culture</title><p>Human breast cancer cell lines SKBR-3 and BT-474 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA) and maintained in DMEM and Ham's F-12 medium (1:1, v/v) (Invitrogen Corp, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen Corp). These cell lines were cultured in a 37&#x000b0;C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>and were split twice a week.

The histological pattern and tumor diagnoses were confirmed by microscopic analysis. These methods have been previously described in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], although the specific cell lines described in this work have not been previously published. In brief, solid tumor tissue was transferred into a tissue culture dish containing PBS. After removal of mammary fat and connective tissues, tumors were minced into small pieces and treated with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen Corp) at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min. Cells were subsequently centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 5 min. After discarding supernatant, cells were suspended in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics and antimycotics (Invitrogen Corp). These mammary tumor cells (~1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells/plate) were seeded in tissue culture dishes and kept in a 37&#x000b0;C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The media was changed twice a week to maintain cells in culture. Each line was passaged approximately 20 times before stability was assumed.</p></sec><sec><title>Soft agar cloning assays</title><p>Soft agar cloning was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] with some modification. The bottom agar was prepared with a mixture of 1.6 ml of 1 &#x000d7; DMEM/F12 (complete medium), 3.2 ml of 2 &#x000d7; DMEM/F12 (complete medium), and 3.2 ml of 1.25% Noble agar (Sigma Co, St Louis, MO, USA) and maintained at 42&#x000b0;C. From this, 2 ml was pipetted into each well of six-well cell culture plates and agar was allowed harden in the hood. For each well, top agar was a mixture of 0.2 ml of 1 &#x000d7; DMEM/F12, 0.4 ml of 2 &#x000d7; DMEM/F12, and 0.4 ml of 0.95% Noble agar. Five thousand cells (in 80 &#x003bc;l complete medium) were added into the top agar mixture. After vortexing gently, the cell containing top agar was added in a drop-wise fashion onto the bottom agar containing six-well plates (in triplicate per cell line). After resting for 10 min in the hood, the six-well plates were cultured in a 37&#x000b0;C incubator for 3 weeks. Colony counts were obtained under an inverted microscope, from three wells per cell line counting all colonies &#x0003e;50 &#x003bc;M in diameter.</p></sec><sec><title>Doubling time in culture</title><p>Measurement of cell growth rate in culture was determined using sulforhodamine B (SRB; Sigma Co) assays as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Two thousand cells were seeded into each well of a six-well plate with complete medium. Cells were fixed with 50% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) at 24 h intervals for 3 days. TCA-fixed cells were then stained with 0.4% SRB for 30 min followed by three washes. Protein-bound dye was dissolved in 10 mM Tris base. Plates were read at 565 nM using a micro-plate reader. Cell-doubling time was calculated based on proliferation curves that resulted from changes in SRB absorbance over time. Data represent the means of at least three independent experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell proliferation assay</title><p>A CellTiter96&#x02122; AQ non-radioactive cell proliferation kit (Promega Corp, Madison, WI, USA) was used to determine the responsiveness of cells to various growth factors. Cells were plated onto 96-well plates, 5,000 cells/well for each cell line. Twenty-four hours later, the culture media were replaced by 0.5% FBS in DMEM/F12 fresh medium or the same medium containing 25 ng/ml HRG (R&#x00026;D Systems, Inc, Minneapolis, MN, USA), 10 ng/ml EGF (Sigma Chemical Co), or 40 ng/ml IGF-1 (R&#x00026;D Systems, Inc) for another 72 h incubation with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>at 37&#x000b0;C. After reading at 490 nM with the micro-plate reader, the percentages of viable cells were determined by reduction of MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium; inner salt) relative to controls.

Briefly, after deparaffinization and rehydration, tissue sections were steamed in a 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 30 min. Non-specific reactivity was blocked with 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in buffer. For erbB3 immunoassays, CAS Block (Zymed Laboratories, Inc, South San Francisco, CA, USA) and 10% normal horse serum (Vector Laboratories, Inc, Burlingame, CA, USA) were used sequentially. For phospho-Akt immunostaining, we used 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and 5% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Inc) sequentially. Primary antibodies included an anti-erbB2 (reactive with rat c-<italic>neu</italic>/erbB2 rabbit polyclonal, dilution 1:1000 (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) for 2 h incubation at room temperature), anti-erbB3 (cross-reacts with mouse and human, mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:50 (NeoMarkers, Inc, Fremont, CA, USA), overnight incubation at 4&#x000b0;C), anti-phospho-Akt (rabbit polyclonal, diluted in 5% normal goat serum 1:12.5 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), overnight at 4&#x000b0;C), or anti-phospho-MAPK (E10 monoclonal antibody, diluted in 5% normal goat serum 1:25 (Cell Signaling Technology), overnight at 4&#x000b0;C). After multiple washes with buffer, tissue sections were sequentially incubated for 30 min at room temperature with diluted biotinylated secondary antibody (1:500; Dako) and VECTASTAIN Elite ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories, Inc) diluted in PBS. After reaction with diaminobenzidine (Dako) and counterstaining with hematoxylin, tumors were individually examined.

The supernatants were cleared by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were measured using the Coomassie plus protein assay reagent (Pierce Chemical Co, Rockford, IL, USA). Total cell lysates containing 200 &#x003bc;g of protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation in the presence of 1 &#x003bc;g anti-erbB2 antibody (mouse monoclonal antibody, Ab-4; Oncogene Science Products, Cambridge, MA, USA) for 2 h at 4&#x000b0;C, followed by incubation with immobilized protein A-agarose (Roche Diagnostics Corp, Indianapolis, IN, USA) at 4&#x000b0;C overnight with rotation. For Western blot analyses, the immunoprecipitates or equal amounts of crude extracts were boiled in Laemmli SDS-sample buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA), and probed with different primary antibodies. After the blots were incubated for another 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG; Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA, USA), the signals were detected using the Enhanced Chemiluminance assay (Amersham Life Science Inc., Arlington Heights, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Co-expression of erbB2 and erbB3 protein in tumor-derived cell lines and tumors</title><p>Western blot analyses were used to determine erbB2 and erbB3 protein expression in tumor-derived cell lines (and the control SKBR-3 human breast cancer cell line). The majority of tumor-derived cell lines expressed moderate to high levels of both erbB3 and erbB2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In general, lines with the highest erbB2 expression showed the highest levels of erbB3 protein. Tyrosine phosphorylation (activation) of these receptors was examined by Western blots using antibodies specific for phophorylated erbB2 (P-erbB2) or phosphorylated erbB3 (P-erbB3). Tumor lines with co-overexpression of both proteins showed higher P-erbB2 and P-erbB3 levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The intensity of P-erbB2 and P-erbB3 signals did not necessarily correlate with their corresponding protein levels. The expression of either receptor protein was undetectable in only one of our novel, derived tumor cell lines (78423). AIB-1 (also called SRC3, RAC3, ACTR and p/CIP), a co-activator of estrogen receptor commonly amplified in breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], was used as a loading control. Expression of AIB-1 further established the origin of these cells as mammary-derived.</p><p>To confirm the transformed characteristics of these lines, soft agar cloning assays (which quantitate anchorage-independent cloning capability) were used. All six tumor-derived cell lines formed colonies in soft agar. Colony formation was variable when comparing one cell line with another (range 17&#x02013;180, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). There was no correlation between the ability of a cell line to form anchorage-independent clones and the expression levels of erbB2 or erbB3.</p><p>Immunohistochemical methods were used to visualize RTK expression and downstream signaling (protein activation) by tumors <italic>in situ</italic>. Tumors showed strong and typically diffuse co-expression of both erbB2 and erbB3. The only exception to this was the mammary tumor 78423 R1, the progenitor of the cell line that did not co-express erbB2 and erbB3 discussed above. We also studied RTK signaling activation <italic>in situ</italic>, using phosphospecific antibodies. Phosphorylated-Akt (P-Akt) showed cytoplasmic and membranous staining, which was less diffuse than the erbB-2 expression. Phosphorylated-MAPK (P-MAPK) was the most selectively expressed, typically expressed by clustered or isolated tumor cells as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> (left panel) with tumor 78617 R3. The majority of tumor cells from 78423 R1 were erbB3 negative, although some cells showed weak erbB2 protein expression. In this later tumor, P-Akt staining was weak with clustered or isolated tumor cells and no staining for P-MAPK was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, right panel). The histological, cytological and biological features of these tumors have been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. As a control, we also studied cytokeratin expression and all tumors were positive. This confirmed the epithelial nature of these tumors (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Sequencing analyses of the transgene <italic>neu </italic>in established mammary tumor-derived cell lines</title><p>As alluded to above, in-frame deletions of 7&#x02013;12 amino acids have been reported in the extracellular region of the transgene, proximal to the transmembrane domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. To study the mutational status of tumor-derived lines, we performed RT-PCR amplification of exactly the same region followed by direct sequencing analysis. The PCR primers used were specific for rat <italic>neu </italic>and were designed to amplify the 603 bp extracellular region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Of six tumor-derived cell lines used in this manuscript and therefore studied for mutation, only four showed PCR gene amplification (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). Of these, the strongest PCR signal was seen in 85819 cells. These data are consistent with our Western blot results that showed overexpression of the rat <italic>neu</italic>/erbB2 in only the four PCR-positive lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Direct sequencing of the PCR products revealed no deletion mutations in the amplified product. Sequencing showed three of the four were wt rat <italic>neu </italic>cDNA sequence. Sequencing data from the 83923 cells indicated a mixture of two kinds of <italic>neu </italic>cDNA. Using a reverse primer, we verified that both wt and point mutation <italic>neu </italic>transcripts co-existed in 83923 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). This suggests biclonal populations or a heterozygous mutation. Further studies and sub-cloning are in process.</p></sec><sec><title>Mammary tumor cell response to growth factors corresponds with erbB receptor data</title><p>To study the functionality and interactions of the erbB receptors, 78423 and other three representative mouse mammary tumor-derived lines with the highest expression of wt erbB2 and co-expression of erbB3 were chosen for further study. Baseline proliferation was determined using monolayer culture conditions and the SRB assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). Some variability in the basal doubling time was observed between these cell lines. The mouse mammary tumor cell lines 78423, 78617, 85815 and 85819 showed population doubling times of 15.15 &#x000b1; 1.10, 16.25 &#x000b1; 1.40, 30.85 &#x000b1; 2.31 and 20.35 &#x000b1; 1.89 h, respectively. Using an MTS assay, we then tested the response of these lines to EGF, HRG and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). HRG strongly stimulated the proliferation of three of the four mouse mammary tumor cell lines (78617, 85815, 85819) with overexpression of both erbB2 and erbB3. Proliferation was not induced by EGF or IGF-1, which bind to EGFR and IGF-1 receptor, respectively. HRG also promoted the growth of SKBR-3 and BT-474 human breast cancer cells (controls). These data strongly support a functional interaction between the wt-rat <italic>neu</italic>/ErbB2 and endogenous mouse erbB3.</p></sec><sec><title>HRG activation of PI-3K/Akt and MAPK kinase (MEK)/MAPK signaling promotes mammary tumor cell growth</title><p>It is well documented that the MEK/MAPK and PI-3K/Akt pathways are the two major signal transduction pathways downstream of the erbB receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. To determine which signaling pathways were activated in the mouse-derived mammary tumor cells exposed to HRG, we performed Western blots to detect P-MAPK or P-Akt. With 2 h of HRG treatment, both P-Akt and P-MAPK increased in the 85815 and 85819 mouse mammary tumor cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). This study included a series of HRG concentrations, and stimulation was maximal at a concentration of 2.5 ng/ml. Next, we performed a time-course analysis to further verify these results. HRG stimulated both Akt and MAPK in 85815 and 85819 cells, whereas it had no effect on Akt or MAPK activation in the 78423 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). These data were consistent with the results of minimal stimulation by HRG in this cell line (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). In aggregate, these data suggest that HRG induces activation of both MEK/MAPK and PI-3K/Akt signaling transduction pathways in mammary tumor cells with elevated expression levels of both the transgene rat c-<italic>neu/ErbB2 </italic>and the endogenous mouse <italic>ErbB3 </italic>gene. This activation was both dose- and time-dependent.</p><p>To study cross-species functional interactions between the rat c-<italic>neu/Erb</italic>B2 transgene and mouse <italic>ErbB3</italic>, we evaluated tumor and tissue expression <italic>in vivo</italic>, ligand-associated interactions, and signaling <italic>in vitro</italic>. Immunohistochemical studies showed cytoplasmic P-Akt and P-MAPK expression in tumor cells with erbB2 and erbB3 co-expression, predominantly a perivascular distribution. In rare tumors without erbB2 and erbB3 expression (e.g. 78423 R1), the perivascular distribution was not identified and only rare cells showed immunoreactivity. This evidence of perivascular pathway activation suggests that ligand-associated signaling via erbB3 may be involved. Ligand-associated signaling probably provides enhanced growth or pro-tumorigenic signaling, in addition to ligand-independent, transgene activation. Our data, and those from others showing frequent erbB3 upregulation in transgenic mice bearing activated <italic>neu/ErbB2</italic>, suggest that the concomitant upregulation of erbB3 and ligand-associated signaling may be an important additional factor in both wt and activated <italic>neu/ErbB2</italic>-associated mammary tumor development. To further define the role of HRG (ligand)-associated signaling, we utilized derived cell lines and specific inhibitors <italic>in vitro</italic>. The PI-3K inhibitor LY294002 was significantly more potent than the MEK inhibitor PD98059 in blocking the stimulatory effects of HRG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Hence, while the MEK/MAPK and PI-3K/Akt signaling cascades both contribute HRG induced proliferation, the PI-3K/Akt pathway appears to provide the dominant response.</p></sec><sec><title>Physical interaction between wt-rat-c-<italic>neu</italic>/ErbB2 and endogenous mouse erbB3</title><p>The erbB2/erbB3 complex is believed to be the most biologically active erbB heterodimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], with potent activation of the downstream signaling cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Since both erbB2 and erbB3 were highly expressed by our mammary tumor cell lines and HRG-promoted tumor cell proliferation, we sought physical evidence that the wt-rat-<italic>neu</italic>/ErbB2 could form a complex with the endogenous mouse erbB3. Immunoprecipitation of erbB2, followed by Western blot analysis for erbB2 and erbB3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8a</xref>) showed a low level of complex formation between these receptors in untreated cell lines. HRG treatment significantly increased the physical interaction between the rat transgene and mouse erbB3 in two out of three cell lines. The antibody we used for immunoprecipitation (c-<italic>neu </italic>Ab-4) appeared to be wt-rat-<italic>neu/</italic>ErbB2-specific, because human erbB2 was not immunoprecipitated from SKBR-3 cell lysates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8a</xref>, upper panel), although it was expressed by SKBR-3 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8b</xref>, Western blot analysis with c-<italic>neu </italic>Ab-3). HRG treatment (for 2 h) did not increase the total protein levels of erbB2 or erbB3 as compared with untreated cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8b</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that transgenic mice bearing the wt-rat c-<italic>neu </italic>gene, under control of the MMTV promoter, develop mammary tumors that overexpress the rat c-<italic>neu </italic>transgene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and the endogenous mouse erbB3 protein, in the vast majority of cases. We have shown a functional interaction between these two important RTK receptors and a role for ligand-induced signaling <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>. While others have reported that transgenic mice bearing activated forms of rat c-<italic>neu</italic>/<italic>erb</italic>B2 have co-expression of erbB2 and endogenous erbB3 in mammary tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], direct physical and functional interactions between these two species receptors have not previously been reported.</p><p>Deletion mutants of the <italic>neu </italic>oncogene have been reported in two out of three of the mammary tumors derived from this wt-rat c-<italic>neu </italic>transgenic model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We did not find the same mutation rate or type in selected tumor-derived cell lines. However, we have identified a potential point mutation in 83923 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This missense mutation is located inside the same extracellular region of <italic>neu </italic>where the deletion mutations have been reported. This particular mutation changes the amino acid 654 serine (codon AGC) into cysteine (codon TGC). It is different from the active <italic>neu </italic>mutation G664V reported in the transmembrane domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The biological significance of the newly discovered S654C mutant <italic>neu </italic>is not yet known.</p><p>Using ligand stimulation with or without specific inhibitors, we have studied RTK-induced signaling in response to HRG and have shown activation of both PI-3K/Akt and the MEK/MAPK signal transduction pathways. A greater role for PI-3K/Akt signaling was suggested in response to HRG treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). PI-3K/Akt signaling is known to be regulated by erbB2-mediated tyrosine kinase activity. This pathway plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and has been associated with the pathogenesis of human breast cancers. PI-3K/Akt activation has also been cited as a key pathway that influences chemo-resistance patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Akt is frequently upregulated in <italic>ErbB2 </italic>amplified or overexpressing human breast cancer cells. These similarities between our transgenic model and human breast carcinogenesis suggest that the model and derived tumor cell lines may be a useful resource to study ligand dependent and independent RTK signaling <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>As a major ligand for erbB3, HRG is known to bind to erbB3, foster heterodimer complex formation and promote potent downstream signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. HRG can thus promote mammary tumorigenesis, cell growth, differentiation and phenotypic aggression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Our immunohistochemical studies of tumors for phosphorylated proteins facilitated studies of the cellular location and architectural context of signaling. We noted enhanced phosphorylated Akt and MAPK in a perivascular distribution in mammary tumors, with overexpression of both erbB2 and erbB3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), suggesting that circulating HRG may enhance the physical and functional erbB2/erbB3 interactions <italic>in vivo</italic>, similar to what we observe <italic>in vitro</italic>. This study has focused primarily on erbB3, whereas others have demonstrated upregulation of EGFR in tumors (by immunohistochemistry and Western blot) in the same model system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Low and variable expression of EGFR has also been found in mammary tumors that develop in transgenic mice bearing activated forms of rat c-<italic>neu</italic>/ErbB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Using <italic>in vitro </italic>analyses of the tumor-derived cell lines, we have found no significant physical or functional interaction between EGFR (erbB1) and erbB2 in the presence of EGF (data not shown). However, by immunohistochemical study, we also detected erbB1 expression at the tumor periphery as reported by DiGiovanna [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. These data suggest to us that erbB3 plays a more significant role in tumorigenesis than erbB1 in this model system.</p><p>These data and this model probably have relevance to human breast cancer biology and treatment strategies. We have reported that only a minority of erbB2-altered invasive human breast cancers have overexpression of erbB1 (EGFR) and activation of erbB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Given the complexity of the RTK receptors, various ligands and downstream signaling, it is likely that combinations of these factors including erbB3 contribute to cell signaling, biological behavior and treatment response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. To date, the role of erbB3 in human breast carcinogenesis is not well defined, although many investigators have suggested that HRG-associated signaling may be important. In view of these complexities, it is not surprising that erbB2 aberrant breast cancers have shown variable responses to anti-erbB2 therapeutics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. It is widely believed that co-expression of other erbB RTK family members may be one mechanism of Herceptin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Ligand-induced heterodimerization between erbB3 and erbB2, the most potent signaling complex amongst the various heterodimers, is one likely mechanism of Herceptin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. More detailed investigations using banks of human tumors and clinical trial-associated specimens, to define the incidence of erbB3 abnormalities, functional complex formation and downstream signaling, may provide important new clues regarding these interactions and their role in breast carcinogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results indicate that over-expression of endogenous mouse erbB3 plays an important role in the development and progression of mammary tumors that arise in mice bearing the wt-rat c-<italic>neu </italic>transgene. The functional and physical interactions between these important cross-species erbB receptors result in activation of both PI-3K/Akt and MEK/MAPK signaling. These data support the concept that ligand-dependent and -independent signaling through erbB2 may promote mammary tumorigenesis in these transgenic mice, similar to what is observed in human breast cancers.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>DMEM = Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; EGF = epidermal growth factor; EGFR = EGF receptor; ER = estrogen receptor; FBS = fetal bovine serum; HRG = heregulin; IGF-1 = insulin-like growth factor-1; mAb = monoclonal antibody; MAPK = mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK = MAPK kinase; MMTV = mouse mammary tumor virus; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline; RTK = receptor tyrosine kinase; PI-3K = phosphoinositide 3-kinase; RT-PCR = reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; SRB = sulforhodamine B; TCA = trichloroacetic acid; TGF-&#x003b1; = transforming growth factor-&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>The authors' contributions to this research work are reflected in the order shown, with the exception of ADT who supervised the research and finalized the report.
