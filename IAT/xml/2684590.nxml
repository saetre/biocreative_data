We tested neuroprotective effects of the synthetic triterpenoid CDDO-MA, a potent activator of the Nrf2/ARE signaling. CDDO-MA treatment of neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells resulted in Nrf2 upregulation and translocation from cytosol to nucleus and subsequent activation of ARE pathway genes. CDDO-MA blocked t-butylhydroperoxide-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by activation of ARE genes only in wild type, but not Nrf2 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Oral administration of CDDO-MA resulted in significant protection against MPTP-induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration, pathological alpha-synuclein accumulation and oxidative damage in mice. Additionally, CDDO-MA treatment in rats produced significant rescue against striatal lesions caused by the neurotoxin 3-NP, and associated increases in the oxidative damage markers malondialdehyde, F<sub>2</sub>-Isoprostanes, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, 3-nitrotyrosine, and impaired glutathione homeostasis. Our results indicate that the CDDO-MA renders its neuroprotective effects through its potent activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway, and suggest that triterpenoids may be beneficial for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is increasing evidence showing that both mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage play a key role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Lin1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Browne1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. An extremely promising pathway for neurotherapeutics is the NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Lee1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Calkins1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The transcription factor Nrf2 is a key regulatory factor in the coordinated induction of a battery of cytoprotective genes, including those encoding for both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory proteins. The induction of these protective genes depends on the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and its binding to the ARE, a regulatory enhancer sequence, which is present in the promoter region of the involved genes. The regulation of the Nrf system involves another cytosolic protein, KEAP1 (kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1), which binds to Nrf2 in the cytosol and prevents its nuclear translocation and subsequent transcriptional activation of the ARE genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Holtzclaw1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Kobayashi1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Critical cysteine residues in the KEAP1 protein are essential for its ability to inactivate Nrf2 by retaining it in the cytosol. These cysteine residues are targets for various drugs that form Michael adducts with KEAP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-DinkovaKostova1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Liby1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Nrf2/ARE signaling regulates over 200 genes, including those encoding anti-oxidative genes and detoxifying enzymes (known as the &#x0201c;phase 2&#x0201d; enzymes) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Kwak1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>One critical enzyme that is induced by the Nrf2 signaling pathway is NADPH quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO-1). This enzyme is involved in detoxification of protein-bound quinone, and it functions to maintain alpha-tocopherol and coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> (CoQ<sub>10</sub>) in their reduced antioxidant states. Another ARE-dependent protein is the stress responsive inducible enzyme hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1). HO-1 is involved in the metabolism of the prooxidant heme to the antioxidant pigment biliverdin, ferrous iron and carbon monoxide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Dore1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, and it has profound anti-inflammatory properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Ryter1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

Oleanolic acid is a naturally occurring triterpenoid, which has been used for centuries in Asian medicine, due to its anti-inflammatory activity. Synthetic triterpenoids such as CDDO have been found to be potent inducers of the transcriptional activity of Nrf2, resulting in marked induction of NQO-1, HO-1, glutathione transferases, and other cytoprotective enzymes, as well as suppressing induction of iNOS and COX2 at nanomolar concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-DinkovaKostova1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Suh1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Yates2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

These pro-inflammatory genes have been implicated in inflammatory pathways involved in a number of neurodegenerative diseases including PD, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Liberatore1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Klivenyi2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Kiaei1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Thus pharmacological agents that have the ability to activate the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway hold great promise for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative diseases. One such class of compounds known to activate this pathway is the triterpenoids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Liby1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Triterpenoids are synthesized by the cyclization of squalene, a triterpene hydrocarbon found ubiquitously in nature including plants and humans. More than 20,000 triterpenoids are known to occur in nature of which oleanolic acid has been used for centuries in traditional Asian medicine, due to its anti-inflammatory activity. Using an assay for iNOS, a derivative of oleanolic acid CDDO (2-cyano-3, 12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid) was identified that is over 200,000 times more active than its parent molecule oleanolic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Liby1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Structure-activity analysis shows that &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;-unsaturated carbonyl groups in CDDO at key positions on rings A and C are essential for enabling Michael addition with a nucleophilic target similar to Keap 1 (a protein with multiple nucleophilic &#x02013;SH residues and a cytoplasmic repressor of Nrf2). This reaction activates the phase 2 responses, an intrinsic mechanism used by cells to deactivate electrophiles or oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Liby1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study, human neuroblastoma cells treated by CDDO-MA demonstrated a stream of changes in the phase 2 response through Nrf2/ARE pathway activation. These include induction of Nrf2 protein levels and subsequent nuclear translocation from the cytosol. The nuclear translocation of Nrf2 resulted in induction of phase 2 genes encoding a coordinated family of cytoprotective proteins that include the enzymes of glutathione synthesis and transfer, the quinone oxidoreductase NQO-1, and the hemeoxygenase HO-1. Significantly, the phase 2 response in neuroblastoma cells due to CDDO-MA was translated functionally by a dose dependent increase in cellular GSH production, one of the major cellular antioxidants under the regulatory control of Nrf2/ARE signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Shih1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Another significant finding in our study is that the phase 2 response due to Nrf2/ARE activation by CDDO-MA is selective and depends on the presence of a functional Nrf2. In mouse embryonic fibroblast cells derived from wild type mice CDDO-MA treatment resulted in induction of mRNA levels for ARE genes such as GSTa3, NQO-1 and HO-1. The induction of these ARE genes was completely absent in embryonic fibroblasts cells from Nrf2 knockout mice. This effect was consistent with the dose-dependent reduction of t-butylhydroperoxide-induced ROS in wild type but not Nrf2 knockout fibroblast cells. It is thus plausible that CDDO-MA may very well enable Michael's addition to its target Keap1 which is the cytosolic repressor of Nrf2, since induction of ARE genes require presence of functional Nrf2 and its translocation from cytosol to nucleus. Previously, the ability of synthetic triterpenoids to activate the ARE pathway in other model systems was demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-DinkovaKostova1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Liby2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Thimmulappa1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. However, our results in the present study for the first time have shown that synthetic triterpenoids such as CDDO-MA are potent inducers of Nrf2 expression, and activators of the ARE pathway in a neuronal cell line.</p><p>Previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showed that neuronal cultures derived from Nrf2 knockout mice have increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, as well as damage produced by mitochondrial electron transport chain complex inhibitors such as rotenone, MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, 3-NP and malonate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Lee2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

Conversely, the implantation of intrastriatal grafts of astrocytes overexpressing Nrf2, produced neuroprotection against the neurotoxic effects of malonate. Recently, transgenic mice overexpressing Nrf2 in astrocytes were shown to be resistant to MPTP toxicity and to extend survival when crossed with a transgenic mouse mode of ALS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Chen1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Vargas1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. In order to study the neuroprotective efficacy of CDDO-MA induced activation of Nrf2/ARE pathway <italic>in vivo</italic> we used two neurotoxic paradigms of MPTP, involving acute 7-day and chronic continuous infusion for four weeks in mice. Administration of CDDO-MA produced significant neuroprotection against loss of striatal dopamine and its metabolites. Furthermore, it produced significant protection against loss of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive neurons in the SNpc. These data are consistent with MPTP-induced enhanced susceptibility to nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Nrf2 knockout mice, suggesting that impairment of Nrf2/ARE signaling is an important mediator of dopaminergic neurodegeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Burton1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, in the chronic MPTP neurotoxicity paradigm, there was increased accumulation of &#x003b1;-synuclein (a neuropathological feature seen in PD) in dopaminergic neurons, which was blocked by administration of CDDO-MA. This is consistent with other reports where chronic administration of MPTP, and other toxins which specifically target mitochondria such as rotenone and paraquat, produce mitochondrial dysfunction leading to oxidative stress resulting in &#x003b1;-synuclein accumulation in SNpc neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Fornai1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Thomas2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Betarbet1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-ManningBog1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our findings demonstrate that administration of CDDO-MA reduced the striatal lesion volumes by more than 70&#x00025;. Histological evaluation confirmed that CDDO-MA significantly protects against 3-NP induced neuronal death. Additionally, we observed that CDDO-MA blocked 3-NP induced increases in 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, a marker of oxidative damage to DNA, and malondialdehyde levels in the striatum and cortex. Increases in F<sub>2</sub>-Isoprostanes (F<sub>2</sub>-IsoPs) in cerebral cortex produced by 3-NP were blocked by CDDO-MA. F<sub>2</sub>-Isoprostanes are prostaglandin-like lipids derived from the free-radical mediated peroxidation of arachidonic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Milne1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Montine1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.

Furthermore, increased production of glutathione, due to induction of glutathione synthetic enzymes is a well known effect of increased expression of the Nrf2/ARE genes. We found that administration of 3-NP significantly reduced striatal concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH), and the reduction in GSH and the ratio of GSH/GSSG were completely prevented by CDDO-MA administration. This is consistent with adenoviral overexpression of Nrf2 in the striatum, which mainly infects astrocytes, which was sufficient to reduce 3-NP toxicity <italic>in vivo</italic> by synthesis of GSH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Shih1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

These Nrf2 overexpressing astrocytes secrete high levels of glutathione, providing a means for a small number of astrocytes to affect the survival of a much larger number of neurons. Similar observations were made in transgenic mice overexpressing Nrf2 in astrocytes.

Motor neuron protection was dependent on glutathione secretion <italic>in vitro</italic> and spinal cord glutathione levels were increased <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results demonstrating a dose-dependent increase of cellular GSH levels in neuroblastoma cells following CDDO-MA treatment, also suggests that CDDO-MA not only impacts glutathione synthesis in astrocytes <italic>in vivo,</italic> but also may activate inherent neuronal GSH synthesis to provide neuroprotection against 3-NP neurotoxicity.</p><p>In summary the present study demonstrates that CDDO-MA is a potent activator of Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway and renders neuroprotection against MPTP and 3-NP neurotoxicity. We recently showed that CDDO-MA reduces &#x003b2;-amyloid deposition and improves memory in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005757-Dumont1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. In that study we showed that administration of CDDO-MA increased brain levels of HO-1, an Nrf2/ARE dependent enzyme. These results provide compelling evidence for the utility of pharmacological agents known to activate Nrf2/ARE mediated phase 2 detoxification genes for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Currently the parent compound, CDDO, and its close relative, CDDO-methyl ester, are in Phase I studies for the treatment of cancer. For applications in neurodegenerative disease, the superior pharmacokinetics of CDDO-MA in the brain provides a rationale for further investigation of this agent, as well as related triterpenoid amides. Our data provide a strong rationale for further preclinical investigation of CDDO-MA and other related amides, directed toward eventual clinical trials in patients with Parkinson's and Huntington's disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture studies</title><p>Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10&#x00025; FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 &#x000b5;g/ml streptomycin at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified atmosphere of 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>.

A modified avidin-biotin-peroxidase technique was employed for immunohistochemistry. Briefly, 35 micrometer thick coronal brain sections were pretreated with 3&#x00025; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in 0.1 M PBS for 30 min. The sections were rinsed in PBS twice for 5 min each. The sections were incubated sequentially in (a) 1&#x00025; bovine serum albumin (BSA)/0.2&#x00025; Triton X-100 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 30 minutes, (b) appropriate primary antibodies (rabbit anti-TH affinity purified antibody (1&#x02236;4,000; Chemicon, Temecula, CA), rabbit immunoaffinity purified anti-nitrotyrosine (4 &#x000b5;g/ml; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), rabbit polyclonal anti-malondialdehyde (1&#x02236;1,000; provided by Dr. C.

The immunoreaction was visualized using 3,3&#x02032;-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride dihydrate (DAB) with nickel intensification (Vector Laboratories) as the chromogen. All incubations and rinses were performed at room temperature with agitation using an orbital shaker. The sections were mounted onto gelatin-coated slides, dehydrated, cleared in xylene and coverslipped.</p><p>For stereological cell counts serial coronal sections (50 &#x000b5;m) were cut through the substantia nigra using a cryostat. Two sets of sections were prepared with each set consisting of 7&#x02013;8 sections, 100 &#x000b5;m apart. One set of sections was stained with Nissl (cresyl violet). Another set was processed for TH immunohistochemistry as described above. The numbers of Nissl-stained or TH-immunoreactive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta were counted using the optical fractionator method in the Stereo Investigator (v 4.35) software program (Microbrightfield, Burlington, VT).</p><p>A qualitative examination was performed to analyze immunoreactivities of &#x003b1;-synuclein, malondialdehyde and nitrotyrosine. The analysis was done using 7 sections per animal (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5 per group).</p><p>One set of serial sections (210 &#x000b5;m apart) immunostained using a mouse antibody against the neuronal marker NeuN were measured for areas of 3-NP-induced NeuN loss to determine the lesion volume using the point-counting method and the cavalieri principle as estimator in the same software program.</p></sec><sec id="s4m"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data represent mean&#x000b1;standard error of means (SEM) from groups of animals. Experimental analysis applied with one-way ANOVA. When F values implied significance at a level p&#x0003c;0.05, Student-Newman-Keul's or Tukey&#x02013;Kramer multiple comparison tests was applied to determine where the differences among groups arose. All statistical analysis was performed using the Graphpad Instat software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Beverly J.
