Although multiple guidance signals have been identified, our understanding of how specific growth cone behaviors and pathfinding steps are regulated <italic>in vivo </italic>is far from complete. We are investigating mechanisms controlling the pathfinding of axons extending from the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle (nucMLF) in the zebrafish brain. The nucMLF neurons are the first neurons to differentiate and extend axons in the midbrain. They navigate uncharted territory and establish a major axon tract upon which multiple later-growing axons extend. We have focused particularly on the initial pathfinding steps that nucMLF axons must make: emergence from the cell body with correct polarity, extension in the correct direction, and convergence into an axon tract or fascicle. These crucial first steps are required by axons of many developing brain nuclei, although little is known about how they are regulated. We identify two guidance signals critical for initial nucMLF axon guidance: laminin, a component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) through which axons grow, and transient axonal glycoprotein-1 (TAG-1), a cell adhesion molecule (CAM) present on axons.</p><p>The first axons to extend in the brain use the ECM and undifferentiated neuroepithelial cells as growth substrata and guidance sources. Laminins are heterotrimeric glycoproteins, consisting of &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x003b3; polypeptide chains, that are secreted into the ECM and form a major component of the ECM in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. <italic>In vitro </italic>studies have shown that laminin provides a permissive substratum for neuronal growth cones by binding and signaling through integrin receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Moreover, laminin can modulate growth cone responsiveness to other extracellular guidance cues, such as netrins and ephrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Interestingly, contact with laminin stimulates axon formation in cultured hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and netrin controls axon initiation in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], suggesting laminin or its modulation of netrin could contribute to the initial polarity of axon emergence. Mutations in particular laminin subunits in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and zebrafish embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], as well as antibody perturbation of laminin in grasshopper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], cause axon guidance defects, indicating that laminins are important for axon guidance <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, our understanding of laminin function and its influence on growth cone behaviors <italic>in vivo </italic>is incomplete.</p><p>CAMs of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily play crucial roles in mediating interaxonal relationships and communication between axons and their surrounding cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. TAG-1 (or its chick homolog axonin-1) is a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked IgCAM present on the surface of growing axons that promotes neurite outgrowth and interacts homophilically and heterophilically with a host of other cell surface molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. <italic>In vitro </italic>assays have shown that interactions with other IgCAMs, including L1 and NrCAM (NrCAM = neuron-glia related cell adhesion molecule), mediate axon outgrowth and cell-cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, interactions of TAG-1 with L1 or NrCAM appear to be required <italic>in vivo </italic>for midline crossing by spinal commissural axons and for target selection by sensory neurons in the chick spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Axon guidance defects in TAG-1 knockout mice have not been shown; however, neuronal migration in the caudal medulla is defective in these animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. We have found previously that TAG-1 knockdown in zebrafish inhibits extension of sensory axons in the spinal cord, although whether this is mediated by a homophilic or heterophilic interaction is unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Despite these studies demonstrating the importance of TAG-1, we have yet to fully understand whether or how TAG-1 controls directional axon guidance decisions or how it influences dynamic growth cone behaviors <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Here we investigate how TAG-1 and laminin-&#x003b1;1 influence growth cone behavior and axon outgrowth during the initial period of nucMLF axon development <italic>in vivo</italic>. Wild-type growth cone behaviors suggest that axon-axon interactions and possibly repulsion by surrounding tissue direct the initial pattern of nucMLF axon growth. Interestingly, TAG-1 knockdown causes defects in the directional extension and initial convergence of MLF axons that, in fixed tissue, appear identical to pathfinding errors previously observed in a laminin-&#x003b1;1 mutant, <italic>bashful </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, <italic>in vivo </italic>time-lapse imaging of growth cone behaviors reveals that although there are some similar effects of TAG-1 or laminin-&#x003b1;1 loss of function, there are also distinct and significant differences. Our results suggest that TAG-1 functions to guide the direction of axon extension by interpreting environmental cues and also mediates positive axon-axon contacts. Laminin-&#x003b1;1 does not appear to affect axon-axon interactions, but does regulate neuronal polarity and influence growth cone responsiveness to surrounding cues.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Characterization of normal MLF axon convergence</title><p>To investigate the guidance cues and growth cone behaviors involved in the initial outgrowth of axons from an early developing brain nucleus, we studied the formation of the zebrafish MLF, one of the first axon tracts to develop in the zebrafish central nervous system (CNS; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The MLF arises from bilateral clusters of neuronal cell bodies, called the nucMLF, that lie in the ventral midbrain. At the onset of MLF formation (16 hours post fertilization (hpf)), the nucMLF consists of 6&#x02013;8 neurons and by 24 hpf the cluster has grown to approximately 30&#x02013;35 neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. During the initial wave of axonogenesis (16&#x02013;30 hpf), unipolar nucMLF cells each extend an axon caudally along the ipsilateral ventral neural tube. The caudal-most nucMLF cell extends the leading MLF axon into the hindbrain and then the more rostrally positioned cells extend axons that fasciculate with the leading axon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. We have previously reported that Semaphorin3D, which is expressed both rostral and medial to the nucMLFs, plays a role in repelling nucMLF axons in the caudal direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]; however, nothing is known about other extracellular cues involved in guiding the initial pathfinding decisions of nucMLF axons. Here, we further investigate guidance mechanisms that control how nucMLF axons initially extend in the correct direction and fasciculate with the leading nucMLF axon.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Initial extension and convergence of MLF axons.</bold><bold>(a-e) </bold>Ventral views, anterior to the left.

To specifically visualize nucMLF neurons, we used a transgenic line in which a <italic>pitx2 </italic>promoter construct drives green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression (<italic>Tg(pitx2c:gfp)</italic>) in nucMLF neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b&#x02013;e</xref>; see Materials and methods). We verified that all nucMLF neurons are labeled by double labeling embryos with antibodies against ZN-12, a marker of nucMLF neurons, and GFP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). At the onset of nucMLF axonogenesis, cell bodies each extended one axon in the direction of the caudal-most nucMLF cell body (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c&#x02013;e</xref>, asterisk), which extended its own axon into the hindbrain, parallel to the ventral midline. In their initial trajectory, the earliest nucMLF axons typically did not contact neighboring axons since their cell bodies were positioned at some distance from one another, but later as these axons approached the caudal-most nucMLF cell and as the number of nucMLF cells increased, axon-axon contact was prevalent. Interestingly, the axons did not appear to extend into the tissue surrounding the nucMLF. Rather, they appeared to extend directly toward the caudal-most nucMLF cell body and eventually converged on a point just rostral to this cell (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c&#x02013;e</xref>, arrow). In our subsequent analysis, we will refer to this point as the convergence point. Beyond the convergence point, MLF axons extend into the hindbrain as a tight fascicle.</p></sec><sec><title>Axon-axon interactions and the surrounding tissue contribute to the convergence of nucMLF axons</title><p>To better understand nucMLF growth cone behaviors and gain insight into potential guidance factors that might control initial axon direction, convergence, and fasciculation, we performed <italic>in vivo </italic>time-lapse imaging of these neurons. We reasoned that specific growth cone behaviors (that is, retraction, pausing, branching, and so on) would reflect underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for these behaviors. To visualize growing nucMLF axons <italic>in vivo</italic>, we removed the yolk cell from <italic>Tg(pitx2c:gfp) </italic>embryos and imaged the nucMLF from the ventral side of the embryo proper (see Materials and methods for details), beginning at approximately 16 hpf. Consistent with the fixed staging series, each nucMLF neuron extended one axon from its caudal side, which grew towards the convergence point. Once growth cones contacted neighboring MLF axons, they maintained these contacts and extended along the axon <italic>en route </italic>to the convergence point. This behavior was highly conserved and these interactions appeared to expedite growth towards the convergence point, suggesting that axon-axon contacts may be important for MLF formation (n = 11 embryos, 32 growth cones; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). In some cases, axons extended from cell bodies that were positioned up to 25 &#x003bc;m from their nearest neighbor, and, therefore, the majority of their path towards the convergence point was not along a neighboring axon. This observation suggested that axon-axon interactions were not the only factor required for proper convergence. Indeed, we found that if a wild-type growth cone extended aberrantly into the surrounding tissue, away from the convergence point, it was able to retract and redirect its growth in the appropriate direction without contact with other axons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). This result suggests that nucMLF axons are guided by surrounding tissues, perhaps by repulsive cues that funnel them towards the convergence point.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>MLF growth cones fasciculate along neighboring MLF axons and are inhibited by surrounding tissue.</bold><bold>(a, b) </bold>Images from time-lapse sequence of MLF axon outgrowth in uninjected <italic>Tg(pitx2c:gfp) </italic>embryos.

We examined the expression of TAG-1 protein during initial stages of MLF development (16&#x02013;24 hpf), and found that it is expressed on the nucMLF axons and weakly on the nucMLF cell bodies throughout these stages (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b&#x02013;d</xref>, and data not shown). In addition, TAG-1 is expressed on axons from the nucleus of the tract of the postoptic commissure (nucTPOC) that begin to extend past the lateral side of the nucMLF around 19&#x02013;20 hpf, and on a couple of cells lateral to the nucMLF, but not otherwise in the surrounding neuroepithelium. We injected <italic>Tg(pitx2c:gfp) </italic>embryos at the 1&#x02013;4 cell stage with a translation blocking TAG-1 morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (TAG1MO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], allowed them to develop to 24 hpf, and examined the pattern of nucMLF axon outgrowth in fixed embryos by immunolabeling with an anti-GFP antibody. We have previously shown that injection of TAG1MO, but not a standard control morpholino (STDCONMO), eliminates TAG-1 immunolabeling, indicating the loss of TAG-1 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. TAG-1 knockdown caused several defects in nucMLF axon initial growth and convergence, but did not appear to alter the number of nucMLF neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3i&#x02013;k, m</xref>). Normally, nucMLF axons initially extend only within the area containing the nucMLF cell bodies (called the 'nucMLF zone'; outlined in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3i&#x02013;l</xref>) prior to reaching the convergence point. However, after TAG-1 knockdown, nucMLF axons aberrantly extended into the tissue medial, lateral, and rostral to the nucMLF zone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3k</xref>, open arrowhead). This phenotype was observed in 67.6% (n = 173) of TAG1MO injected embryos, compared with only 8.4% (n = 107) of STDCONMO injected embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3i&#x02013;k, m</xref>). In addition, the axons converged at a point more caudal than the typical convergence point in 73.2% (n = 168) of embryos injected with TAG1MO, while injection of STDCONMO caused this defect in only 8.4% (n = 107) of embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3i&#x02013;k</xref>, arrowheads, and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3m</xref>).</p><p>Knockdown of TAG-1 also significantly stunted nucMLF axon outgrowth. Normally, the leading edge of the MLF has reached the anterior spinal cord by 24 hpf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]; however after TAG-1 knockdown, MLF axons had not extended beyond the anterior hindbrain in 62.2% (n = 172) of embryos, compared with only 2.8% (n = 107) of STDCONMO injected embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3j, m</xref>). To determine whether these defects were specifically due to TAG-1 knockdown and not to nonspecific morpholino effects, we attempted to rescue the defects by co-injecting TAG1MO with a TAG-1 mRNA construct that did not include the majority of the TAG1MO binding region. TAG-1 overexpression did not cause any non-specific gross morphological changes, but did significantly reduce the percentage of embryos with nucMLF defects, suggesting that these defects are specific to TAG-1 knockdown (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3m</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown of L1, another Ig superfamily CAM that is expressed by the nucMLF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], did not cause the above defects, although it did cause MLF defasciculation in the hindbrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], suggesting that not all CAMs expressed by these neurons are required for MLF axon convergence. Together, these data suggest that TAG-1 is required for the efficient convergence of nucMLF axons and that it potentially functions to promote positive axon-axon interactions and/or allow nucMLF axons to interpret signals from the surrounding tissue.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>TAG-1 or laminin-&#x003b1;1 loss of function disrupts normal MLF axon convergence.</bold><bold>(a-l) </bold>Ventral views, anterior to the left.

The similar defects suggest that TAG-1 and laminin-&#x003b1;1 may function together to guide the initial convergence of nucMLF axons or that they may have similar influences on growth cone behavior to produce comparable pathfinding defects. However, the fixed tissue analysis of nucMLF axon defects was insufficient to address these questions.</p></sec><sec><title>NucMLF growth cones exhibit behavioral defects after TAG-1 or laminin-&#x003b1;1 loss of function</title><p>To determine how TAG-1 and laminin-&#x003b1;1 loss of function influences nucMLF growth cone behaviors, we performed <italic>in vivo </italic>time-lapse imaging in TAG1MO injected <italic>Tg(pitx2c:gfp) </italic>embryos and <italic>bal</italic>;<italic>Tg(pitx2c:gfp) </italic>embryos. Interestingly, live imaging results indicate these cues play both overlapping and unique roles in regulating nucMLF growth cone behaviors to cause the apparently identical defects observed in fixed tissue. In TAG1MO injected or <italic>bal </italic>embryos, axons extended in aberrant directions and into the tissue surrounding the nucMLF zone, without retracting or immediately correcting their growth direction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a, b</xref> and Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). Some of these misdirected axons eventually converged with other nucMLF axons that had extended properly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>, arrowhead), while others approached or crossed the ventral midline (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a, b</xref>, arrows) or grew laterally after exiting the nucMLF zone. Interestingly, axons extended into medial (30%, n = 49 axons in 10 embryos) and lateral (23%, n = 49 axons in 10 embryos) tissues with comparable frequency after TAG-1 knockdown. However, in <italic>bal </italic>embryos, the majority of axons extending into surrounding tissue grew towards the ventral midline (53%, n = 80 axons in 8 embryos; 16% extended laterally), and in some cases, these axons accelerated as they neared the midline. To quantify the directional outgrowth errors, we determined the average percentage of time that axons extended in the correct direction ('on-track') and whether each MLF axon initially emerged from its cell body in an 'on-track' or 'off-track' position. We defined 'on-track' as growth within a region defined by a line extending from the cell body at 90 degrees to the nucMLF centerline and another line connecting the cell body to the convergence point (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>). The nucMLF centerline was defined as an imaginary line drawn along the MLF and extending rostrally through the nucMLF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a, c</xref>, dashed line). Growth outside of this region or across the nucMLF centerline was considered 'off-track'. On average, axons spent significantly more time growing off-track after TAG-1 or laminin-&#x003b1;1 loss of function (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>). Axons from uninjected embryos extended off-track only 3% of the time (n = 40 axons in 11 embryos). However, axons in TAG1MO injected and <italic>bal </italic>embryos grew off-track 35% (n = 44 axons in 10 embryos) and 75% (n = 31 axons in 8 embryos) of the time, respectively. In <italic>bal </italic>embryos, a significant number of axons (40%, n = 83 axons in 8 embryos; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4e</xref>) initially emerged from their cell bodies in an incorrect direction, which may, at least in part, explain why these axons grew off-track the majority of the time measured. In contrast, the majority of axons in TAG1MO injected embryos emerged from their cell bodies in an on-track position and later extended off-track. Taken together, these data suggested that TAG-1 and laminin-&#x003b1;1 may both be required for nucMLF growth cones to be guided by the surrounding tissue and that laminin-&#x003b1;1 is important for establishing the initial polarity of nucMLF neurons.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>TAG-1 or laminin-&#x003b1;1 loss of function causes misdirected MLF axon outgrowth.</bold><bold>(a, b) </bold>Images from timelapse sequence of MLF axon outgrowth in TAG1MO injected (a) and <italic>bal;Tg(pitx2c:gfp) </italic>(b) embryos.

In TAG1MO injected embryos, we commonly observed growth cones contacting neighboring axons and then subsequently retracting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). In many cases, growth cones would sample multiple other axons, but fail to maintain any of the interactions. None of these behaviors were observed in <italic>bal </italic>embryos where aberrantly guided axons maintained their interactions once they contacted other axons (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>, and Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>). To quantify the maintenance of axon-axon interactions, we calculated the average percentage of time in which growth cones were in contact with neighboring axons once contact was initiated, the average duration of each contact, and the average number of axons contacted per growth cone. On average, axons in TAG1MO injected embryos were in contact with neighboring axons only 47% (n = 22 axons in 10 embryos) of the time compared with 95% (n = 32 axons in 11 embryos) and 96% (n = 11 axons in 8 embryos) of the time in uninjected and <italic>bal </italic>embryos, respectively (compare Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Moreover, the average duration of these contacts was 70 minutes (n = 35 axon contacts in 10 embryos) in TAG1MO injected embryos versus 176 minutes (n = 34 axon contacts in 11 embryos) and 177 minutes (n = 12 axon contacts in 8 embryos) in uninjected and <italic>bal </italic>embryos, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref>). Finally, prior to converging, each growth cone contacted an average of 1.06 axons (n = 32 growth cones in 11 embryos) in uninjected and 1.09 axons (n = 11 growth cones in 8 embryos) in <italic>bal </italic>embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5e</xref>). However, after TAG-1 knockdown, each growth cone sampled 1.6 axons (n = 22 growth cones in 10 embryos; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5e</xref>), suggesting that growth cones repeatedly sample neighboring axons despite their inability to maintain these interactions. The failed axon interactions in TAG1MO injected embryos may contribute to their increased off-track extension since these axons often changed their trajectory and extended away from the nucMLF centerline after breaking contact with a neighboring axon. Moreover, these axon-axon defects may have potential additional consequences in terms of neuronal polarity. In one case, we observed the growth cone of a newly emerged MLF axon contact a neighboring axon and then collapse (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>, arrow). After collapsing, the axon retracted to its cell body and then what appeared to be a new axon emerged from the opposite side of the cell body, consequently changing the neuron's polarity. We never observed such polarity changes in uninjected embryos, nor did we ever observe a nucMLF neuron extend multiple axons and then prune all but one axon in any of the groups. Collectively, these observations suggested that TAG-1 knockdown reduced positive axon-axon interactions, which can cause nucMLF axons to grow off-track and possibly influence nucMLF neuronal polarity.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>TAG-1 knockdown causes defects in MLF axon-axon interactions.</bold><bold>(a, b) </bold>Images from time-lapse sequence of MLF axon outgrowth in TAG1MO injected (a) and <italic>bal;Tg(pitx2c:gfp) </italic>(b) embryos.

Therefore, we quantified the growth rate of axons in uninjected, TAG1MO injected, and <italic>bal </italic>embryos from their initial extension until they reached the convergence point or an equivalent position in the rostral-caudal axis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>).

Normally, nucMLF axons converge and fasciculate soon after extending from their cell bodies. Our results suggest this growth pattern is driven by a combination of guidance by surrounding tissue and axon-axon fasciculation. TAG-1 or laminin-&#x003b1;1 loss of function disrupted this stereotypical outgrowth pattern. First, TAG-1 or laminin-&#x003b1;1 loss of function caused MLF axons to aberrantly extend into the surrounding tissue. TAG-1 knockdown also caused MLF growth cones to retract from neighboring MLF axons, which led to aberrant directional extension of MLF axons and possibly influenced changes in neuronal polarity. Axon-axon interactions appeared normal in <italic>bal </italic>embryos; however, neuronal polarity was affected, since MLF axons often emerged from their cell bodies in the incorrect direction. MLF axons were also excessively branched in <italic>bal </italic>embryos. Finally, MLF axons in TAG1MO injected or <italic>bal </italic>embryos exhibited reduced growth rates and were stalled in the hindbrain. Taken together, these results reveal critical roles for TAG-1 and laminin-&#x003b1;1 in controlling specific growth cone behaviors, neuronal polarity, and directional outgrowth to guide proper formation of a major CNS pathway.</p><p>Interestingly, TAG-1 may serve dual functions in mediating nucMLF axon pathfinding as it appears to be required for sensing a signal in the surrounding tissue and for mediating axon-axon interactions. Several Ig superfamily CAMs, including TAG-1, have been shown to mediate axon fasciculation via homophilic and heterophilic binding partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Therefore, the defective nucMLF axon-axon interactions caused by TAG-1 knockdown were not surprising. It is highly possible that TAG-1 promotes adhesion among nucMLF axons either homophilically or heterophilically, although a heterophilic partner has not been determined in this case. The apparent consequences of these failed interactions were more intriguing. Often, growth cone retraction upon contacting a neighboring axon was followed by a change in direction and extension into the surrounding tissue, suggesting that these defective interactions may have contributed to further pathfinding errors. Furthermore, in a few cases, defective axon-axon interactions led to the complete retraction of the original axon and the emergence of a new axon on the opposite side of the neuron, thus altering the polarity and directional extension of nucMLF axons. Collectively, these results exemplify the significance of TAG-1 mediated axon-axon interactions not only to fasciculation, but also to directional guidance and neuronal polarity. Finally, it is possible that TAG-1 mediates interactions between nucMLF and nucTPOC axons, which also extend through the midbrain and join the MLF. However, nucTPOC axons grow into this region 2&#x02013;3 hours after the initial outgrowth of nucMLF axons and appeared unaffected by TAG-1 knockdown.</p><p>In addition to this expected role for TAG-1, our results also suggest TAG-1 is required for nucMLF axons to sense a guidance signal from the environment because TAG-1 knockdown also caused nucMLF axons to grow in aberrant directions without first contacting other axons. This signal potentially could be an inhibitory cue located in tissue surrounding the nucMLF and/or an attractive cue emanating from the convergence point. This finding is interesting because TAG-1 is not known to function as a receptor for repulsive or attractive ligands. However, related Ig superfamily CAMs, such as L1 and NrCAM, have recently been shown to be required receptor components for repulsive semaphorin signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Thus, these observations raise the intriguing possibility that TAG-1 may also serve as a receptor component for repulsive and/or attractive ligands <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Laminin also appears to be involved in preventing MLF axon growth into inappropriate surrounding tissues and orienting outgrowth direction. Laminin is expressed throughout the basal lamina upon which MLF axons extend, and thus it could function directly to guide nucMLF axons by signaling via integrins or other receptor molecules on nucMLF growth cones. Alternatively, laminin-&#x003b1;1 may affect axons indirectly through more global effects on brain organization or by binding and presenting other guidance signals. An interesting possibility is that laminin-&#x003b1;1 may regulate growth cone responsiveness to other cues expressed by the surrounding tissue, such as netrin or ephrin, which have been shown to elicit repulsion in the presence of laminin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Without functional laminin-&#x003b1;1, nucMLF axons may be attracted or non-responsive to such cues. Interestingly, in <italic>bal</italic>, misguided axons appeared biased to extend towards the ventral midline rather than wandering in all directions equally. This observation suggests that laminin-&#x003b1;1 indirectly regulates axon repulsion by another cue in the midline region because laminin-&#x003b1;1 is expressed broadly, not only at the midline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>Loss of laminin-&#x003b1;1 also caused defects in polarity and branching. Establishing appropriate neuronal polarity is arguably the first step towards properly guiding an axon because it determines the initial direction of axon outgrowth. Normally, almost all nucMLF neurons immediately extended their axon in the direction of the convergence point. However, in <italic>bal</italic>, we observed a significant number of neurons that initially extended axons in aberrant directions, suggesting that laminin-&#x003b1;1 is critical for establishing the proper polarity of these neurons. Again, whether nucMLF neuronal polarity is directly or indirectly regulated by laminin-&#x003b1;1 remains to be determined. Recently, netrin was shown to regulate neuronal asymmetry and define the site of axon formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It is possible that these roles may also require the presence of laminin, similar to netrin-mediated repulsion. Functionally, the nucMLF polarity defect may also have contributed to the increased percentage of time that axons extended off-track. In addition to polarity defects, axons were excessively branched in <italic>bal</italic>. It might be surprising that loss of laminin-&#x003b1;1, which usually functions as a permissive growth substratum, would directly stimulate increased branching. However, it is possible that the loss of laminin-&#x003b1;1 created an inhibitory substratum causing growth cone stalling or retraction, which has been correlated with back branching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. These observations reveal novel roles for laminin-&#x003b1;1 in establishing neuronal polarity and regulating axon branching.</p><p>TAG-1 or laminin-&#x003b1;1 loss of function ultimately caused nucMLF axons to prematurely stall in the hindbrain. Interestingly, the stalled axons were almost always observed in the anterior hindbrain, instead of being positioned along a continuum from the anterior hindbrain to the anterior spinal cord, where they should have reached by 24 hpf. This observation suggests that an additional cue may be required to promote axon extension through this region and that late arriving axons may miss the temporal expression window of this factor. Alternatively, nucMLF axons may become non-responsive to the potential factor in the absence of TAG-1 and/or laminin-&#x003b1;1 function. In any case, it is interesting that the position of stalled nucMLF axons is the same in embryos deficient for TAG-1 or laminin-&#x003b1;1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Collectively, our live imaging data reveal that TAG-1 and laminin-&#x003b1;1 loss of function cause some similar defects in nucMLF growth cone behavior, while also causing defects unique to the loss of each gene. The fact that both contributed to restricting nucMLF axon outgrowth to within the nucMLF zone might suggest that TAG-1 and laminin-&#x003b1;1 may function cooperatively to mediate inhibition of growth cones by surrounding tissue. One possibility is that TAG-1 and laminin-&#x003b1;1 act in separate signaling pathways, with common and distinct downstream effectors. Alternatively, laminin-&#x003b1;1 in the environment may directly bind TAG-1 on nucMLF growth cones, although no such interaction has been demonstrated. Instead, laminin-&#x003b1;1 may indirectly regulate the presentation of a binding partner of TAG-1. Future experiments will be required to address these alternative mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were maintained in a laboratory breeding colony on a 14/10 h light/dark cycle.
