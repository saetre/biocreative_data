Filensin and phakinin are believed to function in the maintenance of lens transparency. To elucidate the function of filensin and phakinin at the molecular level, we examined the degradation of these two proteins in normal and cataractous rat lenses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A hereditary cataract model, the Shumiya cataract rat (SCR), was used for these studies. Anti-filensin antibodies were raised against three different regions of the protein, the rod domain, the inner region of the tail domain, and the outer region of the tail domain. Anti-filensin and anti-phakinin antibodies were used to examine the conformation of degradation of filensin and phakinin by western blot analysis and fluorescent immunocytochemistry of cryosectioned lenses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the normal lens, filensin was processed from a 94 kDa protein to proteins of 50 kDa and 38 kDa. Similarly, phakinin was processed from a 49 kDa protein to one of 40 kDa. The concentrations of filensin and phakinin in the rat lens cortex fluctuated with age and decreased during cataractogenesis. The 50 kDa form of filensin decreased significantly before opacification. In the normal lens, phakinin, the filensin rod domain, and the filensin inner tail domain localized to membrane lining regions in the shallow cortex and to the central region of the cytoplasm in the deep cortex. The COOH-terminal domain of filensin localized to the membrane lining region in the deep cortex. In pre-cataractous lenses, phakinin and the filensin rod domain localized primarily to the membranes lining the shallow cortex region and were distributed throughout the cytoplasm of lens fiber cells in the deep cortex.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The 50 kDa form of filensin is important for the localization of beaded filaments in lens fiber cells and for lens transparency.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>f5-style</meta-name><meta-value>two-column</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The lens of the eye is composed of two types of cells, epithelial cells, which form a monolayer at the anterior surface of the lens, and lens fiber cells, which originate from epithelial cells and are highly differentiated. Lens fiber cells lack organelles, have lens-specific structures such as gap junctions and beaded filaments, and synthesize lens-specific proteins. Beaded filaments are lens fiber cell-specific intermediate filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>] composed of two proteins, filensin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>] and phakinin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. Beaded filaments are 15&#x02013;20 nm in diameter and consist of globular particles with a periodicity of 19&#x02013;21 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. Primary amino-acid sequence analysis shows that filensin and phakinin are members of the intermediate filament family of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Similar to other intermediate filament proteins: the structure of filensin consists of a head domain, a rod domain that can be divided into three subdomains (1A, 1B, and 2), and a COOH-terminal tail domain. Phakinin is similar in structure to filensin but lacks a COOH-terminal tail domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. Filensin and phakinin copolymerize to form beaded filaments at a stoichiometry of 1:2 to 1:3 both in vivo and in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>] but are unable to polymerize with vimentin, another member of the intermediate filament protein family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>].</p><p>Beaded filament proteins are found exclusively in the fiber cells of the lens in all vertebrate orders examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>], which suggests that beaded filaments play a critical role in lens function. Previous studies have shown that the deletion of filensin or phakinin expression in mice by gene targeting causes cataracts and that some forms of hereditary cataracts in humans are caused by mutations of filensin or phakinin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. These data suggest that beaded filaments play an important role in lens transparency. Full-length filensin is processed into smaller fragments in the normal lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>], but the significance of its degradation and the function of the degraded protein are unknown.</p><p>The Shumiya cataract rat (SCR) hereditary cataract was derived from a congenic line of SHR-fa rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>], and 66.7% of the animals develop cataracts. Lens opacity first appears in the nuclear and perinuclear regions in 11-week-old SCRs and later develops into a mature cataract. Cataract SCR can be distinguished from normal SCR at six weeks of age by slit-lamp microscopy. The phenotype of the cataract SCR lens manifests as wrinkles along the Y suture. In contrast, the surface of the lens in normal rats and normal SCRs is smooth.</p><p>In the current study, we examined normal and pre-cataract SCR lenses at 6 and 10 weeks of age and cataract SCR lenses at 12 weeks of age to determine the role of filensin and phakinin degradation and localization during aging and cataractogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Wistar rats and Japanese white rabbits were purchased from Sankyo Labo Service Corporation (Tokyo, Japan).

In this report, we have shown that filensin is processed into two smaller molecular weight proteins of 50 and 38 kDa in the normal rat lens. It has been reported that filensin is processed in a similar manner in normal bovine lenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Using antibodies specific for different domains of the protein, we have shown that both the 50 kDa and 38 kDa forms of filensin contain the rod domain and the 50 kDa form of filensin contains a portion of the tail domain that is adjacent to the rod domain.</p><p>Presumably, the 50 kDa, 38 kDa, and 36 kDa forms of filensin are products of proteolytic cleavage; however, there are few known proteinases in the lens. Calpain is a calcium-activated cysteine protease, and many isoforms of calpain have been identified in the lens including calpain 2, calpain 3, calpain 10, LP82, and LP85 in the lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. However, filensin is processed into 50 kDa, 38 kDa, and 36 kDa forms in the normal lens in which calcium levels are very low, suggesting that the filensin cleavage products are not generated by calpain. Calpains are activated by calcium, and calcium levels rise in the lens after the onset of cataractogenesis. In the SCR lens, calpain has been suggested to be the major proteinase involved in cataractogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. Crystallins are also believed to be targets of calpain-mediated degradation, and insoluble aggregates of truncated crystallin have been proposed to play a role in the formation of cataracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>].</p><p>Additional candidate proteinases that are present in the lens are caspase and the proteasome. Caspase activates a DNase that is involved in lens development and nuclear degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>], and proteasomes are involved in the complete digestion of cellular proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. Thus, neither caspase nor the proteasome are likely candidates for the proteinase that cleave filensin.</p><p>In the pre-cataract SCR lens, the degradation of filensin and phakinin was accelerated compared to normal rat lenses. The mRNA sequences of filensin and phakinin are the same in Wistar, cataract SCR, and normal SCR lenses (data not shown). Furthermore, we performed a semi-quantitative analysis of filensin and phakinin mRNA levels and found that they are similar in all three types of lens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>). This data indicates that the degradation of filensin and phakinin in pre-cataract SCR lenses is not caused by decreased transcription or conformation changes brought about by alterations in the primary amino-acid sequences of the proteins. Thus, an unidentified protease and/or peptidase is likely to be involved in the degradation of filensin and phakinin. Presumably, different proteases are involved in generating the 50 and 38 kDa forms of filensin. Furthermore, generation of the 50 kDa form of filensin may involve a different enzyme in cataract SCRs than in normal rats.</p></sec><sec><title>Polymerization of filensin and phakinin and the role of beaded filaments</title><p>Filensin and phakinin copolymerize into beaded filaments at a molar ratio of 1:2 to 1:3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. Structural studies have suggested that beaded filaments are 15&#x02013;20 nm in diameter and that the &#x0201c;beads&#x0201d; have a periodicity of 19&#x02013;21 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. However, a detailed molecular structure of beaded filaments has yet to be reported. It has been suggested that the filensin tail domain comprises the bead portion of the beaded filament [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. It has also been reported that the bead portion includes a third component, &#x003b1;-crystallin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. Further complicating the issue, other groups have suggested that the beaded filament is smooth rather than beaded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. Thus, a clear picture of the structure of beaded filaments is still emerging. In addition, all of the molecular components of beaded filaments have not been identified. In the current study, we have shown that in the normal lens, the 94 kDa form of filensin is degraded and that in the deep cortex, the filensin COOH-terminal tail domain localizes to membrane lining regions whereas the filensin rod domain and phakinin localize to the central regions of lens fiber cells. These results suggest that the COOH-terminal region of the tail domain of filensin is not essential for the polymerization of beaded filaments.</p><p>In the normal rat lens, the filensin rod domain and phakinin localized to the membrane lining region in shallow cortex cells and to the central region of the cytoplasm in deep cortex cells. These results are in agreement with previous studies of the mouse lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. In cells of the deep cortex, the filensin tail domain localized to subcellular membranes, but the filensin rod domain did not. As beaded filaments are composed of both filensin and phakinin, the polymerized form of beaded filaments should localize to subcellular membranes in the shallow cortex and to the central region of lens fiber cells in the deep cortex. The physiologic significance of the transition from membrane lining regions to the central region of the fiber cell during fiber cell differentiation is unknown. It is possible that the beaded filament is necessary for the formation of adhesion structures in young elongated fiber cells or that the structure that underlies the fiber cell membrane may be necessary for beaded filament polymerization in the shallow cortex of the lens. Polymerized beaded filaments separate from the cell membrane and localize to the center of fiber cells where they may play an important role in the maintenance of lens transparency. In the deep cortex of pre-cataract SCR lenses, filensin and phakinin were distributed throughout the cytoplasm. This result indicates that filensin and phakinin are not incorporated into beaded filaments in the deep cortex of pre-cataract SCR lenses and that polymerized beaded filaments in deep cortex cells are important for lens transparency.</p><p>The 50 kDa form of filensin was markedly decreased in pre-cataract and cataract lenses, and the localization of filensin was disordered in the deep cortex of pre-cataract lenses. These results indicate that the 50 kDa form of filensin is important for the polymerization of beaded filaments and lens transparency. The 38 kDa form of filensin was detected at very low levels in the lens cortices of young animals, which indicates that the 38 kDa form of filensin is not required for beaded filament polymerization. In conclusion, we have shown that polymerized beaded filaments are important for lens transparency and that the 50 kDa form of filensin may be a critical component of beaded filaments.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
