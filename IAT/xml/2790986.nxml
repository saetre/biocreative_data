PON2 is intracellularly located, is the most ubiquitously expressed PON, and has the highest lactonase activity of the PON family members. Whereas some single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PON1 have resulted in altered enzymatic activity in serum, to date the functional consequences of SNPs on PON2 function remain unknown. We hypothesized that a common PON2 SNP would result in impaired lactonase activity. Substitution of cysteine for serine at codon 311 in recombinant PON2 resulted in normal protein production and localization but altered glycosylation and decreased lactonase activity. Moreover, we screened 200 human lung samples for the PON2 Cys<sup>311</sup> variant and found that <italic>in vivo</italic> this mutation impaired lactonase activity. These data suggest that impaired lactonase activity may play a role in innate immunity, atherosclerosis, and other diseases associated with the PON2 311 SNP.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="CS100">National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id rid="CS100">DK54759</award-id><award-id rid="CS100">AI076671</award-id><award-id rid="CS100">HL61234-09</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The paraoxonase (PON)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4"><sup>3</sup></xref> family consists of three members: PON1, PON2, and PON3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). PON1 was the first family member described and was named for its ability to degrade the organophosphate paraoxon. PON1 was subsequently found to inhibit low density lipoprotein oxidation and be important for cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In addition, analysis of PON1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has linked PON1 to the pathogenesis of numerous other human disorders including atherosclerosis, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, organophosphate susceptibility, and Parkinson disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9 B10">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Despite these numerous association studies, the mechanism(s) underlying the role of PON in disease pathogenesis remains to be fully determined, in part because of uncertainty regarding the endogenous or natural substrate of PON.</p><p>However, the native enzyme activity of PON was recently found to be as a lactonase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), suggesting that despite its known enzymatic promiscuity for other substrates including esters and phosphotriesters, its endogenous substrates are lactones. Importantly, all three PON family members have conserved their lactonase activity, but individual PON family members have widely disparate enzymatic activities toward other substrates. One specific lactone-containing molecule that PONs can degrade is the bacterial quorum-sensing molecule, <italic>N</italic>-3-oxododecanoyl homoserine lactone (3OC12-HSL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). 3OC12-HSL is an acyl-homoserine lactone that <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</named-content>, a common cause of hospital-acquired infections and an important cause of pulmonary morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis, uses to control biofilm formation and virulence factor production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Of the three PON family members, PON2 has the greatest lactonase activity toward 3OC12-HSL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In contrast to PON1 and PON3, PON2 is not present in serum, and it has minimal arylesterase and paraoxonase activity. Human airway epithelial cells degrade 3OC12-HSL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), and murine PON2-deficient airway epithelial cells have an impaired ability to inactivate 3OC12-HSL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In addition, we have recently found that PON1-transgenic <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> are protected from organophosphate poisoning and <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). PON2 activity in airway epithelial cells may represent a novel antibacterial defense mechanism against invading pathogens that utilize acyl-homoserine lactones for quorum sensing and virulence regulation.</p><p>Genetic variation in human genes can have a substantial impact on host responses, and SNP analysis may be used in anticipating responses and outcomes or in adjusting drug dosing. In this study we asked whether a common PON2 SNP, a serine to cysteine amino acid change at codon 311 in PON2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), alters PON2 lactonase activity for 3OC12-HSL. This SNP is fairly common in the general population and is strongly conserved evolutionarily. We chose this PON2 SNP because PON2 has the greatest lactonase activity of PON family members, phylogenetic analysis suggests that PON2 is the oldest PON family member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), and several PON1 SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium with PON2 SNPs. We found that recombinant PON2 Cys<sup>311</sup> exhibits an impaired ability to inactivate 3OC12-HSL and that airway epithelial cells from humans homozygous for Cys/Cys at PON2 amino acid position 311 also have an impaired ability to degrade 3OC12-HSL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Recombinant PON2 Cys<sup>311</sup> or Ser<sup>311</sup> Expression</title><p>Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were used for transfection studies because these cells have no endogenous PON or lactonase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).

PON2 was also sensitive to treatment with Endo H, an endoglycosidase that cleaves the chitobiose core of high mannose and oligosaccharides from <italic>N</italic>-linked glycoproteins. When proteins are correctly processed through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, they become resistant to Endo H. Therefore sensitivity to Endo H indicates the presence of proteins that have not been processed beyond the ER. We observed qualitatively similar results when comparing Endo H, tunicamycin, and PNGase F treatments in both PON2 Cys<sup>311</sup> and Ser<sup>311</sup> samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).

The serine allele is ancestral, has relatively little variation across human populations (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database (dbSNP) data), and is strongly conserved in evolution. We hypothesized that the cysteine for serine substitution at amino acid position 311 in PON2 would disrupt PON2 lactonase activity. We found that the PON2 Cys<sup>311</sup> variant had an impaired ability to inactivate 3OC12-HSL. More importantly, human airway epithelial cells from Cys/Cys homozygous individuals had an impaired ability to degrade 3OC12-HSL, compared with cells from Ser/Ser homozygous individuals. The impaired lactonase activity by Cys/Cys airway epithelia was not due to changes in promoter activity, alternative splicing, or linkage disequilibrium with other PON SNPs or genes because transfection of CHO cells with a plasmid expressing PON2 Cys<sup>311</sup> also showed similar results as primary human airway epithelia.</p><p>Linkage studies of monogenic diseases have resulted in the identification of genes responsible for the pathogenesis of several diseases including cystic fibrosis and Huntington disease. In contrast, association studies of complex genetic diseases often result in the identification of SNPs that may represent false positives or linkage to other genetic mutations. This becomes particularly troubling when the SNPs are found in proteins whose function are poorly understood, when the effect of the SNP on protein function is not known, and when there is no obvious physiologic connection between the gene and the pathogenesis of the studied disease.</p><p>The identification of a physiologic consequence of a SNP becomes important in understanding association studies. A great example is the work of Richter and Furlong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) in their studies determining the &#x0201c;PON1 status&#x0201d; of an individual. These investigators use a functional genomic approach and are able to directly measure, from plasma samples, the PON1 function of an individual based upon hydrolysis of both paraoxon and diazoxon. By using this method, any polymorphisms that might affect PON1 function are taken into account. In addition, hydrolysis of diazoxon quantifies the PON1 levels of an individual, allowing for comparisons in PON1 function to be determined. This assay allows for accurate identification of PON1 phenotype, predicts PON1 E192R status (Glu/Glu, Glu/Arg, or Arg/Arg), and can account for any other yet unidentified SNPs or those changes that may be secondary to a second SNP in linkage disequilibrium with the SNP of interest.</p><p>This functional genomic approach was utilized by Jarvik <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) to study the effects of PON1 polymorphisms on risk of vascular disease, an association that has been inconsistently linked. Examination of PON1 192 or 55 genotypes alone failed to predict the risk of vascular disease of the carotid arteries. However, when genotype status was combined with the rates of substrate analysis, as described above, vascular disease risk was predicted accurately, thus demonstrating the importance of including a functional analysis in association studies. A similar approach was used to test organophosphate hydrolysis by subjects with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). As with vascular disease, discrepant results regarding a linkage between PON1 polymorphisms and ALS exist. Wills <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) reported an increased frequency of the PON1 Arg/Arg<sup>192</sup> variant in ALS patients but similar levels of organophosphate hydrolysis by plasma samples from control and ALS patients. These findings were important because they suggested that if a linkage does exist between the PON1 192 SNP and ALS, etiologies other than organophosphate toxicity are responsible for the association, including disturbances in metabolism of other yet unidentified toxic substances or an effect secondary to linkage disequilibrium with either additional PON variants or other proteins.</p><p>Application of this functional genetic analysis for PON2 is more difficult because PON2 is primarily an intracellular enzyme, as opposed to PON1, which is found in the serum, and no simple assay exists to detect a functional consequence of the PON2 311 SNP in human samples. Furthermore, the natural substrate and <italic>in vivo</italic> physiological function of PON2 are not yet fully elucidated. However, by performing genetic analysis of donor human lung samples and testing 3OC12-HSL degradation by human airway epithelia, we were able to show that the Cys allele at PON2 311 impairs lactonase activity. The <italic>in vivo</italic> physiological consequence of this effect remains to be determined, but our previous data showing that PON2 deficiency in airway epithelial cells impairs the ability of these cells to inactivate 3OC12-HSL suggest that despite the intracellular location of PON2, it may be important in the host response to quorum sensing-dependent bacteria.</p><p>Differing molecular masses of PON2 immunoreactive bands between the PON2 311 alloenzymes were observed, so we investigated the <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation pattern of PON2. In our study, tunicamycin, Endo H, and PNGase F treatment of PON2 Cys<sup>311</sup> and Ser<sup>311</sup> showed that PON2 undergoes <italic>N</italic>-linked core oligosaccharide addition and that following deglycosylation PON2 Cys<sup>311</sup> and Ser<sup>311</sup> immunoreactive bands appeared similar in molecular mass. Using directed evolution, Harel <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) reported a crystal structure of PON1 and suggested that of the four corresponding PON1 asparagine residues, 254 and 323 are most likely core glycosylated because of their location on surface loops. Asparagine 226 and 269 are in the central tunnel of the &#x003b2;-propeller and are predicted not to be glycosylated. These predictions are in agreement with our findings. We found that PON2 Cys<sup>311</sup> has a single molecular mass protein glycosylated at asparagine residues 254 and 323, whereas PON2 Ser<sup>311</sup> had one isoform identical to PON2 Cys<sup>311</sup> (glycosylated at asparagine 254 and 323) and another with a smaller molecular mass only glycosylated at 323. Based upon our findings and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), it appears that differential glycan processing occurs between PON family members and that differential <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation occurs between the PON2 311 alloenzymes. Furthermore, even though we showed that glycosylation is important for PON2 3OC12-HSL degradation, it does not explain the differences seen in PON2 Cys<sup>311</sup> lactonase activity.</p><p>Although we hypothesized that glycosylation at asparagine 323 would inhibit PON2 activity (based upon the differential glycosylation pattern and lactonase activity between PON2 Cys<sup>311</sup> and Ser), this was not the case. Several possible explanations exist for both differential glycosylation and lactonase activity between PON2 Cys<sup>311</sup> and Ser<sup>311</sup>. First, although unlikely, the Cys<sup>311</sup> mutation may affect PON2 function, which in turn affects the glycosylation pathway of other proteins. Second, changes in glycosylation and PON2 function may be completely unrelated. Finally, whereas differential glycosylation may not account for the impaired ability of the PON2 Cys<sup>311</sup> airway epithelia to degrade 3OC12-HSL, the two findings might be related. We hypothesize that the most likely underlying mechanism common to both findings is due to differences in disulfide bond formation. This might result from changes in which cysteine residues undergo disulfide bond formation, changing the number of disulfide bonds formed, or changes in which intermolecular disulfide bonds between cysteine residues of different PON2 molecules occur. For example, the free cysteine residue at position 284 in PON1 is required for its lactonase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), and disruption of PON1 disulfide-linked Cys residues 41 or 352 impaired catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Similarly, we found that treatment of both PON2 Cys<sup>311</sup> and Ser<sup>311</sup> with the reducing agent dithiothreitol (10 m<sc>m</sc>) impaired lactonase activity (data not shown). These data also suggest that disulfide bonds are important for PON2 activity. Alternatively, an altered protein structure or differences in substrate binding to the PON2 active site might account for the phenotype of PON2 Cys<sup>311</sup> mutants. Therefore, it appears that the altered glycosylation profile observed between the PON2 311 alloenzymes is a marker of altered lactonase activity but is not the mechanism for this difference.</p><p>In summary, we found that human airway epithelia homozygous for PON2 Cys<sup>311</sup> have an impaired ability to inactivate 3OC12-HSL. There have been few successes to date in identifying the specific etiologic variant influencing a common disease when an association has been confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), mostly because of inadequate functional assay testing. This is the first time for PON2 that a functional consequence for the 311 SNP has been demonstrated in humans. Moreover, these findings suggest three important speculations. First, infections with quorum sensing-dependent bacteria should have a differential phenotype in patients with the PON2 Cys<sup>311</sup> variant. Second, diseases that associate genetically with this PON2 311 SNP may have an infectious etiology. Third, some of these diseases may be caused by an as yet unidentified metabolic pathway that requires lactonase activity.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by National Institutes of Health Grants DK54759, AI076671, HL61234-09.
