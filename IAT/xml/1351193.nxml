It is a widely accepted theory that an important causative factor is extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, resulting from aberrant inflammation and disruption of the proteinase &#x02013; antiproteinase balance; reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The identity of candidate proteinases has been a subject of much debate, however the balance between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors; the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs), is thought to be important in pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>MMPs are a family of up to 26 homologous endopeptidases, which can collectively degrade all of the protein components of the extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. They are produced by a range of stromal cells and by two of the major inflammatory cells implicated in COPD &#x02013; neutrophils and alveolar macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that levels of MMPs, especially MMP-9, are elevated in the bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from patients with COPD, compared to normal controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and high levels of both MMP-9 and its cognate inhibitor TIMP-1 have been found in sputum from chronic bronchitics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and correlated with decrease in lung function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. While these studies focused on stable COPD, there has been no analysis to date of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 variation during exacerbations.</p><p>Patients with moderate to very severe COPD are prone to frequent exacerbations, which are associated with a poorer health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Exacerbations can be triggered by viral or bacterial infection of the lower respiratory tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] both of which increase airway and systemic inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Exacerbations also contribute to the accelerated decline in FEV1 that is characteristic of COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Using a well monitored group of COPD patients, this study has prospectively investigated changes in sputum levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 during exacerbations in COPD and compared these to samples taken from the same individuals prior to exacerbation. The aim of the study was to see whether the MMP/TIMP balance was upset during exacerbation as this might suggest a pathway between exacerbations, ECM remodelling and lung function decline.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Nineteen patients were recruited from a cohort of patients followed since October 1995 by the East London COPD study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Inclusion criteria and enrolment for the study have been previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The patients were recording on diary cards each morning any increase over their normal, stable condition of (i) dyspnoea, sputum purulence or sputum volume (major symptoms) and (ii) colds (nasal discharge/congestion), wheeze, sore throat, cough and fever (minor symptoms). This was a yes/no answer. Exacerbation onset was identified as the first of two or more consecutive days with increase in either two or more major symptoms, or any one major symptom plus any minor symptom. The prospective data collected on the diary cards before and at onset of the exacerbation showed that peak expiratory flow fell from 246 l/min (223 to 313) averaged over days 14-8 preceding exacerbation by 7.1 l/min (-22 to 3) on the day of onset. Similarly, the number of symptoms rose from zero to 2 (2 to 3) on the day of onset. Patients with any deterioration of symptoms were encouraged to contact the clinical team by telephone, and were seen in clinic for sputum sampling, generally within 48 hours. Patients also attended 3 monthly clinics at which samples were obtained when the patient was exacerbation free (clinically stable).</p><p>19 individuals (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) were recruited and gave informed, written consent. 12 of the 19 samples taken at exacerbation were paired with a prospectively collected stable sample obtained within a median of 4 months (IQR 2&#x02013;8 months) prior to the sampled exacerbation.

Briefly, the sputum was incubated with four times its weight of 0.01 M DTT in HBSS, at 4&#x000b0;C for 15 minutes. Sputum dilution was in proportion to the weight collected thus standardizing between time points and patients the supernatants used for assay of proteinases and other markers. The volume of HBSS was then doubled (ten fold dilution of original sputum sample) and incubated for a further 5 minutes. The suspension was then filtered through 50 &#x003bc;m nylon gauze to remove mucus and debris without removing any of the cells and centrifuged at 790 g for 10 minutes. The cell free supernatant was removed and stored at -70&#x000b0;C. The cell pellet was resuspended. The total cell count was determined with a Neubauer haemocytometer using the trypan blue exclusion method to determine cell viability, blue cells were counted as non viable. Cytospins were made from the cell suspension and stained with Diff-Quik to obtain a differential cell count.</p></sec><sec><title>Zymography</title><p>Quantitative gelatin zymography was carried out as described by Kleiner et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] to analyse MMP-9 levels. Briefly, samples were prepared by dilution into a 5X zymography sample buffer consisting of 0.4 M Tris, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 12.5% sucrose, and 0.03% bromophenol blue. 10 &#x003bc;l volumes of sample were loaded onto a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% gelatin and the proteins separated by electrophoresis. The gel was washed twice in buffer containing 20 mM Tris, and 2.5% Triton, pH 7.8 and incubated overnight at 37&#x000b0;C in Tris/Triton buffer supplemented with 10 mM CaCl2 and 5 &#x003bc;M ZnCl. The following day the gels were stained with 0.5% Coomassie and the gelatinases visualised as clear areas on a dark blue background (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The major band of MMP-9 activity in all samples was proMMP-9 observed at 92 kDa, this accounted for a median 92% of total MMP-9 activity (total n = 31 samples, IQR 78&#x02013;100%). Additional bands were also observed at 125 kDa and 220 kDa comprising MMP-9 complexed with inhibitors and MMP-9 dimers. In a small minority of samples active MMP-9 was observed below the major MMP-9 band at 82 kDa. MMP-2 activity was found to migrate to 72 kDa. The identity of MMP-9 was further verified by immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal antibody to MMP-9 (4 mg/ml, Biogenesis.

The results indicate that exacerbations are associated with an increase in MMP-9 burden in the airways. This increase could result in ECM destruction in the airways and contributing to airway remodelling and the decline in lung function seen in COPD patients. Previous studies have related MMP-9 to parenchymal destruction and lung function decline, in sub clinical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and established emphysema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Studies with induced sputum from stable COPD patients have found that levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 are elevated in COPD patients compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Levels were found to correlate with both increased neutrophilia and decrease in lung function. These studies suggest that an underlying proteolytic environment exists in the airways in COPD, however studies where molar ratio of MMP-9 to TIMP-1 was analysed found that TIMP-1 levels outweighed MMP-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Our current study indicates that prior to exacerbation MMP-9/TIMP-1 balance favours the inhibitor. During exacerbation however MMP-9 levels significantly increase, tipping the balance in favour of MMP-9. A similar finding has been reported in asthmatic exacerbations which found that circulating levels of MMP-9 were increased in patients during exacerbation compared with convalescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The frequency of shift between a "proteolytic" phenotype during exacerbation and "fibrotic" phenotype outside exacerbation, may be an important driving factor in airway remodelling, and deserves further research.</p><p>Our data show that number of neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes all increase in the airways during an exacerbation, whilst levels of macrophages remained constant. Recent studies have shown that alveolar macrophages from smokers increased production of MMP-9 in response to cigarette smoke conditioned medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Pro-inflammatory stimuli such as IL-1&#x003b2; and LPS also increased MMP-9 production, leading the authors to suggest that Alveolar Macrophage release of MMP-9 could have relevance in COPD exacerbations. In this present study, a strong correlation was observed during exacerbation between increased neutrophil number and MMP-9 while a weaker association existed between macrophages and MMP-9. While the contribution of macrophage derived MMP-9 cannot be ruled out, it is tempting to speculate from these data that neutrophil influx is the primary source of increased MMP-9 during exacerbation. The stimulus for increased neutrophil influx was not assessed in this study, however it seems likely that neutrophil specific chemokines such as IL8 are involved this response. Recently, Bhowmik <italic>et al</italic>, using sputa from the East London COPD study, reported that levels of IL8 during exacerbation were related to neutrophil number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, it is of note that the increase in MMP-9 during exacerbation also shows a very close association with increase in lymphocyte number. It is unclear whether these events are related; however it is pertinent to suggest that the increase in neutrophil and lymphocyte numbers is linked. In support of this concept, a recent study in mice has shown that intranasal stimulation by the cytokine IL17, produced by CD4+ T-lymphocytes induced a pronounouned accumulation in both pro and active MMP-9 associated with local accumulation of neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A recent study by Zhu <italic>et al </italic>reported an increase in the number of CD4+ lymphocytes in the airways during exacerbation in COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The authors suggested that virally induced upregulation of the chemokine RANTES during exacerbation could contribute to this. In addition an increased airway eosinophilia, also attributed to RANTES upregulation, was observed.</p><p>While eosinophils do not have a clearly defined role in COPD, an increased airway eosinophilia during exacerbation has now been observed in a range of studies including our own [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The role of eosinophils in disease progression may therefore deserve further investigation. Previous studies using asthmatic BAL identified eosinophils as important sources of MMP-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However a comparatively weak, albeit significant association between MMP-9 and eosinophils in our study, suggests eosinophils are not the primary source of MMP-9 during COPD exacerbation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We report here that during an exacerbation in COPD there is an increased MMP-9 burden in the airways, which combined with unchanging TIMP-1 leads to MMP-9/TIMP-1 imbalance in favour of MMP-9. Increase in MMP-9 correlates with influx in both neutrophils and lymphocytes and to a lesser extent eosinophil and macrophage numbers. The cross talk between these cells during exacerbation and their contribution to airway remodelling requires further detailed investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PFM assisted in the study design, carried out the zymography and TIMP-1 immunoassays and drafted the manuscript.
