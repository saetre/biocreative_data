Specifically, wounds on horse limbs often develop exuberant granulation tissue which behaves clinically like a benign tumor and resembles the human keloid in that the evolving scar is trapped in the proliferative phase of repair, leading to fibrosis. Clues gained from the study of over-scarring in horses should eventually lead to new insights into how to prevent unwanted scar formation in humans. cDNA fragments corresponding to <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>(coding for &#x003b2;-catenin) and <italic>PECAM1</italic>, genes potentially contributing to the proliferative phase of repair, were previously identified in a mRNA expression study as being up-regulated in 7 day wound biopsies from horses. The aim of the present study was to clone full-length equine <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>and <italic>PECAM1 </italic>cDNAs and to study the spatio-temporal expression of mRNAs and corresponding proteins during repair of body and limb wounds in a horse model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The temporal pattern of the two genes was similar; except for <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>in limb wounds, wounding caused up-regulation of mRNA which did not return to baseline by the end of the study. Relative over-expression of both <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>and <italic>PECAM1 </italic>mRNA was noted in body wounds compared to limb wounds. Immunostaining for both &#x003b2;-catenin and PECAM1 was principally observed in endothelial cells and fibroblasts and was especially pronounced in wounds having developed exuberant granulation tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study is the first to characterize equine cDNA for <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>and <italic>PECAM1 </italic>and to document that these genes are expressed during wound repair in horses. It appears that &#x003b2;-catenin may be regulated in a post-transcriptional manner while PECAM1 might help thoracic wounds mount an efficient inflammatory response in contrast to what is observed in limb wounds. Furthermore, data from this study suggest that &#x003b2;-catenin and PECAM1 might interact to modulate endothelial cell and fibroblast proliferation during wound repair in the horse.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Repair of wounds located on the limbs, but not the body, of horses is often accompanied by the formation of exuberant granulation tissue (EGT) which behaves clinically like a benign tumor and resembles the human keloid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] in that the evolving scar is trapped in the proliferative phase of repair, leading to fibrosis. This condition ultimately generates extensive scarring, detrimental to function. Indeed, a recent study reported that approximately 7% of injuries leading to the retirement of racehorses are the result of a wound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Efforts to enhance wound repair and to prevent unwanted scar formation in both humans and horses have been disappointing, possibly owing to insufficient knowledge of the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>We recently identified genes expressed in wound margin biopsies of horses, using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Two hundred and twenty six cDNAs were found to be differentially expressed during the proliferative phase of repair of normal body wounds, 129 of which matched against GenBank databases. In the study described herein, we targeted a previously identified SSH-derived cDNA fragment corresponding to &#x003b2;-catenin (<italic>CTNNB1</italic>) and a second corresponding to equine platelet endothelial adhesion molecule-1 (<italic>PECAM1</italic>) for their potential contribution to the proliferative phase of repair, which is aberrant following wounding on the limbs of horses. <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>had already been demonstrated to play a role in fibroproliferative disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and <italic>PECAM1 </italic>was chosen because of its known interaction with &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Beta-catenin is an 88-kDa highly conserved protein that is a structural component of the adherens junction (AJ), a cadherin-dependent adhesive structure intricately linked to the actin microfilament network and located between adjacent epithelial cells. Beta-catenin is a central mediator in the canonical wingless (Wnt) signaling pathway, which exerts remarkable control over cellular phenotype and behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. When the Wnt pathway is quiescent, &#x003b2;-catenin participates in AJs which must disassemble to allow for cell migration, a process critical to epithelialization following wounding. When freed from intercellular contacts, &#x003b2;-catenin is phosphorylated and targeted for degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Activation of the Wnt pathway inhibits phosphorylation, leading to cytosolic stabilization of &#x003b2;-catenin. This stabilized form subsequently translocates to the nucleus where it functions as a transcriptional co-activator of T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (Tcf/Lef) target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Beta-catenin plays a cell-specific role during wound repair. Protein levels are transiently elevated in mesenchymal cells during the proliferative phase of repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], which is thought to regulate the growth of dermal fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Moreover, &#x003b2;-catenin stimulates the growth of microvascular endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In contrast, &#x003b2;-catenin inhibits migration of human epithelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, which may impair wound closure <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Hyperplastic wounds in man exhibit a prolonged phase of elevated &#x003b2;-catenin protein levels and concurrent tcf-dependent transcriptional activation of target genes involved in fibroproliferative processes, such as alpha smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;-SMA), fibronectin (FN) and collagen type III (COLIII) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. A transgenic mouse model, in which stabilized &#x003b2;-catenin is expressed in mesenchymal cells, develops aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumors) and hyperplastic cutaneous wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>PECAM1 (CD31) is a 130-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that is constitutively expressed on platelets, specific cells of the immune system, as well as on endothelial cells, particularly at intercellular junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Its ectodomain mediates adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] while its cytoplasmic portion serves as a scaffold for cytoskeletal proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and for signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. PECAM1 has been implicated in a number of important biological processes including modulation of adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], inflammatory cell infiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], phagocytosis by macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], endothelial permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>PECAM1 binds tyrosine-phosphorylated &#x003b2;-catenin having left AJs and become localized to the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Precisely, PECAM1 functions as a reservoir for tyrosine-phosphorylated &#x003b2;-catenin, maintaining localization at the plasma membrane. This dynamic interaction is involved in the proliferation phase of angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Biswas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] identified PECAM1 as a modulator of microvascular endothelial cell proliferation via its participation in the Wnt signaling pathway, thereby stabilizing and promoting the accumulation of transcriptionally active &#x003b2;-catenin.</p><p>In the present study we hypothesized that the temporal expression pattern of these two genes with potential roles in angiogenesis and cell proliferation would differ between body wounds which heal normally and limb wounds which are predisposed to the formation of EGT in horses. The specific objectives of this study were to characterize the full-length equine <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>and <italic>PECAM1 </italic>cDNAs, and to study the spatio-temporal expression profile of their mRNAs and proteins during the repair of body and limb wounds. The ultimate objective of our research program is to contribute to a better understanding of the dermal repair process, and permit the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to resolve wound healing complications in the horse and which could ultimately be extrapolated to man.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cloning and characterization of equine cDNA for <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>and <italic>PECAM1</italic></title><p>The cDNA fragments used for the virtual Northern analyses came from sequences previously obtained from a gene expression profiling experiment using SSH screening aimed at identifying mRNAs that were increased or induced during the proliferative phase of wound repair in the horse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Screening of the size-selected library from equine thoracic wound margin biopsies collected 7d post-operatively for <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>cDNA resulted in the cloning of a truncated cDNA fragment. Thus, a PCR reaction was performed to characterize 5' upstream sequences of the ORF. The equine <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>cDNA characterized consisted of 2382 bp [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DQ267491">DQ267491</ext-link>] that included a partial 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of 9 bp, an ORF of 2346 bp encoding a 781-amino acid protein with a theoretical molecular weight of 85.5-kDa, an isoelectric point of 5.5, and a partial 3'-UTR of 27 bp. Amino acid homology search in GenBank by PsiBlast revealed orthologous proteins with an overall identity level of 100% for porcine [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_214367">NM_214367</ext-link>], and 99% to human [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_001904">NM_001904</ext-link>] and canine [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="XM_856013">XM_856013</ext-link>] CTNNB1 proteins. The analysis against a protein conserved domains database (PROSITE) showed the presence of 9 Armadillo/plakoglobin ARM repeat profiles (R<sup>151</sup>-S<sup>191</sup>, Q<sup>193</sup>-G<sup>236</sup>, G<sup>235</sup>-G<sup>277</sup>, G<sup>277</sup>-G<sup>319</sup>, G<sup>319</sup>-G<sup>362</sup>, G<sup>400</sup>-G<sup>442</sup>, G<sup>442</sup>-A<sup>484</sup>, Y<sup>489</sup>-A<sup>532</sup>, N<sup>594</sup>-A<sup>636</sup>).</p><p>The virtual Northern analyses allowed determination of the approximate molecular weight of the full-length <italic>PECAM1 </italic>cDNA, which corresponded to 3.1&#x02013;3.7 kb. The SSH cDNA fragment was thus used as probe to screen, by hybridization, the appropriate size-selected cDNA library generated from equine thoracic wound margin biopsies collected 7d post-operatively. The full-length equine <italic>PECAM1 </italic>cDNA was cloned and consisted of 3381 bp [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DQ310372">DQ310372</ext-link>] that included a 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of 156 bp, an ORF of 2217 bp encoding a 738-amino acid protein with a theoretical molecular weight of 82.3-kDa, an isoelectric point of 8.2, and a 3'-UTR of 1008 bp containing one polyadenylation signal. Amino acid homology search in GenBank by PsiBlast revealed orthologous proteins with an overall identity level of 76% to canine [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="XM_848326">XM_848326</ext-link>], 75% to porcine [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_213907">NM_213907</ext-link>], and 72% to human [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_000442">NM_000442</ext-link>] and bovine [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_174571">NM_174571</ext-link>] proteins. The equine sequence determined herein contains the 16 exons present in the predominant form of full-length human PECAM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. While our study does not exclude the possibility of PECAM1 isoforms in the horse, in normal skin and wound edge biopsies we detected only the full-length isoform for PECAM1.</p></sec><sec><title>Temporal expression of <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>and <italic>PECAM1 </italic>mRNAs in body and limb wounds</title><p>Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed an induction of <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>mRNA expression in response to wounding though up-regulation was less acute than for <italic>PECAM1</italic>.

Cellular localization of &#x003b2;-catenin in normal skin and wound tissues was determined by immunohistochemistry. In normal unwounded skin, the epidermis showed nuclear reactivity, which was also present in the sheaths of the hair follicles and some sebaceous glands (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). No immunoreactive signal was noted in the extracellular matrix (ECM) or the fibroblasts populating the dermis, but endothelial cells were positively stained on their luminal side (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). No qualitative or quantitative differences in staining were detected between thoracic and limb skin samples, nor later on between thoracic and limb wound samples. While epithelialization was incomplete two weeks following wounding, the intact epidermis adjacent to the wound continued to show nuclear reactivity but also new membrane reactivity at the wound edge (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). The dermis contiguous to the wound showed the same pattern as pre-operatively while the granulation tissue filling the wound bed showed nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of both the fibroblasts and the microvascular endothelial cells. In the fourth week of repair the epidermis and the dermis showed the same staining pattern as described for the second week samples. The granulation tissue fibroblasts were strongly stained in a nuclear fashion while the endothelial cells were also labelled with the anti-&#x003b2;-catenin antibody. Six weeks following wounding, immunostaining for &#x003b2;-catenin protein had started to wane. The epidermis, which covered the wound bed in most cases, showed the nuclear staining pattern observed pre-operatively in intact skin. The granulation tissue, which had become less cellular, was weakly stained compared to that of four week biopsies and exhibited a staining pattern more nuclear than cytoplasmic. In three month and six month old EGT, fibroblasts as well as endothelial cells appeared strongly stained in a nuclear/cytoplasmic fashion (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Immunohistochemical localization of &#x003b2;-catenin in the epidermal compartment of equine skin or wounds.

Consequently, the staining pattern paralleled that of angiogenesis following wounding. At weeks 1 and 4 the presence of more blood vessels within the granulation tissue filling the wound bed translated into more PECAM1 immunostaining, particularly in limb wounds (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] in Xenopus laevis, shows no similarity in sequence to the genes for the &#x003b1;-catenins reported in other species while the &#x003b2;-catenin protein shares 70% amino acid identity with both plakoglobin, found in desmosomes, and the product of the Drosophila segment polarity gene "armadillo". Analysis of equine predicted &#x003b2;-catenin, against a protein conserved domains database (PROSITE), showed the presence of 9 Armadillo/plakoglobin repeat profiles, an approximately 40 amino acid long repeated sequence motif. Proteins that contain this type of domain combine structural roles and signaling functions, by generating and transducing signals affecting gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The calculated expected molecular weight (85,5 kDa) concords with that previously reported for other species.</p><p>A preliminary mRNA gene expression profiling study identified a cDNA fragment that corresponded to <italic>PECAM1</italic>, suggesting its up-regulation in response to dermal wounding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The equine sequence determined herein contained the 16 exons present in the full-length human <italic>PECAM1</italic>, the predominant isoform detected in human tissue and endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This contrasts with the main isoform found in murine endothelium which lacks exons 14 and 15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. While it is possible that other isoforms also exist in horses, our data suggest that, at least in skin, the full-length form predominates.</p><p>Processes occurring during the proliferative phase of wound repair ensure restoration of the structural and functional characteristics of skin which depend on both the epithelial and the mesenchymal components of the wound. The severity of scarring of horse limb wounds is related to an excessive proliferative phase where angiogenesis and fibroplasia are exacerbated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This may result from dysregulation of the molecular components governing the growth of mesenchymal cells. In the study reported herein we have focused on two molecules, <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>and <italic>PECAM1</italic>, for their proposed role in endothelial cell and fibroblast proliferation.</p><p>The temporal patterns we report for mRNA expression of <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>and <italic>PECAM1 </italic>resemble one another. Both genes were constitutively expressed in normal intact skin, but while dermal trauma induced the expression of both mRNAs, the response was more acute for <italic>PECAM1 </italic>whose levels were significantly increased over baseline one week following wounding compared to two weeks for <italic>CTNNB1</italic>. This significant up-regulation of mRNA was maintained for the duration of the study for <italic>PECAM1 </italic>at both anatomic locations and for <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>in thoracic wounds; conversely, expression of <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>in limb wounds was not significantly elevated following wounding. Finally, mRNA expression in thoracic wounds significantly surpassed that of limb wounds for <italic>PECAM1</italic>, one week post-wounding, and for <italic>CTNNB1</italic>, three, four and six weeks post-wounding.</p><p>While possible that the temporal pattern of mRNA expression might reflect the different levels at the various sampling sites, the wounds were very close together such that we think it unlikely that anatomic or metabolic differences (blood supply, muscle coverage, etc) are important. Previous studies using a similar model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] have not reported an influence of the exact location on the body or the lower limb. Likewise a current study has shown no difference in the rate of closure between wounds located distally or more proximally on the lower limb (Monteiro et al, unpublished data).</p><p>The correspondence in the patterns of mRNA expression following wounding is consistent with the PECAM1/&#x003b2;-catenin protein partnership proposed by Biswas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Indeed, the cytoplasmic portion of PECAM1 binds cytosolic &#x003b2;-catenin and this dynamic interaction is involved in angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. More specifically, by enhancing the accumulation of stabilized &#x003b2;-catenin, PECAM1 modulates microvascular endothelial cell proliferation via transcriptional activation of growth promoting genes. Furthermore, a significant increase in <italic>PECAM1 </italic>mRNA levels preceded that of <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>following wounding in our study, consistent with the fact that upon cytokine stimulation endothelial cells initially induce PECAM1, followed by an increased expression of &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>While one might have anticipated higher levels of equine <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>mRNA in limb wounds predisposed to the development of EGT, a form of fibroproliferative disease, our opposite findings may reflect the mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of &#x003b2;-catenin during wound repair, which controls how mRNA is translated into protein. Indeed, Cheon et al. documented that in the absence of any change in mRNA level, &#x003b2;-catenin protein, expressed primarily in dermal mesenchymal cells, was nonetheless transiently increased during the proliferative phase of normal wound healing in humans while exhibiting a sustained elevation in hyperplastic wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Thus, a lack of correlation between mRNA and protein levels might underlie our unexpected findings; specifically, why <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>mRNA levels remained elevated when immunostaining for &#x003b2;-catenin waned, and why <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>mRNA levels in thoracic wounds surpassed those of limb wounds at weeks 3, 4 and 6 of healing.</p><p>In the horse, epithelial cells migrate slowly on limb wounds which are concurrently afflicted by over-abundant fibroblast proliferation; both are influences attributed to &#x003b2;-catenin protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although immunohistochemical studies did not suggest quantitative differences in &#x003b2;-catenin expression between body and limb wounds, our investigation did reveal that while the protein remains transcriptionally active (nuclear stain) in dermal mesenchymal cells for the duration of the study, the intensity of the stain diminishes between the 4<sup>th </sup>and 6<sup>th </sup>weeks of healing. This pattern suggests that the signal would have disappeared entirely from normally healed wounds had the study been extended a few weeks. Conversely, strong immunostaining for &#x003b2;-catenin was detected in biopsies of 3 and 6 month old EGT, a condition characterized by exaggerated angiogenesis and fibroplasia and which resembles hyperplastic scarring in man in which a prolonged duration of &#x003b2;-catenin protein elevation has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Our findings may indicate that mesenchymal cells in EGT are behaving as though in a prolonged active proliferative phase of wound healing. In other words, the high levels of &#x003b2;-catenin would encourage proliferation and motility of the dermal cells, generating a larger dermal component to the wounds and hampering remodeling which requires reduced &#x003b2;-catenin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>While the design of our study cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the prolonged elevation of &#x003b2;-catenin and the development of equine EGT, transgenic mouse models expressing a stabilized form of &#x003b2;-catenin in mesenchymal cells develop hyperplastic cutaneous wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Fibroblasts derived from these mice display increased proliferation, motility and invasiveness when grafted into nude mice. Moreover, primary cell cultures demonstrate Tcf-dependent transcriptional activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] consistent with the hypothesis that nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin transactivation of target genes is a primary component of fibrosis.</p><p>In contrast to the membrane staining of epithelial cells reported by Cheon et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], we identified nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin within epithelial cells of intact skin. Our finding is similar to that of Tsuji et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] who report nuclear immunostaining for &#x003b2;-catenin from the upper spinous to the granular cells in normal, intact human epidermis. The presence of stabilized, transcriptionally active &#x003b2;-catenin no doubt reflects keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation in response to continued renewal of the epithelial component of equine skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>While PECAM1 is best known as a promoter of angiogenesis, its ability to facilitate neutrophil transendothelial migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and thus boost the acute inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] is particularly intriguing in view of the data obtained herein. Indeed, it is tempting to draw a parallel between the inefficient and prolonged inflammatory response to wounding in the horse limb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and the significantly inferior expression of <italic>PECAM1 </italic>mRNA in wounds at this site compared to those of the thorax, one week following injury. Conversely, while differences in expression between the two sites disappear from the second week on, one might have expected an increase in limb wounds where new blood vessels are particularly abundant within the granulation tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], in relation to PECAM1's role in angiogenesis. Interestingly, the expression pattern of PECAM1 isoforms has been shown to change during tube formation <italic>in vitro</italic>, indicating specialized roles for specific isoforms of PECAM1 during angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. While our data suggest that we have cloned the predominant isoform of equine PECAM1, it is possible that another isoform is responsible for modulating endothelial cell adhesive properties during angiogenesis in the horse. Finally, the <italic>PECAM1 </italic>mRNA expression pattern found in our study corroborates previous assertions concerning the sluggishness hindering the repair of equine wounds, particularly those located on the extremities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. To this effect, a recent study in mice showed that both mRNA and protein expression of PECAM1 were induced three days following dermal wounding but mRNA expression returned to baseline by day 12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In contrast, expression of equine <italic>PECAM1 </italic>mRNA was significantly up-regulated in both thoracic and limb wounds for the 6-week duration of the study.</p><p>Immunohistochemistry revealed that, as expected of an endothelial cell marker, PECAM1 is principally present in blood vessels. As such, our data reflect that previously reported by Lepault et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] who documented, histologically, more pronounced angiogenesis in healing limb than body wounds of horses. The concomitant presence of PECAM1 and &#x003b2;-catenin on endothelial cells of wound granulation tissue further supports the dynamic interaction between these two molecules, which may modulate the proliferation phase of angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study is the first to characterize equine cDNA for <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>and <italic>PECAM1 </italic>and to document that the genes are expressed over the different phases of wound repair in horses. Our findings suggest that &#x003b2;-catenin and PECAM1 might interact to modulate endothelial cell and fibroblast proliferation during wound repair in the horse.</p><p>Most previous studies investigating the roles of &#x003b2;-catenin and PECAM1 in wound healing have used <italic>in vitro </italic>techniques. Since wound repair is a complex process involving the interplay of several cell types, signaling pathways, extracellular matrix components and soluble factors, the role of various factors and their interactions may best be evaluated using an <italic>in vivo </italic>approach. Thus, while data interpretation can be challenging, the value of our study lies in the fact that the findings are more representative of what truly occurs in the patient.</p><p>In an effort to develop targeted therapies to prevent the formation of EGT leading to excessive scarring of equine limb wounds, future studies should quantitatively verify the temporal protein expression of &#x003b2;-catenin and PECAM1 and attempt to elucidate how the two molecules interact. The clues gained from studying the equine model may eventually lead to new insights into how to prevent unwanted scar formation in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cloning of equine <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>and <italic>PECAM1</italic></title><p>Isolation of the full-length equine cDNAs was undertaken by screening size-selected cDNA libraries.

Briefly, five square 6.25 cm<sup>2 </sup>areas were excised on the dorso-lateral aspect of one randomly assigned metacarpus beginning just above the fetlock, and on the lateral thoracic wall, 1.5 cm apart in a staggered vertical column, then left to heal by second intention. Excised skin from the lowermost wound was kept as a time 0 sample. One wound per site (thorax; limb) was sampled at the following times in each horse: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 weeks. To avoid repeated trauma, each wound, beginning with the most distal one, was designated for a single biopsy. Full-thickness specimens were taken with an 8 mm diameter biopsy punch to include a 3-to-4 mm strip of peripheral skin, the migrating epithelium and a 3-to-4 mm strip of granulation tissue from the wound center, when present. Biopsy samples were divided in half; one half was formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) for immunohistochemical studies while the other was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until further processing.
