The maturation process prepares the cells to actively participate in the inflammatory and immune responses, and many factors have been reported to be involved in the process. We found in our study that CD147 played a very important role in this process.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>By using PMA-differentiated human monocyte cells line THP-1, we found that CD147 mediated matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) expression of the leukemic THP-1 cells and thus enhanced the invasiveness of THP-1 cells. After 24 hours of PMA-induced monocyte differentiation, the mean fluorescence intensity of CD147 in differentiated THP-1 cells (289.61 &#x000b1; 31.63) was higher than that of the undifferentiated THP-1 cells (205.1 &#x000b1; 19.25). There was a significant increase of the levels of proMMP-2, proMMP-9 and their activated forms in the differentiated THP-1 cells. Invasion assays using reconstituted basement membrane showed a good correlation between the invasiveness of THP-1 cells and the production of MMP-2 and MMP-9. The difference in the MMPs expression and the invasive ability was significantly blocked by HAb18G/CD147 antagonistic peptide AP-9. The inhibitory rate of the secretion of proMMP-9 in the undifferentiated THP-1 cells was 45.07%. The inhibitory rate of the secretion of proMMP-9, the activated MMP-9 and proMMP-2 in the differentiated THP-1 cells was 52.90%, 53.79% and 47.80%, respectively.

Upon differentiation, the response of macrophages to pathogens is markedly enhanced, allowing them to participate in the inflammatory and immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The differentiation process is a complex one and is controlled by the expression or the activation of several factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The activated inflammatory macrophage plays a crucial role in matrix destruction by producing matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) both directly and indirectly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Activated macrophages up-regulate the activity of MMPs, particularly that of MMP-9, MMP-2 (gelatinases), MMP-12 (metalloelastase) and MMP-7 (matrilysin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Activated macrophages are also known to release collagenases (MMP-1 and MMP-13) under certain circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In co-culture assays, macrophages can stimulate myofibroblasts to release collagenases. In the studies of kidney disease, inflammatory macrophages of the glomeruli are found to have induced myofibroblast mesangial cells to produce stromelysin (MMP-3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>MMPs are a family of structurally related endopeptidases that resorb macromolecules of the extracellular matrix. They participate both in physiologic connective tissue remodeling and in pathologic tissue destruction. However, the exact mechanism underlying the up-regulated expression of MMPs in macrophages is not yet clear.</p><p>CD147, a 57-KD transmembrane glycoprotein, (also called extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) and leukocyte activation-associated M6 antigen) is located on the surface of human tumor cells and normal keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. CD147, rich on the surface of most tumor cells, has been found to stimulate tumor cells and stromal cells to produce elevated levels of MMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, the involvement of CD147 in stimulating MMP release and activation during cellular maturation process remains unknown. This paper reports our study, using a phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced cell differentiation model of the human monocytic cell line THP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], on the involvement of CD147 expression in the differentiation process of monocytes into macrophages, and on the correlation between CD147 expression and the secretion and activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9, and the correlation between CD147 expression and the invasive ability of mono-macrophage cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Alteration of morphology and phenotype on PMA-treatmented THP-1 cells</title><p>Untreated THP-1 cells are round in shape and do not adhere to the plastic surfaces of the culture plates.

This is in accordance with our previous study in human hepatoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>MMPs are a family of Zn<sup>2+</sup>-containing enzymes that cleave most of the components of extracellular matrix (ECM) and are involved in physiologic connective tissue remodeling and in pathologic tissue destruction. MMPs can be regulated by different factors. Popp et al reported that calpain/calpastatin system mediated MMP-mRNA expression of the leukemic THP-1 cells and, as a result, their invasiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Worley et al identified that PPAR&#x003b3; and RXR agonists had complex effects on monocyte MMPs expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In our present study, we employed CD147 to promote MMPs.</p><p>CD147 is a highly glycosylated transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily with two Ig domains. Previous studies have clearly demonstrated that CD147 is highly expressed on some tumor cells and is responsible for stimulating MMP production by stromal cells and/or other tumor cells, thereby leading to extracellular matrix degradation and elevated tumor growth and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. CD147 has also been found to stimulate the secretion and the activation of MMPs, which are associated with tissue degradation and remodeling during inflammatory damage and wound healing. The up-regulation of the expression of CD147 in the synovial membrane of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Our recent studies have demonstrated that CD147 is highly expressed on monocytes in circulating blood and synovial fluid, and on macrophages/macrophages-like synovial cells in synovium from RA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Similarly, the up-regulation of the expression of CD147 on monocytes/macrophages may induce MMPs produced by fibroblasts and other monocytes/macrophages, and this process may play an essential role in articular cartilage lesion development in RA.</p><p>To explore the association of CD147 with the secretion and activation of MMPs, especially those in the cellular maturation, in our present study, human THP-1 monocytic cells were further stimulated to differentiate into a macrophage-like stage and some specific morphological and phenotypic alterations of PMA-treated THP-1 cells were detected. The high expression level of CD147 was observed in the differentiated process. Zymography, RT-PCR and ELISA results showed that the secretion and activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were significantly enhanced in the differentiated THP-1 cells. MMP-9 mRNA expression significantly increased in the differentiated THP-1 cells. Our results agree with the reports that the stimulation of the cells by PMA significantly augmented the release of MMP-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>In view of the fact that CD147 may be required for the expression of gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 and that the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 are expressed in leukemic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], our study focused on the potential interaction between CD147 and MMPs, MMP-2 and MMP-9, in the differentiation process of monocytes into macrophages and in the invasion of monocytes/macrophages. We found that the overexpression of CD147 induced elevated levels of proMMP-2, pro-MMP-9 and their activated forms in differentiated THP-1 cells and the elevated levels of MMPs in turn enhanced the invasive ability of THP-1 cells. But the elevated expression and activation of MMPs and the enhanced invasive ability of THP-1 cells were blocked when HAb18G/CD147 antigonistic peptide AP-9 was added. These findings indicate that CD147 is involved in promoting the expression and activation of MMPs, which in turn increases the invasive potential of THP-1 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results suggest that the expression of CD147 is upregulated during the differentiation of monocyte THP-1 cells to macrophage cells, and CD147 induces the secretion and the activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and which in turn enhance the invasive ability of THP-1 cells. The increased secretion and the activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and the enhanced invasive ability of THP-1 cells can be blocked by antagonistic peptide of CD147. The matured monocytes / macrophages, via their high expression of CD147, may play an important role in promoting the tissue repair or tissue damage during their inflammatory response.

The differentiated and undifferentiated THP-1 cells in serum-free medium were cultured for 5&#x02013;20 h in the presence or absence of HAb18G/CD147 antagonist peptide AP-9, which was produced and characterized in our lab based on HAb18G. HAb18G is a new member of CD147 family and is abundantly expressed in human hepatoma tissues and on the cell surface of several hepatoma cell lines with a highly invasive potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Conditioned media were collected and the MMP activity was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel zymography. Media samples were centrifuged to remove cellular debris and the supernatant was collected and stored at -20&#x000b0;C. Each sample suspension (30 &#x003bc;l) was mixed with SDS sample buffer without reducing agent and loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% gelatin. After electrophoresis, gels were washed in 2.5% Triton X-100 and incubated in low salt collagenase buffer containing 50 mmol/l Tris, 0.2 mol/l NaCl, 5 mmol/l anhydrous CaCl<sub>2 </sub>and 0.02% Brijdetergent at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes. The gels were subsequently stained with 0.5% Comassie blue (R-250) and destained with buffer consisting of 20% methanol, 10% acetic acid and 70% distilled water for 30 minutes to visualize the zymogen bands. The zymography gels were scanned and analyzed using US National Institutes of Health Image 1.6 software.</p></sec><sec><title>Invasion assay</title><p>The chemotactic cell invasion assay was performed using 24-well transwells units (Costar, Cambridge NY, USA), each with an 8-um pore size polycarbonate filter coated with Matrigel (5 ug/ml in cold medium) to form a continuous thin layer. Prior to the addition of cell suspension of differentiated and undifferentiated THP-1 cells (3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>) in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of HAb18G/CD147 antagonist peptide AP-9, Meantime an irrelevant peptide SSP, a synthetic epitope peptide of SARS-S-protein, FFSTFKCYGVSA, produced in our lab was used as control. The dried layer of Matrigel matrix was rehydrated with medium without fetal bovine serum (450 ul). The cells were then cultured for 24 h at 37&#x000b0;C in a CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator. The cells remaining in the upper compartment were completely removed with gently swabbing. The number of cells invaded through the filter into the lower compartment was determined using colorimetric HE assay.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JZ performed the studies and drafted the manuscript.
