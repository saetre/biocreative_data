Downregulation of VRK1 induced by p53 is prevented in a dose dependent manner by either p300 or CBP, but not by PCAF, used as transcriptional co-activators, suggesting that p53 has a different specificity depending on the relative level of these transcriptional cofactors. This inhibition does not require p53 acetylation, since a p53 acetylation mutant also induces VRK1 downregulation. PCAF can not revert the VRK1 protection effect of p300, indicating that these two proteins do not compete for a common factor needed to induce VRK1 downregulation. The protective effect is also induced by the C/H3 domain of p300, a region implicated in binding to several transcription factors and SV40 large T antigen; but the protective effect is lost when a mutant C/H3Del33 is used. The protective effect is a consequence of direct binding of the C/H3 domain to the transactivation domain of p53. A similar downregulatory effect can also be detected with VRK2 protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Specific p53-dependent effects are determined by the availability and ratios of its transcriptional cofactors. Specifically, the downregulation of VRK1/VRK2 protein levels, as a consequence of p53 accumulation, is thus dependent on the levels of the p300/CBP protein available for transcriptional complexes, since in this context this cofactor functions as a repressor of the effect. These observations point to the relevance of knowing the cofactor levels in order to determine one effect or another.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The vaccinia-related kinases (VRK) form a group of three proteins in the human kinome that diverged early from the casein kinase I branch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-Manning1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Differently acetylated p53 molecules may oligomerize with some differences in their organization that can affect gene transcription specificity. The interaction of p53 with hdm2 depends on its phosphorylation. The persistent accumulation of p53 would result in a permanent block to cell cycle progression or the cells will enter apoptosis, and thus is not compatible with life. Therefore p53 levels are usually low and its accumulation is transient. Precisely to prevent this accumulation, p53 induces its main downregulatory protein mdm2/hdm2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-Moll1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Since VRK1 contributes to p53 stabilization, some mechanism of autoregulation between these two proteins is likely to function in the cell and has been recently identified. In vivo there is an inverse correlation between p53 and VRK1 levels in human tumor cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-Valbuena1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>; furthermore in human fibroblast, the induction of DNA damage by ultraviolet light and subsequent accumulation of p53 is accompanied by a downregulation of endogenous VRK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-Valbuena1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. This downregulatory mechanism could be reproduced in transfection experiments making it more accessible for characterization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-Valbuena1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, and is independent of the promoter used to express VRK1, thus indicating it is an indirect effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-Valbuena1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The accumulated p53 regulates VRK1 protein level by proteolytic degradation, which is mediated by an indirect mechanism that requires de novo gene transcription of an unknown gene. The VRK1 downregulation is also independent of a proteasome mediated pathway; this mechanism is insensitive to proteasome inhibitors, and hdm2/mdm2 is not implicated since it is also functional in mdm2 deficient cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-Valbuena1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

These autoregulatory properties are altered when p53 is mutated; thus transcription-defective p53 mutants cause an accumulation of VRK1 because its degradation mechanism can not be induced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-Valbuena1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, an observation that has been confirmed in human lung squamous cell carcinomas containing mutations in p53, which have very high levels of endogenous VRK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-Valbuena2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Since this VRK1 downregulation requires p53 dependent transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-Valbuena1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, in this report we have used this VRK1 downregulation by p53 to determine the potential contribution of different acetyl transferase cofactors of p53 that can modulate the specificity of gene transcription, and for which VRK1 downregulation provides a functional assay. The tumor suppressor p53 has different responses to a common stimulation depending on cell type, which is likely to reflect a differential composition of transcriptional complexes. The transcriptional activity of p53 is regulated by interaction with transcriptional coactivators such as the p300/CBP, or the PCAF (p300/CBP-associated factor) acetyl transferases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-Grossman1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The sites acetylated in p53 are Lys373, Lys382 by p300/CBP and Lys320 by PCAF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-Sakaguchi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, which selectively activate transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-Roy1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The tumor suppressor p53 interacts with p300 by two different regions, one located in the N-terminus and required for nuclear export and degradation, and the other near the C-terminal region, proximal to but different from the C/H3 region, which is required for activation of transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-Grossman1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-Borger1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The C/H3 region has an eighty percent homology to the same region in CBP (CREB binding protein), but is not present in PCAF. The C/H3 domain is an interaction region with many different proteins such as viral proteins as adenovirus E1A or SV40 large T antigen, or transcription factors such as MyoD, Fos, c-Jun, and E2F <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-Grossman1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-Patel1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this work we have determined the requirement for the contribution of co-transcriptional factors with acetyl transferase activity and determined their contribution to the specificity of the effect induced by p53 on the stability of VRK1. This would indicate that some transcriptional cofactors, but not others will be determinants of the effect. Among the three cofactors, p300, CBP and PCAF that interact with p53, only the former two were able to prevent this VRK1 downregulation. Complexes of p53 with proteins having a C/H3 domain are not able to downregulate VRK proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>p300 and CBP protect VRK1 from its p53-induced downregulation</title><p>The downregulation of VRK1 by p53 has been shown to be dependent on p53-induced transcription of an unknown protein that controls VRK1 proteolytic degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-Valbuena1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore it was decided to identify the contribution of p53 transcriptional cofactors to this process. p300 and CBP are p53 coactivators that participate in its transcriptional activation by acetylation of Lys373 and Lys382 residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-Grossman1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-Ito1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

First, it was tested if p300 could have any effect on the transcriptionally dependent downregulation of VRK1 induced by p53. For this aim H1299 cells were cotransfected with plasmids pCEFL-HA-VRK1, pCB6&#x0002b;p53 and increasing amounts of pCMV-p300 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002649-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Surprisingly, as the p300 protein level increased, it was accompanied by a parallel increase in the protection of VRK1 degradation induced by p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002649-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). To confirm that the effect requires the participation of p53, the same experiment was performed in the absence of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002649-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). In this situation p300 over-expression by itself has no effect on VRK1, or perhaps even induces a minor increase in its levels. These results suggested an implication of the p300 coactivator in preventing VRK1 downregulation by p53. An unknown connection between these proteins may occur or it might be possible that the gene controlled by p53 that regulates VRK1 does not require p300 as coactivator and that unique over-expression of p300 is sufficient to direct the transcriptional activity of p53 to other targets and to abrogate the negative effect of p53 on VRK1 levels. The expression of actin was not affected by either p53 or any of the cofactors.</p><fig id="pone-0002649-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002649.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>p300 and CBP protect VRK1 from p53-induced downregulation.</title><p>(A) H1299 cells were transfected with pCB6&#x0002b;p53 (0.2 &#x000b5;g) and pCEFL-HA-VRK1 (5 &#x000b5;g) with increasing amounts of pCMV&#x003b2;-p300-HA and 36 hours postransfection cell extracts were analyzed with the different antibodies indicated in the legend.

To distinguish between these two possibilities, a similar set of experiments was performed. Increasing amounts of CBP were able to protect VRK1 from downregulation induced by p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002649-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), and CBP by itself in the absence of p53 had no effect on VRK1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002649-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>).

The relevance of p53 transcriptional specificity is manifested by the observation that overexpression of p300 or CBP can block the effect of p53, but the PCAF coactivator does not. This might be due to the promoter specificity of different p53-transcriptional cofactor complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-Espinosa1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. But PCAF and p300 do not compete for the same cofactor; since the p300 protective effect is detected even in the presence of excess PCAF. This p300 inhibitory competition of VRK1 downregulation is independent of acetyl transferase activity, since it is blocked by proteins that do not have the acetyl transferase activity as is the case for the C/H3 region of p300. Also the downregulatory mechanism does not require p53 acetylation since it is also induced by a p53 protein containing all its acetylation sites replaced. The inhibitory mechanism can be explained by a competition for binding to p53 by proteins containing a C/H3 domain, such as p300/CBP. Other acetyl transferase such as PCAF, lacking a C/H3 domain, has no effect. The C/H3 domain depletes the p53 molecules needed for induction of VRK1 downregulation. The C/H3 domain of p300/CBP proteins is an interaction region known to bind to several transcription factors such as MyoD, Fos, c-Jun, or E2F and to viral proteins such as adenovirus E1A or SV40 large antigen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-Patel1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, and also to the transactivation domain of p53.

The inhibitory effect of p300/CBP, or their isolated C/H3 domain, is the consequence of a successful competition for p53, because of its direct interaction, which is also required for the transcriptional complex of p53 needed to induce the indirect downregulation of VRK1. This competition effect is lost in the presence of the C/H3Del33 defective domain, or by PCAF that does not have a C/H3 region.

In the context of cancer, it is important to note that, in the presence of activated H-Ras or N-Ras oncogenes, an active degradation of p300 is induced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-SanchezMolina1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, and this change will permit the activation and subsequent degradation of VRK1 by the new complexes of p53.

However, the role of relative changes in factor concentration has so far received little attention, in comparison with all or none effects, despite their very important physiological relevance. The effect of changing levels of p300/CBP on the induction of VRK1 proteolytic downregulation, requiring p53 dependent transcription as an intermediate step, can be considered in this context of factor competition. Thus the downregulation of VRK1 is not only determined by the level of p53, but VRK1 downregulation is also conditioned by the relative levels of different acetyl transferases present in the cell. It is highly likely that the heterogeneity of effects frequently observed in response to common types of stimulation is precisely reflecting differences in the intracellular balance of the proteins implicated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmids, antibodies and reagents</title><p>The VRK1 construct, pCEFL-HA-VRK1, coding for the wild type VRK1 has been previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002649-Vega2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.
