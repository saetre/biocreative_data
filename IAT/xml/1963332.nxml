This behavioural ecology constitutes an excellent model for analyzing simultaneous processing of neurosensory information. We reasoned that the decision of flies to land somewhere in order to achieve aggregation is based on simultaneous integration of signals (visual, olfactory, acoustic) during their flight. On the basis of what flies do in nature, we designed laboratory tests to analyze the phenomenon of neuronal coincidence.

We therefore designed protocols to test the exploratory skills of the flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. We reasoned that the efficiency of exploration depends on the simultaneous integration of neurosensory signals during flight to guide the aggregation of individuals on a specific spot. When a food spot becomes disadvantageous, the flies reset a new cycle of exploration/aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. We previously showed that the first flies to find the appropriate food spot (explorers) signal to the others (followers) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Such collective exploration leads to remarkably efficient aggregation. They aggregate to screen sex partners and to lay eggs on the food spot most favourable for sustaining the development of larvae. This cooperative task suggests that costly individual foraging behaviour has not been selected by evolution because encounters would have been random, unpredictable and therefore unfavourable for mating. We assume in this report that "mistakes" in aggregation result from misguided integration of visual, olfactory and acoustic signals during flight and/or the overall exploratory process. We think that this simultaneous processing of neuronal signals can be analyzed experimentally by examining how flies achieve aggregation. These neuronal features include the detection and processing of a sequential and temporal order of signs generated in an unstable environment, to guide the flies' trajectory during flight and "decision making" to occupy a spot durably after landing. In other words, flies will be attracted by a bouquet of smells emitted by sources dispersed in the environment. Flies tend to land on an already-populated spot to maximize aggregation and to ignore "unoccupied" sources emitting the same bouquet. According to a "trade-off" mechanism, a high density population on a spot will prompt re-colonisation somewhere else by a fraction of the aggregated population. If a food spot is attractive because of the odours emitted but turns out to be distasteful and/or poisonous, the aggregate will probably not form. In this report, we designed tests derived from protocols described in our previous publication in order to analyze this stereotyped task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. We show evidence that the capacity of the neuronal network to process coincidental signalling can be thoroughly evaluated in this way. Owing to the difficulties of encapsulating all the sensory functions and their integration in an entire body, we focus on the wing nerve, which conveys two major signals to the brain during flight: velocity- and chemo-detection. We used this neuronal system because the circuitry is accessible and the axons of at least two functionally distinct types of neurons (mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors) are entangled, generating a unique bundle that projects to the same thoracic nervous structure site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The two types of sensory information are therefore simultaneously transported via the same nerve. Although our comprehension of the integrative function of the brain in guiding the "decision" in an exploratory task is still incomplete, we report data suggesting that the collective exploration component is very robust; it is preserved in most of mutants tested (see the list of CNS mutants in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) but drastically altered in <italic>sGC </italic>mutants. Moreover, NO (activator of <italic>sGC</italic>) has been reported to function as a combined 'slow-down and search signal' for growth cones of neuronal cells and a potent stop signal for developing neurites, which suggests mistakes in neuronal network and/or misguided neuronal wiring in flies lacking <italic>sGC </italic>(see arguments in discussion section). We reasoned that instable synapses and defective wiring should affect the synthesis/transport of synaptic vesicle components. Due to multiple difficulties to investigate whether synapses are appropriately formed at the right places in our mutants, we chose to examine indirectly the axonal transport of synaptic vesicle components in a very accessible nerve: the anterior wing margin nerve.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Strains used in this work</title><p>All the strains tested and not retained for further investigations are listed in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>.

Briefly, a pierced centrifuge tube is fixed upside down on a Petri dish so that grape juice food inside the assemblage is accessible only by passage through the holes. In the alternative system, such access is prevented by a layer of glass wool. Flies explore and colonize the two systems equally, and over a variable time course they leave the "wrong" system and flock on the "good" one. We described the kinetics of aggregation in a previous article [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], showing a sub-social component of aggregation. Briefly, our data argued in favour of the following behavioural sequence: flies walking on a food spot are moving objects that generate signs (wing motion, proboscis extension, acoustic signs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].

The two spots are identical grape juice sources, except that one is complemented with denatonium (1 mg/ml) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Denatonium confers bitterness (distasteful for flies as for humans, no perceptible odour) without interfering with the grape juice odorants. We observed a robust behavioural phenotype of aggregation on the source without denatonium for most strains from our shelves (this suggests that flies evaluate the source before they lay eggs on it). We determined the ratio of aggregated flies on the "wrong" spot <italic>versus </italic>the "good" one. We checked bitterness detection with quinine (1 mg/ml), which is less drastic than denatonium because, after tasting, denatonium blocks food uptake for a few minutes.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Aggregation control in the taste/aggregation paradigm </bold>.

In other words, we showed that individual flies tested one by one were distributed randomly in a chamber, very different from the distribution obtained with a population of flies. Individual flies were counted in three compartments: immobile on surfaces, flying in the chamber, inside a pierced tube with food. We observed no evolution of the frequencies with which flies were present in these three compartments over a 5-hour time course. Furthermore, these frequencies were to some extent similar in all the strains tested including the <italic>sGC </italic>mutants (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> and the following paragraphs). We then assessed the collective ability of the flies to find a hidden food source in a misleading environmental context. Briefly, two systems compete for the attention of the flies in a chamber. One system consists of a pierced tube; the flies have to pass through the holes to reach a grape juice reward placed inside. The other system is the same except that it includes a layer of glass wool to prevent access. Controls show that the ability of <italic>sGC </italic>mutants to aggregate was unaffected (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We analyzed the kinetics of distribution and found that most mutants and <italic>C-S </italic>(wild type) flies, along with control <italic>ca </italic>or <italic>bv </italic>flies, stay in the unfavourable tube for only a limited time. When the experiment is carried out with <italic>sGC </italic>mutants, equal numbers of flies remain for longer in both tubes (see figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These mutants are trapped in the "forbidden" system by the odour gradient and it is obviously difficult for them to leave it and find the nearby "good" system. The other strains entering this system leave quickly and colonize the "good" system. In the same context, we found that heat shock-induced expression of <italic>sGC </italic>during metamorphosis (single acute heat shock delivered at the late third instar stage), then during the adult age (single acute heat shock delivered to 3 day old flies), significantly restored the wild type phenotype (see figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The complexity of the tasks performed (directional flight, detection of gradient, finding the holes) by most of the strains tested, including the <italic>sGC </italic>mutants, eliminates major sensory defects in these flies (visual, olfactory, acoustic). Sensory cells are not likely to account for the flaws in searching observed in the <italic>sGC </italic>mutants.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>sGC </italic>mutants disconnect exploration from detection of odour</title><p><italic>Drosophila </italic>have highly efficient machinery for exploring the environment, and in the course of exploration they simultaneously integrate olfactory, acoustic and visual signals to guide their journey. We used an odour-saturated atmosphere to evaluate how odour gradients guide exploratory behaviour in mutants. We first carried out experiments to analyze aggregation in an atmosphere aerated to preserve the odour gradient emitted from a source of grape juice (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). A parallel protocol was performed in a chamber with a grape juice-saturated atmosphere that eliminated gradients (see figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The final aggregates were counted in each tube. As expected, the most favourable tube (more grape juice) attracted the larger aggregates in the aerated atmosphere (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). When the experiment was carried out with the gradient abolished, we observed that most mutants tested, and the wild type fly (<italic>Cantonese S</italic>.), lost their exploratory behaviour and were unable to find the food sources. In odour-saturated air, the <italic>sGC </italic>mutants were significantly more capable of finding the hidden source without environmental olfactory cues for guidance (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Remarkably, the behaviour of the <italic>sGC </italic>mutants suggests that their exploratory capacity is not eliminated by the absence of gradient, as we might expect, so it is partially independent of olfaction. The rescue (third instar larvae then 3 day old adults exposed to a single acute heat shock) restores wild type behaviour (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Our data might be consistent with more aggressive and disorganized exploratory behaviour and might accord with published accounts of the behaviour of <italic>sGC </italic>mutant larvae, showing hyper-locomotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, we found that the most favourable spot was systematically more populated with <italic>sGC </italic>mutants in the saturated atmosphere, which suggests that unguided and random visiting of sites does not exclude secondary sub-social aggregation. We therefore conclude that <italic>sGC </italic>mutants disconnect exploration from the detection of odour gradients. We think that the protocol includes its own internal controls for the minimal functionality of the peripheral sensory systems. These data suggest regulation/control of exploration <italic>via </italic>the NO/cGMP pathway.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Exploration/aggregation in odours gradients</bold>.

Furthermore, females have to assess the quality of food resources in order to lay eggs. Interestingly, the choice of aggregation spot is a reliable collective evaluation of the food resources necessary to sustain larval development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Therefore, we reasoned that aggregation on a misleading and unfavourable spot in competition with a favourable spot could highlight a collective "mistake" in performing an aggregation task. We designed an experimental protocol as follows: two spots of identical grape juice food were placed in a chamber and constituted alternative choices for the attention of the flies. The only difference was that one was complemented with denatonium, which confers a bitter taste. The control showed that the total aggregated <italic>versus </italic>free in the chamber was of the same order in the different strains tested (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). We checked then that the bitter compounds are repulsive, and observation showed that recognition of bitter molecules is little affected by the mutations tested, including <italic>sGC </italic>(figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Using this protocol, we found that the <italic>sGC </italic>mutants aggregated significantly on the bitter spot during the time course of the experiment, whereas the controls flocked on the favourable spot (see figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The rescue (double heat shock delivered to third instar then 3 day old adult) significantly corrected the phenotype (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The control showed that the total aggregated <italic>versus </italic>free in the chamber was of the same order in the different strains tested, which again supports the inference that <italic>sGC </italic>mutations induced flaws in coincidental neuronal signalling. This suggests that <italic>sGC </italic>mutants partly disconnect taste from aggregation.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold><italic>sGC </italic>mutants disconnect taste and aggregation behaviour</bold>. The time course of aggregation on the two spots was analyzed with 200 flies. We used a chamber and two spots of grape juice.

(<italic>bottom</italic>) We tested bitterness recognition by the taste sense organs. Thirty flies were analyzed individually after they had been starved for 5 hours (received only water/agar). They were placed in the chamber and had to choose between two alternatives to feed (grape juice spot or grape juice/quinine spot) (see drawing in figure 5). Flies tended to fly away after proboscis extension when they detected quinine.

We failed to uncover the relevant circuitry because <italic>sGC </italic>is ubiquitous in the brain. Immunohistology using an anti-<italic>sGC </italic>antibody showed no specific labelling in any anatomical part of the brain (data not shown). <italic>sGC </italic>mutants have no structural brain defect as far we could observe by microscopy (data not shown). The cellular mass was identical to wild type, as measured by quantification of a neuronal marker recognized by anti-HRP antibody (data not shown). To approach the molecular mechanisms involved in these behavioural defects, we performed biochemical experiments with adult brains of <italic>sGC </italic>mutants and the rescue (induction of <italic>hsp</italic>-<italic>sGC </italic>at adult age in mutant background). We pursued this work although the neurons involved in the coincidence systems are probably "diluted" in the CNS. We analyzed the effects of three <italic>sGC </italic>mutations on the levels of expression of <italic>syt.eGFP </italic>and <italic>n-syb.eGFP</italic>. We found that <italic>sGC </italic>mutations slightly increase the levels of fluorescence of the two hybrid molecules, although the global effect is modest. Moreover, the rescue (induction of <italic>hsp</italic>-<italic>sGC </italic>at adult age in mutant background) diminishes significantly the level of fluorescence of the two hybrid molecules (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). We didn't see differences in <italic>sGC </italic>mutants and control regarding the amount of the three isoforms of <italic>syt </italic>molecules (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). However two <italic>syt </italic>isoforms were down regulated after overexpression of <italic>sGC </italic>in the rescue after heat shock. This argues in favour of a role for <italic>sGC </italic>to regulate the synthesis and/or transport of synaptic vesicle components along the axons after wiring.</p><p>In view of this complexity, we decided instead to focus on a simple coincidence system, the sensory organs of the wing margin, which has the advantage that two types of sensory neurons are entangled in the same axonal bundle: mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This simple system is highly accessible and relevant to flight guidance. Unilateral lesion of the wing margin nerve of <italic>C-S </italic>abolishes the aggregation phenomenon and the collective behaviour of these flies resembles that of individual flies.

Complex behaviours involve brain integration of multiple environmental signs in order to guide decisions. Flies might disregard some signs and overreact to others depending on the context. In this sense, the paradigm of molecular sensors of coincidence is advantageous in linking molecules to complex behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We carried out this work because the well-documented foraging genes in <italic>Drosophila </italic>and honeybee code for cGMP-dependent kinases, and pleiotropic effects are induced downstream of their activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. By better integrating the multiple environmental signs sensed by the neurosensory systems (visual, acoustic, olfactory, tactile), explorers variants (honeybee, <italic>drosophila</italic>) should be more equipped to face the adversity and hostility of the environment. In this report, we used tests designed to evaluate whether certain mutations in key molecules can specifically affect the integration of multiple neuronal signals that contribute to enabling flies to perform stereotyped tasks in exploration. We considered that flies naturally (innately) perform tasks involving skills and strategies for finding food and sexual partners, otherwise they would wander in the environment. The stereotyped tasks forming the basis of our tests constitute cycles of exploration/aggregation. Although highly complex gene networks and pleiotropy account for these complex behaviours, the phenomenon of coincidence highlighted in our tests seems to relate to a more restricted subset of genes. We screened more than twenty mutants of genes involved in neuronal signalling (Cam kinase, PKC, PKG mutants, mutants of synaptic machinery; see the list in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) and found that mutants of <italic>sGC </italic>(along with <italic>dnc </italic>mutants) present a marked behavioural phenotype. Abundant literature documents the role of <italic>sGC </italic>in neurobiology. Nitric oxide (NO) diffuses as short-lived messenger through the plasma membrane and serves, among many other functions, as an activator of the soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Authors have reported that NO could affect the steering decisions of growth cone during neuronal pathfinding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, authors have described that presynaptic elements are assembled into 'prototerminals' before being transported down the axons and these structures stop their migration when the axons contact a dentrite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Interestingly direct application of a NO donor to neurons resulted in inhibition of axonal transport of synaptophysin and synaptotagmin I tagged with EGFP in neuron culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Authors reported also that <italic>sGC </italic>is asymmetrically localized to the developing apical dendrites in mammal neurons and is required for the chemoattractive effect of some molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Authors have reported also a role of NO as "stop and go" signal for neuronal processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], a role in communication between sensory afferent neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], in long term depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and in retrograde signal to regulate the synaptic vesicle recycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. All together these elements argue for the presence of fragile and/or misguided synapses in our <italic>sGC </italic>mutants. The wing nerve analysis allowed us to evaluate that <italic>sGC </italic>mutations result in a continued synthesis and/or transport of synaptic vesicle components, which should be stopped by proper axon/dentrite wiring. The <italic>sGC </italic>mutants are viable. <italic>sGC </italic>is therefore not essential gene for major developmental steps. However, we were able to see obvious effect of this gene on the neuronal coincidence signalling based on behavioural tests.
