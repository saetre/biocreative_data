H2AL2 was used to reconstitute nucleosomes and the structural and functional properties of these particles were studied by a combination of biochemical approaches, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electron cryo-microscopy. DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprinting as well as micrococcal and exonuclease III digestion demonstrated an altered structure of the H2AL2 nucleosomes all over the nucleosomal DNA length. Restriction nuclease accessibility experiments revealed that the interactions of the H2AL2 histone octamer with the ends of the nucleosomal DNA are highly perturbed. AFM imaging showed that the H2AL2 histone octamer was complexed with only &#x0223c;130 bp of DNA. H2AL2 reconstituted trinucleosomes exhibited a type of a &#x02018;beads on a string&#x02019; structure, which was quite different from the equilateral triangle 3D organization of conventional H2A trinucleosomes. The presence of H2AL2 affected both the RSC and SWI/SNF remodeling and mobilization of the variant particles. These unusual properties of the H2AL2 nucleosomes suggest a specific role of H2AL2 during mouse spermiogenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Chromatin exhibits a repeating structure. The basic repeating unit of chromatin, the nucleosome, is formed upon wrapping of two superhelical turns of DNA around an octamer of core histones (two of each H2A, H2B, H3 and H4). The structures of the histone octamer and the nucleosome core particle were solved by X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). The histones within both the nucleosome and the histone octamer are constituted of structured histone fold domains and unstructured N-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The individual nucleosomes are connected by linker DNA and form the chromatin filament in this way. A fifth histone, termed linker histone, is associated with the linker DNA and it assists the folding of the chromatin filament into the 30 nm chromatin fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7 B8">4&#x02013;8</xref>).</p><p>The nucleosome is a repressive structure. It interferes with the cellular processes, which need access to naked DNA. The cell uses three main strategies to overcome the nucleosome barrier, namely posttranslational histone modifications, chromatin remodeling by ATP-consuming chromatin-remodeling machines and histone variants.</p><p>The N-termini of the histones play an essential role in the organization of both the chromatin fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and the mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The histone posttranslational modifications are essentially located at the non-structured N-termini of the histones. They can affect both the compaction of the chromatin fiber and the ability of remodeling machines to mobilize nucleosomes [for a recent review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>)]. A typical example for such role of the histone modifications is the acetylation of the core histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and in particular the acetylation of histone H4 at K16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Histone modifications serve also as marks. These marks are recognized by specific protein factors, which in turn have important functional consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>The chromatin remodelers are high molecular multiprotein complexes, which are able, at the expenses of ATP hydrolysis, to mobilize the nucleosomes. The chromatin remodelers are required for several vital cellular processes, including transcription, replication and DNA repair. They are grouped in four distinct families: SWI2/SNF2, ISWI, CHD and INO80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). SWI/SNF and RSC (both belonging to the SWI2/SNF2 family), in addition to their capacity to mobilize the nucleosomes, are also able to alter significantly the structure of the nucleosomal particle and even to evict the histone octamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>Histone variants are non-allelic isoforms of conventional histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). They show a variable degree of homology with their conventional counterparts [for a recent review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>)]. All core histones, with the exception of H4, have histone variants. The H2A histone variants form the largest family of histone variants, including macroH2A, H2A.Z, H2A.X, H2A.Bbd, etc. Recently, a novel histone mouse variant H2AL2, belonging to the H2A family, was described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments showed that H2AL2 is expressed in different tissues, but its expression was found to be remarkably strong during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>The incorporation of some of the histone variants within the nucleosomes resulted in alterations of its structure, which in turn, affected its functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26 B27">24&#x02013;27</xref>). The most striking example is H2A.Bbd. H2A.Bbd nucleosomes exhibited strong perturbations all over the nucleosomal DNA, these perturbations being stronger around the dyad axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). H2A.Bbd histone octamer was able to wrap only &#x0223c;130 bp of DNA and H2A.Bbd nucleosomes exhibited very low stability both <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In addition, the remodeling complexes SWI/SNF and ACF were unable to both remodel and mobilize the H2A.Bbd nucleosomes. Polymerase II activated transcription was more efficient from H2A.Bbd nucleosomal arrays than from conventional H2A templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The unusual docking domain of H2A.Bbd was important in determining these particular properties of the H2A.Bbd chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we have focused on the recently identified histone H2AL2. We confirmed the reported data that H2AL2 is expressed exclusively in testis and we have studied the structural and functional properties of the H2AL2-reconstituted nucleosomes. We show that the incorporation of this sperm-specific histone variant within the nucleosomes altered its structural properties dramatically. These structural perturbations affected both the remodeling and the relocation of the H2AL2 nucleosomes induced by either SWI/SNF or RSC chromatin remodelers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>H2AL2 cloning and preparation of DNA fragments</title><p>The H2AL2-coding sequence was amplified by PCR by using the EST IMAGE clone 6774311 cDNA and the primers 5&#x02032;&#x02013;TTTTCCTGGCCATATGGCCAGGAAAAGGCAAAGG-3&#x02032; (forward) and 5&#x02032;&#x02013;TGAGGATCCTCAGTTGTCATCAGGTTCTGGT&#x02013;3&#x02032; (reverse).

H2AL2 shows only 41% identity with conventional H2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The protein exhibits similar primary sequence to that of H2A.Bbd, a human variant of H2A (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Indeed, both H2A.Bbd and H2AL2 show an arginine tract at their N-termini and shorter docking domain than that of H2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). H2A.Bbd is mainly expressed in testis, but it was also found in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). RT-PCR data have suggested that H2AL2, similarly to H2A.Bbd, was expressed in different tissues, but mainly in testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Since PCR is, however, very sensitive to small contaminations; we have studied the expression of H2AL2 in different mouse tissues by using Northern blot analysis. The data show that, in general agreement with the reported data, H2AL2 is expressed only in testis (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp473/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>), suggesting that H2AL2 is a mouse testis-specific histone variant.</p><p>H2A.Bbd could be used to reconstitute nucleosomes, but the H2A.Bbd nucleosomes exhibited peculiar properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28 B29 B30">28&#x02013;30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Bearing in mind the primary sequence similarity between H2A.Bbd and H2AL2 one could expect similar behavior of H2AL2 nucleosomes. To test this we first reconstituted H2AL2 nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We expressed and purified conventional core histones as well as H2AL2 to homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) and used them to reconstitute nucleosome core particles by using <sup>32</sup>P-end-labeled 147 bp 601.2 positioning sequence. The data show (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) no presence of free DNA in the reconstituted both conventional and H2AL2 nucleosomes illustrating that H2AL2, similar to H2A.Bbd, could efficiently replace conventional H2A in the histone octamer.</p><p>To further show that the reconstituted particles contain a full complement of core histones, we used conventional and H2AL2 histone variant nucleosomes, reconstituted on 255 bp 601 DNA sequence. Both particles were run on 5% native gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D) and the bands corresponding to the respective particles were excised from the gel. Then we eluted the nucleosomes from the gel slices and separated the histones in 18% SDS&#x02013;PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E).

Numerous distinct alterations were observed in the DNase I digestion pattern of the H2AL2 nucleosome core particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, lanes 2&#x02013;7) compared to that of the conventional core particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, lanes 9&#x02013;14). Indeed, changes in the intensity of many bands corresponding to the DNase I digestion products all over the length of the nucleosomal DNA were clearly detected. The OH cleavage pattern of the H2AL2 255-bp nucleosome particle also exhibited some alterations. These alterations were more pronounced towards the end of the DNA complexed with the H2AL2 histone octamer, where the contrast of the bands was clearly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 1 and 2). We attributed these changes in the DNase I and OH cleavage patterns to reflect H2AL2-associated perturbations in the overall structure of the variant nucleosome. </p></sec><sec><title>Micrococcal and exonuclease III digestion demonstrates a distinct organization of the H2AL2 nucleosome</title><p>The structure of the H2AL2 nucleosomes was further investigated by micrococcal nuclease and exonuclease III digestion. For the experiments with micrococcal nuclease, a 255 bp 601 sequence was <sup>32</sup>P-body labeled and used for reconstitution of both conventional and H2AL2 nucleosomes. These nucleosomes were centrally positioned leaving two free DNA arms of 52 and 56 bp, respectively. Identical amounts (&#x0223c;50 ng) of these two samples were incubated in the presence of 1 &#x003bc;g of naked DNA (the presence of nearly 20-fold excess of naked DNA allows a very precise standardization of the digestion conditions; note that under these conditions the nucleosomes are stable and no transfer of histones to the naked DNA was observed) for the indicated times with 8 units/ml of micrococcal nuclease and after arresting the digestion, DNA was isolated and run on a 10% PAGE under native conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). In the case of conventional particles, the free DNA arms were rapidly digested and a stable digestion intermediate, corresponding to the core particle, is generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, lanes 2&#x02013;6). Note that even at the longest time of digestion (32 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A) a very weak subnucleosomal digestion band was detected. The H2AL2 particles show, however, different digestion pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, lanes 8&#x02013;12). Indeed, a strong band corresponding to the subnucleosomal particle was already observed at 8 min of digestion and at the longest time of digestion (32 min) essentially only subnucleosomal particles were generated. This demonstrates that the H2AL2 nucleosomal DNA is more accessible to micrococcal nuclease suggesting that its structure is more relaxed compared to that of the conventional particle. </p><p>The accessibility of H2AL2 reconstituted nucleosomal arrays to micrococcal nuclease was also investigated and was compared to that of conventional nucleosomal arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). The data clearly show that, as in the case of mononucleosomes, the H2AL2 arrays are more rapidly digested than the conventional ones indicating that not only the monosomes but also the nucleosomal H2AL2 arrays exhibited more relaxed structure.</p><p>The accessibility of H2AL2 nucleosomes to exonuclease III was also studied. These experiments use a centrally positioned nucleosome reconstituted on a <sup>32</sup>P-5&#x02032;end-labeled 255 bp 601 DNA sequence. This nucleosome bears, as mentioned above, two free DNA &#x02018;arms&#x02019; of 52 and 56 bp, respectively. Incubation of the conventional nucleosomes with exonuclease III results into two major stable intermediates: a first one, located at position 200 bp, and thus corresponding to the border of the particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, lanes 2&#x02013;5) and a second one at around 185 bp position and reflecting an arrest of the nuclease in the interior of the particle. Small amounts of lower molecular weight intermediates are also generated at longer times of incubation with the enzyme. Upon increasing the time of digestion the amount of the first intermediate decreases, that of the second increases, but even at the longest time of digestion the first intermediate is still present. The exonuclease III digestion profile of the H2AL2 particle was totally different from that of the conventional one, since six distinct digestion products were produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, lanes 7&#x02013;10), the molecular masses of the first three higher molecular bands being the same as those of the conventional particles. Increasing the time of digestion leads to the generation of mainly lower molecular mass fragments, corresponding to pauses of the exonuclease deeply in the interior of the H2AL2 particle. The observed ability of exonuclease III to overcome the structural barriers imposed by the H2AL2 particle evidences for weaker histone&#x02013;DNA interactions, and thus for weaker stability of this particle.</p></sec><sec><title>The &#x02018;one pot assay&#x02019; shows that the interactions between the histone octamer and the ends of nucleosomal DNA are highly perturbed within the H2AL2 particle</title><p>To further study the structure of the H2AL2 histone variant nucleosome we also used a recently described &#x02018;one pot assay&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Briefly, both conventional and H2AL2 147-bp core particles were reconstituted by using eight mutated <sup>32</sup>P-end-labeled 601.2 DNA sequences. Each individual sequence was mutated in a way to introduce a single Hae III restriction site in it. All restriction sites exhibit the same rotational position with an outward-facing minor groove and are separated by 10 base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) [for simplicity further in the text the Hae III restriction sites will be designated as d<sub>0</sub> (superhelical position 0) to d<sub>7</sub> (superhelical position 7)]. Then, the nucleosome samples were incubated with 5 units/&#x003bc;l of Hae III for increasing times. After arresting the reaction, DNA was isolated and run on 8% PAGE under denaturing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). The quantification of the HaeIII cleavage efficiency at the different sites is shown at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B. As seen, major differences in the cleavage efficiencies are observed at d<sub>5</sub> and d<sub>6</sub>, i. e. close to the end of the nucleosomal DNA (note that under our experimental conditions we were unable to separate the HaeIII d<sub>7</sub> cleavage products from the non-cleaved fragments, which did not allow the calculation of the cleavage efficiency at d<sub>7</sub>). Indeed, both the initial rate of cleavage (the slope of the curves) as well as the saturation of the cleavage are much higher for these superhelical positions for the H2AL2 nucleosomes compared to those of the conventional ones. We conclude that the histone&#x02013;DNA interactions at the end of the nucleosomal DNA are strongly perturbed within the H2AL2 particle. Note that there are also differences inside the nucleosome, particularly at d<sub>0</sub>, d<sub>2</sub> and d<sub>4</sub> consistent with the DNase I digestion data as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>. </p></sec><sec><title>AFM imaging of conventional and H2AL2 nucleosomes</title><p>The described structural alterations in the H2AL2 nucleosomes are similar to those of the H2A.Bbd nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).

With this in mind, we next asked whether the H2AL2 variant histone octamer exhibited the same property, i.e. whether it also organizes less DNA than the conventional octamer does (147 bp). To this end, we imaged both centrally positioned conventional and H2AL2 nucleosomes reconstituted on 255 bp 601 DNA fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B). The relatively long free DNA arms present at each end of the nucleosome allowed their precise length measurement by AFM image analysis.

The measurements were performed in a large number of objects (<italic>N</italic> = 1252 conventional and <italic>N</italic> = 2805 H2AL2 nucleosomes), which made them statistically relevant. The mean of the length distribution for DNA complexed with the conventional histone octamer was located close to 145 bp and interestingly around 130 bp, for the variant H2AL2 nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). The position of the nucleosome relative to the DNA center, &#x025b5;<italic>L</italic>, was the same for both particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). </p></sec><sec><title>Electron cryo-microscopy shows a very open structure of the H2AL2 tri-nucleosomes</title><p>The perturbation of the histone&#x02013;DNA interactions at d<sub>5</sub>&#x02013;d<sub>6</sub> and the ability of the H2AL2 octamer to organize only &#x0223c;130 bp may affect the entry/exit angle of the nucleosomal DNA ends. To test this we have used electron cryo-microscopy (EC-M). E-CM experiments are performed in vitrified solutions without the utilization of any contrasting reagents, which allows the visualization of the &#x02018;native&#x02019;, unperturbed structure of the samples. E-CM was very successfully used for investigating the structure of both reconstituted conventional and H2A.Bbd histone variant nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) as well as native oligosomes and high molecular weight chromatin samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Note that the trinucleosomes are of particular interest for studying the linker orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). With this in mind, we have reconstituted precisely positioned 601 conventional and H2AL2 trinucleosomes and visualized them by E-CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The conventional trinucleosomes exhibited a typical &#x02018;V&#x02019; (equilateral triangle) shape with two nucleosomes located at each end of the trinucleosomal DNA and the middle nucleosome at the &#x02018;point&#x02019; of the &#x02018;V&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). The 3D organization of the H2AL2 trinucleosomes was, however, quite different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). Typically, the H2AL2 trinucleosome shows &#x02018;beads on a string&#x02019; organization, and in some cases, a very open &#x02018;V&#x02019; type organization with the linker DNAs forming a very large angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). We conclude that the variant H2AL2 octamer cannot properly organize the 3D conformation of the entry/exit nucleosomal DNA. We attribute this to the altered interactions of the entry/exit ends of nucleosomal DNA with the H2AL2 histone variant octamer. </p></sec><sec><title>The presence of H2AL2 affected both RSC and SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling and mobilization</title><p>The data described above unequivocally demonstrate that the incorporation of H2AL2 in the nucleosomes results in perturbation of their structure. Perturbation in the nucleosome structure induced by the presence of the histone variant H2A.Bbd led to inhibition of both nucleosome remodeling and mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). This prompted us to next ask if H2AL2, as H2A.Bbd, interferes with nucleosome remodeling and mobilization. DNase I footprinting assay was used for studying the capacity of RSC and SWI/SNF to remodel the nucleosomes. Conventional and H2AL2 end-positioned nucleosomes were reconstituted on <sup>32</sup>P-end-labeled 200 bp 601 DNA sequence. Identical amounts of both samples were incubated for different times (from 2.5 to 40 min) at 30&#x000b0;C with either RSC or SWI/SNF. After arresting the remodeling reaction, the samples were treated with DNase I, the digested DNA was purified and run on 8% PAGE under denaturing conditions. SWI/SNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A) and RSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B) remodeled both conventional and H2AL2 nucleosomes. The 10-bp DNase I nucleosomal repeat was lost and many bands corresponding to the respective bands of the digestion of free DNA were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A and B, compare lanes 2&#x02013;7 with lanes 9&#x02013;14). However, both RSC and SWI/SNF remodeled about 2.5 times more efficiently the conventional particles as determined by quantification of the intensity of some specific bands (results not shown). We conclude, that the presence of H2AL2, similarly to that of H2A.Bbd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), interferes with nucleosome remodeling. </p><p>Is H2AL2 able to affect nucleosome mobilization? To test this we have carried out a standard nucleosome mobilization assay. Centrally positioned conventional and H2AL2 nucleosomes were reconstituted by using <sup>32</sup>P-end-labeled 255 bp 601 fragment and incubated for 45 min (in the presence of ATP) with increasing amount of either RSC or SWI/SNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Treatment with the remodelers resulted, as expected, in loss of the 10-bp repeat in the DNase I digestion pattern of either one of the particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B). However, careful comparison of the remodeled patterns (lanes 2 and 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B) shows again some differences. Indeed, the remodeling of the conventional nucleosomes was stronger compared to that of the variant particles. In addition, some bands present in the digestion pattern of remodeled conventional nucleosomes were not detected in the digestion pattern of remodeled H2AL2 nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B, bands marked by stars). These results are in agreement with the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> for the 200-bp H2AL2 nucleosome and evidence for a less-efficient remodeling of the variant H2AL2 255 bp particle.</p><p>Under the conditions of the experiments both remodelers induced a relocation of conventional nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). Although, neither RSC nor SWI/SNF was able to relocate efficiently the H2AL2 histone variant octamer to the end of the nucleosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). Quantification of the data showed that the efficiency (the initial slope of the curves, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A, lower panels) of the variant H2AL2 histone octamer relocation at the end of the nucleosomal DNA by either one of the remodelers was at least 10-fold lower than that of the conventional histone octamer. Note, however, that the upper band corresponding to the centrally positioned H2AL2 nucleosomes is becoming larger upon incubation with higher amounts of either RSC or SWI/SNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). This might be associated with some heterogenization due to either histone&#x02013;DNA contacts disruption and/or short range relocation of the H2AL2 particles.</p><p>We have also studied the capacity of RSC to mobilize H2AL2 nucleosomes by using an enzyme restriction assay (see schematics of the assay, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A). We have first incubated both conventional and H2AL2 nucleosomes with an amount of RSC sufficient to relocate the conventional nucleosomes at the end of the nucleosomal DNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). After arresting the reaction, both types of nucleosomes were digested with Xba 1, whose restriction site is located in the linker DNA at 233 bp from the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled end of the nucleosomal DNA. If the nucleosomes were mobilized by RSC (in the presence of ATP) one should expect the yield of cleavage to drop two-fold (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A). This was really the case for conventional nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B and C). In contrast, essentially no change in the Xba 1 cleavage yield for the RSC incubated H2AL2 nucleosomes was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B and C). These data combined with the EMSA results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A) demonstrate that the presence of H2AL2 interferes with the chromatin remodeler induced relocation of the variant particles at the end of the nucleosomal DNA. This conclusion was further supported by studying the RSC-induced mobilization by AFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>D). The AFM imaging showed that treatment with RSC generated conventional, but essentially not H2AL2, end-positioned nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>D). <fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>XbaI nuclease restriction and AFM analyses of the RSC-induced relocation of conventional and histone variant H2AL2 nucleosomes.

The XbaI restriction site is located in the linker DNA of the nucleosome at 233 bases from the end of the <sup>32</sup>P-end-labeled 601.2 DNA fragment. If RSC induces sliding of the nucleosome, the cut efficiency of XbaI is expected to decrease two-fold (the nucleosome will be mobilized to both ends of the DNA fragment, left panel). If RSC is unable to mobilize the nucleosome, no decrease of the XbaI cut efficiency will be observed (right panel). (<bold>B</bold>) Identical amounts (150 ng) of H2A (left panel) or H2AL2 (right panel) <sup>32</sup>P-end-labeled nucleosomes were incubated with 0.04 units/&#x003bc;l of XbaI either in the presence or the absence of 1 mM ATP. After digestion for the times indicated, the reaction was stopped and the digestion products were separated on the same 8% sequencing gel (the migrated products, which loading was not adjacent in the original gel, are demarked by vertical lines). The positions of the full length (FL) and cut DNA fragment are indicated on the left of the figure. (<bold>C</bold>) Quantifications of the data presented in (B). Note the 2-fold decrease of cut yield for the conventional H2A nucleosomes (Nuc H2A, left panel) and the absence of effect on the cut yield in the case of H2AL2 (Nuc H2AL2, right panel) nucleosomes. The digestion with Xba 1 was carried out in remodeling buffer and under these conditions a digestion plateau was reached at &#x0223c;50&#x02013;60%. (<bold>D</bold>) Position distribution (&#x00394;<italic>L</italic>) of conventional and H2AL2 histone variant nucleosomes before and after treatment with RSC. Either conventional or H2AL2 nucleosomes were treated with RSC in the presence of ATP and the samples were visualized by AFM. The insets indicate the centrally positioned (first peak) and the mobilized, end-positioned conventional nucleosomes (second peak). The numbers of analyzed nucleosomes are: N(H2A-RSC) = 524, N(H2A+RSC) = 688 conventional nucleosomes and N(H2AL2-RSC) = 1063 and N(H2AL2+RSC) = 1341 variant nucleosomes, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp473f9"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this work, we have studied the structural and functional properties of the histone variant H2AL2 nucleosomes. We confirmed that this histone variant is testis-specific and we show that it can efficiently replace conventional H2A in the nucleosome. The variant H2AL2 nucleosome exhibited both structural and functional properties distinct from those of the conventional ones. DNase I and OH footprinting, micrococcal nuclease and exonuclease III digestion and nucleosomal DNA restriction nuclease accessibility assay demonstrated alterations in the overall H2AL2 nucleosome structure. AFM imaging showed that only &#x0223c;130 bp of DNA were wrapped around the H2AL2 histone variant octamer. The H2AL2 trinucleosomes exhibited essentially &#x02018;beads on a string&#x02019; nucleosomal organization in contrast to the conventional trinucleosomes, which showed equilateral triangle shape. Finally, we found that H2AL2 nucleosomes cannot be efficiently both remodeled and relocated at the end of the nucleosomal DNA by either one of the chromatin remodelers RSC or SWI/SNF. The effect of H2AL2 on the efficiency of nucleosome relocation was, however, more pronounced than that on the efficiency of nucleosome remodeling. Note that for the reconstitution of the nucleosomal samples we have used <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> core histones H2B, H3 and H4, but their mouse analogs are essentially the same, and thus the described results would not be affected.</p><p>The above-summarized data indicate that the observed perturbations in the H2AL2 nucleosome structure were sufficient to induce an impediment of the remodeling of the nucleosome and the relocation of the variant histone octamer to the nucleosomal DNA end. In particular, the alterations in the wrapping of DNA around the H2AL2 variant histone octamer may not allow the proper binding of the variant particle in the nucleosome-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43 B44 B45">43&#x02013;45</xref>) of both RSC and SWI/SNF.</p><p>H2AL2 is a testis-specific histone variant [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and this work]. H2A.Bbd is also expressed mainly in testis. Common properties of the H2AL2 and H2A.Bbd particles are their altered structures and their capacity to interfere with the remodelers&#x02019; function, i.e. to interfere with nucleosome remodeling and relocation. Therefore, both histones would be involved in the <italic>in vivo</italic> &#x02018;construction&#x02019; of distinct nucleosomes with specialized functions. These functions would require an easier removal of the variant dimers from the nucleosome and no nucleosome mobilization.</p><p>We have reported earlier that the docking domain of H2A.Bbd is required for nucleosome mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Since the docking domain of H2AL2 differed considerably from that of the conventional H2A and its length is closer to that of H2A.Bbd (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), this indicates that the cells in both mouse and human use very similar strategies to generate nucleosomes lacking the ability to be mobilized by chromatin remodelers.</p><p>The H2A.Bbd nucleosomes exhibited an open structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The H2AL2 trinucleosomes also showed an open (beads on a string type) structure and micrococcal nuclease digestion of H2AL2 nucleosome arrays suggest a more relaxed organization of these variant arrays. This appeared to be determined by the altered interactions of the H2AL2 histone octamer with the ends of the nucleosome DNA (this work). Since for the H2A.Bbd the docking domain was required for the generation of the open nucleosome structure we hypothesize that the H2AL2-altered docking domain is also involved in the generation of the open structure of the H2AL2 nucleosomes and nucleosomal arrays. This open structure of both H2A.Bbd and H2L2A chromatin filaments could play an important role during different spermiogenesis-specific processes, including replacement of these histone variants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp473/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp473_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-powerpoint" xlink:href="gkp473_nar-00048-m-2009-File003.ppt"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>INSERM and CNRS; La Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer (Equipe labelis&#x000e9; La Ligue to S.D.) the Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer (Grant N 4821 to D.A.); the R&#x000e9;gion Rh&#x000f4;ne-Alpes (Convention CIBLE 2008 to D.A. and S.D.); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (Grant Blanc &#x02018;CHROREMBER&#x02019; to S.D., D.A. and J.B) and the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic (Grant #304/05/2168 to J.B.) and the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (Grants MSM0021620806 and LC535 to J.B.) and the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic (Grant #AV0Z50110509 to J.B.).
