In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), secretory proteins are subjected to a stringent quality control process to eliminate misfolded proteins by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway.

Substrates of the proteasome are often covalently modified by the ubiquitin (Ub) molecule, an abundant 76-residue protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Schwartz1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Weissman1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Ub is activated and transferred to the substrate via several enzymes including a Ub-activating enzyme (E1), a Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a Ub-protein ligase (E3). The rate-limiting step is likely the recognition and ubiquitylation of the substrate by the E3 enzyme. The ubiquitylated substrate is then degraded by proteasome.

Nearly one third of cellular proteins enter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) on their way to various cellular destinations. The folding state of secretory proteins is actively monitored in the ER. Immature proteins are retained to fold properly by ER chaperones. To prevent toxicity by the accumulation of aberrant proteins, terminally misfolded proteins are disposed of via a process termed ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Ellgaard1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Romisch1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. More specifically, these malfolded proteins are returned to the cytosol and recognized by a Ub-protein ligase (E3), which decorates misfolded proteins with Ub molecules that mark the substrate for proteasome-mediated proteolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Ciechanover1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Recent findings suggest that at least two checkpoints are employed to sort ERAD substrates into different degradation pathways based on the location of the misfolded domain (e.g. membrane, lumen, or cytosol) and the topology of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Vashist1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Carvalho1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Denic1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. ERAD substrates with lesions exposed in the cytosol, termed ERAD-C, are selected for degradation by the Doa10 (E3) pathway. ERAD substrates with lesions in either ER membrane (ERAD-M) or ER lumen (ERAD-L) are ubiquitylated by an E3 complex composed of Hrd1 (a RING finger containing protein) and Hrd3. Interestingly, ERAD-L requires two additional proteins resided in the ER membrane, Usa1 and Der1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Carvalho1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Denic1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. While Der1 is proposed to be involved in the substrate retro-translocation since it has four transmembrane domains, the specific role of Usa1 in ERAD is unknown.</p><p>In the cytosol, the ATPase Cdc48 in complex with two Ub-binding proteins Ufd1 and Npl4 recognizes Ub chains and uses its chaperone activity to extract ubiquitylated proteins out of the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Vembar1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Meusser1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

We show herein that the UBL motif is largely dispensable for the functioning of Usa1 in ERAD-L substrate degradation. We demonstrate that Usa1 is specifically involved in the ERAD substrate ubiquitylation step. Our deletion analysis uncovers two domains essential for Usa1 function, one of which binds the Hrd1-Hrd3 E3 complex.

To facilitate the detection of Usa1 protein, Usa1 and its mutant alleles were separately fused to Flag-epitope. Yeast extracts expressing Usa1 derivatives were divided into total, soluble, and membrane fractions. Whereas the soluble Rad23 protein partitioned into supernatant portion, Usa1 mainly resides in the membrane fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007604-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). None of the N-terminal deletions affected the localization of Usa1 to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007604-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Small amount of Usa1 (less than 5&#x00025;) was also detected in the soluble fractions. Whether this is due to insufficient fractionation or related to its role in pre-mRNA splicing remains further investigation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Awasthi1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Then, we also carried out pulse-chase assays to measure the stabilities of Usa1 and its derivatives. Wild-type and mutant Usa1 are stable proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007604-g003">Figure 3E</xref> and data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Defective Usa1-E3 binding affects substrate ubiquitylation</title><p>To examine the specific defects caused by these deletions, we examined the ubiquitylation pattern in <italic>usa1</italic> mutants. As expected, CPY&#x0002a; ubiquitylation was compromised in cells lacking <italic>USA1</italic> or <italic>HRD1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007604-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). We found reduced ubiquitylation of CPY&#x0002a; in two non-UBL deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007604-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that these two domains are required for substrate ubiquitylation. Interestingly, CPY&#x0002a; ubiquitylation is consistently more severely reduced in d3&#x00394; mutant than in usa1 null. Although the underlying mechanism is not known, one possible explanation is that d3&#x00394; deletion may exert a dominant negative effect since, unlike usa1 null mutant, it still has other functional domains such as the first N-terminal region and membrane anchoring domain. We suspect that these two mutations may affect the association between Usa1 and other ERAD-L ubiquitylation components. First, we determined the interaction between Usa1 derivatives and Hrd1 by co-immunoprecipitations. Interestingly, deletion of the middle portion (i.e. d3&#x00394;) abolished the binding between Usa1 and Hrd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007604-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) and also reduced the Usa1-Hrd3 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007604-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting that the interaction between Usa1 and the Hrd1-Hrd3 E3 complex is important for ERAD. The N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1&#x02013;525) binds efficiently to Hrd1 in the absence of transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007604-g004">Figure 4C</xref> and data not shown). We also examined the binding between Usa1 and Der1. To this end, we employed Der1-TAP, which does not support ERAD but, nevertheless, associates with the other components of the Hrd1-complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Carvalho1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. None of the mutations affects the Usa1-Der1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007604-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Usa1 is also known to interact with the chaperone complex Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Carvalho1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, which recognize and extract ubiquitylated proteins out of the ER membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Ye1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Jarosch1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Rabinovich1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since the d1&#x00394; mutant retained the bindings to Hrd1, Hrd3 and Der1, the results also suggest that the extreme N-terminal domain of Usa1 plays a different, but undefined essential function in ERAD-L ubiquitylation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Since the discovery of ERAD over a decade ago, the physiological significance of ERAD has been increasingly appreciated owing to its emerging, prominent role in human diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Ciechanover1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Vembar1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. However, many important questions remain: For example, how are substrates selected for degradation? How are substrates retro-tranlocated across the ER membrane? How are substrates ubiquitylated? How are ubiquitylated substrates transferred to the proteasome? Studies in yeast have led the way in uncovering critical mechanistic attributes and the physiologic functions of ERAD. Many key players in ERAD were first identified in yeast, and nearly all of them have human counterparts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Meusser1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Denic1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Assigning each ERAD factor to the specific events mentioned above presents the first step to unravel this highly coordinated choreography of ERAD.</p><p>Compromised CPY&#x0002a; ubiquitylation in usa1 mutants suggests the involvement of Usa1 in ERAD-L ubiquitylation. Currently, it is unknown whether Usa1 regulates substrate ubiquitylation directly or indirectly. Given the membrane barrier, ERAD-L ubiquitylation is likely much more complicated than typical ubiquitylation carried out by a normal E2&#x02013;E3 pair. Besides Ubc6 E2 and Hrd1 E3, other proteins (e.g. Cue1, Hsp70 chaperones) have also been implicated in ERAD substrate ubiquitylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Han1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Biederer1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Identification of these ubiquitylation regulators would facilitate in vitro reconstitution of ERAD ubiquitylation.</p><p>Given its ER membrane localization and mainly cytosolic topology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Carvalho1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, Usa1 has the potential to play multiple key roles in the ERAD pathway. Interestingly, the putative UBL motif and the C-terminal tail are not essential for ERAD-L substrate degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007604-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007604-g003">3</xref>). Usa1 bridges Der1 and Hrd1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Carvalho1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, which in turn could ensure the coupling of retrotranslocation and ubiquitylation. Our results also suggest that likely Usa1 has another function in ERAD in addition to its associations with Der1, Hrd1 and Hrd3 since the d1&#x00394; mutant with largely intact bindings to Der1 and Hrd1/Hrd3 is defective for CPY&#x0002a; ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007604-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The specific function of the first 250 amino acids of Usa1 is unknown, but may bring other cytosolic factors required for substrate ubiquitylation close to Hrd1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Vembar1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Romisch1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results suggest that Usa1 also works with the Hrd1&#x02013;Hrd3 E3 complex to facilitate substrate ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007604-g004">Figure 4</xref>). How might Usa1 assist Hrd1 in attaching ubiquitins onto misfolded proteins? In the presence of E1 and E2, Hrd1 alone is sufficient to catalyze self-ubiquitylation <italic>in vitro</italic>, indicating that Hrd1 has the Ub-protein ligase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Bays1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Usa1 is likely not essential for turning on the enzymatic activity of Hrd1, but may still stimulate Hrd1 activity. It remains a possibility that Usa1 could be involved in substrate retro-translocation. Our data provides new insights regarding the mechanism governing ERAD substrate ubiquitylation and lays the foundation for uncovering the more detailed events in the ERAD pathway.</p><p>The human homologue of Usa1 is thought to be Herp since Herp partially restores the ERAD-L pathway in <italic>usa1&#x00394;</italic> yeast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Carvalho1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

The precise function of Herp remains elusive. Like Usa1, Herp also interacts with the mammalian Hrd1&#x02013;Hrd3 complex and is required for the degradation of ERAD substrates (e.g., CD3-delta, connexin 43) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Hori1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-OkudaShimizu1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007604-Schulze1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.
