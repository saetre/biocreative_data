After lung injury, alveolar epithelial type II cells are known as progenitor cells in the lung to regenerate and restore the damage. Accordingly, it is hypothesized that factors which facilitate proliferation of these cells would contribute to the enhancement of lung regeneration and furthermore may lead to treatment option.</p><p>Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is 37-amino acid neuropeptide found among neuroendocrine cells, sensory C fibers, blood vesssels and lymphoid tissues in the normal lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In addition to the function of vasodilatation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], bronchial protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], regulatory function of macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and regulation of airway responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], CGRP has been reported to play a role in proliferation of epithelial and endothelial cells of various types, such as human endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], tracheal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], retinal pigment epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and thymic epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Meanwhile, it has been reported that pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and neuroendocrine bodies become neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia during the restoration process, and these cells produce CGRP and have paracrine effect on cell proliferation in the lung microenvironment in airway and alveolar epithelial injury animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We have reported that relation between inflammation or fibrosis and CGRP expression in the animal models exposed to dusts of various types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the models of lung injury induced by crystalline silica, crocidolite asbestos and bleomycin, pathological findings of lung inflammation increased progressively in a time dependent manner, while low levels of CGRP concentration in lungs were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. On the other hand, in lung injury induced by exposure to silicon carbide whisker and potassium octatitanate whisker, strong inflammation was transient, then lung inflammation abated gradually, while high levels of CGRP concentration in the lung were observed at an early phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These findings suggest that CGRP is involved in the lung restoration. Moreover, it has been reported that ablation of the CGRP-releasing sensory neurons aggravates severe inflammation, and absence of CGRP intensifies the inflammatory reaction of tissues induced by reperfusion in the CGRP-knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It is therefore thought that CGRP and sensory neurons play an important role in maintaining the tissue integrity by regulating local inflammatory responses in the lung.</p><p>The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is a critical pathway involved in the proliferation of many cell types including alveolar epithelial cells.</p><p>On the basis of our hypothesis that CGRP proliferates alveolar epithelial cells, we have examined the effects of CGRP on the proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells and ERK signalling pathway as one of the cell proliferation pathways <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>A549 cells (RIKEN gene bank, Japan), originally derived from human lung carcinoma were cultured in Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (GIBCO Invitrogen, Japan) with 5% fatal bovin serum (FBS) (Biosource, Japan) containing 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin (Nakarai, Japan) in a humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>at 37&#x000b0;C. Cell cultures were passaged at confluency approximately every three days. Cells were then removed from monolayer culture in trypsin containing ethylinedimine tetraacetic acid, counted with a hemocytometer and plated in each well.

Aliquots of 20&#x02013;30 &#x003bc;g protein were boiled in loading buffer (New England Biolabs, USA) for 2 minutes, then loaded onto 12% Tris-glycine-polyacrylamide gel (Cambrex, USA) and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes.</p><p>40 &#x003bc;g of cell homogenate protein were added to gel loading buffer (final concentration: 50 mM Tris, 70 mM NaCl, 1% sodium lauryl sulfate (SDS), 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) and electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gel (15%) in the presence of 0.1% SDS by using the Mini Protein 3 Dlectrophoresis System (Bio-Rad). The samples were electrophoretically blotted on polyvinylidine difloride membrane (ECL Western Blotting Detection System, Amersham Biosciences, USA) at 25V for one hour by transblot apparatus. Subsequently, the samples were incubated with 3% milk-Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 for one hour, after which they were incubated at room temperature overnight with rabbit anti-human p42/44 ERK and phospho- p42/44 ERK antibody (dilution 1/1,000, Cell Signalling Technology Inc., Japan) in 3% milk-Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20. After three times of washing, the membrane was incubated with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) (dilution 1/5,000) for one hour. The membrane was then washed three times, and the signals were finally visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences).

After amplification in <italic>E. coli</italic>, the expression cassette was excised from pShuttle2 and ligated to Adeno-X Viral DNA (the adenoviral genome). Because pShuttle2 and Adeno-X Viral DNA carried different antibiotic selection markers, we did not purify the expression cassette fragment for ligation with Adeno-X. In the final stage, the recombinant Adeno-X vector was packaged into infectious adenovirus by transfecting human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Recombinant adenovirus was harvested by lysing transfected cells. Recombinant adenoviruses titer was determined by Titer Kit (Clontech Laboratories). Purified viruses were stored in PBS and kept at -80&#x000b0;C until use.</p></sec><sec><title>In vivo analysis</title><p>The rats were handled according to the guidelines described in the Japanese Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as approved by the University of Occupational and Environmental Health Animal Care and Use Committee. Male Wister rats (n = 5, 10 weeks old, mean body weight 256 &#x000b1; 20 g) were purchased from Kyudo (Kumamoto, Japan). They were anesthetized with inhaled ether in the box, and treated by intratracheal injection of rhCGRP (4.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8 </sup>infectious unit) or saline through a cannula using a laryngoscope. They were assigned to a rhCGRP group (n = 5) and a saline control group (n = 5) for each exposure category and maintained for 7 days after the injection. Each rat was then sacrificed with a fatal over dosage of Nembutal (Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma, Japan) intraperitoneally. After severing the abdominal aorta, both lungs were removed and fixed by intratracheal instillation of 4% paraformaldehyde (MERCK, Japan) at 25 cmH<sub>2</sub>O pressure. The lung and trachea were excised from the surrounding tissue and allowed to stand at 4&#x000b0;C for 24 hours. The tissue was washed for 10 minutes in PBS, dehydrated by immersing in a graded series of one hour ethanol washes, before being finally maintained in 100% ethanol at 4&#x000b0;C. The lung tissue was embedded in paraffin and cut into each 5 &#x003bc;m section, and Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemical staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Dako, Denmark) were performed.</p><p>For PCNA immunohistochemistry, the tissue sections were air-dried, and deparaffinized by washing in xylene for 3 minutes four times, followed by dehydration through a series of 100% to 70% ethanol washes. The slides were placed in methanol containing 0.3% hydrogen peroxide to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating with 10% goat serum for 10 minutes at room temperature. Then the lung sections were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with monoclonal mouse antibody specific for PCNA (diluted 1:500&#x02013;1:1000 before use). The sections were rinsed three times in 0.1 M PBS and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody, then incubated with avidin-biotin complex (DAKO JAPAN, Japan) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Sections were washed with PBS and incubated with diaminobenzidine for 7 minutes, and counterstained with hematoxylin. Tissue incubations without the primary or secondary antibody were carried out as labeling controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Values were expressed as mean &#x000b1; one standard deviation.

Meanwhile, hyperplasia of alveolar epithelial cells reportedly occurred in the early phase (2&#x02013;7 days after the exposure) in the rat lungs dissected 2&#x02013;28 days after KGF intratracheal injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The finding of alveolar epithelial cell proliferation on the seventh day after the CGRP exposure is similar to other growth factors.</p><p>The result that preadministration of CGRP receptor inhibitor restrained increase of alveolar epithelial cell proliferation by CGRP seems to be supported by the previous findings that CGRP was produced by the paracrine effect in the lung microenvironment, resulting in proliferation of airway and alveolar epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and that CGRP receptors were found in the membrane of A549 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Generally, CGRP in the normal lung is secreted from neuroendocrine cells existing in the central airways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and there are several reports indicating that CGRP is secreted from A549 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In these reports, CGRP secretion from A549 cells increased under the condition of hypoxia, and they also suggested that distribution of CGRP secretion would be different under stressful situations.</p><p>We also observed ERK phosphorylation during CGRP induced cell proliferation. The ERK pathway is a critical pathway involved in the proliferation of many cell types, and proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells induced by ERK activation has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Our result showed that ERK activation peaked between 5 minutes and one hour after the exposure of CGRP and continued for at least 18 hours. In studies with KGF which proliferates alveolar epithelial cells, ERK activation appeared after 5 minutes and lasted for 90 minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Such result showed similar tendency to the findings in this study.</p><p>Harada <italic>et al. </italic>reported that CGRP increased insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], so we also examined pulmonary immunohistochemical staining of IGF-1 in this study. No significantly immunostained for IGF-1 cells were observed in the lung in CGRP exposed group, and IGF-1 levels in culture medium of A549 cells after exposure to CGRP did not increase. Therefore we think that IGF-1 induced by CGRP may be minimal in the rat lung.</p><p>Recent reports suggest that growth factors, such as HGF and KGF, proliferate alveolar epithelial cells while they inhibit lung injury. Increased function of cell proliferation <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>is thought to be involved with lung restoration. We would like to hereafter examine the effects of CGRP preadministration in various types of lung injury models.</p><p>In conclusion, this study describes the proliferative effects of CGRP on A549 cells in a dose dependent and time dependent manner <italic>in vitro</italic>, via CGRP receptor and ERK pathway. Proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells and interstitial thickening were also observed in CGRP exposed rat lung <italic>in vivo</italic>, and we speculate that CGRP has proliferatory function on alveolar epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YK, YM, KH, KY, CY and MK designed of the study.
