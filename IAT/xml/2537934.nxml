Yet, they rarely cause invasive infections in immunocompetent individuals, an observation reflecting the ability of our innate immune system to control potentially invasive microbes found at biological boundaries. Antimicrobial proteins and peptides are becoming increasingly recognized as important effectors of innate immunity. This is illustrated further by the present investigation, demonstrating a novel antifungal role of histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), an abundant and multimodular plasma protein. HRG bound to <italic>Candida</italic> cells, and induced breaks in the cell walls of the organisms. Correspondingly, HRG preferentially lysed ergosterol-containing liposomes but not cholesterol-containing ones, indicating a specificity for fungal versus other types of eukaryotic membranes. Both antifungal and membrane-rupturing activities of HRG were enhanced at low pH, and mapped to the histidine-rich region of the protein. <italic>Ex vivo</italic>, HRG-containing plasma as well as fibrin clots exerted antifungal effects. <italic>In vivo</italic>, Hrg<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were susceptible to infection by <italic>C. albicans</italic>, in contrast to wild-type mice, which were highly resistant to infection.

The fungal species <italic>Candida</italic> is present as a commensal at mucosal surfaces and on skin. Although it may cause life-threatening infections, such as sepsis, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, it seldom causes disease in normal individuals. In order to control our microbial flora, humans as well as virtually all life forms are armoured with various proteins and peptides that comprise integral parts of our innate immune system. Here we describe a new component in this system; histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), an abundant plasma protein. We show, using a combination of microbiological, biochemical, and biophysical methods, that HRG exerts a potent antifungal activity, which is mediated via a histidine-rich region of the protein, and targets ergosterol-rich membrane structures such as those of <italic>Candida</italic>. HRG killed <italic>Candida</italic> both in plasma as well as when incorporated into fibrin clots.

The structure contains two cystatin-like domains, a central histidine-rich region (HRR) with highly conserved GHHPH tandem repeats flanked by proline-rich regions, and a C-terminal region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Jones1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. This modular structure of HRG facilitates multiple interactions, involving ligands such as heparin, plasminogen, fibrinogen, thrombospondin, heme, IgG, Fc&#x003b3;R, and C1q. Due to its high content of histidine residues (&#x0223c;13&#x00025;), which are concentrated to the HRR, HRG can acquire a positive net charge either by incorporation of Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, or by protonation of histidine residues at acidic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Jones1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, as many cationic proteins and peptide sequences display antimicrobial properties <italic>in vitro</italic>, the ultimate role(s) of HRG in innate immunity <italic>in vivo</italic> still remained unresolved. During the course of our studies, we observed that HRG had a significant activity against <italic>Candida</italic>. <italic>Candida</italic>, an eukaryote, is present as a commensal at mucosal surfaces and on skin.

We therefore speculated that HRG could constitute a natural defence against <italic>Candida</italic> infections. In the present study we show, using a combination of microbiological, biochemical, and biophysical methods, that HRG exerts a potent antifungal activity particularly at low pH, which is mediated via its HRR, and targets ergosterol-rich membrane structures such as those of <italic>Candida</italic>.

HRG was shown to be antifungal against <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> at normal pH (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4), and the activity was significantly increased in low pH buffer (10 mM MES, pH 5.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000116-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). It is well-known that activities of AMPs and antimicrobial proteins are dependent of the microenvironment. For example, various chemokines, defensins, LL-37 as well as heparin binding protein are partly, or completely, antagonized by high salt conditions or the presence of plasma proteins <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Rydengrd2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Ganz2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Wang1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the influence of salt was tested. The results showed that HRG partially retained antifungal activity at physiological Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> levels (0.1 M) but only at low pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000116-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The antifungal activity against <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> was both time- and dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000116-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In subsequent experiments various <italic>Candida</italic> strains (<italic>C. parapsilosis</italic>, <italic>C. albicans</italic>, <italic>C. glabrata</italic> and <italic>C. krusei</italic>) were incubated with HRG (at 3 &#x000b5;M) at neutral as well as low pH. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000116-g001">Figure 1D</xref> demonstrates, in line with the above experiments, that HRG is particularly active at low pH. Thus, <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic>, <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. krusei</italic> were all nearly completely killed by HRG at low pH, whereas <italic>C. glabrata</italic> exhibited a partial resistance at this concentration of HRG, the latter in analogy to <italic>C. glabrata</italic> displaying some resistance against histatin 5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Helmerhorst1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Next, to investigate the binding of HRG to fungi, <italic>C. papapsilosis</italic> was incubated with HRG at low pH, washed, and analysed by immunoblotting. Since previous results indicated that the HRR of HRG, which binds heparin/heparan sulfate, mediates antibacterial effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Rydengrd2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, heparin was added for competition of binding to <italic>Candida</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000116-g001">Figure 1E</xref> shows that HRG was able to bind to the fungal cells and that the binding was partially inhibited by an excess of heparin. This finding is compatible with the observation that heparin completely blocks the antifungal effect of HRG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000116.s002">Figure S1</xref>). As demonstrated by flow cytometry, HRG bound to <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> at neutral pH, and the binding was significantly increased at pH 5.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000116-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), results compatible with the fungal killing assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000116-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In summary, therefore, the results demonstrate that the antifungal actions of HRG were pH-dependent and likely mediated via the heparin-binding region of the protein.</p><fig id="ppat-1000116-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000116.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Antifungal activity and binding of HRG to <italic>Candida</italic>.</title><p>(A) Antifungal activity of HRG. <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> ATCC 90018 (1&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cfu) was incubated with purified human HRG at concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 6 &#x000b5;M for 2 hours in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4 (&#x02022;) or 10 mM MES, pH 5.5 (&#x025cb;), plated and the number of cfu determined (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6).

Notably, ergosterol-containing liposomes, mimicking fungal membranes, were more sensitive than cholesterol-containing ones, mimicking mammalian membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000116-g002">Figure 2C, right panel</xref>). These results are in agreement with numerous previous findings on the membrane-stabilizing effects of cholesterol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Mouritsen1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as the findings that ergosterol induce less membrane stability in phospholipids than cholesterol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Henriksen1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. At lower pH, protonation of histidine groups (pKa for the isolated histidine group is approximately 6.5), effectively increases the net charge density of HRG, thus the observed effects are compatible with findings previously reported for histidine-containing consensus peptides and histidine-rich endogenous peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Lee1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Mason1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Also noteworthy is that HRG did not display any major conformational changes either at low pH, or in the presence of fungal mannan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000116-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) or ergosterol-containing phospholipid liposomes (not shown). Hence, large-scale conformational changes appear not to be critical for the antifungal action of HRG. Taken together, the combination of electron microscopy, FITC-studies, and liposome data demonstrates that HRG acts at least in part through membrane disruption, although it is possible that additional intracellular effects of HRG may also contribute to fungal death. It is also notable that the observed effects were most marked and consistent at low pH. At neutral pH, binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000116-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), as well as permeabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000116-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>) was less apparent and these observations reflected the diminished antifungal effects at pH 7.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000116-g001">Figure 1A and 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Antifungal regions of HRG</title><p>In order to explore the structure-function relationships of epitopes of HRG, overlapping peptide sequences comprising 20mers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000116-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000116.s001">Table S1</xref>) were synthesized and screened, at both neutral and acidic pH, for antifungal activities against <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> as well as <italic>C. albicans</italic>.

Initial results showed that HRG was detected in blood fractions (plasma, serum) and in platelets, also in wound fluid from acute wounds, and chronic leg ulcers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000116-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The latter wound type is characterized by unregulated and excessive proteinase activity leading to degradation of many plasma proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Schmidtchen1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Grinnell1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. However, compared with plasma and serum HRG, the molecule was not fragmented in this chronic wound fluid fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000116-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The protein was also detected in fibrin clots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000116-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) but not present in seminal plasma. It is of note that the molecule migrated aberrantly in the used gel systems; relative 55&#x02013;60 kDa in 8&#x00025; gels (Tris-Glycine) and 45&#x02013;50 kDa in 16.5 gels (Tris-Tricine). Identical serum and plasma preparations of HRG were used in the two gel systems, and recombinant HRG showed the same anomalous migration (not shown). In addition to its presence in plasma and other biological fluids, HRG occurs at significant levels in, and binds avidly to, fibrin clots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Leung2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Coagulation was initiated in normal and HRG-deficient human plasma in the presence of FITC-labeled HRG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000116-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). FITC-labeled HRG bound to clots derived from HRG-deficient plasma, and notably, it appeared to be present at clot boundaries, suggesting that it may &#x0201c;coat&#x0201d; the clot surfaces. In clots from normal plasma, no staining was seen, indicative of an inhibition of binding of FITC-HRG by the excess of endogenous HRG (&#x0223c;150 &#x000b5;g/ml). Clots, physiologically important &#x0201c;barriers&#x0201d;, formed during hemostasis and infection, could thus constitute a unique milieu with high levels of surface-immobilized HRG. Considering the above results we investigated whether the presence of HRG could reduce the growth of <italic>Candida</italic> in plasma. Firstly, the growth of <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> was investigated in normal human plasma and in plasma depleted of HRG. The results showed that <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> multiplied significantly faster in HRG-depleted human plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000116-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Analogous results on fungal growth were observed using plasma from mice deficient in HRG (data not shown). It is of note that these results do not exclude the possibility that other antifungal mechanisms may be involved, such as those dependent of complement activation. Furthermore, although the total protein levels (as determined by the Bradford method) and contents (as assessed by SDS-PAGE on 8&#x00025; gels, not shown) were the same in depleted plasma (51.0&#x0002b;/&#x02212;1.2 g/l) when compared with control plasma (51.7&#x0002b;/&#x02212;3.3 g/l), it cannot be excluded that additional changes of low abundance proteins, induced by passage over Ni-NTA agarose could affect <italic>Candida</italic> growth. Nevertheless, the observation that similar results were obtained with the mice plasmas points at HRG as the main factor responsible for the partial growth inhibition noted. Furthermore, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000116-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, fibrin clots derived from plasma of HRG deficient mice were significantly more prone to infection by <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> than clots from wild-type mice, and similar results were obtained with human plasma depleted of HRG when compared with normal plasma (not shown). The observation that clots devoid of HRG showed detectable, although reduced, antifungal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000116-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) suggest the existence of other yet unidentified factors in clots also mediating fungal killing.

Although the 3D structure of HRG has not yet been determined, modelling studies suggest that the HRR of HRG forms a polyproline (II) helical structure with numerous histidines. At physiological pH, HRG is net negatively charged (pI 6.45). However, due to its high content of histidine residues (&#x0223c;13&#x00025;), which are concentrated to the HRR, it can acquire a positive charge by protonation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Jones1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Borza2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, and this in turn likely facilitates the interactions between HRG and <italic>Candida</italic>. These results were substantiated by the finding that a region of HRG containing the motif sequence GHHPH, was antifungal, and that low pH enhanced this activity. The high conservation of this sequence among vertebrates likely reflects its importance for membrane interactions of HRG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Rydengrd2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. However, as evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000116-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, there are also other antifungal regions in the protein, active irrespective of pH in the interval investigated, an observation compatible with the antifungal activity of HRG detected at neutral pH. It should be pointed out however, that the peptide data do not reflect the complex structure-activity relationships of the holoprotein. Although the CD experiments did not detect any major conformational changes upon interaction with liposomes or polysaccharides, it cannot be ruled out that conformational changes mediated by HRR interactions with intact fungal cells lead to the exposure of additional antimicrobial epitopes in the molecule. Nevertheless, a recombinant and truncated variant of HRG, lacking the histidine-rich and C-terminal domains, was not active against <italic>Candida</italic>, pointing to the HRR as an important, possibly the most important, effector of HRGs antifungal effects.</p><p>Many histidine-rich AMPs are known, among these the clavanins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Lee1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, histatins, and calprotectin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Miyasaki1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. We have previously shown that the antibacterial effects <italic>in vitro</italic> of various histidine-rich peptides, both consensus motifs and peptides derived from domain 5 of HMW kininogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Rydengrd1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> and from HRG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Rydengrd2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> are enhanced at low pH or upon addition of Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>.

Furthermore, the antimicrobial effect of histatin 5 is enhanced at low pH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-MacKay1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, and histidine-rich variants of magainin, the LAH4-peptides, were recently shown to have increased antibacterial activity in low pH compared to neutral pH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Mason1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.

For example, the cathelicidin LL-37 is released from hCAP18, and other AMPs are proteolytically generated from complement factor C3 and high molecular weight kininogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Zasloff1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Pasupuleti1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Nordahl1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Frick1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Rydengrd1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Considering that intact HRG is antifungal, proteolysis of this molecule does not appear to be needed for activity. It is of note that like HRG, several antimicrobial proteins are antimicrobial <italic>per se</italic>, including bacterial permeability increasing protein, serprocodins such as proteinase 3, elastase and heparin binding protein, as well as lactoferrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Rydengrd2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Levy1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it is also described that antibacterial proteins, such as bacterial permeability increasing protein and lactoferrin, may give rise to peptides exerting antibacterial activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Elsbach2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Gifford1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, although a major fragmentation of HRG was not observed in this work, e.g., in wound fluid and after binding to fibrin, it is likely that degradation of HRG may occur at sites of high proteolysis and plasmin activity. Indeed, the finding that the HRG-derived peptide GHH20, as well as numerous other other 20mer peptides were antifungal, and as particularly noted for HRR-derived peptides, exhibiting a similar pH dependence as HRG, exemplifies that the holoprotein is not a prerequisite for antifungal action. Clearly, such possibilities need to be addressed in future studies.</p><p>As previously mentioned, HRG is involved in various aspects of angiogenesis, coagulation, and fibrinolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Jones1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, reflecting its interactions with ligands such as heparin, plasminogen, fibrinogen, and thrombospondin. Additionally, it acts as an opsonin by bridging FcyRI receptors on macrophages to DNA on apoptotic cells, stimulating phagocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Gorgani1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, and modulates the binding of IgG and immune complexes to Fc&#x003b3;RI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Gorgani1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Considering these multiple roles, it is likely that HRG binding to microbial surfaces could induce additional &#x0201c;down-stream&#x0201d; effects, such as modulation of plasminogen activity and phagocytosis. The history of &#x0201c;classic&#x0201d; AMPs have shown that these molecules, initially believed to take part merely in direct microbial killing, have extended their roles into the ability to act as chemokines and to induce chemokine production leading to recruitment of leukocytes, promotion of wound healing, and an ability to modulate adaptive immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Bowdish1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, as interest in the <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of host defence peptides is increasing, it is important to consider the direct antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties observed. Nevertheless, several findings in this study unequivocally demonstrate that HRG, like many AMPs, acts directly on microbes. Thus, in addition to the antifungal <italic>in vitro</italic> data, the enhanced fungal growth in HRG-deficient plasma, as well as the finding that <italic>Candida</italic> was detected at higher levels in blood of Hrg<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals, indicates a direct antifungal action of the molecule. It is also interesting to note that these HRG deficient animals have also been shown to be more susceptible to <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> infection (Shannon et al, unpublished results). However, considering both AMP and HRG multifunctionality <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as <italic>in vivo</italic>, it may be envisaged that additional actions, resulting in the observed antifungal effects, will likely be revealed. All of these effects may be dependent on binding of HRG to microbes and subsequent interactions with cells (e.g., neutrophils and macrophages) in different compartments (e.g., skin, internal organs, and blood). In this respect, the pH dependence of HRG is particularly interesting and relevant. It is well known that infection foci, including abscesses, are characterized by low pH levels reaching as low as pH 5, due to increased anaerobic metabolism and lactate production, as well as leukocyte mediated oxidative burst and subsequent acidification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Grinstein1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. The capacity of HRG to kill <italic>Candida</italic> at these pH levels and the corresponding increase in salt-resistance at low pH suggest that HRG could target infection foci, resulting in a physiologically relevant concentration and localization of antifungal activity. As previously mentioned, HRG's opsonising activity could hypothetically lead to enhanced phagocytosis. Although it remains to be investigated, such localisation of antifungal activity to endosomal compartments, where acidification could result in enhanced HRG-mediated killing of phagocytosed fungi, could serve as an effective way of eliminating invading <italic>Candida</italic> cells at sites of tissue inflammation without releasing potentially toxic microbial components.</p><p>Again hypothetically, genetic deficiencies of HRG or acquired functional defects could provide interesting clues with respect to functional roles of HRG. In some patients, reduced levels of HRG are associated with a thrombophilic phenotype, indeed compatible with the phenotype observed in Hrg<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, which had a shorter prothrombin time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-TsuchidaStraeten1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. As these patients still have &#x0223c;20&#x02013;50&#x00025; of normal levels of HRG, the human phenotype of complete absence of HRG remains, however unknown. Although patients with low levels of HRG have not been reported to be more prone to infections, it must be remembered that examples from deficiencies of particular innate immune proteins, e.g., complement and mannose-binding lectin, illustrate that even homozygous deficiency and a complete absence of a particular innate immune molecule may give rise to surprisingly mild symptoms. For example, patients with mannose-binding lectin deficiencies are normally not at risk of developing infections unless compromised by immune suppression or severe disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-Thiel1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. In this context, it is particularly interesting that antibodies against HRG have been detected in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000116-BallRosen1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, a disease associated with thrombodiathesis and systemic lupus erythematosus.

Taken together, and considering the role of HRG in innate immunity, it should be of interest to study potential associations between functional inactivation(s) or deficiencies of HRG as well as genetically determined differences, in relation to the occurrence of infections.</p><p>During the last three decades, research on innate immune molecules has demonstrated the significance of the innate immune system for prevention of invasion by microbes at biological boundaries. Previous studies have emphasized that various molecules, such as &#x0201c;classic&#x0201d; AMPs, complement factors, and cytokines, bridge between innate and adaptive immunity. The present work adds another significant component to this family of molecules, the plasma protein HRG.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials" id="s4a"><title>Materials</title><p>The peptides GHH20 (GHHPHGHHPHGHHPHGHHPH) and histatin 5 (DSHAKRHHGYKRKFHEKHHSHRGPY) were synthesized by Innovagen AB (Lund, Sweden), and were of &#x0003e;95&#x00025; purity.
