The defect in resuscitation of multiple mutants from a &#x02018;non-culturable&#x02019; state induced by starvation under anoxia was reversed by genetic complementation or addition of culture filtrate from wild-type organisms confirming that the phenotype was associated with <italic>rpf</italic>-like gene loss and that the &#x02018;non-culturable&#x02019; cells of the mutant strains were viable. Other phenotypes uncovered by sequential deletion mutagenesis revealed a functional differentiation within this protein family.

Furthermore, mutants retaining <italic>rpfD</italic> or <italic>rpfE</italic> were highly attenuated for growth in mice with the latter persisting better than the former in late-stage infection. In conjunction, these results are indicative of a hierarchy in terms of function and/or potency with the Rpf family, with RpfB and RpfE ranking above RpfD.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> is an exquisitely adapted human pathogen that has infected one-third of the world's population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dye <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>) and is responsible for approximately eight million new cases of tuberculosis (TB) and two million deaths each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Corbett <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> can persist in the host for decades after infection before reactivating to cause disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Stewart <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). The bacterial and host factors that contribute towards latent TB infection (LTBI) and reactivation disease have long remained enigmatic. However, there is considerable circumstantial evidence to suggest that the persisting organisms may include bacteria in physiological states that are characterized by impaired culturability (i.e. colony-forming ability) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Mukamolova <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Young <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). These observations suggest a plausible link between an intrinsic microbiological property of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013; the ability to enter into a state of dormancy from which culturability can be restored &#x02013; and the clinically defined phenomenon of LTBI.</p><p>Resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf) from <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> is the founder member of a family of secreted proteins found throughout the actinobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Mukamolova <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kell and Young, 2000</xref>). Rpf is able to restore culturability from a dormant state and also stimulate growth of viable bacteria, acting at concentrations of pM or less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Mukamolova <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">2002a</xref>). <italic>Mi. luteus</italic> Rpf was recently shown to possess muralytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Mukamolova <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), consistent with its structural similarity to C-type lysozyme and soluble lytic transglycosylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Cohen-Gonsaud <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). The decline in both peptidoglycan hydrolysis and resuscitating-promoting activities of Rpf caused by mutation of a predicted active site glutamic acid residue strongly implicated this protein in cell wall remodelling at the level of the peptidoglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Mukamolova <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). However, while several possibilities have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Ravagnani <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Keep <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), the precise mechanism by which Rpf-catalysed hydrolysis of the peptidoglycan promotes bacterial resuscitation has yet to be elucidated.</p><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> possesses five <italic>rpf</italic> homologues, <italic>rpfA-E</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Mukamolova <italic>et al</italic>., 2002b</xref>), all of which are expressed <italic>in vitro</italic> and in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Tufariello <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Expression of some of these genes has also been observed in human TB infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Fenhalls <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Rachman <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Recombinant forms of RpfA-E show similar biological activity to the <italic>Mi. luteus</italic> protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Mukamolova <italic>et al</italic>., 2002b</xref>). Individually, the <italic>rpfA-E</italic> genes are dispensable for growth of <italic>M. tuberculosis in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Downing <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Tufariello <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>), suggesting functional redundancy. However, more recent evidence has suggested some degree of functional specialization within this gene family: Tufariello <italic>et al</italic>. found that an <italic>rpfB-</italic>defective mutant of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> Erdman displayed delayed kinetics of reactivation in a mouse model of dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Tufariello <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) and we found that two mutants of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv lacking three <italic>rpf</italic>-like genes in different combinations were impaired for resuscitation from a &#x02018;non-culturable&#x02019; state and were differentially attenuated for growth in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Downing <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). In an important new advance, RpfB was shown to interact with a putative mycobacterial endopeptidase, designated as Rpf-interacting protein A (RipA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hett <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). The two proteins colocalize to the septa of dividing cells suggesting a role for the RipA&#x02013;RpfB complex in peptidoglycan hydrolysis during cell division. RipA also interacts with RpfE but not with RpfA, RpfC or RpfD, suggesting that these Rpfs may act via distinct mechanisms and/or on different peptidoglycan substrates, possibly in conjunction with other RipA-like proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hett <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). To further investigate the individual and collective roles of the Rpfs in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, we constructed three quadruple mutants and a quintuple mutant of H37Rv lacking all five genes, and in this paper, we demonstrate that although the <italic>rpf</italic>-like genes are required for virulence and resuscitation from dormancy, the entire <italic>rpfA-E</italic> family is dispensable for growth of this organism <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The <italic>rpfA-E</italic> genes are collectively dispensable for growth of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in broth culture</title><p>The strategy for sequential deletion of the five <italic>rpf</italic>-like genes in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref> with allelic exchange mutagenesis resulting in unmarked in-frame deletions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Downing <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">2005</xref>).

Like the progenitor triple mutants from which they were derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Downing <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), no growth defects were observed for any of the strains tested; all displayed approximately the same doubling times during logarithmic growth and achieved similar cell densities in stationary phase (data not shown). Moreover, no loss of culturability was observed during maintenance in stationary phase over a period of 10 days, as determined by colony-forming unit (cfu) enumeration (data not shown).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Stepwise deletion of <italic>rpf</italic>A-E genes in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv.

Therefore, this mutant was transformed instead with a vector carrying <italic>rpfC</italic>, <italic>rpfD</italic> and <italic>rpfE</italic> to generate a strain with a genotype analogous to &#x00394;AB, but carrying an additional copy of <italic>rpfD</italic>.</p><table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Strains and plasmids used in this study.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Name</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Description</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Source/reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Strains</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1"><italic>E. coli</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02002;DH5&#x003b1;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Strain used for routine cloning; <italic>supE44</italic>&#x00394;<italic>lacU169 (</italic>&#x003c6;<italic>80 lacZ</italic>&#x00394;<italic>M15</italic>) <italic>hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Laboratory stock</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1"><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf2-1">a</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02002;H37Rv</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Virulent reference laboratory strain (ATCC 25618)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Laboratory stock</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02002;KDD6 (&#x00394;AB)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Double mutant of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv carrying internal in-frame deletions in <italic>rpfA</italic> and <italic>rpfB</italic>; &#x00394;<italic>rpfA</italic>&#x00394;<italic>rpfB</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Downing <italic>et al</italic>.

The phenotype of &#x00394;ACBED carrying pHRPFC suggested that a quadruple mutant with a &#x00394;<italic>rpfA</italic>&#x00394;<italic>rpfB</italic>&#x00394;<italic>rpfD</italic>&#x00394;<italic>rpfE</italic> genotype (not made in this study) would display the same delay in colony formation as &#x00394;ACBE and &#x00394;ACBED. Complementation of &#x00394;ACBE with <italic>rpfE</italic> also completely reversed its delayed colony-forming phenotype, consistent with reconstruction of the genotype of &#x00394;ACB, which shows no delay in colony formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>).

A key difference between these media is the fourfold higher concentration of malachite green in the former. As malachite green sensitivity is suggestive of a cell wall defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Gillespie <italic>et al</italic>., 1986</xref>), the effects of Rpf deficiency on sensitivity to a cell wall damaging agent were assessed. The susceptibility of the quadruple and quintuple mutant strains to the detergent, sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS), was compared with that of the wild-type by spotting serial dilutions of logarithmic-phase cultures on 7H11 agar containing 0.001&#x02013;0.1% SDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref> and data not shown). No growth inhibition was observed for the wild-type or any of the mutant strains at an SDS concentration of 0.001%, whereas 0.1% SDS was severely growth inhibitory to all strains (not shown). However, differential sensitivities were observed at an SDS concentration of 0.01% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>). Under these conditions, the SDS sensitivity of the mutants retaining <italic>rpfE</italic> (&#x00394;ACBD) or <italic>rpfB</italic> (&#x00394;ACDE) was similar to that of the wild-type strain. In contrast, the quadruple and quintuple mutants lacking both of these genes (&#x00394;ACBE and &#x00394;ACBED) displayed marked hypersensitivity to SDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>). Importantly, the phenotype of the &#x00394;ACBE mutant was partially reversed by complementation with <italic>rpfC</italic>, <italic>rpfD</italic> and <italic>rpfE</italic>, confirming its association with Rpf deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Resuscitation of <italic>rpf</italic>-deficient mutants from a &#x02018;non-culturable&#x02019; state</title><p>The triple mutants, &#x00394;ACB and &#x00394;ACD, were previously shown to be unable to resuscitate spontaneously from a state of non-culturability induced by starvation without oxygen input using a most probable number (MPN) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Downing <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). To investigate the association between the resuscitation defect and <italic>rpf</italic>-like gene loss, we assessed &#x00394;ACB, &#x00394;ACD, &#x00394;ACBE and &#x00394;ACBD and their complemented derivatives in this model alongside a wild-type control (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>).

B6D2/F<sub>1</sub> mice were infected through the aerosol route to seed 300&#x02013;1500 bacteria in the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3B</xref>). The progress of infection was monitored by scoring the lungs and spleen for cfu over 240 days and monitoring a group of mice infected with each strain for survival. In contrast to the wild-type, which grew by almost 4 logs over 56 days, the quadruple mutants showed significantly reduced growth over this period (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001 at 56 days). Although the lung bacillary load of &#x00394;ACBD persisted at &#x0223c;6300 cfu over a period of 240 days, the number of bacteria remaining in the lungs of &#x00394;ACBE-infected mice at 240 days was below the limit of detection (40 cfu per lung). Both quadruple mutants were defective for dissemination to the spleen with &#x00394;ACBD achieving a final bacterial load <italic>ca</italic>. 100-fold lower than the wild-type and &#x00394;ACBE being below the limit of detection by the end of the experiment (data not shown). At 240 days, nine out of 10 of the mice infected with the wild-type strain had succumbed to the infection whereas none of the mice infected with either mutant had died, consistent with the profound attenuation of these strains.</p><p>To establish whether the attenuation of the &#x00394;ACBE mutant was attributable specifically to <italic>rpf</italic>-like gene loss, the <italic>rpfC</italic>, <italic>rpfD</italic> and <italic>rpfE</italic> genes were integrated at the <italic>attB</italic> site of this mutant via pHRPFCDE. RT-PCR analysis of steady-state levels of mRNA confirmed that the vector-borne <italic>rpfC</italic> and <italic>rpfE</italic> genes were expressed in the complemented mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>, lane 16) implying that its genotype was analogous to that of the &#x00394;AB strain, albeit with an additional copy of <italic>rpfD</italic>. Although the phenotype of &#x00394;AB had not been assessed <italic>in vivo</italic>, the trend towards increased attenuation with progressive <italic>rpf</italic>-like gene loss observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Downing <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) suggested that restoration of <italic>rpfC</italic> and <italic>rpfE</italic> function in the &#x00394;ACBE mutant would be expected to result in an increase in virulence. B6D2/F<sub>1</sub> mice were thus infected with &#x00394;ACBE, the complemented strain or H37Rv and lung cfu scored for groups of three mice over 77 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3C</xref>). Growth of the wild-type strain was comparable with that observed in previous infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3B</xref> and data not shown). &#x00394;ACBE showed no detectable growth in mouse lung over the 77 day time-course and at day 14, mice infected with this strain showed a 200-fold lower bacillary load compared with those infected with the wild-type, consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3B</xref>). By comparison, a 40-fold increase in cfu was observed at day 14 in two mice infected with the complemented strain, but no increase was observed in the third animal (shown as an outlier in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3C</xref>). Similarly, at day 28, one animal had a higher bacillary load than the other two, which were at levels comparable to &#x00394;ACBE. However, at later time points, both mutant and complemented strains behaved similarly in all animals tested, showing &#x02265; 1000-fold lower cfu in the lung compared with the wild-type. Furthermore, the lungs of mice sacrificed at the later points showed no significant difference in gross pathology between those infected with the mutant versus complemented strains, with no visible signs of disease being evident. In contrast, the lungs of mice infected with the wild-type strain were enlarged and completely covered with granulomatous lesions, as expected for chronic infection with virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of phthiocerol dimycocerosate production by the Rpf-deficient mutants</title><p>Spontaneous mutations at the phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) locus which affect the ability of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to produce this complex lipid have been reported to occur frequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Manjunatha <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).

Given the equivocal results obtained from the virulence assessment of the complemented &#x00394;ACBE mutant, we investigated whether mutations affecting PDIM production might account, at least in part, for the attenuation observed for the multiple <italic>rpf</italic>-like mutants observed in this and prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Downing <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). The wild-type, quadruple and quintuple mutant strains were tested for PDIM production by monitoring the incorporation of [<sup>14</sup>C]-propionate into lipid. All strains, including the original laboratory stock of H37Rv that was used to produce the &#x00394;A parent from which all multiple mutants were derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Downing <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>), and the subclone thereof that was used for all mouse infections, were equally impaired for PDIM production and resembled a mutant of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> rendered PDIM-deficient by deletion of the <italic>mmpL7</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Domenech <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>). These results suggested that the attenuation of the <italic>rpf</italic> mutants could not be explained by loss of PDIM.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The multiplicity of <italic>rpf</italic>-like genes in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> has presented major challenges for dissecting out the roles of the individual genes and their encoded proteins in growth and culturability, their relationship to one another, and the mechanisms of regulation of their expression and activity. We and others showed previously that each of the <italic>rpfA-E</italic> genes was individually dispensable for growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Downing <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Tufariello <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). We subsequently demonstrated that two triple mutants were defective for resuscitation <italic>in vitro</italic> and were significantly yet differentially attenuated for growth <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Downing <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). However, key questions remained, many of which have been addressed in the present study. We have now shown that the entire <italic>rpfA-E</italic> gene family is dispensable for <italic>in vitro</italic> growth. Importantly, quintuple mutants lacking all five genes were obtained independently from two distinct lineages of mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). To our knowledge, mutant strains of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> carrying this number of unmarked deletion mutations have not been reported previously in the literature. The dispensability of RpfA-E for growth of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv was somewhat surprising given the inhibitory effects of affinity-purified anti-Rpf antibodies on growth of the Academia strain of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic> Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Mukamolova <italic>et al</italic>., 2002a</xref>). However, during the course of this study, the construction of a mutant of <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic> lacking both <italic>rpf</italic>-like genes present in this organism was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Hartmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). The dispensability of the <italic>rpf</italic>-like genes in both <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>C. glutamicum</italic> thus suggests that <italic>Mi. luteus</italic>, which possesses a single, essential <italic>rpf</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Mukamolova <italic>et al</italic>., 2002a</xref>), may represent an exception rather than the rule.</p><p>Deletion of the individual <italic>rpfB-E</italic> genes was previously shown to be accompanied by a modest upregulation of some or all of the remaining <italic>rpf</italic>-like genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Downing <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). However, these subtle effects were reversed upon deletion of further <italic>rpf</italic>-like genes to a point at which the single <italic>rpfB</italic>, <italic>rpfD</italic> or <italic>rpfE</italic> gene remaining in the quadruple mutants was expressed at a level 1.3&#x02013;1.8-fold lower than in the wild-type strain. These observations suggest that the remaining <italic>rpf</italic>-like genes do not compensate for loss of the other genes by transcriptional upregulation and argue against a significant degree of regulatory cross-talk within this gene family. Instead, the available data suggest the <italic>rpf</italic>-like genes are likely to be regulated by other, distinct mechanisms. In this respect, it is worth noting that <italic>rpfA</italic> has been shown to be subject to regulation by the cAMP receptor protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Rickman <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), whereas <italic>rpfC</italic> is positively regulated by both the alternate sigma factor, SigD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Raman <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>) and the site two protease homologue, Rv2869c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Makinoshima and Glickman, 2005</xref>).</p><p>A key <italic>in vitro</italic> phenotype associated with progressive <italic>rpf</italic>-like gene loss in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is the inability to resuscitate spontaneously from a &#x02018;non-culturable&#x02019; state. Like their progenitor triple mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Downing <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), both quadruple mutants assessed in this model displayed this phenotype. Significantly, the resuscitation defects were partly reversed by genetic complementation and/or by the addition of culture filtrate (an exogenous source of Rpfs). Therefore, the failure of the multiple mutants to resuscitate cannot simply be ascribed to poor survival of these strains in the Sauton's medium/sealed flask starvation model, but is attributable, at least in part, to a deficiency in Rpf function.</p><p>Progressive <italic>rpf</italic>-like gene loss also differentially affected the colony-forming ability of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> on agar-solidified media. Whereas <italic>rpfB</italic> or <italic>rpfE</italic> alone was sufficient to support a normal rate of colony formation, the mutant retaining only <italic>rpfD</italic> and its quintuple mutant derivative were impaired in this regard. Although the precise reason(s) why mutant cells grown on agar plates showed delayed colony formation are not known, we may speculate that this is a result of sudden exposure to stress (e.g. elevated oxygen concentration, high surface tension). In <italic>Mi. luteus</italic>, which contains a single essential <italic>rpf</italic> gene, Rpf function is vital for survival under conditions that are inappropriate for bacterial growth, or when cells are exposed to stresses such as nutrient starvation (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Mukamolova <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). In <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, which contains five nonessential <italic>rpf</italic>-like genes, the phenotype observed <italic>in vitro</italic> (delayed colony formation when transferred from a liquid to a solid medium) is less pronounced, although evident for mutant cells even in the absence of any stress. However, the greater challenge posed by prolonged starvation in stationary phase <italic>in vitro</italic> resulted in failure to grow on plates for both the wild-type and the mutant strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Significantly, the same mutants that displayed delayed colony formation on 7H11 agar were also most sensitive to SDS. Together, the data therefore suggest that Rpf deficiency results in a cell wall defect that renders <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> hypersensitive to stresses that affect the cell envelope, with the effect being most pronounced in cells deficient in RpfB and RpfE.</p><p>The ability of individual <italic>rpf</italic>-like genes to complement the delayed colony formation phenotype of the quintuple mutant provided a direct means of differentiating function and/or potency within the RpfA-E family. Importantly, the notion of a &#x02018;functional hierarchy&#x02019; within this family inferred from the <italic>in vitro</italic> data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>) was further supported by the <italic>in vivo</italic> data demonstrating that loss of <italic>rpfD</italic> from the double mutant, &#x00394;AC, had a lesser attenuating effect than loss of <italic>rpfB</italic> on growth in mouse lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Downing <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) and loss of <italic>rpfD</italic> from the triple mutant, &#x00394;ACB, had a less pronounced effect than loss of <italic>rpfE</italic> on persistence (this work). These observations therefore suggest that RpfB and RpfE rank above RpfD and RpfC in the functional hierarchy. It is particularly interesting to note that the Rpfs that rank highest in this hierarchy &#x02013; RpfB and RpfE &#x02013; correspond to the two Rpfs shown to interact with the partnering peptidoglycan hydrolase, RipA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hett <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The quadruple mutants, &#x00394;ACBD and &#x00394;ACBE, were severely impaired for growth and persistence in mice. The single (&#x00394;A) and triple mutant (&#x00394;ACB) progenitors of these strains were assessed for virulence in a different mouse model (C57BL/6JCit) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Downing <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) from that employed in the present study (B6D2/F<sub>1</sub>), thus precluding a direct comparison of the datasets. The data nonetheless suggested that progressive <italic>rpf</italic>-like gene loss was accompanied by progressive attenuation for growth <italic>in vivo</italic>, with loss of <italic>rpfE</italic> or <italic>rpfB</italic> being more attenuating than loss of <italic>rpfD</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Downing <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). However, attempts to complement the <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype of &#x00394;ACBE yielded equivocal results: during early infection, a partial restoration of virulence was observed, but the effect was lost at later stages. The reasons underlying the variation observed between animals and why the partial restoration of virulence was not sustained are unclear, but may include: (i) incomplete/inadequate restoration of <italic>rpf</italic>-like gene function and/or temporal differences in expression of the complementing genes due to the limitations inherent in the complementation methodology (integration, at a different chromosomal location (<italic>attB</italic>), of the complementing gene(s) with varying lengths of flanking sequence), (ii) secondary effects caused by genetic elements carried on the fragments cloned in the complementation vector, (iii) instability/loss/rearrangement of the integration vector, and (iv) the accumulation of attenuating second-site mutations through the repeated cycles of allelic exchange mutagenesis required to produce &#x00394;ACBE and the other multiple mutant strains. Attenuation through loss of PDIM production was ruled out as a contributing factor, as all strains &#x02013; including the parental wild-type &#x02013; were equally poor producers of this lipid. However, the possibility that other attenuating second-site mutations were acquired during the construction and passage of the mutant strains cannot be excluded. Therefore, the attenuation observed <italic>in vivo</italic> cannot, as yet, be attributed exclusively and unequivocally to <italic>rpf</italic>-like gene loss. This study has highlighted the difficulties in correlating genotype with phenotype in multiple mutant strains of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. In this particular case, pair-wise comparisons of growth and survival in primary mouse macrophages, which may be a more relevant <italic>ex vivo</italic> model system than human PBMCs, and of virulence in a single mouse model for the mutant strains ranging from &#x00394;AC to &#x00394;ACBED or &#x00394;ACDEB, alongside their complemented counterparts, are planned in order to address this issue systematically.</p><p>In conclusion, the results described herein have confirmed the collective dispensability of <italic>rpfA-E</italic> for growth of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in broth culture, and have suggested a functional hierarchy within this gene family under the conditions tested. We have yet to unravel the complexities that underpin the <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotypes and relate them to the various <italic>in vitro</italic> phenotypes associated with <italic>rpf</italic>-like gene loss. The fact that some Rpfs interact with other proteins in the cell to form protein complexes that may cleave distinct forms of peptidoglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hett <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) further adds to the complexity of Rpf function and regulation. However, the collection of mutant strains reported in this and earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Downing <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">2005</xref>) have provided an important resource for future biochemical, microbiological and physiological studies on this fascinating family of proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and culture conditions</title><p>The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>. <italic>E. coli</italic> strains were grown in Luria&#x02013;Bertani broth (LB) or on Luria agar.

To produce complementation vectors carrying <italic>rpfD</italic> and/or <italic>rpfE</italic>, these genes and flanking sequences were PCR-amplified from chromosomal DNA and cloned in pBluescriptKS+ to yield pBRPFD and pBRPFE respectively (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref> for a description of the primer sequences and amplicon properties). A 1640 bp SpeI fragment was excised from pBRPFD and cloned in pHRPFC to produce pHRPFCD, whereafter a 1164 bp BamHI fragment from pBRPFE was cloned in pHRPFCD to create pHRPFCDE.
