AKT kinase activity is principally determined by the level of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) in the plasma membrane of cells, which is generated by phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) upon stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases. PI3K is counteracted by the lipid-phosphatase and tumor suppressor PTEN, which converts PIP3 back to PIP2 (Reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). When PIP3 levels are elevated, AKT is recruited to the plasma membrane and phosphorylated in the activation loop by PDK1. In addition, AKT contains a highly conserved C-terminal hydrophobic motif (HM) that must also be phosphorylated for full AKT activation in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies in mammals and Drosophila have demonstrated that TORC2 is responsible for HM site phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Surprisingly, TORC2-mediated phosphorylation only affects a subset of AKT functions. MEFs lacking essential TORC2 components show reduced phosphorylation of FOXO, but not reduced phosphorylation of TSC2 or GSK-3, although all three are well-established AKT targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In Drosophila, TORC2 loss-of-function phenotypes are substantially different from those of the other AKT pathway members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. While Drosophila AKT and its upstream regulators, such as PI3K and PDK1, are essential for viability and cell growth, flies lacking TORC2 are viable and display only minor growth impairment under standard growth conditions. However, TORC2 is required for tissue overgrowth upon hyperactivation of AKT signaling, e.g. in the case of PTEN loss-of-function. This suggests that TORC2 inhibitors might be a useful for treating cancers that depend of high AKT signaling. Since TORC2-mediated phosphorylation is essential for only a subset of AKT functions, it is possible that targeting TORC2, instead of other AKT pathway members, would minimize unwanted consequences resulting from more general inhibition of AKT activities.</p><p>In order to evaluate the potential of TORC2 inhibition in cancer treatment, it is important to analyze which AKT functions depend on TORC2 in malignant cells. Here we have analyzed the effects of TORC2 inhibition on proliferation and anchorage independent growth in two different tumor cells, MCF7 breast cancer and PC3 prostate cancer cells. Inhibition of TORC2 activity by knockdown of an essential component, Rictor, inhibited cell cycle progression, cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in both cell types. Our results suggest that inhibition of TORC2 activity might be a useful strategy to inhibit proliferation of tumor cells and subsequent tumor growth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and treatments</title><p>MCF7 and PC3 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FCS and penicillin/streptomycin in humidified 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere at 37&#x000b0;C.

We used two independent siRNAs directed against rictor mRNA and, as a control, an siRNA not targeting any human proteins. Both rictor siRNAs efficiently lowered Rictor protein levels in MCF7 and PC3 cells, compared to cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Rictor depletion reduces AKT HM phosphorylation and inhibits AKT kinase activity</bold>.

Immunoblot analysis showed that Rictor depletion led to strong inhibition of AKT hydrophobic motif phosphorylation in both cell lines, whereas total levels of AKT remained unaltered (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). To directly analyze the effect of Rictor depletion on AKT kinase activity, we performed a kinase assay, by immunoprecipitating AKT and assaying its ability to phosphorylate in vitro a protein containing a GSK-3 peptide harboring a consensus phosphorylation site for AKT. As expected, AKT kinase activity was induced when cells were treated with insulin and inhibited by PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In line with the strongly reduced AKT hydrophobic motif phosphorylation, the insulin-induced AKT kinase activity was reduced to ~20% in both cell lines upon Rictor depletion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and anchorage independent growth upon Rictor depletion</title><p>As an initial assessment for the effects of TORC2 inhibition, we analyzed the amount of cell death and the rate of proliferation of MCF7 and PC3 cells upon Rictor depletion. Controlled amounts of siRNA-transfected cells were plated at low density and allowed to proliferate for several days. During the growth period, rictor siRNAs did not cause significant increase in cell death, observed either by the extent of cell detachment (data not shown) or by analyzing nuclear morphology (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Intriguingly, cell counts indicated that Rictor depletion strongly inhibited proliferation of MCF7 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Proliferation of PC3 cells was also significantly inhibited, albeit less strongly than in the case of MCF7 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibition of TORC2 reduces proliferation of MCF7 and PC3 cells</bold>. (A) The amount of programmed cell death (PCD) was analyzed by calculating the percentage of cells displaying nuclear condensation 4 days after siRNA treatments. In the table the percentage of condensed nuclei and the number of cells analyzed is displayed. Note that MCF7 cells lack functional caspase-3, which makes them resistant and affects their mode of cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. When treated with the commonly used cell death inducer, staurosporin, MCF7 cells undergo nuclear condensation without the nuclear fragmentation typical of normal apoptotic cells (upper panel). (B) MCF7 and PC3 cells were plated at low density and transfected with two independent rictor siRNAs or with a control siRNA. Cells were allowed to proliferate for two days until they reached near confluency, they were trypsinized, diluted and replated at low density and retransfected with the siRNAs.

Therefore, we performed a more stringent test to evaluate the importance of TORC2 in respect to tumor cell growth by analyzing the anchorage-independent growth of the MCF7 and PC3 cells after Rictor depletion. The control siRNA-treated cells formed colonies in soft agar (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B</xref>), but transfection of rictor siRNA almost totally abolished the formation of colonies, demonstrating that TORC2 activity is required for anchorage-independent growth of MCF7 and PC3 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibition of anchorage independent growth upon Rictor depletion</bold>.

To examine whether the reduced rate of proliferation upon TORC2 inhibition might be explained by inhibition of cell cycle progression, we analyzed the effects of Rictor depletion on the cell cycle profile. Both MCF7 and PC3 cells displayed a clear enrichment of cells in G1 when treated with the siRNAs against Rictor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). MCF7 cells showed a shift from ~60% to &#x0003e; 90% of cells in G1. The effect was similar, but less pronounced in PC3 cells. We next analyzed Cyclin D1 levels by immunoblotting after Rictor depletion. Rictor depletion strongly reduced the expression of Cyclin D1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), suggesting that phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif of AKT is needed to maintain Cyclin D1 expression and subsequent cell cycle progression.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Accumulation of cells in G1 phase upon rictor depletion correlates with downregulation of Cyclin D1</bold>.

Inhibition of TORC2 activity prevented proliferation and anchorage independent growth of both MCF7 and PC3 cells, although MCF7 were more sensitive to reduced TORC2 activity. Analysis of cell cycle profiles revealed a clear enrichment of cells in G1 phase in TORC2-inhibited cells, which coincided with a strong downregulation of Cyclin D1. These findings suggest that loss of HM site phosphorylation may be sufficient to mimic the effects of a more global inhibition of AKT activity in this context, although we cannot rule out the possibility of AKT-independent effects. In sum, our study shows that proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of tumor cells can be efficiently prevented by inhibiting TORC2, which therefore could be an effective strategy for treatment of cancers that depend on high AKT activity.</p><p>Which AKT functions are dependent on TORC2-mediated HM phosphorylation? Several studies provide evidence that two downstream effectors of AKT, FOXO1/3a and TORC1, respond differently to loss of AKT HM phosphorylation. In both Drosophila and mammalian systems, loss of TORC2 activity reduces phosphorylation-mediated inhibition of FOXO, whereas TORC1 activity is unaffected by loss of AKT HM phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This difference is reflected in the Drosophila TORC2 loss-of-function phenotypes. While loss of AKT, Rheb or TOR cause a clear reduction of cell size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], inhibition of TORC2, and consequently AKT HM phosphorylation, does not (VH &#x00026; SC, unpublished observation). FOXO1/3a, on the other hand, has been shown to be important for regulation of resistance to oxidative stress and other apoptotic stimuli, and indeed mammalian cells lacking TORC2 or AKT HM phosphorylation are hypersensitive to apoptotic stimuli induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], indole-3-carbinol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] or etoposide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The effect of TORC2 on cell proliferation has been studied in fibroblasts derived from knock-out mouse models of essential TORC2 components Rictor and Sin1 with controversial results. Shiota and coworkers analyzed proliferation of Rictor-deficient MEFs and showed that the cells displayed modestly slower proliferation compared to wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], whereas Jacinto and coworkers analyzed sin1-deficient MEFs, and found that they proliferated similarly to wild type cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the two tumor cell lines analyzed here, acute loss of TORC2 activity clearly slowed proliferation by slowing or blocking cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle. Interestingly, a recent study showed that many gliomas overexpress Rictor and have elevated TORC2 activity that contributes to their tumorigenity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Results obtained in our study suggest that the potential of preventing tumor growth by inhibition of TORC2 is not only limited to gliomas, but can be used to inhibit growth of other types of tumors as well.</p><p>Sarbassov and coworkers discovered that prolonged treatments with rapamycin or its derivatives can also inhibit TOR complex 2, in addition to the well-established inhibition of TORC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Therefore, rapamycin derivatives might be useful in preventing growth of tumors dependent on AKT HM phosphorylation. However, strong inhibition of TORC1 may have undesirable consequences. Therefore development of small-molecular inhibitors specific to TORC2 is necessary.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>VH planned experiments, performed experiments, analyzed data, and wrote the manuscript.
