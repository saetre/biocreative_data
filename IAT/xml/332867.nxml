S mu is composed predominantly of GAGCT and GGGCT pentameric repeats, with these units also being found in S epsilon at a much lower density. S mu-S gamma 4 matches are infrequent, but S gamma 4 contains a cluster of repeated sequences similar to units in mouse gamma switch sites and unrelated to the S mu repeats, suggesting that S mu-S gamma homology is not important in mu-gamma switching. We examined our epsilon and gamma 4 sequences for features that could regulate production of 'sterile' transcripts preceding switch recombination. There is an Evolutionarily Conserved Sequence (ECS) upstream from the human and mouse S epsilon regions that overlaps and extends 5' to the start sites for human and mouse epsilon sterile transcripts. Similarly, an ECS upstream from S gamma 4 is homologous to a mouse sequence that overlaps and extends 5' to the start sites for mouse gamma 2b sterile transcripts. The epsilon and gamma 4 conserved segments contain potential Interferon Stimulable Response Elements (ISRE's) that are identical between human epsilon and gamma 4.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0098.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7305"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0099.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7306"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0100.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7307"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0101.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7308"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0102.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7309"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0103.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7310"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0104.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7311"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0105.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7312"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0106.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7313"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0107.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7314"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7315"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7316"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
