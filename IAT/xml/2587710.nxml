The transmembrane glycoprotein CD98 contains potential phosphorylation sites in its extracellular C-terminal tail. We hypothesized that extracellular signaling through ecto-protein kinases (ePKs) might lead to ecto-phosphorylation of CD98 and influence its multiple functions, including its role in cell-cell interactions. Our results show that recombinant CD98 was phosphorylated <italic>in vitro</italic> by ePKs from Jurkat cells and by the commercial casein kinase 2 (CK2). Alanine substitutions at serines-305/307/309 or serines-426/430 attenuated CK2-mediated CD98 phosphorylation, suggesting that these residues are the dominant phosphorylation sites for CK2. Furthermore, CD98 expressed in the basolateral membranes of intestinal epithelial Caco2-BBE cells was ecto-phosphorylated by Jurkat cell-derived ePKs and ecto-CK2 was involved in this process. Importantly, cell attachment studies showed that the ecto-phosphorylation of CD98 enhanced heterotypic cell-cell interactions and that the extracellular domain of CD98, which possesses the serine phosphorylation sites, was crucial for this effect. In addition, phosphorylation of recombinant CD98 increased its interactions with Jurkat and Caco2-BBE cells, and promoted cell attachment and spreading. In conclusion, here we demonstrated the ecto-phosphorylation of CD98 by ePKs and its functional importance in cell-cell interactions. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism involved in regulating the multiple functions of CD98 and raise CD98 as a promising target for therapeutic modulations of cell-cell interactions.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>CD98, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, is a potential regulator of multiple functions, including extracellular signaling, epithelial cell adhesion/polarity, amino-acid transport and cell-cell interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003895-Yan1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

The expression of this protein was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-CD69 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003895-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>, upper panel), which recognizes an epitope in the C-terminus of CD69, or anti-V5 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003895-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>, lower panel), which recognizes the fusion variants. Adhesion assays of Jurkat cells on the transfected CHO cells were then performed under the ecto-kinase assay condition.

We have previously reported that CD98 forms heterodimers with amino-acid transporters, and these heterodimers interact with &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-integrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003895-Merlin1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> and the intercellular adhesion molecule ICAM-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003895-Liu1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> in the basolateral membranes of IECs. The ecto-phosphorylation of CD98 investigated here is of utmost importance since it represents a novel mechanism by which CD98 may be involved in phosphorylation-dependent transduction of extracellular signals into the cells.</p><p>The major finding of our study is that ecto-phosphorylation of CD98 plays an important role in cell-cell interactions. Results from cell attachment assays suggested that ecto-phosphorylation of CD98 in Caco2-BBE cells was involved in Caco2-BBE cell-Jurkat cell interactions. Furthermore, ecto-phosphorylation of CD98 expressed in CHO cells increased the binding of Jurkat cells to CHO cells, and mutation at serines-305/307/309 or serines-426/430 attenuated CD98 phosphorylation by Jurkat cells and consequently reduced cell-cell interactions. Importantly, we demonstrated that the C-terminal extracellular domain of CD98, which possesses phosphorylation sites, was crucial for the heterotypic cell-cell interactions. Together, these findings suggest that the phosphorylation of CD98 on its extracellular domain by ePKs from T lymphocytes is important for epithelial cell-T lymphocyte interactions. In addition, applying the ECIS technology to monitor IEC adhesion on different substrates in real time, we demonstrated that attachment and spreading of Caco2-BBE cells on recombinant CD98 were enhanced when CD98 was phosphorylated. In agreement with the ECIS data, cell adhesion assays performed in 96-well high-binding plates showed that the attachment of Caco2-BBE and Jurkat cells was increased on phosphorylated recombinant CD98. Mutation at both phosphorylation sites, serines-305/307/309 and serines-426/430, abolished the effect of ePK-mediated CD98 phosphorylation on cell adhesion, further demonstrating the contribution of phosphorylation to the adhesive function of this molecule. These results strongly suggest that the phosphorylation of CD98 could modulate its specific ability to interact with membranes of other cells, which might account for homotypic and/or heterotypic cell-cell interactions.</p><p>Previous sdudies have demonstrated that several proteins that are involved in cell adhesion can be extracellularly phosphorylated and that their ecto-phosphorylation can regulate cell adhesion and cell migration. It has been reported that vitronectin, an extracellular maxtrix glycoprotein, is phosphorylated by CK2 on the surface of blood cells, and that cell adhesion on CK2-phosphorylated vitronectin is enhanced via the alpha(v)beta3 integrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003895-Seger1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Ecto-CK2-mediated vitronectin phosphorylation was also shown to be important to vascular smooth muscle cell adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003895-Stepanova1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, laminin-1 can be phosphorylated by CK2-type ePKs of monocyte, and its phosphorylation increases cell adhesion, cell proliferation as well as cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003895-Trachana1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, the cell surface receptor collagen XVII was identified as a substrate of ecto-CK2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003895-Zimina1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Ecto-phosphorylation of collagen XVII was also demonstrated to inhibit its ecto-domain shedding, which is involved in the regulation of adhesion, motility and differentiation of epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003895-Zimina1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Together with these investigations, our finding that ecto-phosphorylation of CD98 promotes cell adhesion suggest that the extracellular phosphorylation of cell-surface proteins and extracellular matrix proteins seems to be the general mechanism underlying the regulation of cell adhesion.</p><p>The involvement of CD98 ecto-phosphorylation in cell-cell interactions found here is of great importance from a pathophysiological perspective because the interactions between IECs and lymphocytes play a key role in immune responses within the intestinal tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003895-Agace1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. It is interesting to speculate that under pathological conditions, where extracellular ATP required for ecto-phosphorylation can reach high concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003895-Redegeld1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, CD98 phosphorylation is especially effective, which affects cell-cell interactions and consequently regulates T cell-mediated immune responses. Further studies are required to investigate which physiological and/or pathological state(s) can actuate this mechanism. Previous studies have suggested a role for CD98 in the etiology of inflammatory disorders. Pro-inflammatory cytokines have been shown to upregulate CD98 expression in IECs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003895-Yan2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003895-Fais1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Increased levels of lymphocyte-activation antigens, including CD98, have been found at the cell surface of intestinal B cells, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells isolated from patients with inflammatory bowel disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003895-Schreiber1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. We have recently showed that CD98 expression is highly upregulated in colonic tissues from mice with active colitis, and that activation of epithelial CD98 aggravates intestinal inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003895-Kucharzik1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies and our present findings suggest that CD98 could be a potential pharmacological target to manipulate lymphocyte activation and IEC-lymphocyte interactions during intestinal inflammation.</p><p>The molecular mechanism by which the ecto-phosphorylation of CD98 modulates cell-cell interactions remains to be elucidated. It is tempting to speculate that CD98 ecto-phosphorylation could have substantial effects on the binding affinity of CD98 for proteins expressed on the surface of other cells. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the phosphorylation of CD98 may functionally affect other proteins that interact with CD98 and are involved in cell-cell interactions.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that CD98 is ecto-phosphorylated by ePKs, including ecto-CK2, dominantly at serine-305/307/309 and serine-426/430, and that the ecto-phosphorylation of CD98 plays an important role in cell-cell interactions. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism underlying the regulation of the multiple functions of CD98 and suggest that CD98 could be a promising target for therapeutic strategies to prevent aberrant cell-cell interactions, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various intestinal diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dr. Laetitia Charrier-Hisamuddin for her
