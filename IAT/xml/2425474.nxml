Here, we show that fission yeast Clr6-HDAC (histone deacetylase) regulates the checkpoint kinase Cds1 when DNA replication encounters a stressful condition. We found that the global level of acetylation of histone H4 was constant throughout the normal cell cycle, but was reduced significantly when the cell recovered from the HU-induced cell cycle arrest (or slow DNA replication). We identified the Clr6-HDAC as a component responsible for the reduction in the level of the H4 acetylation. Although DNA replication was completed, the HU-induced cell cycle arrest could not be released even after removal of HU in the <italic>clr6-1</italic> mutant. Under this experimental condition, Cds1 kinase was maintained active and remained bound tightly to chromatin. We also demonstrated that Cds1 was active even after treatment with caffeine, an inhibitor for ATM/ATR that is an activator of Cds1. These results indicate that inactivation of Cds1 requires functional Clr6-HDAC independently of the conventional DNA replication checkpoint. When DNA replication is impeded, Clr6-HDAC activity may monitor damage on chromatin structure/environment, which is required for inactivation of Cds1.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Posttranslational modification of histones plays important roles in maintenance of the genome integrity. Phosphorylation of histone H2AX, which occurs shortly after introduction of double-strand break (DSB) of DNA, is required for DNA repair as well as regulation of the damage checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). It was also shown that acetylation of lysine residues at the N-terminal tail of H4 is required for DSB repair in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). A recent study demonstrated an important role of acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 in generation of a favorable chromatin structure for DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Not only enzymes to modify the histone tail, but also enzymes to catalyze the reverse reaction play roles in coping with DNA damage. The multisubunit histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes catalyze the deacetylation of highly conserved acetylated lysine residues of core histones in the N-terminal tails. The conditional mutation of Clr6-HDAC results in chromosome mis-segregation and sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Cells lacking Pst2, a homolog of Sin3 in budding yeast, which are stably associated with Clr6, are also sensitive to DNA-damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). It has also been shown that the histone modification is required for regulation of DNA replication during the normal cell cycle. In S phase, acetylation of histone H4 tails seems to be coupled with DNA replication, since increased and unscheduled replication was observed in cells deficient in a Rpd3-HDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) or cells treated with a HDAC inhibitor TSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In addition, histone H4 tails are hyperacetylated at the active origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). It is generally believed that modification of the histone tail regulates accessibility of various proteins to chromatin/DNA and thereby plays important roles in biological processes involving DNA.</p><p>Stress on DNA replication causes a harmful lesion to the genome integrity and various biological pathways would be activated to cope with them. Upon inhibition of DNA replication in fission yeast, Rad3/Tel1 phosphorylate the effector kinase Cds1, which is mediated by the adaptor protein Mrc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In contrast, Rad3/Tel1 phosphorylate the effector kinase Chk1 when DNA is damaged during S/G2 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>The Cds1 kinase, in turn, prevents the onset of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In this study, we attempted to investigate regulation of the Cds1 kinase through deacetylation of histone H4 by Clr6-HDAC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and media</title><p>The strains used in this study are derivative of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe h</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> 972 and <italic>h</italic><sup>+</sup> 975 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).

To repress the transcription from the nmt1 promoter, cells were grown either in YES complete or EMM2 minimal medium with 4 &#x000b5;M thiamine. For determination of hydroxyurea (HU) sensitivity, HU was supplied to YES or EMM2 medium at 12 mM or otherwise indicated. For spot assays, exponentially growing cultures were 5-fold diluted serially, and each dilution was spotted onto agar plates containing HU and/or thiamine. For synchronization, <italic>cdc10-M17</italic> mutant cells were first cultured at permissive temperature (26&#x000b0;C) before being shifted up to the restriction temperature (37&#x000b0;C) for 4 h.

Septated cells reappear after 7 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), indicating that slow DNA replication is eventually completed and the cells enter into mitosis under this condition. We performed a similar experiment with a temperature-sensitive allele of <italic>cdc10</italic> (<italic>cdc10-M17</italic>), in which the cell cycle restarts from G1 phase upon the shift from the restrictive temperature to the permissive one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Following incubation at the restrictive temperature (36&#x000b0;C), the <italic>cdc10-M17</italic> cells were released to the permissive temperature (26&#x000b0;C). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, the septation index at 4 h after the shift down was &#x0223c;55% when grown in the absence of HU, indicating that the cell cycle proceeded synchronously. In contrast, the septation index reached only 15% at 8 h after the shift in the presence of HU. The result indicated that DNA replication proceeded very slowly and is completed between 6 and 8 h after the shift. This notion was supported by the measurement of the mobility of Cds1, which migrates slowly on SDS&#x02013;PAGE due to phosphorylation when the DNA replication checkpoint is activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). In the presence of HU, Cds1 migrated slowly between 1 and 6 h after the shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, upper panel). Mrc1 associates with Cds1 and is required for regulation of Cds1 by the checkpoint kinase Rad3. It is phosphorylated and accumurates upon HU treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, Mrc1 accumulated and its mobility decreased between 2 and 6 h after the shift. Examination of the two proteins indicated that the DNA replication checkpoint was activated by 6 h after the shift in most of the cells and that the cell cycle proceeded into G2/mitosis thereafter. In parallel, we monitored the level of acetylation in histone H4 by indirect immunofluorescent staining as well as western blot. While the level of the H4-acetylation was nearly constant in the cells released into the media containing no HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and E), it was reduced gradually and was lowest at 6 h after the shift in the presence of HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D and E). Eight hours after the shift, the level of the H4-acetylation went up. We thereby concluded that acetylation of histone H4 reaches a minimum level at or around when the cell recovers from slow DNA replication under the stress imposed by HU. We also examined the level of H4 acetylation in a temperature-sensitive mutant of <italic>cdc22-M45</italic>. The <italic>cdc22</italic><sup>+</sup> gene encodes a ribonucleotide reductase, a major target of HU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>F, the level of H4 acetylation dropped in the <italic>cdc22</italic> mutant upon the shift to the restrictive temperature. The reduction of the H4 acetylation is thus a cellular response to depletion of nucleotides, but not a side effect caused by HU. Taken together, these results would suggest that deacetylation of histone H4 may be involved in cell cycle regulation, in particular, when DNA replication slows down. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Level of H4 acetylation during treatment with hydroxyurea (HU).

To examine which HDAC is involved in deacetylation of histone H4 in response to HU treatment, wild-type cells, in which each of the classical HDACs was overexpressed under the control of thiamine repressible <italic>nmt1</italic> promoter, were plated on media containing HU. Overexpression of Clr6, but not Clr3 or Hos2, caused severe sensitivity to HU as well as a reduction in the level of H4-acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Importantly Clr3 is a histone H3 specific deacetylase, whereas Clr6 deacetylates both H4 and H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Taken together, modulation of acetylation in histone H4 tails but not H3 appears to be responsible for the cellular response to HU treatment. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Overexpression of <italic>clr6</italic><sup>+</sup>.

In contrast, the septation index of the control cells was only 8% even after incubation for 7 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). The two proteins, Cds1 and Mrc1, involved in the DNA-replication checkpoint, were also affected by overexpression of Clr6. Both the mobility shift of Cds1 and the increase in the level of Mrc1, which normally accompany HU treatment, were not observed in the cells overexpressing Clr6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C and D). These results suggested that overexpression of Clr6 results in premature entry into G2/mitosis. Microscopic observation revealed that the cells overexpressing Clr6 septated with segregated nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, right panel). In contrast, mutants deficient in the DNA replication checkpoint septate with unsegregated nuclei, exhibiting the &#x02018;cut&#x02019; phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), which is characteristic of the onset of mitosis before the completion of DNA replication. Although overexpression of Clr6 allows septation earlier, it seems that DNA replication is completed.</p><p>Having demonstrated that enhancement of the Clr6-HDAC activity shortens the delay induced by HU treatment, we speculated that a deficiency of the Clr6-HDAC system might result in a prolonged delay. To test this possibility, we examined response of mutants defective in Clr6-HDAC system to HU treatment. Pst2 forms a complex with Clr6 and is required for deacetylation of histone H3 and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The spot test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A) indicated that both the <italic>clr6-1</italic> mutant and a strain lacking the <italic>pst2</italic><sup>+</sup> gene could grow at a semi-permissive temperature (32&#x000b0;C) comparatively with the wild-type strain, but exhibited hypersensitivity to HU. The level of H4 acetylation, measured by western blot, dramatically decreased in the wild-type strain in response to HU treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B), but not in the <italic>clr6-1</italic> mutant. Judged by the septation index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C), the <italic>clr6-1</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>pst2</italic> mutants, in contrast to the wild-type strain, could not enter G2/mitosis in the continued presence of HU at 32&#x000b0;C. It appeared that the delay in entry into G2/mitosis was due to activated Cds1 because deletion of the <italic>cds1</italic><sup>+</sup> gene rescued this defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). The delayed cell cycle progression was possibly because that (i) DNA replication was still incomplete in the <italic>clr6-1</italic> mutant or (ii) the DNA replication checkpoint was prolongedly activated though DNA replication was completed. In order to further examine the defect of the <italic>clr6-1</italic> mutant, we monitored the status of the DNA replication checkpoint after HU was removed. Following incubation in the media containing HU for 4 h, cells were released into the HU-free media. In the wild-type strain, Cds1, whose mobility was slow immediately after the release, migrated faster after incubation for 2 h in the HU-free media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). In a sharp contrast, the mobility of Cds1 was kept slow in the <italic>clr6-1</italic> mutant even after incubation for 4 h in the HU-free media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). Under this experimental condition, DNA replication was completed in both the wild-type strain and the <italic>clr6-1</italic> mutant. Chromosomal-sized DNAs with replicating structures, such as replication bubbles and forks, are retained in the gel loading wells during PFGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E, while chromosomal-sized DNAs could not migrate on the PFGE at 0 time (immediately after the release into the HU-free media), they could run after incubation for 4 h in the HU-free media.

To further confirm this notion, we examined mutants of histone H4 for the response to HU. As overexpression of Clr6-HDAC caused both reduction in the level of the H4 acetylation and premature inactivation of the DNA replication checkpoint, we anticipated that removal of acetylation sites from histone H4 tail could mimic the effect by overexpression of Clr6-HDAC. Fission yeast genome contains three genes encoding histone H4.1, H4.2 and H4.3. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, a strain expressing only H4.2 or expressing only H4.2 in which an acetylation site (lys16) was replaced with glycine (H4.2 K16G) grew normally. However, additional replacement of an acetylation site (lys8) with alanine (H4.2 K8A K16G) caused hypersensitivity to HU. The replacement, indeed, greatly affected the level of the H4-acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). In the continued presence of HU, the septation index of H4.2 K8A K16G was much higher than the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, upper panel). Consistently with this, the viability of H4.2 K8A K16G dropped rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C) in the media containing HU. The mobility of Cds1 also indicated that Cds1 was not phosphorylated normally in H4.2 K8A K16G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). Microscopic observation of H4.2 K8A K16G cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lower panel) indicated that their nuclei did not exhibit &#x02018;cut&#x02019; phenotype.

The phenotype of H4.2 K8A K16G is, however, moderate in comparison to that observed in the cells overexpressing Clr6-HDAC. This is probably because that H4.2 K8A K16G can still be acetylated at the other two sites, lys5 and lys12, or another molecule could also be regulated by Clr6-HDAC in response to HU treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Independent operation of Clr6-HDAC system</title><p>Activation of the DNA replication checkpoint is a major response to HU treatment. We addressed the question of whether the Clr6-HDAC system is operated under the control of the DNA replication checkpoint. We examined the level of the H4-acetylation in mutants, <italic>rad1</italic> and <italic>rad3</italic>, both of which are defective in the DNA replication checkpoint. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, the level of the H4-acetylation dropped in these mutants in response to HU treatment, just like the wild-type strains. The Clr6-HDAC system, therefore, responds to HU independently of the replication checkpoint. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E, Cds1 was still activated in the <italic>clr6-1</italic> mutant even when HU was removed. We tested if prolonged activation of Cds1 in the <italic>clr6-1</italic> mutant is dependent on the DNA replication checkpoint. Numerous studies demonstrated that caffeine, a potent inhibitor of ATM/ATR (fission yeast Tel1/Rad3) kinases, could override an arrest induced by the DNA replication checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). We first treated fission yeast cells with HU for 2 h to activate Cds1. Caffeine was added subsequently in the continued presence of HU. After incubation with caffeine for 2 h, the mobility of Cds1 on SDS&#x02013;PAGE increased in the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B), indicating that caffeine abrogated the checkpoint and Cds1 was inactivated. Consistently with this, the septation index increased upon addition of caffeine in the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). In the <italic>clr6-1</italic> mutant, on the other hand, the mobility of Cds1 remained slow even after incubation with caffeine for 6 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). The septation index of the <italic>clr6-1</italic> mutant also remained low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). Microscopic observation indicated that caffeine induced premature onset of mitosis and allowed septation with single nucleus in the wild-type cells, but not in the <italic>clr6-1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C, right panel). These results indicated that inhibition of the Tel1/Rad3 kinase by caffeine was not sufficient for inactivation of Cds1 in the <italic>clr6-1</italic> mutant. The functional Clr6-HDAC system, which is operated independently of the DNA replication checkpoint, is required for inactivation of Cds1. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Effect of caffeine.

It was previously shown that Mrc1, a component of the replication checkpoint that activates Cds1, remains bound to chromatin after extraction with Triton X-100 when the checkpoint is activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). We thereby speculated that Cds1 might also behave in a similar manner. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D, when the replication checkpoint was activated by HU, Cds1 was resistant to the Triton-extraction and remained bound to chromatin, because the level of Cds1 did not change after treatment with HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). In contrast, Cds1 was washed out from chromatin after 6 h in H4.2 K8A K16G mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). These results indicated that Cds1 in an active form has an increased affinity to chromatin. We next characterized the chromatin affinity of Cds1 in the <italic>clr6-1</italic> mutant. Cells were first treated with HU for 4 h and subsequently grown for 4 h in the HU-free media. In the wild-type strain, the Triton-extraction removed most of Cds1 from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E). In contrast, Cds1 remained in the nucleus in the <italic>clr6-1</italic> mutant. Taken together, these results suggested that Cds1, which is activated by the replication checkpoint, remains bound to chromatin if Clr6-HDAC is not fully functional.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we investigated the level of H4-acetylation during the HU-induced cell cycle arrest and found a close link between the Clr6-HDAC system and regulation of the checkpoint kinase, Cds1.</p><p>Judged by indirect immuno-fluorescence staining of the nucleus in fission yeast, the global level of acetylation of histone H4 was maintained throughout the normal cell cycle, but reduced significantly when DNA replication was impeded by HU or a mutation in the <italic>cdc22</italic><sup>+</sup> gene encoding a ribonucleotide reductase. The H4 -acetylation is reduced to a minimum level when the cell recovers from the HU-induced cell cycle arrest (or slow DNA replication). We identified the Clr6-HDAC as a component responsible for the reduction in the level of the H4 acetylation. Analysis of the phenotypes of a clr6-deficient mutant, <italic>clr6-1</italic>, indicated that the HU-induced cell cycle arrest could not be released. In the <italic>clr6-1</italic> mutant, although DNA replication was completed after removal of HU, the checkpoint kinase Cds1 was still activated. We also demonstrated that Cds1 was active even after treatment with caffeine, an inhibitor for ATM/ATR that is an activator of Cds1. These results would suggest that once the Cds1 kinase is activated in the <italic>clr6-1</italic> mutant, it cannot be inactivated. The Clr6 protein forms two distinctive HDAC-complexes with Pst1 or Pst2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Although we showed in this study that Clr6 plays a role in regulation of Cds1, it remains to be elusive which of the components, Pst1 or Pst2, is required for this process. As supportive evidence, we showed that cells lacking Pst2 were defective in recovery from a HU-induced arrest just like the <italic>clr6-1</italic> mutant. Further biochemical analysis is obviously required to examine the involvement of Pst2 and/or Pst1, in regulation of Cds1.</p><p>In order to find a clue as to why Cds1 cannot be inactivated in the <italic>clr6-1</italic> mutant, we examined localization of Cds1. Prior to incubation with the antibody for indirect immunofluorescent staining, cells were extracted with Triton X-100. If a nuclear protein is tightly bound to chromatin, it remains bound after extraction with Triton X-100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Our analysis indicated that Cds1, when the replication checkpoint was activated by HU in the wild-type strain, persisted in the nucleus after the Triton-extraction. Upon removal of HU, it disappeared from the nucleus. The <italic>clr6-1</italic> mutant, treated with HU, was subsequently grown in HU-free media for 4 h to allow DNA replication. Under this experimental condition, Cds1 still persisted in the nucleus as if the DNA replication checkpoint were active. These results would suggest that H4-deacetylation by Clr6-HDAC might, directly or indirectly, be required for removal of the Cds1 kinase from chromatin. Mrc1, which associates with Cds1 and has a DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), may possibly bridge Cds1 and chromatin. As Mrc1 did not accumulate in cells overexpressing Clr6, it is plausible that its stability and/or binding activity to DNA may be regulated depending on the level of H4-acetylation. The role of Mrc1 in localization of Cds1 should be defined in the future study.</p><p>On the basis of these results we propose several models for the role of Clr6-HDAC in regulation of Cds1. As shown in many studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) histone acetylation regulates gene expression. It is thereby possible that modification by Clr6-HDAC is required for gene expression of a component necessary for inactivation of Cds1. We, however, are not in favor of this model. The level of H4 acetylation changes globally in the nucleus during treatment with HU and is unlikely to regulate expression of a specific gene locus.</p><p>When DNA replication is impeded by HU, homologous recombination is a major pathway to overcome the replication blockage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Various protein complexes would be loaded on chromatin and play roles in recombination. Clr6-HDAC may be responsible for removing these complexes by deacetylating H4 before the onset of mitosis. It is also plausible that loading of newly synthesized histones on replicated DNA may require a specialized mechanism when DNA replication is impeded. The Clr6-HDAC might be involved in such a histone metabolism. In addition to the status of DNA replication, chromatin structure/environment may be an important element to regulate the checkpoint kinase, Cds1. The p38 MAP kinase pathway in fission yeast involving Spc1/Sty1 is known to be activated following addition of HU to slow DNA replication or in response to agents that cause DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). We showed in this study that Clr6-HDAC is operated independently of the conventional DNA replication checkpoint. It is thus an interesting possibility that Clr6-HDAC may be under control of the MAP kinase signal cascade.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank O. Niwa, J.
