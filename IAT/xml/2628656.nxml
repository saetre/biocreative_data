IL-13 acts through a receptor complex comprised of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 and IL-4R&#x003b1; subunits with subsequent activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6). The IL-13R&#x003b1;2 receptor may act as a decoy receptor. In human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells, IL-13 enhances cellular proliferation, calcium responses to agonists and induces eotaxin production. We investigated the effects of pre-treatment with IL-4, IL-13 and IFN-&#x003b3; on the responses of HASM cells to IL-13.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Cultured HASM were examined for expression of IL-13 receptor subunits using polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Effects of cytokine pre-treatment on IL-13-induced cell responses were assessed by looking at STAT6 phosphorylation using Western blot, eotaxin secretion and calcium responses to histamine.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>IL-13R&#x003b1;1, IL-4R&#x003b1; and IL-13R&#x003b1;2 subunits were expressed on HASM cells. IL-13 induced phosphorylation of STAT6 which reached a maximum by 30 minutes. Pre-treatment with IL-4, IL-13 and, to a lesser degree, IFN-&#x003b3; reduced peak STAT6 phosphorylation in response to IL-13. IL-13, but not IFN-&#x003b3;, pre-treatment abrogated IL-13-induced eotaxin secretion. Pre-treatment with IL-4 or IL-13 abrogated IL-13-induced augmentation of the calcium transient evoked by histamine. Cytokine pre-treatment did not affect expression of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 and IL-4R&#x003b1; but increased expression of IL-13R&#x003b1;2. An anti-IL-13R&#x003b1;2 neutralizing antibody did not prevent the cytokine pre-treatment effects on STAT6 phosphorylation. Cytokine pre-treatment increased SOCS-1, but not SOCS-3, mRNA expression which was not associated with significant increases in protein expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Pre-treatment with IL-4 and IL-13, but not IFN-&#x003b3;, induced desensitization of the HASM cells to IL-13 as measured by eotaxin secretion and calcium transients to histamine. The mechanism of IL-4 and IL-13 induced desensitization does not appear to involve either downregulation of receptor expression or induction of the IL-13R&#x003b1;2 or the SOCS proteins.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Asthma and allergy have been associated with a Th2 polarized immunological response to otherwise innocuous allergens. This Th2 response is associated with increased levels of the interleukins IL-4 and IL-13 in inflamed tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The Th2 paradigm has been successfully reproduced in animal models of allergen sensitization and challenge to antigens such as ovalbumin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Animal models demonstrate a role for IL-13 in the development of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR); overexpression of IL-13 in the murine lung induces a phenotype similar to human asthma, with excess mucus production, goblet cell hyperplasia, smooth muscle hypertrophy and AHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. IL-13 and IL-4/IL-13 knockout mice are protected from allergen induced AHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Interferon-&#x003b3; may counteract the actions of IL-4 and IL-13 in some circumstances. IFN-&#x003b3; knockout mice have been shown to have augmented Th2 responses and IFN-&#x003b3; knockout mice have enhanced AHR following allergen challenge that is restored by administration of recombinant IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>IL-13 and IL-4 signal through binding to their respective subunit of a receptor complex comprised of the IL-13 receptor alpha1 (IL-13R&#x003b1;1) and the IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4R&#x003b1;) with subsequent phosphorylation of Janus activated kinases (JAKs) and the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These pathways appear to be essential for the development of AHR as IL-4R&#x003b1; and STAT6 deficient mice are protected from AHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and reconstitution of STAT6 in the epithelium has been shown to be sufficient to restore IL-13 mediated AHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. IL-13 also binds to the IL-13 receptor alpha2 (IL-13R&#x003b1;2) with high affinity. The functional significance of this subunit is unclear. It may act as a decoy receptor to prevent excessive IL-13 signaling as it has a short intracytoplasmic tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] but there is also some evidence that it participates in IL-13 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. IL-4 can drive many of the same processes as IL-13 through their shared receptor complex although IL-4 deficient mice are not protected from AHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Recent evidence indicates that cytokine actions on airway smooth muscle may be important in the pathobiology of asthma. The calcium responses to histamine, bradykinin and methacholine in human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells are augmented by IL-13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The proliferative response of HASM cells to leukotriene D<sub>4 </sub>(LTD<sub>4</sub>) is also augmented by IL-13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The expression of the chemokines eotaxin, eotaxin-3 and TARC is also induced by IL-13, so IL-13 can be linked to the contractile, proliferative and secretory properties of HASM cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-13 both increase HASM cell stiffness as assessed by magnetic twisting cytometry and reduce relaxation responses induced by isoproterenol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We hypothesised that the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 would have different effects than the Th1 cytokine IFN-&#x003b3; on IL-13 signaling in HASM cells. We chose to use STAT6 phosphorylation, eotaxin production and calcium responses as outcomes for IL-13 signaling. ASM is a primary effector of bronchoconstriction and IL-13 increases the contractility of HASM cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and promotes STAT6-dependent eotaxin production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell cultures</title><p>Primary cultures of HASM cells were prepared from lung transplant specimens as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Briefly, tissue digestion was obtained by incubating the tissues in HBSS containing collagenase type IV (0.4 mg/ml), elastase (0.38 mg/ml) and soybean trypsin inhibitor (1 mg/ml) at 37&#x000b0;C for 90 min with gentle shaking. The dissociated cells were collected by filtering through 125 &#x003bc;m Nytex mesh followed by centrifugation.

Confluent cells were detached with a 0.025% trypsin solution containing 0.02% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Cells were grown on glass cover slips for single immunofluorescence microscopy and calcium measurements or on 6 well culture dishes for flow cytometric analysis and for protein and mRNA extraction. Confluent cultures of HASM cells were serum deprived and supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 &#x003bc;g/ml insulin and 5 &#x003bc;g/ml transferrin 24 h prior to cytokine treatment.

After blocking Fc receptors, cells were incubated for 3 h on ice with either anti-IL-13R&#x003b1;1-PE (Diaclone, Besan&#x000e7;on, France), anti-IL-13R&#x003b1;2-PE (Diaclone, Besan&#x000e7;on, France), or anti-IL-4R&#x003b1;-FITC (Pharmingen, BD Biosciences) monoclonal antibodies. Isotype-matched mouse antibodies were used in all experiments. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. Flow cytometric acquisition and analysis of samples were performed on at least 10,000 acquired events on a FACScan (Becton-Dickinson, Oakville, Canada).

One-Step quantitative real-time RT-PCR was conducted using the QuantiTect SYBR Green System (Qiagen, Mississauga, Canada) on a Mx3000P cycler (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).

However the responses of HASM cells to the presence of IL-13 is likely to be conditioned by the prevalent cytokine milieu. In this study, we sought to determine how cytokines representative of both the Th1 and Th2 types influence the responses of HASM cells to IL-13. The principal finding from our study is that the prototypical Th1 cytokine IFN-&#x003b3; and the Th-2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 have different, although non-opposite, modulatory effects on IL-13 responses in HASM cells. All three cytokines induced the IL-13R&#x003b1;2 subunit of the receptor while leaving the other subunits unaltered. IL-4, IL-13 and IFN-&#x003b3; pre-treatment reduced IL-13 induced STAT6 phosphorylation, although the effect was most pronounced for IL-4 and IL-13. IL-13 pre-treatment abrogated IL-13 induced eotaxin secretion by HASM cells and also the IL-13-induced augmentation of the calcium transient evoked by histamine. Consistent with the lesser effect of IFN-&#x003b3; pre-treatment on STAT6 phosphorylation in response to IL-13 there was also no significant reduction in eotaxin release or IL-13-mediated augmentation of calcium response to histamine.</p><p>The effects of Th1 and Th2 cytokines have been studied on a number of structural cells of the airways. IFN-&#x003b3; has been shown to antagonize IL-13-induced STAT6 activity in airway epithelial cells, an effect that is time- and dose-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The inhibitory effect of IFN-&#x003b3; on IL-4 signalling has been more extensively studied and has been demonstrated in both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells including monocytes, lymphocytes, fibroblasts and airway epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Exposure of HASM cells to IFN-&#x003b3; reduced the effects of IL-13 on STAT6 activation but did not appear to have much effect on calcium responses to histamine and on eotaxin secretion, important measures of contractile and secretory properties of HASM. Our data also point to a restriction of signalling through IL-13 in the presence of continuous amounts of IL-13 or IL-4. The desensitization induced by IL-4 and IL-13 was substantial and was sufficient to completely abrogate IL-13-induced effects. This may represent a negative feedback system by which these Th2 cytokines prevent persistence of IL-13 signalling at sites of allergic inflammation. Since these experiments have been performed using airway smooth muscle cells recovered from non-asthmatic subjects, the results of this investigation cannot be extrapolated to asthmatic airway smooth muscle cells. Whether these observed effects occur <italic>in vivo </italic>in normal or asthmatic airways also remains to be elucidated.</p><p>We examined some of the potential mechanisms by which desensitization of HASM cells to IL-13 may have occurred. First we addressed the effects of cytokine treatments on IL-13 receptor subunit expression. The mRNA and cell surface expression of the IL-13R&#x003b1;1 and IL-4R&#x003b1; subunits were unaffected by cytokine treatment suggesting that cytokine pre-treatment did not induce downregulation of synthesis or internalization of these subunits. These data are consistent with findings by Hirst et al. who demonstrated that both IL-4 and IL-13 do not alter IL-4R&#x003b1; receptor expression in HASM cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], an effect that differs to that seen in murine smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and in various immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Based on our findings, we can conclude that the inhibitory effect of all three cytokines on STAT6 activation is not mediated by altered cell surface expression of the IL-13R&#x003b1;1 and IL-4R&#x003b1; subunits. However, we observed an increased surface expression of IL-13R&#x003b1;2, as evidenced by both the relative receptor density and the fraction of cells bearing IL-13R&#x003b1;2. These data confirm and extend previous observations showing increased mRNA and cell surface expression of IL-13R&#x003b1;2 in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and murine ASM cells upon IL-13 stimulation. Likewise, lung levels of IL-13R&#x003b1;2 mRNA are augmented in transgenic mice overexpressing IL-4, IL-13 or IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Interestingly, our data indicate that IFN-&#x003b3;, unlike IL-4 and IL-13, did not increase IL-13R&#x003b1;2 mRNA expression so that the increased cell surface expression of this receptor subset must be mediated by post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms. Indeed, IFN-&#x003b3; induces the mobilization of IL-13R&#x003b1;2 from intracellular pools to the cell surface in monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Regulation of IL-13R&#x003b1;2 expression in HASM cells appears to slightly differ from those obtained in airway epithelial cells in which reduced IL-13 or IL-4 signalling induced by pretreatment with either IL-4 or IL-13 is associated with increase in expression of IL-13R&#x003b1;2 mRNA and intracellular protein expression but no increase in cell surface receptor protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Likewise, in airway epithelial cells, IFN-&#x003b3; induces IL-13R&#x003b1;2 mRNA expression that was not associated with increased cell surface expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>The IL-13R&#x003b1;2 subunit may serve as either a decoy receptor in some circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] or as a signalling receptor in other situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Transfection of IL-13R&#x003b1;2 into the airway epithelial cell line BEAS-2B led to downregulation of STAT6 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], suggesting a role for this subunit in regulating cytokine signalling. Sparse data exist on the regulatory role of the IL-13R&#x003b1;2 subunit in IL-13 responses in HASM. Using a blocking anti-IL-13R&#x003b1;2 antibody Kellner et al have shown that this subunit likely modulates IL-13 responses as indicated by the reversal of decreases in HASM cell proliferation and acetylcholine-induced calcium mobilization in presence of high concentrations of IL-13 and IL-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. We used the same blocking antibody at a slightly higher concentration to assess the involvement of IL-13R&#x003b1;2 on cytokine treatment effects on STAT6 phosphorylation. There was no demonstrable effect of the blocking antibody on the reduction in STAT6 activation, so that it is unlikely that upregulation of the expression of IL-13R&#x003b1;2 accounts for the observation. These results are at variance with those reported by Kellner et al and may be related to differences in both the protocol and the functional outcomes studied. The lower concentrations of IL-13 and IL-4 used in our study may be more physiological than those used in Kellner's study. In other cell types, IL-13R&#x003b1;2 inhibits IL-13 signalling in proportion to its level of expression and that these inhibitory effects could be overcome by high concentrations of IL-13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. We cannot exclude the possibility that IL-13, although used at a concentration which did not induce maximal STAT 6 phosphorylation, was still present in sufficient amount in our experimental system to overcome the effects of the anti-IL-13R&#x003b1;2 antibody. However in support of the concept that induction of IL-13R&#x003b1;2 may not be the predominant regulator of cytokine signalling in HASM cells, we found that IFN-&#x003b3; increased IL-13R&#x003b1;2 expression slightly more than IL-4 or IL-13 yet was less effective at reducing IL-13 signalling as assessed by STAT6 phosphorylation.</p><p>We then tested whether the inhibition of phosphorylation of STAT6 was related to the induction of the endogenous inhibitory proteins, suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins. SOCS are inducible inhibitors, primarily in signaling cascades associated with the Jak-STAT pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. A variety of studies support this rationale. Over-expression of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 in the human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells inhibit IL-4 and IL-13 mediated expression of eotaxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. IFN-&#x003b3; induces SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 in airway epithelial cells parallel to the inhibition of IL-4 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Both IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-4 induce SOCS-1 gene expression in monocytes and macrophages, an effect that is associated with reduced activation of STAT6 by IL-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. IFN-&#x003b3;-induces SOCS-1 and downregulates STAT6-dependent eotaxin production in murine fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Our data show that IL-4, IL-13 and IFN-&#x003b3; all increased SOCS-1, but not SOCS-3, mRNA expression in HASM cells. The magnitude of induction of SOCS-1 mRNA was, however, substantially less than that reported for airway epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Despite this increase in SOCS-1 mRNA expression, there was no significant increase in protein expression. It is therefore unlikely that induction of SOCS molecules contributed significantly to the cytokine inhibition of IL-13-induced responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, IL-13 has effects on eotaxin secretion by HASM cells and calcium responses of HASM cells to histamine that are abolished by pre-treatment with IL-13. Pre-treatment with IL-4 also reduced IL-13 receptor signalling and calcium responses. A reduction in STAT6 phosphorylation in response to IL-13 was also found after treatment of the cells with IFN-&#x003b3; but there was no evidence of desensitization of the HASM cells as measured by eotaxin secretion and calcium transients to histamine. The mechanism of IL-4 and IL-13 induced desensitization is not clear and does not appear to involve either induction of the IL-13R&#x003b1;2 or the SOCS proteins. The observed desensitization to IL-13 may be a mechanism for limiting IL-13 induced responses in the airways in the setting of allergic airway inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>HASM: human airway smooth muscle; STAT6: signal transducer and activator of transcription 6; AHR: airway hyperresponsiveness; JAK: Janus activated kinase; SOCS: suppressor of cytokine signalling.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>BM carried out Western blots and participated in the design of the study and preparation of the manuscript.
