We have cloned the rad22 gene from a genomic gene bank by functional complementation of the switching defect. An open reading frame coding for a putative protein of 469 amino acids was found by sequence analyses. The rad22 gene contains no intron. A region of 126 amino acids in the N-terminal half of the Rad22 protein has significant homologies (56% identity and 36% similarity) to the Rad52 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A rad22 disruption strain was constructed which seems to be inviable in a homothallic background. Southern blot analyses have shown that the rad22-67 mutant frequently gives rise to deletions in the mating-type region. These data indicate that the Rad22 protein has a function in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00074-0148-a" xlink:role="5943"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00074-0145.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5940"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00074-0146.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5941"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00074-0147.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5942"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00074-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5943"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00074-0149.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5944"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
