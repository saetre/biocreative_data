As with other herpes viruses, infection by Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) displays these two phases. During latency only few viral genes are expressed, while in the productive infection the virus is reactivated with initiation of extensive viral DNA replication and gene expression, resulting in production of new viral particles. Viral reactivation is crucial for KSHV pathogenesis and contributes to the progression of KS. We have recently identified Pim-1 as a kinase reactivating KSHV upon over-expression. Here we show that another Pim family kinase, Pim-3, also induces viral reactivation. We demonstrate that expression of both Pim-1 and Pim-3 is induced in response to physiological and chemical reactivation in naturally KSHV-infected cells, and we show that they are required for KSHV reactivation under these conditions. Furthermore, our data indicate that Pim-1 and Pim-3 contribute to viral reactivation by phosphorylating the KSHV latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) on serine residues 205 and 206. This counteracts the LANA&#x02013;mediated repression of the KSHV lytic gene transcription. The identification of Pim family kinases as novel cellular regulators of the gammaherpesvirus life cycle facilitates a deeper understanding of virus&#x02013;host interactions during reactivation and may represent potential novel targets for therapeutic intervention.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The switch from latency to productive viral replication (reactivation) is a crucial decision in the viral life cycle, and recent clinico-epidemiological studies support the importance of lytic replication in the development and progression of Kaposi's sarcoma. Hence, cellular signaling pathways operative during viral reactivation could represent potential novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Our work identifies Pim-1 and Pim-3 kinases as essential key regulators of the gammaherpesvirus life cycle. These kinases target the hallmark of KSHV latency, the LANA protein, by phosphorylation, which abolishes its ability to act as a transcriptional suppressor of viral lytic replication. This study facilitates a deeper understanding of virus&#x02013;host interactions during reactivation and provides novel opportunities for pharmacological control and intervention also in virus-associated cancers.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) is an etiological agent of three types of malignancies: Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), multicentric Castleman disease, and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000324-Ablashi1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Viral reactivation was screened by analysis of RFP-positive cells using an automated high-content microscope. As Pim-1 is not the only representative of its kinase family, we decided to examine the roles of other Pim kinase family members in viral reactivation using the rKSHV.219-Vero cells. The experiments were also performed in rKSHV.219-infected EA.hy926 endothelial cells, which represent a biologically relevant KSHV infection model. To this end, latently infected rKSHV.219-Vero and -EA.hy926 cells were transiently transfected with V5-tagged Pim-1, -2 or -3 cDNAs or with an empty vector control. After 48 h, basal reactivation was induced using a low-titer recombinant baculovirus encoding RTA (BacK50) as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, and RFP expression was monitored 30 h later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000324-g001">Figure 1A and 1D</xref>). The basal reactivation induces low level of RFP expression (2.5&#x00025; in rKSHV Vero, and 1.9&#x00025; in rKSHV- EA.hy926) in the infected cells (negative controls), but is necessary for priming the cells for reactivation by transfected Pim-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000324-Varjosalo1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

Interestingly, all Pim kinases induced RFP expression to at least 3-fold more as compared to the level obtained by basal reactivation (negative controls), with Pim-1 inducing the strongest (4- to 7-fold) increase in both cell lines. Reactivation by Pim kinases was stronger in Vero than in EA.hy926 cells, which is in accordance with the ability to obtain higher maximal reactivation efficiency in these cells by BacK50 and NaB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000324.s001">Figure S1A</xref>).

The U2OS cells were chosen as target cells due to their good susceptibility to KSHV infection, and suitable morphology for automated microcopy (our unpublished results). All wild-type (wt) Pim kinases induced a 2- to 5-fold increase in GFP in the U2OS cells infected with supernatants from the rKSHV-Vero or -EA.hy926 cell lines when compared to the negative controls, suggesting that the expression of Pim kinases induced completion of the full lytic cascade. Importantly, production of infectious virions was also dependent on kinase activity as expression of the V5-tagged kinase-deficient Pim kinases, the Pim-1KD, -2KD and -3KD, in both cell lines led to a clear reduction (maximally 10-fold) in GFP expression as compared to their wt counterparts.

To this end, rKSHV-EA.hy926 cells were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides specific for Pim-1, -2 or -3, or with a non-targeting control siRNA. The cells were subjected to maximal reactivation 48 h after transfection. After another 48 h, lysates were collected and efficient depletion of Pim-1 (85&#x00025;), Pim-2 (90&#x00025;) and Pim-3 (80&#x00025;) protein expression was confirmed by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000324-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The effect of silencing on viral reactivation was examined by immunoblotting with K8.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000324-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) as well as by measuring the induction of RFP, and expression of GFP on na&#x000ef;ve U2OS cells as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000324-g001">Figure 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000324-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

Consistent with K8.1 expression, a significant reduction in the expression of RFP (2.6-fold and 1.6-fold, respectively) in rKSHV-EA.hy926 cells and GFP (6.5-fold and 4-fold, respectively) on U2OS cells was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000324-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) in the Pim-1 and Pim-3 depleted samples. However, Pim-2 silencing had very little effect on KSHV reactivation, suggesting that endogenous Pim-2 is not required for the induction of lytic replication or that the higher expression levels of the other two Pim family members mask the effects of the less abundantly expressed Pim-2 protein. Simultaneous knockdown of Pim-1 and Pim-3 had a synergistic effect on viral reactivation as observed by a greater reduction in RFP, GFP and K8.1 expression as compared to samples silenced with individual siRNAs (4.5-fold, 14-fold and 45-fold respectively).

The detected interaction between LANA and Pim-1 or -3 in reactivated cells could, however, be simply due to the 2- to 3-fold increase in the levels of Pim-1 and -3 upon TPA treatment, while there might not be enough of these kinases present in the untreated, uninduced PEL cells to detect the interaction. To address this we immunoprecipitated Pim-1 from untreated BC-3 cell extracts with two (1200 &#x000b5;g) or three times (1800 &#x000b5;g) higher concentration of total protein as compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000324-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, or from TPA-treated BC-3 extracts with 600 &#x000b5;g or 1200 &#x000b5;g of protein, and analysed the associated LANA by immunoblotting.

Since RTA is not located in the proximity of the TR region in the KSHV genome we wanted to investigate whether co-expression of Pim-1 or -3 could affect the ability of LANA to inhibit transcription from the RTA promoter. Previous studies have demonstrated that RTA can auto-activate its own viral promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000324-Deng2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, and this was shown to be partially repressed by LANA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000324-Lan2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

LANA can repress expression of a subset of lytic genes by specifically binding to the LANA binding sites 1 and 2 (LBS1 and LBS2) within the TR region of the KSHV genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000324-Garber2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000324-Verma1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we demonstrate that phosphorylation by Pim-1 and -3 counteracts this LANA-mediated inhibition of transcription from the TR region. Besides inhibiting the TR-enhancer dependent transcription LANA can down-modulate the transcriptional activity of the RTA gene promoter as well as the ability of RTA to autoactivate its own promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000324-Lan2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data shows that co-expression of Pim-1 and -3 with LANA was able to de-repress the LANA-induced partial inhibition of autoactivation of the RTA-promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000324-g005">Figure 5</xref>). However, this Pim kinase-mediated de-repression or the inhibitory effect of LANA phosphosite mutant was not as dramatic as those seen in the TR-enhancer dependent transcription assay. This variation could be due to different mechanisms behind the repression. While the LANA-induced inhibition of transcription from the TR region depends on direct binding of LANA to DNA at LBS1 and LBS2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000324-Garber2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000324-Verma1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, the suppression of RTA autoactivation occurs through direct binding of LANA to RTA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000324-Lan2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, our results suggest that phosphorylation of LANA by Pim kinases can modulate its ability to interact with the enhancer elements within the TR region and with the RTA protein itself, and thereby lead to viral reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000324-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="ppat-1000324-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000324.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>A model for Pim-1 and Pim-3 function in KSHV reactivation.</title><p>In latency, binding of LANA to the LANA binding sites 1 and 2 (LBS 1 and LBS2) at the terminal repeat (TR) region represses transcription from the TR region. LANA can also repress transcription from the RTA promoter and inhibit RTA to autoactivate its own promoter. Upon stimulation by cytokines, TPA or NaB, Pim-1 and -3 are up-regulated, and they interact with and phosphorylate LANA. The phosphorylation by Pim-1 and -3 counteracts the LANA&#x02013;mediated inhibition of transcription from the TR region and down-modulates autoactivation of the RTA-promoter, leading to viral reactivation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1000324.g007"/></fig><p>Our KSHV-infected cell models manifest a very low level of spontaneous lytic replication. However, upon stimulation by low level of exogenous RTA (using a low-titer BacK50) and co-expression of Pim kinases, a relatively large population of cells undergoes reactivation. There are several possible reasons to explain why priming with exogenous RTA is needed to induce the Pim kinase-mediated lytic replication. One explanation is that as the latency program in these infected cell models is very tight, a threshold level of RTA might be required for the activation of viral lytic cascade by Pim. Alternatively, Pim kinases may also have an effect on RTA itself.</p><p>Bajaj et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000324-Bajaj1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> recently demonstrated that Pim-1 phosphorylates LANA at either one or both of the serines at positions 205 and 206. We identified Pim-3 as a novel kinase phosphorylating LANA in naturally infected PEL cells, and demonstrated that the phosphorylation takes place only upon viral reactivation. Our data confirms Ser 205/206 as the target sites for Pim-1 and demonstrate that these sites are phosphorylated also by Pim-3. Pim kinases are involved in partially overlapping survival pathways and are implicated in a wide variety of human diseases including cancer, inflammatory disorders, and ischemic diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000324-Bachmann1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000324-Amaravadi1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, they have previously been linked to regulation of viral oncogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000324-Rainio1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000324-Mikovits1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000324-Bajaj1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data extend these observations by suggesting a novel link between Pim kinases and KSHV, and establishes Pim-1 and -3 as key factors in KSHV reactivation.</p><p>Our findings provide compelling evidence that Pim-1 and -3, but not Pim-2, are essential for KSHV reactivation both in <italic>de novo</italic> infected endothelial cells and in the naturally infected PEL cells. Interestingly, we observe a surprising additive effect of Pim-1 and Pim-3 as depletion of one of them results in almost equal level of inhibition of reactivation. One possible explanation could be that the KSHV-infected cells require a threshold level of active Pim kinases to reactivate, and that endogenous levels of Pim-2 would be below the limit, and thus its depletion does not affect reactivation. When expression of Pim-1 or -3 is efficiently silenced, the total Pim kinase activity may fall below the required threshold, leading to inhibition of reactivation upon depletion of either of them.</p><p>A number of inflammatory and angiogenic cytokines including IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3;, platelet-derived growth factor, oncostatin M and interleukin-1&#x003b2; are expressed in KS tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000324-Ensoli1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Some of these cytokines have been suggested to modulate KSHV reactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000324-Ensoli2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Intriguingly, expression of Pim-1 is induced by a number of cytokines, such as IFN-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-3, and IL-6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000324-Bachmann1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. It is therefore plausible that the presence of a variety of cytokines in the microenvironment of KSHV-associated tumors may induce Pim kinase expression and/or activation and lead to viral reactivation in affected tissues. Our data demonstrating involvement of Pim-1 in IFN-&#x003b3; treated PEL cells on activation of ORF50 and ORF57 lytic gene transcription supports a physiological role of Pim-1 in KSHV reactivation.</p><p>The switch from latency to lytic replication is an elementary decision in the viral life cycle and several lines of evidence support the importance of viral lytic replication in herpesviral tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000324-Grundhoff1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000324-Song1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. A sustained, although low level of reactivation can contribute to progression of KS by not only producing new virions but also by contributing to other aspects of KS pathogenesis, such as the production of inflammatory and angiogenic cytokines. Hence, cellular signaling pathways operative during viral reactivation could represent potential novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Accordingly, inhibitors specific for either Pim-1 or -3 or a broad spectrum Pim inhibitor could be developed as antiviral agents, as inhibition of either Pim-1 or -3 results in a significant decrease in reactivation. These inhibitors could also be tested for their anti-tumor activity in PEL mouse models to explore a novel therapeutic strategy to treat KSHV-malignancies. As animals lacking all three Pim genes are viable with a mild phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000324-Mikkers1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, one could anticipate that small-molecule inhibitors targeting Pim-1 and -3 might be tolerated without significant side effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells</title><p>Vero cells latently infected with a recombinant GFP-expressing KSHV (rKSHV.219) were a kind gift from J.
