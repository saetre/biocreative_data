The largest collection of microbes resides in our gut, which harbors trillions of bacteria, representing hundreds of species, most falling into two groups&#x02014;the Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes. We have sequenced the genomes of two human gut-dwelling Bacteroidetes, and compared their genomes to the genomes of other bacteria that live both inside and outside of our bodies.

We next examined the role of LGT in shaping their genomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Lateral Gene Transfer</title><p>Determining whether a gene is laterally transferred is widely acknowledged to be a difficult problem (e.g., &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b018">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050156-sd001">Text S1</xref>). We chose a phylogenetic approach (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) to identify genes that appeared to have been laterally acquired and probably selected for after the divergence of individual gut species. Our approach could potentially identify two types of genes: genes that were laterally transferred only into one lineage, and genes that were lost in all lineages except one. We also had to acknowledge the possibility that random errors in phylogenetic tree reconstruction could produce false-positive results. We confirmed that LGT was the more likely scenario for these genes by demonstrating that they differed in composition from the rest of the genome. This approach allowed us to investigate the adaptations of individual lineages to their specific niche. For simplicity, we refer to these genes as &#x0201c;laterally transferred&#x0201d; in the remainder of this study, although a minority of them may actually represent differential gene loss, which would still likely indicate species-specific selection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Our approach was to use sensitive, iterated profile searches to retrieve homologs of each protein-coding gene in the genomes of interest from publicly available databases. We then built phylogenetic trees of the related sequences and bootstrapped them to minimize noise, keeping only those nodes that were supported by 70&#x00025; of the replicates. We subsequently used the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) taxonomy database to assign taxonomy information to each sequence, and employed the Fitch parsimony algorithm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d; to assign the most likely bacterial taxon to each internal node. This analysis allowed us to differentiate four classes of genes: (1) those whose closest relatives are outside the gut Bacteroidetes, suggesting a lateral transfer event and/or differential gene loss; (2) those whose closest relative is within the gut Bacteroidetes, indicating likely vertical inheritance; (3) those without any homologs in the database (i.e., &#x0201c;novel&#x0201d;); and (4) those whose pattern of inheritance, whether lateral or vertical, could not be determined (i.e., &#x0201c;unresolved&#x0201d;). Parsimony was used to assign a likely direction (&#x0201c;in&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;out&#x0201d;) to each lateral transfer event where possible (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050156-st004">Table S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p><p>We did not attempt to resolve lateral transfer events within the gut Bacteroidetes in this study, primarily because the lack of sufficient taxonomic sampling within the Bacteroidetes made it impossible to distinguish transfer from biased sampling.

However, for the purposes of our functional analyses, these novel genes were excluded because little functional information is available about them. Because we wished to analyze adaptation to the gut, we also excluded genes that appeared to have been transferred out of the Bacteroidetes.</p><p>Our method identified an average of 5.5&#x00025; of the genes in each genome as being laterally transferred from outside the gut Bacteroidetes (312 for <italic>B. distasonis,</italic> 184 for <italic>B. vulgatus,</italic> 277 for <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron,</italic> 199 for <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. fragilis</named-content> NCTC 9343, 214 for <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. fragilis</named-content> YCH 46, and 103 for <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. gingivalis</named-content>).

The excess of LGT genes in <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. distasonis</named-content> is also not simply attributable to its more distant phylogenetic relationship to the other gut Bacteroidetes, because <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. gingivalis</named-content> does not share this feature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050156-g003">Figure 3</xref>C).

The constituent bacteria might therefore be expected to have a high degree of functional redundancy between species, so that the loss of one lineage would not adversely impact ecosystem services to the host. Our investigation of the genomes of human gut Bacteroidetes species shows that the &#x0201c;top-down&#x0201d; forces imposed by selection at the host level that would result in a homogenized microbiome, and the &#x0201c;bottom-up&#x0201d; forces of intermicrobial dynamics that would result in completely differentiated genomes, are both at work in the distal gut. The genomes of the gut Bacteroidetes species that have been sequenced harbor suites of genes with similar functions, but differ in the number of genes within functional categories and their specific sequence. It appears that the differences between genomes are enough to carve out specific niches within the gut habitat, such that the species are not in direct competition, but are sufficiently similar to confer resistance to disturbance to the host through functional redundancy.</p><p>Our findings demonstrate a key role for LGT in shaping the adaptation of individual Bacteroidetes to distinct niches within the human gut. It is unclear how and when laterally transferred genes were introduced during evolution of distal gut Bacteroidetes. We have performed 16S rRNA gene sequence&#x02013;based enumeration studies of the fecal microbiota of 59 different mammalian species: the results reveal that none of the four sequenced gut Bacteroidetes species is restricted to the human gut (R. E. Ley and J. I. Gordon, unpublished data). Nonetheless, the impact of LGT is likely profound for these gut symbionts and their human hosts. A large and varied gene pool of glycosyltransferases provides a capacity for diversification of surface polysaccharide structures that could endow symbionts with varied capacities to shape a host immune system so that it can accommodate a microbiota (and perhaps related food and other environmental antigens). Because the environment surrounding each human being varies, this gene flow may promote the generation of host-specific microbiomes. Acquisition of new types of carbohydrate binding proteins, transporters, and degradation enzymes through both LGT and gene amplification should influence the types of substrates that can be exploited for energy harvest. It may also affect our predisposition to conditions such as obesity in which the efficiency of caloric harvest may be influenced by the relationship between an individual's microbial glycoside hydrolase repertoire and the glycan content of his/her diet &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>These considerations emphasize the need to have a more comprehensive view of our genetic landscape as a composite of human and microbial genes, a transcendent view of human evolution as involving our microbial partners, and a commitment to investigating human biology in the larger framework of environmental microbiology.

How is the human microbiome evolving (within and between individuals) over varying time scales as a function of our changing diets, lifestyle, and biosphere?

These genes could either have been transferred into an individual species by LGT, or retained in that species despite being lost in all other related sequenced species. It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to distinguish these two cases using the tree topology alone. We identified this class of genes by determining whether each gene met one of the following criteria. (1) No homologs were found in an augmented NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein database (plus the proteins from the newly sequenced strains). This case indicated that either the gene has been lost in every other sequenced organism but retained in this genome, or that the gene was laterally transferred from an organism that is not represented in the database. (2) The only homologs found were from the same species. This case is the same as case (1), except that either the gene was sequenced multiple times and deposited in the database under separate records, or there are paralogs, i.e., multiple copies of the gene in the genome being analyzed. Both case (1) and (2) were termed &#x0201c;novel.&#x0201d; (3) The only homologs found are either from the same species or from other divisions or non-gut Bacteroidetes. This case indicates that the sequence is in this genome, and also in the genome of distantly related organisms, but not in the closely related gut Bacteroidetes genomes that have been completely sequenced. This case also provides evidence that the gene was either transferred or retained despite loss in related organisms. (4) The gene is more closely related to genes from other divisions or to non-gut Bacteroidetes than it is to other gut Bacteroidetes that are in the tree, and parsimony analysis indicates that the direction of transfer was into rather than out of the genome. This pattern is most consistent with LGT, although differential gene loss cannot in principle be ruled out (however, differences in composition between this class of genes and the rest of the genome provide compelling supporting evidence). Both cases (3) and (4) above were termed &#x0201c;laterally transferred&#x0201d; (LGT).</p><p><italic>Genomes.</italic> We carried out the analysis on six different genomes: <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacteroides vulgatus</named-content> ATCC 8482 and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacteroides distasonis</named-content> ATCC 8503, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacteroides fragilis</named-content> NCTC 9343 (NC&#x0005f;0023338), <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacteroides fragilis</named-content> YCH 46 (NC&#x0005f;006347), <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</named-content> ATCC 29148 (NC&#x0005f;004663), and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Porphyromonas gingivalis</named-content> W83 (NC&#x0005f;002950).</p><p><italic>Finding homologs.</italic> For each gene in each genome, we identified potential homologs using PSI-BLAST against NCBI's nr protein database.

If fewer than 50 hits were found, we used the hits to make a profile for a subsequent PSI-BLAST that was four orders of magnitude less stringent (i.e., with an e-value of 10<sup>&#x02212;46</sup>). We repeated this procedure, increasing the e-value by a factor of 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> at each iteration, until either 50 hits were found or, after 12 iterations, the maximum allowed e-value of 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> was reached. To remove from consideration sequences that were significant only because of a conserved domain rather than similarity over the whole gene, we excluded genes that differed from the length of the query sequence by more than 30&#x00025;.

Sequences that could not be assigned to any particular division were removed from the tree. We also removed nematode and arthropod genomes because we found that these often provided close hits to the Bacteroidetes genomes. We expect that these bacteria-to-eukaryote hits actually arise because gut and/or salivary gland bacteria contaminated the DNA preparations used for genomic sequencing. We also used the genus annotations in the taxonomy to determine whether sequences from the Bacteroidetes division were from the gut. We assigned sequences as gut Bacteroidetes if they were in the genera <italic>Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Tannerella, Dysgonomonas,</italic> or <italic>Bacteroides,</italic> and as non-gut Bacteroidetes otherwise.</p><p><italic>Finding genes that are laterally transferred or differentially lost (under recent selective pressure).</italic> We used the bootstrap neighbor-joining trees to identify genes that met any of the four criteria described above. We first marked genes &#x0201c;novel&#x0201d; if the PSI-BLAST protocol returned only the query gene, indicating that they met criterion (1), or if all of the genes in the tree were from the same species, indicating that they met criterion (2). We assigned each sequence to a species using the NCBI taxonomy. If genes from other species were present in the tree, we used the following algorithm. (1) Start at the query sequence. (2) Step back in tree until a bootstrap-supported node containing sequences from a different species is found. If this node has, as descendants, sequences from other gut Bacteroidetes only, mark the gene as not laterally transferred (not selected for). If the node has, as descendants, sequences from both gut Bacteroidetes and other divisions or non-gut Bacteroidetes, mark the gene as unresolved. If the node has, as descendants, sequences from other divisions or non-gut Bacteroidetes only, mark the gene as laterally transferred (selected for) and proceed to the parsimony analysis. (3) Use parsimony analysis to determine whether a potential transfer would have been into the Bacteroidetes species (indicating that it is important for the gut), or out of the Bacteroidetes species into another lineage. Assign division information to all internal nodes in the tree using the Fitch parsimony algorithm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. These assignments minimize the number of transfers between divisions needed to explain the distribution of divisions in the modern sequences. If the query sequence is surrounded by many sequences from unrelated divisions, the parsimony analysis will indicate that the most likely event was a transfer into the species. As noted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050156-sd001">Text S1</xref> (Overview of Strategy Used to Identify LGT)<bold>,</bold> the method we used provides an automated technique for assigning taxon labels to individual gene trees. Specifically, we treat each taxon label (division labels, &#x0201c;gut Bacteroidetes&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;non-gut Bacteroidetes&#x0201d;) as a character state, and use the Fitch parsimony algorithm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d; to infer the ancestral state at each node. We are not using this method in the sense of a formal evolutionary model of taxon switching, but as a heuristic that recaptures the intuition that a phylogenetic tree with a clade leading to sequences from one taxon that sprouts from within a clade leading to sequences from a completely different taxon probably represents a LGT event, even if the inner clade is represented by more sequences.
