As enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) may cause hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), in which microthrombi cause tissue damage, this study investigated whether the interaction between blood cells and EHEC virulence factors Shiga toxin (Stx) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) led to release of TF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>The interaction between Stx or LPS and blood cells induced platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation and tissue factor (TF) release, as detected by flow cytometry in whole blood. O157LPS was more potent than other LPS serotypes. Aggregates formed mainly between monocytes and platelets and less so between neutrophils and platelets. Stimulated blood cells in complex expressed activation markers, and microparticles were released. Microparticles originated mainly from platelets and monocytes and expressed TF. TF&#x02013;expressing microparticles, and functional TF in plasma, increased when blood cells were simultaneously exposed to the EHEC virulence factors and high shear stress. Stx and LPS in combination had a more pronounced effect on platelet-monocyte aggregate formation, and TF expression on these aggregates, than each virulence factor alone. Whole blood and plasma from HUS patients (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4) were analyzed. All patients had an increase in leukocyte-platelet aggregates, mainly between monocytes and platelets, on which TF was expressed during the acute phase of disease. Patients also exhibited an increase in microparticles, mainly originating from platelets and monocytes, bearing surface-bound TF, and functional TF was detected in their plasma. Blood cell aggregates, microparticles, and TF decreased upon recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>By triggering TF release in the circulation, Stx and LPS can induce a prothrombotic state contributing to the pathogenesis of HUS.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Platelets and leukocytes do not interact with each other in the circulation under normal circumstances.

Both Stx2 and LPS induced platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation, TF expression and microparticle generation. Co-stimulation with Stx2 and LPS resulted in an additive effect with regard to platelet-monocyte aggregate formation and TF expression on these aggregates, particularly when high shear forces were applied.

The discrepancy between our in vitro results and the results from patient blood samples may be explained by other activation factors present in HUS plasma not accounted for in the in vitro experiments.

The effect was additive when whole blood was co-stimulated with both virulence factors and increased under conditions of high shear stress. This process promoted the release of TF-bearing microparticles from activated blood cells. Based on the findings presented in this work we envisage a scenario in which EHEC virulence factors entering the circulation activate platelets and leukocytes. The interaction between these virulence factors and blood cells under shear flow allows blood cell aggregate formation and decryption of TF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006990-sterud1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, expression of active TF on cell membranes as well as secretion of TF-rich microparticles. This process will be enhanced by circulating cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006990-Karpman3">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref> and by Stx-induced vascular injury releasing endothelial-derived microparticles. Thus microparticles expressing TF will promote thrombogenesis during HUS.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Professor Lars Holmberg, Department of Pediatrics, Lund
