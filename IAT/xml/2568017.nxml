The machinery shares features with protein relays for disulfide bond formation in the bacterial periplasm and endoplasmic reticulum. A disulfide-generating enzyme/sulfhydryl oxidase oxidizes a disulfide carrier protein, which in turn transfers a disulfide to the substrate protein. Current views suggest that the disulfide carrier alternates between binding to the oxidase and the substrate. We have analyzed the cooperation of the disulfide relay components during import of precursors into mitochondria and identified a ternary complex of all three components. The ternary complex represents a transient and intermediate step in the oxidation of intermembrane space precursors, where the oxidase Erv1 promotes disulfide transfer to the precursor while both oxidase and precursor are associated with the disulfide carrier Mia40.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>D.

The mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) contains an import and assembly (MIA) machinery, which transfers disulfide bonds to precursors and promotes their import and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chacinska et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koehler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mesecke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tokatlidis, 2005</xref>). The MIA pathway was reported to operate as a protein relay for disulfide bond formation like the disulfide relay systems of the bacterial periplasm (disulfide bond formation protein B [DsbB]&#x02013;DsbA) and the ER (Ero1&#x02013;protein disulfide isomerase [PDI]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Collet and Bardwell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kadokura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tu and Weissman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sevier and Kaiser, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Herrmann and K&#x000f6;hl, 2007</xref>). In each case, a disulfide-generating enzyme/sulfhydryl oxidase (DsbB, Ero1, and Erv1) oxidizes a disulfide carrier protein (DsbA, PDI, and Mia40). The oxidized disulfide carrier subsequently transfers the disulfide to the substrate, typically a newly synthesized protein arriving in the periplasm, ER, or IMS.</p><p>Mixed disulfides are generated between oxidase and disulfide carriers, as well as between carrier protein and substrate as direct means for the transfer of disulfide bonds. The current models of disulfide relays suggest an alternating association of the carrier protein with the substrate (reduction of the carrier) and the sulfhydryl oxidase (reoxidation of the carrier; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Collet and Bardwell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kadokura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tu and Weissman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mesecke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sevier and Kaiser, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Herrmann and K&#x000f6;hl, 2007</xref>). This implies that substrates, which receive more than one disulfide bond, require multiple cycles of the disulfide relay. An alternative, efficient mechanism would be that oxidative protein folding involves a direct cooperation of all three partners in a ternary complex to promote the flow of electrons. However, such a ternary complex has not been shown experimentally.</p><p>We addressed the cooperation of sulfhydryl oxidase and disulfide carrier during oxidation of mitochondrial IMS precursors. Mia40 (Tim40), which contains three essential pairs of cysteines, forms a mixed disulfide with precursors in translocation across the outer membrane, drives their import into the IMS, and transfers disulfides to the proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chacinska et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nao&#x000e9; et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Terziyska et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grumbt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Milenkovic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">M&#x000fc;ller et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mesecke et al. (2005)</xref> found that upon release of the oxidized substrate, reduced Mia40 was reoxidized by Erv1 (also containing three pairs of cysteines), thus permitting new rounds of precursor import. Here, we report that, contrary to the view that Erv1 acts only on substrate-free Mia40, we have identified a ternary complex of Erv1, Mia40, and precursor. This ternary complex assists in the transfer of disulfide bonds to IMS precursors by spatially connecting sulfhydryl oxidase, carrier protein, and substrate.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Disulfide-linked precursor&#x02013;Mia40 intermediate in <italic>erv1</italic> mutant mitochondria</title><p>The import and assembly stages of the <sup>35</sup>S-labeled precursors of the small translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane (Tim) proteins of the IMS were monitored by blue native electrophoresis. After disulfide-mediated interaction with Mia40, the oxidized proteins, which contain two disulfides each, assemble to the mature hexameric complexes (Tim9&#x02013;Tim10 or Tim8&#x02013;Tim13); Tim9 and Tim10 additionally assemble into the TIM22 complex of the inner membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chacinska et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Curran et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Milenkovic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sideris and Tokatlidis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">M&#x000fc;ller et al., 2008</xref>).

To capture a putative ternary complex, we used the trap mutant form Mia40-4, which efficiently binds substrate but is impaired in its release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chacinska et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Milenkovic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">M&#x000fc;ller et al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>mia40-4</italic> mitochondria, formation of the mature complexes (Tim9&#x02013;Tim10, Tim8&#x02013;13, and TIM22) is impaired, and precursor proteins accumulate at Mia40-4. We noticed an additional complex in the high molecular weight range of blue native gels upon import of <sup>35</sup>S-precursors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, Mia40&#x02013;intermediate II). Mitochondria carrying His-tagged versions of Mia40 and Mia40-4 were lysed in digitonin and subjected to affinity purification. The amount of Erv1 bound to Mia40-4 was increased approximately twofold in the mutant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>).

We conclude that both substrate and Erv1 were accumulated at the mutant protein Mia40-4.</p><p>In wild-type mitochondria, a ternary complex of Erv1, Mia40, and precursor would represent a short-lived intermediate in the reaction cycle for precursor oxidation. We searched for conditions to slow down the reaction and stabilize an intermediate complex with wild-type Mia40. Upon rupturing the outer membrane by swelling (mitoplasting), IMS components like the small Tim proteins were released, and the amount of Erv1 was reduced by approximately half (Erv1 was found in two fractions, soluble and peripherally membrane associated; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, lanes 10 and 12; and Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804095/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804095/DC1</ext-link>).

Because in mitoplasts the precursor would have direct access to Erv1 without a need for Mia40-dependent translocation across the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Milenkovic et al., 2007</xref>), we conclude that Mia40 is required for the interaction of Erv1 with the precursor.

To determine why Erv1 was needed for precursor release, we asked if it promoted disulfide formation on a Mia40-bound precursor. We monitored the oxidation of single cysteines of Tim9 by modification with the alkylating agent 4-acetamido-4&#x02032;-maleimidylstilbene-2,2&#x02032;-disulfonic acid (AMS; 500 D). Mutant precursors with a replacement of one to four cysteines were used as standards (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;5). By indirect thiol trapping, the number of oxidized cysteines after import into mitochondria was determined: first, free thiol groups were blocked by iodoacetamide, then the mitochondria were lysed and all disulfides were reduced, followed by modification of the originally oxidized cysteines by AMS. At a low temperature (15&#x000b0;C), a sequential oxidation of the cysteines was observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, lanes 6&#x02013;10).

We imported mutant precursors lacking three, two, or one of the other cysteines and observed the generation of one, two, and three oxidized cysteines, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). We hypothesized that species with an odd number of oxidized cysteines may represent Mia40-linked precursors. After affinity purification of His-tagged Mia40, bound precursors were eluted, and the number of originally oxidized cysteines was determined. The precursors lacking three or two cysteines contained one oxidized cysteine in the Mia40-bound form (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>), which reflects the mixed disulfide with Mia40. Of particular importance was the precursor Tim9<sub>C55S</sub>. Here, two forms, one with a single oxidized cysteine and one with all three cysteines oxidized, were bound to Mia40 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Thus, in addition to the mixed disulfide with Mia40, a further disulfide bond was transferred to the precursor bound to Mia40. In <italic>erv1</italic> mutant mitochondria, the oxidation of Tim9<sub>C55S</sub> was impaired with a particular defect in generation of the third oxidized cysteine (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, E and F</xref>). We determined the number of oxidized cysteines in the Mia40-bound precursor of wild-type and <italic>erv1</italic> mutant mitochondria. Full oxidation of the precursor strongly depended on the activity of Erv1, whereas oxidation of the first cysteine (mixed disulfide with Mia40) was only moderately affected in the <italic>erv1</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 G</xref>). Thus, active Erv1 is critical for the efficient transfer of a further disulfide bond to the precursor, which is bound to Mia40 via a mixed disulfide, demonstrating the function of Erv1 in the ternary complex. We conclude that the association of Erv1 with the precursor&#x02013;Mia40 complex permits an efficient transfer of disulfides in a ternary complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We report that the interactions of Mia40 with Erv1 and precursor are not mutually exclusive, but all three components associate in a ternary complex. This intermediate complex is a transient step in precursor oxidation and thus has escaped experimental detection in previous studies. We found two means to trap precursors in a ternary complex. First, a trap mutant form of Mia40 accumulated precursors and Erv1. Second, mitochondria were swollen, leading to a release of IMS components, including approximately half of Erv1, whereas the amount of membrane-bound Mia40 was unchanged. Erv1 was rate-limiting for dissociation of the precursor&#x02013;Mia40 complex because overexpression as well as addition of purified Erv1 promoted substrate release from Mia40. The ternary complex thus accumulated in mitoplasts containing limiting amounts of Erv1.</p><p>Two possibilities are conceivable for the organization of the ternary complex. Erv1 may bind to the precursor or to Mia40. Our findings support the scenario that Erv1 does not directly bind the precursor but acts on Mia40 because the coprecipitation of precursor with Erv1 requires the presence of functional Mia40, and is enhanced by the Mia40-trap form. We suggest that Erv1 promotes maturation (oxidation) of Mia40-bound substrate in the ternary complex through the transfer of disulfide bonds to precursors via Mia40, and this serves as a prerequisite for substrate release.</p><p>Most disulfide relay components of mitochondria, bacteria, and ER share only limited homology on the primary structure level; however, basic functional mechanisms of disulfide shuttling may be related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gerber et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sevier et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gross et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kadokura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tu and Weissman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Inaba et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sevier and Kaiser, 2006</xref>). By splitting bacterial DsbB into two domains, disulfide transfer in a complex of three polypeptides, DsbA with the two DsbB domains was shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kadokura and Beckwith, 2002</xref>). Here, the central polypeptide contained one redox-active pair of cysteines; in the ternary complex, each cysteine was bound to a different partner polypeptide. Mia40 may function in a similar manner with one redox-active pair of cysteines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grumbt et al., 2007</xref>). Alternatively, more than one cysteine residue of precursor and Mia40 may be involved in forming transient disulfides in the ternary complex. Several components of the ER and bacterial systems contain more than one redox-active pair of cysteines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tsai and Rapoport, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kadokura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kulp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sevier and Kaiser, 2006</xref>). Moreover, more than one molecule of Mia40 may participate in the reaction, as human Mia40 forms a homo-oligomer linked by noncovalent interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hofmann et al., 2005</xref>). In addition to disulfide-mediated interactions, noncovalent interactions and conformational changes likely contribute to the cooperation of the partners in the ternary complex.</p><p>The findings presented here change the view that the disulfide carrier (Mia40) strictly alternates between binding to Erv1 and precursor in a sequential relay system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mesecke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Herrmann and K&#x000f6;hl, 2007</xref>). The identification of a ternary complex suggests that the flow of electrons between oxidase, carrier, and substrate does not require sequential association and dissociation of the components, but rather their concerted action within a single complex. Thus, two distinct redox reactions are spatially coupled, which results in a channeling mechanism for disulfide transfer. Moreover, for substrates that receive more than one disulfide, the binding of Erv1 to the Mia40&#x02013;precursor complex may permit an efficient transfer of multiple disulfides in a ternary complex. We speculate that the concept of mitochondrial disulfide channeling, comprising oxidase, disulfide carrier, and substrate, provides mechanistic implications for the ER and bacterial systems.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Strains</title><p>Strains generated and used in this study are derivatives of the wild-type YPH499 strain of yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<italic>MAT</italic>a, <italic>ade2-101</italic>, <italic>his3-&#x00394;200</italic>, <italic>leu2-&#x00394;1</italic>, <italic>ura3-52</italic>, <italic>trp1-&#x00394;63</italic>, and <italic>lys2-801</italic>).
