These enzymes share no structural and functional similarities with their eukaryotic counterparts and, to date, only few substrates of BY-kinases have been characterized. BY-kinases have been shown to participate in various physiological processes. Nevertheless, we are at a very early stage of defining their importance in the bacterial cell. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, two BY-kinases, Wzc and Etk, have been characterized biochemically. Wzc has been shown to phosphorylate the UDP-glucose dehydrogenase Ugd <italic>in vitro</italic>. Not only is Ugd involved in the biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharides, but also in the production of UDP-4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose, a compound that renders <italic>E. coli</italic> resistant to cationic antimicrobial peptides.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Here, we studied the role of Ugd phosphorylation. We first confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic> the phosphorylation of Ugd by Wzc and we demonstrated that Ugd is also phosphorylated by Etk, the other BY-kinase identified in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Tyrosine 71 (Tyr71) was characterized as the Ugd site phosphorylated by both Wzc and Etk. The regulatory role of Tyr71 phosphorylation on Ugd activity was then assessed and Tyr71 mutation was found to prevent Ugd activation by phosphorylation. Further, Ugd phosphorylation by Wzc or Etk was shown to serve distinct physiological purposes. Phosphorylation of Ugd by Wzc was found to participate in the regulation of the amount of the exopolysaccharide colanic acid, whereas Etk-mediated Ugd phosphorylation appeared to participate in the resistance of <italic>E. coli</italic> to the antibiotic polymyxin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Ugd phosphorylation seems to be at the junction between two distinct biosynthetic pathways, illustrating the regulatory potential of tyrosine phosphorylation in bacterial physiology.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In bacteria, protein phosphorylation is catalyzed mainly by histidine-kinases which are key enzymes of the so-called &#x0201c;two component systems&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Stock1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, by proteins of the phosphotransferase system involved in sugar transport and phosphorylation as well as many regulatory functions and by Hanks-type Serine/Threonine Protein Kinases (STPKs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Bakal1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the presence of tyrosine-kinases has been proven in several bacterial species, and suggested in many more by homology-based gene annotation. These tyrosine-kinases share little structural similarities with their eukaryotic counterparts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-OlivaresIllana1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Lee1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> and most of them have been recently unified in a new enzyme family called BY-kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Grangeasse1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Until now, BY-kinases have been found only in bacteria and they seem to constitute an idiosyncratic class of enzymes. They have been shown to be involved in several physiological processes such as DNA metabolism or heat shock response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Petranovic1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Klein1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In several bacteria, including both proteobacteria and firmicutes, they have also been established as co-polymerases involved in synthesis and export of extracellular polysaccharides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Tocilj1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Whitfield1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. However, their accurate functions remain poorly understood due to slow progress in structural characterization and to the fact that only few phosphorylation substrates have been detected. BY-kinases are autophosphorylating enzymes and they are also able to phosphorylate endogenous proteins. It was only recently that sugar-dehydrogenases or -transferases involved in polysaccharide production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Grangeasse2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Minic1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, RNA polymerase sigma factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Klein1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> and single-stranded DNA binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Mijakovic2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> were identified as BY-kinase substrates. Nevertheless, recent phosphoproteomic studies indicate that BY-kinases could phosphorylate a significant number of other proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Macek1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Macek2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> produces two BY-kinases, Wzc and Etk. They are respectively encoded by genes located at approximately 46 min and 22 min on the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome in two gene-clusters both involved in the biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Stevenson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Peleg1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Accordingly, Wzc and Etk have been characterized as polysaccharide co-polymerases (PCP) belonging to multiprotein transmembrane machineries involved in synthesis and/or export of extracellular polysaccharides, and their autophosphorylation on several tyrosines has turned out to be a key feature in the production of these compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Whitfield2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, it has been demonstrated that Wzc and Etk are involved in other processes. For instance, Wzc is able to phosphorylate and down regulate the activity of Int, the integrase of coliphage HK022 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Kolot1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. In the same way, Etk has been found to be involved in heat shock response by phosphorylating sigma and anti-sigma factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Klein1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Protein Ugd of <italic>E. coli</italic>, a UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, is one of the first identified substrates of a BY-kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Grangeasse2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, it has been shown that Ugd is phosphorylated <italic>in vitro</italic> by the BY-kinase Wzc. Other types of sugar-dehydrogenases, including the UDP-glucose dehydrogenase of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> Ugd<sub>Bs</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Mijakovic3">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> and the UDP-acetyl-mannosamine dehydrogenase CapO of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Soulat1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, have recently been shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated. Thus, it could be speculated that tyrosine phosphorylation of this class of enzymes is a common regulatory mechanism found in several bacteria. Ugd produces UDP-glucuronic acid (UDPGA) that is a precursor and an essential component in the biosynthesis of bacterial polysaccharides, notably of <italic>E. coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Whitfield2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. UDPGA is found in several capsular polysaccharides (K-antigens) and in colanic acid (M-antigen), an extracellular polysaccharide produced by many strains of <italic>E. coli</italic>. In addition, UDPGA participates in the production of a sugar derivative, UDP-4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (L-Ara4N) which is a crucial element in bacterial resistance to antibiotics such as polymyxin and cationic peptides of the innate immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Raetz1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Breazeale1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, in the search of the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in bacteria, the question was raised whether Ugd phosphorylation could affect, on the one hand, the production of polysaccharides and, on the other hand, bacterial resistance to cationic peptides. In <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12, we had previously demonstrated that Wzc autophosphorylation influences the production of colanic acid, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Obadia1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, we had also shown that an <italic>etk</italic> knock-out mutant is much less resistant to polymyxin than a wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 strain. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Lee1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Lacour1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. However, Ugd has not been described as being phosphorylated by Etk. Therefore, it seemed particularly interesting to investigate if Ugd is also a phosphorylation substrate for Etk and if Ugd phosphorylation by either Wzc or Etk affects colanic acid production or polymyxin resistance, respectively.</p><p>In this work, we provide <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that, depending on the growth conditions, Ugd can be phosphorylated by either Wzc or Etk. We show that Ugd is phosphorylated on the same site by both BY-kinases, Wzc and Etk. We further show that Wzc-mediated phosphorylation of Ugd specifically affects the biosynthesis of colanic acid whereas resistance to the cationic antimicrobial peptide polymyxin is dependent upon Ugd phosphorylation by Etk. These data represent the first report of a bacterial protein phosphorylated by two distinct tyrosine-kinases. They contribute to define the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in bacteria and provide a basis for an emerging regulatory network in <italic>E.coli</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ugd is phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> both by Wzc and Etk</title><p>We have previously reported that Ugd is monophosphorylated <italic>in vitro</italic> by the catalytic domain of Wzc, Wzc<sub>cyto</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Grangeasse2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003053.s002">Table S1</xref>).

After growth in Luria Bertani medium, a total protein extract was prepared, analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted against either a monoclonal anti-Wzc antibody, or a monoclonal anti-Ugd antibody, or an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003053-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Immunorevelation with the Wzc- and Ugd-specific antibodies showed signals at around 81-kDa and 45-kDa, which are respectively consistent with the expression of the two proteins. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody revealed an expected signal corresponding to autophosphorylated Wzc. Also, we observed a 45-kDa signal that could correspond to the phosphorylated form of Ugd. To strengthen these observations, we similarly analyzed a <italic>wzc</italic> knock-out mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Obadia1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. We did not detect any signal for Wzc or phosphotyrosine around 45-kDa, whereas Ugd was still detected by the Ugd-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003053-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). In addition, the <italic>ugd</italic> gene was inactivated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003053.s002">Table S1</xref>) and the &#x00394;<italic>ugd</italic> strain obtained was analyzed as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003053-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). We still observed the expression and phosphorylation of Wzc, but no 45-kDa signal was detected by either the Ugd-specific antibody or the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody.

In addition, <italic>etk</italic> expression is not dependent on protein RcsA. It has previously been shown that <italic>etk</italic>, but not <italic>wzc</italic>, is expressed when <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 grows in a culture medium at low pH and low concentration of magnesium and iron ions. Such conditions induce resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Lacour1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. We verified that <italic>etk</italic> was expressed during growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 in such medium. No 81-kDa signal was observed when detection was carried out with the Wzc-specific antibody whereas a signal appeared at this position when we used the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003053-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). This observation confirmed that <italic>wzc</italic> is not expressed and strongly suggested that autophosphorylated Etk is produced under these culture conditions. To validate this point, we analyzed an <italic>etk</italic>-deficient strain. Immunoblot analysis showed no 81-kDa signal and supported the assumption that the signal detected with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody in the wild-type strain corresponded to Etk autophosphorylation. In addition, RT-PCR experiments were performed and we observed that the <italic>etk</italic> gene was effectively expressed under these growth conditions (data not shown). To assess if Etk can phosphorylate Ugd, we also analyzed total protein extracts of wild-type, <italic>ugd</italic>-deficient and <italic>etk</italic>-deficient strains of <italic>E. coli</italic> by immunorevelation with the Ugd-specific antibody and the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003053-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). We observed that Ugd was produced and phosphorylated in the wild-type strain. On the contrary, no 45-kDa phosphorylation signal was detected with <italic>ugd</italic> and <italic>etk</italic> knock-out mutants while Ugd was still detected in the <italic>etk</italic> mutant. These observations confirmed that Ugd was also phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> by Etk.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Ugd is activated by phosphorylation on Tyr71</title><p>To decipher the role of Ugd phosphorylation, it was necessary to identify the site of phosphorylation of <italic>E. coli</italic> Ugd. We had already observed that Ugd seemed to be monophosphorylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Grangeasse2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Mass spectrometry analysis (MALDI-TOF) failed to identify the Ugd phosphorylated tyrosine probably because of the low occupancy of bacterial phosphorylation sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Macek3">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, sequence alignments were performed with protein Ugd<sub>Bs</sub>, a UDP-sugar-dehydrogenase from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> homologous to Ugd and also phosphorylated on tyrosine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003053.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). Several tyrosines of Ugd (Tyr10, Tyr150, Tyr249, Tyr335 and Tyr380) that seemed conserved in Ugd<sub>Bs</sub> were mutated to phenylalanine. However, when each mutant protein was purified and phosphorylated <italic>in vitro</italic> by the catalytic domain of Wzc, Wzc<sub>cyto</sub>, a radioactive signal corresponding to phosphorylated Ugd was still detected for each of them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003053.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>). While this work was in progress, a study of the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> phosphoproteome indicated that Ugd<sub>Bs</sub> was phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> on tyrosine 70 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Macek2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. According to sequence alignments, the closest tyrosine in the <italic>E. coli</italic> Ugd sequence is Tyrosine 71 (Tyr71) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003053.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). We hypothesized that Tyr71 could be the phosphorylation site of Ugd and we constructed the Ugd mutant Tyr71Phe (UgdY71F).</p><p>To check this hypothesis, the phosphorylation signal of Ugd was compared with that of UgdY71F. When incubated for 2 min with Wzc<sub>cyto</sub> (kinase/substrate ratio of 1/100), we observed that Ugd was phosphorylated whereas no radioactive signal was detected for UgdY71F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003053-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). These data suggested that Tyr71 is the phosphorylation site of Ugd. To check that the folding of the Ugd protein was not affected by the Y71F mutation, dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were performed. The hydrodynamic radius measured for Ugd and UgdY71F were the same (<italic>R<sub>S</sub></italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;62&#x0002b;/&#x02212;3 &#x000c5;) confirming that the overall structure of Ugd was most likely not affected by the Tyr to Phe mutation. To confirm Tyr71 as the phosphorylation site responsible for activating the enzyme, the dehydrogenase activity of Ugd and UgdY71F was measured with or without prior incubation with Wzc<sub>cyto</sub> and ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003053-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). We have previously shown that Ugd phosphorylation increased its dehydrogenase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Grangeasse2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. As expected, Ugd activity was stimulated more than 10-fold upon phosphorylation. By contrast, UgdY71F activity remained unaffected by incubation with Wzc<sub>cyto</sub>. In addition, UgdY71F was less active than Ugd which is in agreement with our previous observations showing that Ugd purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> is partially phosphorylated, and that its extensive dephosphorylation by the phosphotyrosine phosphatase Wzb reduces its activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Grangeasse2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. These data indicated that UgdY71F was no longer activated by phosphorylation and we concluded that Tyr71 was the regulatory phosphorylation site of Ugd.</p><fig id="pone-0003053-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003053.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Activation of the UDP-glucose dehydrogenase activity of Ugd by phosphorylation on Tyr71.</title><p>(A) Autoradiography of SDS-PAGE on which reaction mixtures containing &#x0005b;&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;ATP and either Ugd and Wzc<sub>cyto</sub> (lane 1) or UgdY71F and Wzc<sub>cyto</sub> (lane 2) or Ugd and Etk<sub>cyto</sub> (lane 3) or UgdY71F and Etk<sub>cyto</sub> (lane 4) were analyzed.

We therefore used this strain (referred to herein as the wild-type) to assess the importance of Ugd phosphorylation on colanic acid synthesis. First, we confirmed that Ugd Tyr71 was not phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> by Wzc. For this, we complemented the <italic>ugd</italic>-deficient strain (&#x00394;<italic>ugd</italic> strain) with an episomal copy of either the <italic>ugd</italic> gene (&#x00394;<italic>ugd</italic>&#x0002b;<italic>ugd</italic> strain) or the <italic>ugd</italic> Y71F allele (&#x00394;<italic>ugd</italic>&#x0002b;<italic>ugdY71F</italic> strain) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003053.s002">Table S1</xref>). Total protein extracts were prepared from these two strains and the protein synthesis and phosphorylation for both Wzc and Ugd were analyzed by antibodies as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003053-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). We observed that proteins Wzc, Ugd, and UgdY71F, were produced. In contrast, Ugd was phosphorylated only in the strain &#x00394;<italic>ugd</italic>&#x0002b;<italic>ugd</italic>. Indeed, no 45-kDa phosphorylation signal was detected for the strain producing UgdY71F.

In contrast, smaller and duller colonies are observed when colanic acid is not produced. Therefore, we compared the colony morphology of strains producing Ugd, wild-type form or mutated on Tyr71 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003053-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). We first observed that colony morphologies of the wild-type and &#x00394;<italic>ugd</italic>&#x0002b;<italic>ugd</italic> strains were almost indistinguishable and they had characteristics of a mucoid phenotype due to the production of colanic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003053-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). By contrast, colonies formed by the &#x00394;<italic>ugd</italic> strain differed considerably and were not mucoid. When looking at the colony morphology of &#x00394;<italic>ugd</italic>&#x0002b;<italic>ugdY71F</italic> strain, we also observed a non-mucoid phenotype similar to the &#x00394;<italic>ugd</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003053-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). These data supported the hypothesis that the Wzc-mediated phosphorylation of Ugd on Tyr71 controls colanic acid production. To strengthen this observation, we prepared and quantified colanic acid produced by each strain used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003053-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Quantification was performed by measuring the amount of fucose, which is exclusively found in this polysaccharide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Stevenson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. As expected, the wild-type and &#x00394;<italic>ugd</italic>&#x0002b;<italic>ugd</italic> strains produced comparable amounts of colanic acid, whereas the amount of colanic acid determined for the &#x00394;<italic>ugd</italic> strain was up to 10-fold lower. Concerning the &#x00394;<italic>ugd</italic>&#x0002b;<italic>ugdY71F</italic> strain, a 5-fold reduction was measured compared to &#x00394;<italic>ugd</italic>&#x0002b;<italic>ugd</italic> strain. Colanic acid still produced by the &#x00394;<italic>ugd</italic>&#x0002b;<italic>ugdY71F</italic> strain was likely due to the basal activity of UgdY71F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003053-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Accordingly, colony morphology of &#x00394;<italic>ugd</italic>&#x0002b;<italic>ugdY71F</italic> strain began to be mucoid when growth was allowed for more than 48 hours (data not shown).

This finding constitutes the first example of a bacterial protein phosphorylated on tyrosine by two distinct BY-kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003053-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, so far only 3 proteins have been characterized as being phosphorylated by Etk or Wzc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Klein1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Kolot1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. However, no less than 7 other proteins have recently been found to be tyrosine phosphorylated in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells grown under standard laboratory conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Macek1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. These proteins carry out functions as diverse as tRNA synthesis, transport of amino acids, protein translation and stress response. Since, Wzc and Etk are the only tyrosine kinases characterized in <italic>E. coli</italic>, it is possible that they phosphorylate these proteins. Alternatively, presently unidentified tyrosine kinases could be present in <italic>E. coli</italic>. To support the first hypothesis, it has been demonstrated that the colanic acid operon (<italic>cps</italic>), which includes 19 genes, contains a stem-loop transcriptional attenuator which is located immediately after the third gene, namely <italic>wzc</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Bailey1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>wzc</italic> might therefore be expressed independently of the other <italic>cps</italic> genes and be involved in the phosphorylation of other proteins so as to regulate other cellular functions. There are also arguments for the second hypothesis, namely that other tyrosine kinases could be encoded by the genome of <italic>E. coli</italic>. Several proteins of unknown function harbor the Walker A and B motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Leipe1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> that constitute the active sites of Wzc and Etk, and they might function as tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, Zheng and coworkers have recently reported that the protein of unknown function YihE indeed exhibits a eukaryotic-like kinase fold despite sharing no sequence homology with eukaryotic kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Zheng1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. This finding supports the existence of still unknown bacterial kinases that would harbor a new type of phosphorelay mechanism. Be that as it may, the role of BY-kinases in phosphorylating other proteins seems underestimated and new regulatory networks based on tyrosine phosphorylation are likely to exist not only in <italic>E. coli</italic> but also in a large number of proteobacteria and firmicutes in which BY-kinases have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Grangeasse1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0003053-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003053.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Schematic model for Ugd phosphorylation by Wzc or Etk as control element for extracellular polysaccharides production and resistance to antimicrobial cationic peptide.</title><p>The two-component systems PhoP/PhoQ and PmrA/PmrB, or the RcsA/RcsB/RcsC system alone allow expression of genes involved in L-Ara4N production (<italic>arn</italic> and <italic>ugd</italic>) or colanic acid biosynthesis (<italic>cps</italic> operon and <italic>ugd</italic>), respectively. In both situations, phosphorylation of Ugd by Wzc and/or Etk influences UDP-glucuronic acid production and consequently the two phenotypes. Since, Ugd is involved in M<sub>LPS</sub> and Group 4 capsule synthesis, it is assumed that Ugd phosphorylation could also influence their production (boxed question mark symbols).

It has already been demonstrated that the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of BY-kinases is involved in the biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharides in various bacteria and more precisely in the assembly or the export of the nascent polysaccharide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Obadia1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Wugeditsch1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Nakar1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. The function of BY-kinases has been mainly studied by performing mutations in their catalytic site. Therefore, one might assume that, in addition to an effect due to the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation process of a BY-kinase itself, an effect due to the altered phosphorylation of a potential substrate might also influence the biosynthesis of the polysaccharide. Ugd, that is involved in the biosynthesis of the repeat unit of colanic acid, is in line with this idea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003053-g005">Fig. 5</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Stevenson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, colanic acid biosynthesis is controlled by phosphorylation at two levels: the assembly and export of the polyssacharide (Wzc phosphorylation) and the synthesis of the colanic acid repeat unit (Ugd phosphorylation). This analysis could be extended to other bacteria. For instance, Minic and co-workers have described the phosphorylation of the UDP-glycosyl-transferase EpsE, which is involved in the production of the expolysaccharide of <italic>Streptococcus thermophilus</italic>, by the BY-kinase EpsD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Minic1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In the particular case of <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12, the phosphorylation of Ugd could also have side effects on the production of other polysaccharidic compounds. A recent study has demonstrated that variation of polysaccharide chain length depends on the UDP-glucose (UDPG) concentration available in the bacterial cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Ventura1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. In this work, we did not observe such a variation of the colanic acid polymer length (data not shown) even though the UDPG/UDPGA ratio might vary in accordance with the Ugd phosphorylation level. Also, UDPGA is involved in the biosynthesis of certain Group 4 capsules (G4C) produced by some pathogenic strains of <italic>E.coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Goldhar1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. G4C are well-established virulence factors and require Etk to be secreted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Peleg1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Ilan1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Accordingly, Etk-mediated phosphorylation of Ugd could influence the production of G4C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003053-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Similarly, Meredith and co-workers have reported that colanic acid repeats could modify the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12, forming thus a novel LPS glycoform henceforth called M<sub>LPS</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Meredith1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. The biosynthesis of M<sub>LPS</sub> could also be affected by phosphorylation of Ugd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003053-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Therefore, tyrosine phosphorylation of Ugd, and more generally of enzymes involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis, could provide keys to understand the biosynthesis of polysaccharide which might be far more complex than presently believed.</p><p>We also demonstrated that Etk-mediated phosphorylation of Ugd is connected with <italic>E. coli</italic> resistance to polymyxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003053-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). The <italic>etk</italic> gene is located in the <italic>ymc</italic> operon which is thought not to be expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 strain grown in LB medium, but only in pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Peleg1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, an insertion sequence <italic>IS1</italic> is found in the promoter of the <italic>ymc</italic> operon in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 but not in pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> strains. Therefore, our results raise the question of the regulation of <italic>etk</italic> expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12. We have previously shown that an <italic>etk</italic>-deficient strain of <italic>E. coli</italic> is unable to resist to polymyxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Lacour1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. This finding has recently been confirmed by a report indicating that the kinase activity of Etk is required <italic>per se</italic> for polymyxin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Lee1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, an <italic>etk</italic> knock-out mutant of an <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 strain has been reported to be altered in its heat shock response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Klein1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. These observations demonstrate that <italic>etk</italic> is expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 in spite of the <italic>IS1</italic> sequence, at least under some particular growth conditions. No data have been reported concerning the expression of the <italic>ymc</italic> operon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003053-g005">Fig. 5</xref>) but, as <italic>etk</italic> is the last gene of this operon, one might suggest that a cryptic promoter could be involved in <italic>etk</italic> specific expression. More likely, it could be speculated that the <italic>IS</italic>1 insertion could have a positive transcriptional effect under particular conditions. For example, genomic transposition within the regulatory locus <italic>bglR</italic> constitutes the major class of activating mutations that enable transcription of the <italic>bgl</italic> operon, which is silent in wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> strains under laboratory conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Moorthy1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Colanic acid synthesis or polymyxin resistance depend each on two distinct sets of proteins, that include respectively Wzc or Etk, and that are synthesized under specific conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003053-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Beside the influence of Ugd phosphorylation, one cannot preclude that other events would affect those biological processes. To illustrate this, it has been shown that Wzc expression does not complement polymyxin resistance of an <italic>etk</italic>-deficient strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Lacour1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, Wzc proteins from the <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 and K30 strains are also not interchangeable because of specific interactions between each Wzc proteins and their cognate capsule assembly complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Reid1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we assume that Wzc and Etk themselves are not likely only crucial in Ugd phosphorylation, but also in establishing interactions with other proteins involved in colanic acid synthesis and polymyxin resistance. Another possibility is that Etk and Wzc would likely phosphorylate other proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Macek1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, one cannot exclude that Wzc and/or Etk would specifically phosphorylate other endogenous proteins involved in colanic acid production or polymyxin resistance. For instance, WcaJ protein is involved in colanic acid synthesis in <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Stevenson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> and its homolog in <italic>S. thermophilus</italic>, EpsE, is phosphorylated on tyrosine by the BY-kinase EpsD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003053-Minic1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, Wzc-mediated phosphorylation of WcaJ would also influence colanic acid synthesis.</p><p>One can speculate that certain environments would induce simultaneous both expression of colanic acid and polymyxin resistance. At this moment, some factors could also participate in determining whether colanic acid or polymyxin resistance is expressed.
