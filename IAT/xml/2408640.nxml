As a result of these properties, adult stem cells provide a continuous supply of differentiated cells to their tissue compartments, which is particularly important for homeostatic control in adult tissues. It has been hypothesized that the capacity of stem cells to maintain tissue homeostasis functionally declines with age, and that this decline may be responsible for many of the biological phenotypes associated with aging (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Van Zant &#x00026; Liang, 2003</xref>). There is also a well-accepted hypothesis that aging creates conditions conducive to cancer development (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bell &#x00026; Van Zant, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Balducci &#x00026; Ershler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Krtolica, 2005</xref>). Therefore, an increased understanding of the age-related changes in stem cell populations should provide a platform for therapeutic applications to target age-related diseases. However, little is known about age-associated changes in adult stem cell populations.</p><p>The intestine is an excellent model system for the study of stem cell biology. Vertebrate and invertebrate intestines show marked similarities in terms of their development, cellular make-up and genetic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Stainier, 2005</xref>). A recent study showed that proliferating progenitor cells reside within the midgut epithelium of adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>, similar to what has been observed in the vertebrate intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Micchelli &#x00026; Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Ohlstein &#x00026; Spradling, 2006</xref>). Adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut cells can be separated into intestinal stem cells (ISCs), enteroblasts, enteroendocrine cells and enterocytes with specific markers. <italic>Escargot</italic>(<italic>esg</italic>), a transcription factor that belongs to the conserved Snail/Slug family, marks ISCs and enteroblasts within the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Micchelli &#x00026; Perrimon, 2006</xref>). Prospero marks all known enteroendocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Micchelli &#x00026; Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Ohlstein &#x00026; Spradling, 2006</xref>). It was shown recently that ISCs could be identified by the expression of Delta, a ligand for the Notch receptor, and that the fates of ISC daughter cells are specified via differential Notch signaling with low or high levels of cytoplasmic Delta in ISCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Ohlstein &#x00026; Spradling, 2007</xref>). Therefore, <italic>Drosophila</italic> has emerged as a powerful model system for the elucidation of fundamental cellular pathways relevant to both intestinal stem cell biology and to aging.</p><p>Based on numerous studies involving humans and a variety of animal models, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are believed to contribute significantly to the aging process (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Dr&#x000f6;ge, 2003</xref>). Over time, the tissue environment accumulates cells that have undergone cellular senescence; these senescent cells secrete factors that may disrupt tissue architecture and stimulate neighboring cells to proliferate, thereby establishing a pro-oncogenic microenviroment (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Krtolica &#x00026; Campisi, 2002</xref>). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was initially identified as a tumor-secreted vascular permeability factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Lobb <italic>et al</italic>., 1985</xref>). Since its discovery, overwhelming evidence has accumulated to support the role of VEGF as a principal regulator of tumor-associated angiogenesis and as an activator of tumor proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in mammals (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Dvorak, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Hoeben <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that VEGF is expressed and secreted at low levels by most normal cells, whereas VEGF is constitutively and abundantly expressed by many human tumor cells, including colorectal carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Nakayama <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). The VEGF receptor flt-1 is located on intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Siafakas <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>); however, the functional role of VEGF in intestinal cells is not known. VEGF expression is affected by factors including hypoxia or nitric oxide, which can generate ROS (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Liu &#x00026; Simon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Kuwabara <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, three PDGF/VEGF homologues (PVF1, PVF2 and PVF3) and a single PDGF/VEGF receptor homologue (PVR) have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Cho <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). PVF1 was reported to guide border cell migration in the egg chamber of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">McDonald <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). PVF2 is expressed in the developing gut during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Cho <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), and is involved in hemocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Munier <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). PVF3 is necessary for the proper organization of the wing disc epithelium by regulating the apical assembly of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Rosin <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we investigated age-associated cellular changes in the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut. We observed age-related changes including an increase in the number of ISCs and a decrease in the number of differentiated enterocytes in the adult midgut. Furthermore, we determined that oxidative stress induced by paraquat treatment or loss of catalase function can induce phenotypic changes similar to those associated with aging. Finally, we demonstrated that these age- and oxidative stress-related phenotypes are correlated with increased PVF2 levels in the midgut, and that PVF2 function is required for the age- and oxidative stress-induced changes in midgut stem and progenitor cell populations. Our results provide insights into a novel PVF2-mediated mechanism for age-related modulation of intestinal stem populations and suggest that oxidative stress is likely to contribute significantly to age-related changes in intestinal stem cell biology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Age-related increases in the number of proliferating cells in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut</title><p>To investigate age-related changes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut, we first determined whether proliferative activity in the adult midgut is modulated with age. We compared the levels of DNA synthesis in the midguts of 12-, 40- and 60-day-old-flies using 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling. We observed a striking and consistent age-related increase in BrdU-labeled cells in the adult midguts of the wild-type flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which is important for G1-S phase progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Duronio &#x00026; O&#x02019;Farrell, 1994</xref>), functions as a marker for cell proliferation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Elias, 1997</xref>). In order to confirm the age-related increases in the proliferative activity of adult midgut cells, we evaluated the levels of PCNA mRNA in the midguts of 3-, 30- and 60-day-old wild-type flies. PCNA mRNA levels in the midgut of adult wild-type flies increased significantly with age (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). We used an anti-phospho-histone H3 antibody to detect only the proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Micchelli &#x00026; Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Ohlstein &#x00026; Spradling, 2006</xref>) among the ISCs and enteroblasts within the midgut of 3-, 30-, 45- and 60-day-old wild-type flies. Under these experimental conditions, we observed a significant increase in the number of phospho-histone H3-positive cells with age: 4.1 &#x000b1; 0.6 in 3-day-old flies, 7.4 &#x000b1; 0.7 in 30-day-old, 11.4 &#x000b1; 1.1 in 45-day-old and 12.8 &#x000b1; 1.1 in 60-day-old wild-type flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>; Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Table S1</xref>).

If stem cells undergo symmetric cell divisions to generate two daughter stem cells, the stem cell pool may expand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Dingli <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).

However, our analysis of <italic>esg</italic>-positive and Su(H)-positive cells demonstrated an age-related increase in the number of enteroblasts, indicating that asymmetric stem cell divisions in the midgut may also increase with age. We then determined whether the increase in enteroblasts led to an increase in the number of enteroendocrine cells or enterocytes. We found that the number of enteroendocrine cells in the midgut increased in an age-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2K</xref>; Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">Table S5</xref>), whereas the number of differentiated enterocytes with large nuclei decreased in an age-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2K</xref>; Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">Table S5</xref>).

Many studies have shown that intracellular ROS levels increase with age (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Dr&#x000f6;ge, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, ROS induces the activation of a variety of signaling cascades, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) pathways (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Torres &#x00026; Forman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Gloire <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), which contribute to tumorigenesis via their ability to induce cell proliferation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Esposito <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>).

These data suggest that <italic>Pvf2-lacZ</italic> is a useful specific marker of ISCs and enteroblasts of the adult midgut. To confirm that endogenous <italic>Pvf2</italic> is expressed specifically in ISCs and enteroblasts, anti-Pvf2 immunostaining will be required. Importantly, we observed that the levels of <italic>Pvf2</italic> mRNA in the adult fly midgut increased with age and in response to oxidative stress induced by paraquat treatment and when catalase function was compromised in <italic>Cat<sup>n1</sup></italic> mutant flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). These results provide support for a previous report describing an increase in VEGF production in response to increased ROS levels in human cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). At present, our data showing an age-related increase in the number of <italic>Pvf2-lacZ</italic>-positive cells in the midgut indicated that an age- or oxidative stress-related increase in PVF2 levels in the midgut may be due primarily to an increase in the number of PVF2-producing cells in the midgut. Therefore, whether <italic>Pvf2</italic> mRNA level per the ISC or enteroblast is regulated at transcriptional level is unclear.</p><p>Herein, we discovered that PVF2 is a critical factor involved in age- and oxidative stress-related changes in the number and activity of stem and progenitor cells in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut. We first determined that the adult fly midgut failed to exhibit age- and oxidative stress-related increases in BrdU-labeled cells, PCNA expression and the number of proliferating cells when PVF2 function was inhibited in ISCs and enteroblasts that expressed either the <italic>Pvf2<sup>c06947</sup></italic> mutant allele or a transgene for PVF2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A-a</xref>; Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">S6</xref>). In addition, we showed that PVF2 or PVR overexpression driven by <italic>esg-GAL4</italic> in ISCs and enteroblasts led to an increase in BrdU-labeled cells, increased PCNA expression and an increase in the number of proliferating cells in the adult midgut, in a manner similar to that associated with aging and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A-b</xref>; Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figs S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S7</xref>). These data suggested that PVF2 levels played a significant role in the regulation of cell proliferation in the midgut. We demonstrated that PVF2 levels regulated the number of ISCs via an increase in the number of Delta-positive cells by comparing the ratios of <italic>esg</italic>-positive/Delta-positive cells and Delta-positive/Su(H)-positive cells in flies that overexpressed PVF2 or PVR in ISCs and enteroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Table S3</xref>). We showed that PVF2 or PVR overexpression led to a decrease in the number of differentiated enterocytes with large nuclei in the adult midgut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6C-k</xref>; Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">Table S5</xref>); this result indicated that PVF2 levels can impact enterocyte differentiation. In mammals, VEGF has been shown to regulate hematopoietic stem cell proliferation via an autocrine loop mechanism (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Gerber &#x00026; Ferrara, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Fragoso <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). The VEGF receptor flt-1 is expressed on intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Siafakas <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>); however, the role of VEGF in intestinal cells is not known. Our data suggest a role for VEGF/VEGFR signaling in the differentiation of enterocytes.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the effect of aging on the number and activity of stem and progenitor cells in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut. We demonstrated that age-related changes in the number and activity of stem and progenitor cells of the adult midgut can be mimicked by oxidative stress and that the level of PVF2, a PDGF/VEGF-like growth factor, is a critical modulator of the number and activity of stem and progenitor cells in the fly midgut, indicating a novel role for PVF2/PVR signaling. Furthermore, we established <italic>Pvf2-lacZ</italic> transgenic flies that will be useful in future studies aimed at the identification of the upstream or downstream signaling pathways inherent to the regulation of ISC self-renewal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>To construct the plasmid pPvf2-lacZ, the promoter region of the <italic>Pvf2</italic> gene was PCR-cloned with <italic>Drosophila</italic> genomic DNA.
