This tandem AUG arrangement is conserved between humans and the mouse and is unique among the genes of the classical PTPs. Until now it was assumed that the principal open reading frame (ORF) starts at AUG<sub>356</sub>. Our experiments showed that: (i) translation of the mRNA synthesized under the <italic>PTPRJ</italic> promoter starts predominantly at AUG<sub>191</sub>, leading to the generation of a 55 amino acid sequence preceding the signal peptide; (ii) the longer form is being likewise correctly processed into mature PTPRJ; (iii) the translation of the region between AUG<sub>191</sub> and AUG<sub>356</sub> inhibits the overall expression, a feature which depends on the sequence of the encoded peptide. Specifically, a sequence of 13 amino acids containing multiple arginine residues (RRTGWRRRRRRRR) confers the inhibition. In the absence of uORF these previously unrecognized characteristics of the 5&#x02032;-end of the mRNA present a novel mechanism to suppress, and potentially to regulate translation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>It has been noted that a wide variety of proteins, including some protein kinases, growth factors, oncogenes, receptors and transcription factors are expressed from messengers, which are poorly translated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The mRNAs of these proteins are characterized by a long 5&#x02032; leader (5&#x02032;UTR) with high GC content, potentially strong secondary structure and the presence of short upstream open reading frames (uORFs). Recent genome wide analyses have revealed that uAUGs and uORFs are quite common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Generally the translation of these mRNAs follows the standard route for eukaryotes. The 43S scanning complex, composed of the 40S ribosomal subunit, Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> and translation initiation factors, is attached to the m<sup>7</sup>G cap at the 5&#x02032;-end of the mRNA. Unwinding the regions with secondary structure, the scanning proceeds towards the 3&#x02032;-end, and when an AUG triplet in a favorable context is encountered, the 60S ribosomal subunit is recruited and translation initiates. The presence of an uORF impairs the translation of the principal reading frame as the ribosomes need to reinitiate at the downstream AUG. Alternatively, the sequence environment of the upstream AUG (uAUG) may diverge from the one which is optimal for recognition by the scanning complex [A/G]CCaugG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In this case, some of the 40S subunits will start translation at the uAUG, while others will continue scanning (&#x02018;leaky scanning&#x02019;).</p><p>It is generally assumed that the role of the uORF is to secure low levels of expression of proteins which are harmful to the cell when abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7">5&#x02013;7</xref>). In addition, regulatory functions of uORFs have also been identified, for example for the CAAT enhancer binding proteins alpha and beta and for the SCL transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>The receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase J (PTPRJ, also designated DEP-1, CD148), a candidate tumor suppressor protein with potent anti-proliferative and anti-migratory activity, is differently expressed in different cell types and at different cell densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). By dephosphorylating yet only partially characterized cellular substrates it can interfere with signal transduction downstream of several growth factor receptors, and exerts anti-transforming activity in cancer cell lines of different origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14 B15 B16 B17 B18 B19">12&#x02013;19</xref>). Therefore regulation of PTPRJ expression may represent an important level of controlling cellular tyrosine phosphorylation, and deregulation of expression may contribute to carcinogenesis. Although important, the basic mechanisms of <italic>PTPRJ</italic> expression regulation have not been explored until now.</p><p>Some of the structural features of the mRNAs discussed above are shared by the mRNA of <italic>PTPRJ</italic>, in particular a long, GC rich 5&#x02032; leader (GC 82%). However, this region contains three AUGs, all of which are in the reading frame of the main protein, with no intervening stop codons.</p><p>Experiments addressing the mechanisms of <italic>PTPRJ</italic> expression regulation showed that translation of the mRNA starts predominantly at AUG<sub>191</sub>, 55 codons upstream of the AUG<sub>356</sub>, the start of the signal peptide. We discovered properties of the 5&#x02032; leader, which have hitherto not been described in other genes. In the tandem arrangement of the in-frame AUGs, the codons between them are poorly translated, resulting in lower expression. These results uncover a previously unrecognized mechanism of suppressing and potentially regulating translation, which may be relevant not only to PTPRJ.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Firefly luciferase reporter constructs</title><sec><title>Reporter constructs with ATG<sub>Luc</sub> present. &#x02018;In-frame&#x02019; (InF) and &#x02018;Out-of-frame&#x02019; (OutF) constructs</title><p>The genomic region of human <italic>PTPRJ</italic> containing the putative promoter and the 5&#x02032; leader was amplified from BAC DNA (details in Supplementary Data and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn391/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>).

Comparison of the first exon of the human <italic>PTPRJ</italic> and its mouse homolog (NM_008982) revealed that they share a common pattern of organization and several remarkable similarities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B). First, the length of both exons is almost the same (451 nt human, mouse 442 nt); they code for the 5&#x02032; leader of the mRNA, and for 32 amino acids of the predicted signal peptide. Second, both exons contain three tandem AUGs in one reading frame, with no intervening stop codons. The relative position and the context of the AUGs are also conserved (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Third, in case translation starts at AUG<sub>14</sub> (+14 to +16), or at AUG<sub>191</sub> (+191 to +193), the conservation of the amino acid sequence is also high (77% identity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). The high degree of conservation in the <italic>PTPRJ</italic> 5&#x02032; leader, notably the conservation of the position of AUGs, their context and the encoded amino acids suggested that this arrangement might be of functional importance (for conservation at nucleotide sequence level, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn391/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Pattern of organization of the first exon of the <italic>PTPRJ</italic> gene (<bold>A</bold>) in humans (NM_002843) and (<bold>B</bold>) in the mouse (NM_008982).

For this we compared the activity of various constructs with different arrangement of ATG<sub>14</sub>, ATG<sub>191</sub> and ATG<italic><sub>Luc</sub></italic> (the ATG of the firefly luciferase).

The sizes of the luciferase bands corresponded to one product synthesized from AUG<sub>Luc</sub> (63 kDa), and another synthesized from AUG<sub>191</sub> (69 kDa). This directly indicates that AUG<sub>191</sub> initiates translation and that scanning is leaky. If AUG<sub>191</sub> was not in tandem with AUG<italic><sub>Luc</sub></italic> only the synthesis of firefly luciferase with a size of 63 kDa was supported. AUG<sub>14</sub> appeared to be largely inactive in these constructs, since a protein product of 76 kDa, corresponding to translation starting at AUG<sub>14</sub> could not be detected.</p><p>Comparison of the amounts of protein with low and higher molecular mass, shows prevalence of the 63 kDa products (starting presumably at ATG<italic><sub>Luc</sub></italic>). This is in discrepancy with results presented on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, which indicated robust translation starting upstream of ATG<italic><sub>Luc</sub></italic>. We considered that low abundance of the form with higher molecular mass might be caused by differential immunoprecipitation and/or by high susceptibility to protease degradation of the protruding N-tail of the extended protein. This seemed to be indeed the case, as further analysis of luciferase translation products directly in cell lysates revealed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C).</p><p>To estimate the relative ability of each AUG codon in the <italic>PTPRJ</italic> mRNA to sustain translation, we designed a fusion construct, containing all three 5&#x02032;-end ATGs. This construct contained (from 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032;) the <italic>PTPRJ</italic> core promoter (&#x02212;323 to &#x02212;1), the 5&#x02032; leader (+1 to +355), and the sequence coding for the first five amino acids of the signal peptide (+356 to +370). This sequence was fused to the sequence of the firefly luciferase (codons 2&#x02013;550) (see Materials and Methods section). Mutations were introduced to disrupt two AUGs at a time, leaving one AUG intact, and the constructs were subjected to expression analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, translation can start at any of the AUG codons, albeit with different efficiency. Translation from AUG<sub>14</sub> was the weakest, apparently due to its poor sequence context (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), and the short distance from the m<sup>7</sup>G cap. The potential of AUG<sub>191</sub> or AUG<sub>356</sub> to drive expression of reporter luciferase seems approximately equal. Our further results showed that translation starting at AUG<sub>191</sub> is attenuated. The lack of marked difference in expression starting from AUG<sub>191</sub> or AUG<sub>356</sub>, implies that AUG<sub>356</sub> is in a weaker sequence context; more ribosomes start at AUG<sub>191</sub>, but the overall translation is not higher. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Contribution of the different AUGs to the activity of reporter constructs containing the <italic>PTPRJ</italic> promoter and the 5&#x02032; leader, fused to the firefly luciferase.

An N-end signal peptide of 35 amino acids has been predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).

The results again showed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) that both AUG<sub>191</sub> and AUG<sub>356</sub> have the capacity to support translation. The mobility of PTPRJ synthesized from AUG<sub>191</sub> or from AUG<sub>356</sub> is the same, showing a similar degree of glycosylation. The protein bands are fairly broad, and bands of lesser size are also detectable, reflecting the different extent of glycosylation of protein molecules present in the cell. Apparently the presence at synthesis of additional 55 amino acids at the N-end does not prevent correct processing of PTPRJ, which involves binding of the signal peptide to the recognition particle, the subsequent correct translocation into the ER lumen, cleavage of the signal peptide, and glycosylation. It was of interest to know whether the specific sequence of the additional amino acids at the N-end of PTPRJ may play a role in the process of signal recognition. To test this we designed an expression construct with two frame-shift mutations (plus and minus) in the region between AUG<sub>191</sub> and AUG<sub>356</sub>. These combined mutations change the amino-acid sequence upstream of AUG<sub>356</sub>, but leave the reading frame for the signal peptide and the mature PTPRJ protein intact. Judging from mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B), processing and protein glycosylation of PTPRJ were not severely affected by this manipulation.

For this we again introduced single nucleotide frame-shift mutations (one insertion or one deletion) positioned in the region between AUG<sub>191</sub> and AUG<sub>356</sub>. These frame-shift mutation deviate the translation starting at AUG<sub>191</sub> into a reading frame, different from that of the luciferase. In this case, it is reasonable to assume that luciferase can be produced only by initiation of translation at AUG<sub>356</sub> (resulting from leaky scanning at AUG<sub>191</sub>). Both frame-shift mutations caused a severe reduction of reporter activity, indicating that more than two-third of the scanning complexes start translation at AUG<sub>191</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).

The constructs downstream of the CMV promoter contained <italic>PTPRJ</italic> sequences from +171 to +370, which encode ATG<sub>191</sub>, the downstream region (wild type or modified), ATG<sub>356</sub>, plus the codons of the next 4 amino acids of PTPRJ, fused to the codons of the firefly luciferase for amino acids 2&#x02013;550 (see Materials and Methods section). In these reporters the luciferase mRNA is transcribed from the strong cytomegalovirus promoter, however, translation is dependent on the tandem AUG<sub>191</sub> and AUG<sub>356</sub> (and the region between them). We compared the activity of several constructs: the wild-type construct, a construct with one frame-shift mutation, a construct in which the sequence of 47 amino acids was altered by introducing two point mutations, of which the first one altered, and the second one restored the reading frame, and a construct in which these 47 amino acids were deleted (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn391/DC1">Supplementary Figure 4</ext-link>). As expected, the activity of the construct with one frame-shift mutation was low, again demonstrating that translation initiation starts predominantly at AUG<sub>191</sub>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, the reporter activity increased 2&#x02013;3-fold when the amino acid sequence of the region between AUG<sub>191</sub> and AUG<sub>356</sub> was altered or deleted. This indicated that translation of the codons following AUG<sub>191</sub> reduces the overall expression of the reporter. The similar level of expression of these two constructs (3 and 5) shows additionally that the elimination of the region with potentially strong secondary structure has no great effect on translation. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Activity of reporter firefly luciferase constructs driven by the CMV promoter.

However, after immunoprecipitation the ratio of products is changed, disfavoring the form with higher molecular mass. Presumably either immunoprecipitation of this form is inefficient, or during immunoprecipitation degradation of the additional amino acids takes place (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B).</p><p>We also checked the levels of the construct mRNAs in the cell.

Thus, the increase in activity by altering the amino-acid sequence can be attributed solely to changes in translation efficiency, and not to accompanying changes in mRNA synthesis or stability.</p><p>One possibility for the increase in reporter activity would be the presence of rare codons in the reading frame, which were eliminated by the frame-shift. Examples of translation inhibition by the occurrence of rare codons have been reported for viral genes, expressed in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Inspection of the PTPRJ sequence from +191 to +356 showed a marked codon bias (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn391/DC1">Supplementary Figure 4</ext-link>). Out of 55 codons, 14 codons are rare (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/">http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/</ext-link>). To test the possible relevance of rare codons for inefficient translation, we used a reporter with unchanged amino acids, but the nucleotides between ATG<sub>191</sub> and ATG<sub>356</sub> were replaced with synthetic DNA encoding the same amino acids but with codons optimized for human expression (see Materials and Methods section, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn391/DC1">Supplementary Figure 4</ext-link>). At the same time the overall secondary structure of the region was left largely unchanged (for the 1&#x02013;284 nt of the mRNA transcribed from the pcDNA3 constructs dG = &#x02212;112.83 for the wild type and dG = &#x02212;104.01 for the mRNA with optimized codons). The results showed, however, that &#x02018;optimizing&#x02019; the codons by replacing the rare codons leads only to modest increase in reporter activity (note the similarity in reporter expression of constructs 1 and 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A).</p><p>Another possible reason for inefficient translation could be the properties of the nascent peptide itself. The activity of the reporter construct encoding an altered sequence of a stretch of 47 amino acids was clearly elevated (compare activity of constructs 1 and 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). Deletion of these amino acids also resulted in enhanced luciferase expression (construct 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). It was of importance to know which region of the nascent 55 amino-acid peptide would contribute specifically to the translation attenuation. To narrow this region, we prepared a construct encoding only the 26 N-terminal amino acids of the presumably inhibitory peptide (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn391/DC1">Supplementary Figure 5</ext-link>). This construct showed low luciferase reporter activity similar to that of the construct containing the entire 55 amino-acid sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). This indicated that the down-modulation is a property of the N-terminal part of the sequence encoded downstream of AUG<sub>191</sub>.</p><p>To define more precisely the amino-acid sequence responsible for translation attenuation we changed the sequence of 10 amino acids, starting with codon 4 and preceding the arginine stretch. This modification did not lead to significant increase in luciferase expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn391/DC1">Supplementary Figure 5</ext-link>). However, changing the codons from 4 through 26, again by introducing two frame-shift mutations (plus and minus) resulted in an increase of reporter activity as it was observed with the altered full-length 55 amino-acid sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, construct 4 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, construct 3).</p><p>These results indicate that translation attenuation is caused primarily by only 13 amino acids, which include a homopolymer stretch of eight arginines, encoded by codons 19&#x02013;26.</p><p>Taken together, the use of AUG<sub>191</sub> results in inefficient translation of the PTPRJ mRNA.

To test for possible regulation we checked the expression of some of our reporter constructs in several cell lines, and at different cell densities. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, luciferase expression in the different cell types was rather different, with low expression in HT29 cells, intermediate expression in HeLa cells, and high expression in HEK293 and HCT116 cells. It should be emphasized that the increased expression in some cell lines cannot be explained by differential promoter activity as the reporter firefly luciferase and the control <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase in these experiments are expressed under the same CMV promoter. However, the ratios of expression from wild type and mutated reporter constructs were not altered significantly. Therefore, while our data suggest differences in efficiency of initiation of translation at AUG<sub>191</sub> in the different cell lines, the translation attenuation by the sequence encoded between AUG<sub>191</sub> and AUG<sub>356</sub> can be observed in all of them, indicating the generality of this mechanism for down-regulation. Since PTPRJ expression is elevated in some cell lines at high culture densities, we also explored the possibility that changes in translation efficiency would contribute to this phenomenon. These experiments revealed that, while reporter activity was clearly increased in cell cultures at high density, the attenuation of translation from AUG<sub>191</sub> is still apparent in dense cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn391/DC1">Supplementary Figure 7</ext-link>). This finding indicates that upregulation of PTPRJ expression in dense cells is not caused by a release from attenuated translation. <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Translational repression by the PTPRJ 5&#x02032; leader sequence in different cell lines.

Therefore, we explored the putative regulatory importance of this arrangement. It should be noted that many of the 5&#x02032;UTRs of the human PTPs contain uORFs with yet unexplored relevance for expression regulation. However none of them contains a similar tandem AUG arrangement. Only in case of hCD45/PTPRC an in-frame upstream AUG was detected, which was, however, only two codons apart from the proposed translation start site (for details, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn391/DC1">Supplementary Tables 1</ext-link> and 2). Nevertheless, the tandem AUG arrangement is unlikely to be unique to <italic>PTPRJ</italic>. A recent search of available cDNA human and mouse sequences has revealed that some of the conserved AUG codons in the 5&#x02032; leader are not followed by stop codons and are in the same reading frame as the main protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The relevance of such tandem arrangements has, however, to the best of our knowledge not yet been studied.</p><p>Our experiments showed that AUG<sub>191</sub> is the preferred starting codon in the context of the endogenous promoter. Still, apparently not all ribosomes seem to recognize it (leaky scanning). The least active starting codon is AUG<sub>14</sub> presumably due to its proximity to the m<sup>7</sup>G cap and its unfavorable context (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>AUG<sub>191</sub> will direct the synthesis of the same PTPRJ mature protein of 1302 amino acids, but the N-end of (Pro-) PTPRJ is supposed to be 55 amino acids longer than the previously predicted precursor. This has apparently no effect on the functioning of the PTPRJ as our results showed that the N-end extended protein is glycosylated in the same way as the PTPRJ, which starts directly with a signal peptide of 35 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Apparently, in each form the N-end region of the protein is recognized by the signal recognition particle, cleaved by the signal peptide peptidases, the mature protein being correctly glycosylated. Moreover, our results indicate that the exact sequence of the additional 55 amino acids is not a precondition for the protein maturation. These results are in agreement with previous data showing that the signal peptide retains its function when situated downstream of the N-end of a protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The region between AUG<sub>191</sub> and AUG<sub>356</sub> is difficult to translate</title><p>The analysis of the activity of the various reporter constructs indicated that the region downstream of AUG<sub>191</sub> is not efficiently translated, and translation of the 55 codons at the N-end seems to be a rate-limiting step in the overall protein expression. The alteration of 47 codons of the same region by shifting and restoring the reading frame resulted in marked increase in reporter activity. Importantly, this effect on translation does not depend on the promoter. Essentially the same results were obtained when transcription was driven not by the endogenous <italic>PTPRJ</italic> promoter, but by the strong cytomegalovirus promoter. Only a modest increase in the expression was observed when the wild-type sequence was replaced by a synthetic fragment encoding the same amino acids, but with &#x02018;optimized&#x02019; codons. This suggests that the presence of rare codons is not the primary reason for the observed translation inhibition. Moreover, our results showed that the attenuation of translation depends more specifically on 13 amino acids at the N-end of the protein. Based on these findings we propose that the translation inhibition is due to the sequence of the nascent peptide. Examples of translation regulation through interaction between the nascent peptides and the ribosome are well known for prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The translation inhibition exerted in <italic>cis</italic>- by some uORF in eukaryotes depends also on their amino-acid sequence. In these cases, according to the accepted model, the nascent uORF encoded peptide interacts with the ribosome and prevents its release at the uORF termination codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In the mRNA of the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor, the uORF encodes a peptide which supposedly interacts with the messenger, and thereby inhibits translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). For mammalian genes, to the best of our knowledge, observations of regulatory peptides encoded by domains within the main coding sequence have not yet been reported. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, however, a stretch of 11&#x02013;13 amino-acid residues, located 80 residues from the N-terminus of the cystathionine gamma-synthetase <italic>CGS1</italic> gene, causes a nascent peptide-mediated translation elongation arrest most likely at the step of ribosome translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>We do not know yet the exact mechanism by which the nascent stretch of 13 amino acids encoded by the <italic>PTPRJ</italic> 5&#x02032; leader causes translational attenuation. Several mechanisms are feasible. One is the interaction of the nascent residues with the ribosome, interfering either with some of the elongation steps (the peptidyl transfer and the translocation are candidates) or with the exit of the polypeptide from the ribosome through the exit tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30 B31 B32">30&#x02013;32</xref>). Another possibility is an elongation arrest by interaction of the nascent chain with mRNA as proposed for the peptide synthesized by the uORF of the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor mRNA. It is relevant to note that the only general feature of the nascent peptides interacting with the ribosome is that they are not acidic, some being highly basic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The amino acids which are involved in translation attenuation of <italic>PTPRJ</italic> comprise a conserved stretch of 13 residues (RRTGWRRRRRRRR) containing 10 Arg residues. It is tempting to speculate that the properties of this stretch of amino acids are important for inefficient translation by binding to the ribosome or the mRNA. The inhibiting peptide of the &#x003b2;2 adrenergic receptor mRNA has revealed the critical role of three consecutive arginine residues for inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> the translation of regions particularly rich in arginine is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Still another reason for impeded translation of the primary ORF could be the existence of significant ribosome frameshifting, which might possibly take place along sequences between AUG<sub>191</sub> and AUG<sub>356</sub> (for examples of +1 and &#x02212;1 frameshifting in eukaryotes see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://recode.genetics.utah.edu/">http://recode.genetics.utah.edu/</ext-link>).</p><p>Attenuating the translation of PTPRJ may be important to maintain the cellular levels of a critical regulatory and possibly harmful protein low. Potentially, it could also present the basis for regulation, assuming that the translation constraint can be overcome in certain differentiation states or under certain conditions of cell stimulation. While our experiments showed a marked cell specific degree of expression of the reporter constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>), they indicated that attenuation of translation via the described mechanism operates in a similar manner in all analyzed cell lines. Also, we did not yet observe differences in the extent of translational repression at different cell densities, or in cells stimulated with a variety of growth factors or cytokines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn391/DC1">Supplementary Figure 7</ext-link>, and R. Godfrey, unpublished data). Further work is required to address the possibility that expression can be modulated by a mechanism involving the tandem AUGs and the translational repression by the specified stretch of amino acids. Alternatively, the described inhibition of translation may be constitutive and merely serve to achieve low levels of PTPRJ protein, thereby permitting a more effective expression control by other mechanisms, such as transcriptional activation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn391/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkn391_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkn391_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by grants to F.D.B. from the DFG SFB604 (A1), BMBF FKZ 01EA0103, DFG Bo 1043/7-1, and the EC training network MRTN-CT-2006-035830.
