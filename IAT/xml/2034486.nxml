RfaH is a cellular elongation factor that acts as a polarity suppressor by increasing RNA polymerase (RNAP) processivity. In this work, we provide evidence that RfaH acts by reducing transcriptional pausing at certain positions rather than by accelerating RNAP at all sites. We show that &#x02018;fast&#x02019; RNAP variants are characterized by pause-free RNA chain elongation and are resistant to RfaH action. Similarly, the wild-type RNAP is insensitive to RfaH in the absence of pauses. In contrast, those enzymes that may be prone to falling into a paused state are hypersensitive to RfaH. RfaH inhibits pyrophosphorolysis of the nascent RNA and reduces the apparent Michaelis&#x02013;Menten constant for nucleotides, suggesting that it stabilizes the post-translocated, active RNAP state. Given that the RfaH-binding site is located 75 &#x000c5; away from the RNAP catalytic center, these results strongly indicate that RfaH acts allosterically. We argue that despite the apparent differences in the nucleic acid targets, the time of recruitment and the binding sites on RNAP, unrelated antiterminators (such as RfaH and <bold>&#x003bb;</bold>Q) utilize common strategies during both recruitment and anti-pausing modification of the transcription complex.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RNAP is an obligatory processive enzyme that must complete synthesis of the entire RNA chain since the transcripts that are released prematurely cannot re-enter transcription cycle. In bacteria, even in the absence of the tightly condensed chromatin, RNAP still encounters many roadblocks that either stall it temporarily or trigger RNA release. DNA-bound proteins, DNA lesions and various nucleic acid signals that induce pausing, arrest and termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) can hinder RNAP progression along the template. Even at saturating substrate concentrations <italic>in vitro</italic>, RNAP is moving in leaps, with its fast movement along the template punctuated by pauses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Pausing plays numerous regulatory roles, is an obligatory step in termination pathways, and likely controls the overall rate of RNA chain elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>RNAP is capable of making very long RNA chains (30 000 nt long in bacteria) but its rate is rather modest compared to DNA replicases: in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, elongating RNAP (a complex of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2;&#x003b2;&#x02032;&#x003c9; subunits) moves at 20&#x02013;90 nt/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) whereas the replication fork advances 1000 nt/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). This relatively inefficient operation of RNAP does not represent the limit of its catalytic potential since &#x02018;fast&#x02019; substitutions in the &#x003b2; and &#x003b2;&#x02032; subunits that significantly increase its overall rate <italic>in vitro</italic> have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9 B10">6&#x02013;10</xref>). An attractive explanation rests on an assumption that the relatively slow rate of transcription is necessary for efficient regulation of gene expression where it provides for timely recruitment of, and response to regulatory factors, attenuation control, as well as determines folding pathways of the nascent RNA. Moreover, in bacteria transcription and translation are coupled, imposing additional restrictions on the speed that RNAP can attain without placing the nascent RNA in danger of release by Rho, which terminates the untranslated messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In other words, a catalytically perfect RNAP would leave little room for regulation and likely uncouple transcription and translation, while much slower RNAP would not be nimble enough to keep up with sustaining the RNA pool as it adapts to changing environmental and physiological conditions. Indeed, while different &#x02018;fast&#x02019; and &#x02018;slow&#x02019; viable alleles of RNAP have been isolated, they alter the apparent elongation rate <italic>in vitro</italic> by less than 3- to 5-fold in each direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>), whereas mutations coding for much faster or slower enzyme variants are lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15">13&#x02013;15</xref>).</p><p>As substitutions that constitutively change the overall rate of RNA chain elongation appear to have a negative impact on fitness and are being removed by natural selection, the stage is set for transient alteration of RNAP kinetic properties by regulatory proteins. A subset of such factors (known as antiterminators) reduces pausing and termination (in other words, confers a fast phenotype) thereby helping RNAP transcribe long operons. These proteins use different nucleic acid targets during recruitment: &#x003bb;N binds the nascent RNA structure, &#x003bb;Q is recruited to the double-stranded DNA near the promoter, RfaH is recruited to the single-stranded non-template (NT) DNA strand during elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18 B19">16&#x02013;19</xref>). The sites on RNAP to which these proteins bind are likely also distinct: we have recently concluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) that RfaH binds to the &#x003b2;&#x02032;-subunit clamp helices (&#x003b2;&#x02032; CH), whereas the target sites for &#x003bb; regulators are still unknown but are thought to be quite different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Yet all antiterminators share the ability to accelerate RNAP, suggesting that they induce similar changes in the transcription elongation complex (TEC).</p><p>To date, the changes that lead to the &#x02018;antitermination&#x02019; modification of the RNAP have not been characterized in detail, and the molecular mechanism(s) by which elongation factors or substitutions in RNAP make the enzyme faster or slower is not known: they may control nucleotide addition at every template position by affecting the common rate-limiting step (which has not been elucidated for RNAP), or influence the TEC isomerization into off-pathway states at pause and termination sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). We have proposed that at a pause site RNAP isomerizes into a state in which nucleotide addition is slowed due to transient changes in the active site architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), and from which different classes of pause and termination complexes arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). We further speculated that substitutions in RNAP may alter its propensity towards the isomerization into the slow state. In a fast RNAP, the productive alignment of the 3&#x02032; RNA end in the active site, and consequently nucleotide addition, is favored. In contrast, a slow RNAP is more likely to lose the 3&#x02032;end from the active site and enter a paused state, escape from which can be delayed by two orders of magnitude. Antiterminators may act in the same regulatory pathway, switching RNAP into the fast state. Slow, pause-prone enzymes should then be hypersensitive to modification by antiterminators, whereas fast RNAPs should appear resistant to further acceleration. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Unactivated intermediate mechanism. During rapid elongation (top horizontal arrows) RNAP active site (represented by two circles denoting the <italic>i</italic> and <italic>i</italic>&#x02212;1 subsites) is optimized for facile catalysis: the 3&#x02032; OH of the nascent RNA is perfectly positioned to accommodate the incoming substrate NTP. At some sites, the active site undergoes a rearrangement to yield an unactivated intermediate in which the nucleotide addition is slowed (paused state). The precise nature of this rearrangement is unknown; it may include the 3&#x02032; end fraying (as shown), slight changes in the position of the catalytic residues or Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion, etc. From the unactivated intermediate, RNAP can isomerize into more stable, long-lived paused states upon the hairpin formation (at class I sites) or backtracking (at class II sites), or into a termination complex. Substitutions in RNAP that confer &#x02018;fast&#x02019; and &#x02018;slow&#x02019; elongation phenotypes (such as &#x003b2;P560S,T563I and &#x003b2;Q513P, respectively) may affect isomerization into the unactivated intermediate by favoring different states of the RNAP active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm600f1"/></fig></p><p>To test this hypothesis, we have determined effects of the <italic>E. coli</italic> RfaH on RNA chain elongation by enzymes from an expanded panel of fast and slow RNAPs, including many previously uncharacterized kinetic variants. RfaH is recruited to the TEC at specific sites (called <italic>ops</italic>) and is required for expression of several long operons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Reports from several labs indicated that RfaH acts as an antiterminator both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), although the exact mechanism of its action remains elusive. RfaH structure and its binding site on the TEC are known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). RfaH increases the overall elongation rate <italic>in vitro</italic>, reduces pausing at mechanistically distinct regulatory sites (known as class I and II, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), and facilitates bypass of some terminators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Unlike other well-studied antiterminators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), RfaH does not require any accessory proteins (e.g. NusA or NusG), and its action is not dramatically affected by addition of the cellular extract. These features allow us to dissect RfaH effect on the TEC in a highly purified model system.</p><p>Our results indicate that RfaH acts primarily to reduce pausing: it fails to further accelerate the already fast mutants, as well as the wild-type RNAP transcribing under pause-free conditions, but is particularly effective with the enzymes that are prone to pausing because of amino acid changes or substrate deprivation. In contrast, RfaH cannot correct those slow phenotypes, which are due to the defects in the elementary catalytic steps rather than to the off-pathway events like pausing. We also show that the enzymes traditionally regarded as fast are better characterized as pause-resistant. We discuss our results within the framework of the current structural analysis of bacterial TECs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids used for protein purification</title><p>pIA238 encodes the wild-type <italic>rfaH</italic> ORF in pET28 (Novagen); the protein carries a His<sub>6</sub> tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). pIA777 is a derivative of pET36b(+) (Novagen) that encodes RfaH N-domain&#x02013;TEV&#x02013;C-domain&#x02013;[His<sub>6</sub>].

We used the rate of RNAP escape from the <italic>hisP</italic> site (in the same assay system as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B) to evaluate the post-recruitment effects of RfaH; RfaH also reduces the <italic>his</italic> pause efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) but this parameter is difficult to measure accurately, particularly with the slow RNAPs that pause at the upstream sites more prominently, and thus arrive at the <italic>hisP</italic> site asynchronously. We found that RfaH acted similarly on the wild-type enzyme and a variant with the &#x02018;wild-type&#x02019; overall elongation rate (&#x003b2;&#x02032;T786V) while failing to accelerate the fast enzymes (&#x003b2;H526Y/RpoB2, &#x003b2;D675A, &#x003b2;&#x02032;F773V, &#x003b2;&#x02032;&#x00394;SI3, and &#x003b2;P560S,T563I) to the same extent (the defects varied, though). The slow enzymes fell into two categories: four variants (&#x003b2;&#x02032;S793F, &#x003b2;&#x02032;Y795A, &#x003b2;Q513P, and &#x003b2;&#x02032;L672D,V673D) displayed augmented response, whereas two others (&#x003b2;S1105A and &#x003b2;M1107A)&#x02014;reduced response to RfaH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A).

However, there remain two trivial explanations: (i) the RfaH-binding site is altered by substitutions or (ii) RfaH does not become recruited to the fast elongation complexes because these TECs move through the <italic>ops</italic> signal too rapidly.</p><p>Several observations argue against the first possibility. First, substitutions that confer fast phenotypes are located in different regions, far apart from each other, and in the regions that are not accessible from the enzyme surface in the context of the TEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Second, RfaH-binding site is located on the tip of the &#x003b2;&#x02032; CH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), 50 &#x000c5; away from the closest fast substitution. Third, RfaH still delays the fast enzymes immediately downstream from the <italic>ops</italic> site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Finally, RfaH affects the kinetic parameters of the fast enzymes (see subsequently). In contrast, RNAPs with substitutions or deletions in the &#x003b2;&#x02032;CH possess &#x02018;wild-type&#x02019; elongation properties but are totally defective in both the recruitment of RfaH at the <italic>ops</italic> site and the post-recruitment response to RfaH at the downstream sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>To exclude the second possibility, we utilized the isolated N-terminal domain of RfaH in place of the full-length protein. The N-domain contains all the DNA- and RNAP-binding determinants and retains all the elongation enhancement properties of RfaH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). However, it no longer requires the <italic>ops</italic> site for binding to the TEC because its RNAP-binding site is always exposed (see Discussion section)&#x02014;thus, the N-domain binds to (presumably) all TECs formed by the wild-type RNAP (in particular, the halted G37 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B; data not shown) and has ample opportunities to become recruited to the G37 TECs formed by the fast enzymes, provided that the RfaH-binding site remains intact. We found that the N-domain accelerated the wild-type RNAP but not the two fastest mutants, &#x003b2;&#x02032;F773V and &#x003b2;&#x02032;&#x00394;SI3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>); however, the N-domain was clearly recruited to the altered TEC since it delayed all three RNAPs at the C45 site similarly. We conclude that RfaH binds to the fast RNAPs but fails to accelerate them further. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>The isolated N-domain of RfaH fails to accelerate the fast RNAPs.

Indeed, all the templates that we have tested for RfaH effects on elongation thus far contained pause sites (<italic>opsP</italic> and <italic>hisP</italic>), at which the wild-type RNAP pauses with high efficiency, but the fast enzymes do not. A simple prediction of this mechanism would be that if the wild-type RNAP transcribed a template devoid of any strong pauses, particularly at saturating concentrations of substrate NTPs, it would also become resistant to RfaH action because pausing would no longer determine the overall elongation rate. Since the <italic>ops</italic> site is in itself a pause, we utilized an <italic>ops</italic>-less template pIA146 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A) that encodes the <italic>rpoB</italic> gene fragment and the <italic>ops</italic>-independent N-domain. While it is impossible to find a truly pause-less natural DNA template, the <italic>rpoB</italic> gene is the best model system known: it is devoid of strong regulatory pauses and has been used extensively in studies of RNA chain elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). We monitored the overall elongation rate by accumulation of 1225 nt run-off RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). At 1 mM NTPs, the N-domain failed to accelerate wild-type RNAP, and the mean rate was actually reduced from 30 to 25 nt/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). However, wild-type RNAP was modestly (1.7-fold) accelerated by the N-domain at subsaturating (25 &#x003bc;M) NTPs. The net effect of the RfaH N-domain on wild-type RNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D) was the reduction in <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> and, more importantly, the 1.7-fold increase in the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> ratio that approximates the second order rate constant for substrate binding. The increase in the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> ratio was more pronounced (2.1-fold) with the slow &#x003b2;Q513P RNAP, which was accelerated by the RfaH N-domain even at 1 mM NTPs; apparently this enzyme was still limited by substrate availability under such conditions. Interestingly, the fastest RNAPs in our collection, &#x003b2;&#x02032;F773V and &#x003b2;&#x02032;&#x00394; SI3, were actually slower than the wild type at 1 mM NTPs, and were not accelerated by N-domain at all NTPs concentrations tested (from 25 &#x003bc;M to 1 mM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D and data not shown). We conclude that the fast phenotype of these enzymes is due to their inability to pause rather than the higher intrinsic elongation rate. Consequently, it appears that RfaH acts by reducing pausing rather than by increasing the elongation rate, as it fails to act under the conditions that already suppress pausing. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>RfaH does not accelerate transcription in the absence of pausing.

RfaH increases <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> ratio, thus effectively mimicking the increase in the NTP concentration, and may therefore also act to stabilize the post-translocated state either directly or indirectly, by increasing the TEC&#x02032;s affinity for substrate NTPs during elongation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined the effect of RfaH on pyrophosphorolysis, a reversal of the nucleotide addition reaction that occurs in pre-translocated TEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A) in the absence of NTPs. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>RfaH effects on pyrophosphorolysis.

This effect was dependent on specific RfaH&#x02013;RNAP interaction because RNA cleavage in the complexes formed with the &#x003b2;&#x02032; &#x00394;CH enzyme, which lacks the RfaH contact site and is unable to respond to either full-length RfaH or N-domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), was not altered in the presence of the N-domain. The apparent protection against pyrophosphorolysis is consistent with the hypothesis that RfaH stabilizes the post-translocated state of the TEC. These results are inconsistent with the direct effect of RfaH on NTP binding: if RfaH acted primarily to increase the substrate affinity, it would facilitate forward and reverse reactions similarly at limiting substrate concentrations (such as used here) because RNAP contacts to the &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; phosphates (pyrophosphate moiety) constitute the major fraction of the NTP interactions in the substrate-bound TEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). In summary, our data argue that RfaH increases NTP binding indirectly by favoring the particular (post-translocated) TEC conformation that serves as a target for NTP, thereby facilitating the catalysis in the forward (nucleotide addition) direction.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this work, we demonstrate that the response of the <italic>E. coli</italic> RNAP to bacterial antiterminator RfaH is modulated by the kinetic properties of the enzyme itself: enzyme variants with the same or slower elongation rate than the wild-type RNAP are accelerated by RfaH, whereas the fast enzymes are resistant to its action. The widely spread positions of the residues altered in RfaH-resistant RNAPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B) and the fact that the RfaH-binding target, the &#x003b2;&#x02032;CH, is located 50 and 75 &#x000c5; away from the closest substitution and the RNAP active site, respectively, argue against a direct effect of fast substitutions on RfaH binding and in support of an allosteric mechanism of control. Below we offer structural insights into the origins of the anti-pausing behavior of RfaH. Our analysis also allows us to draw many parallels to other antitermination systems&#x02014;we compare the RfaH mechanism of action to that of &#x003bb;Q to conclude that in spite of the apparent differences in the nucleic acid targets, the time of recruitment, and the targets on RNAP, the two proteins share many details of the molecular mechanism during both recruitment and post-recruitment modification of the TEC.</p><sec><title>RfaH and fast substitutions increase TEC processivity exclusively by reducing pausing</title><p>Our data demonstrate that the elongation enhancer RfaH as well as fast and majority of slow substitutions modulate the RNAP rate by altering its propensity to isomerize into an off-pathway paused state. Specifically, we show that &#x003b2;&#x02032;F773V and &#x003b2;&#x02032;&#x00394;SI3 RNAPs, the two fastest variants among the ones we studied, display pause-free RNA chain elongation, yet have the same or lower turnover numbers than does the wild-type enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and data not shown). Similarly, RfaH fails to accelerate transcription by the wild-type RNAP on the template devoid of pauses at saturating NTPs or further enhance elongation by pause-resistant RNAPs even in the presence of regulatory pauses. These results are consistent with RfaH and fast substitutions acting upon the same, &#x02018;pausing&#x02019; step.</p><p>On the other hand, the slow enzymes fall into two groups. The first group is comprised from the catalytically competent but pause-prone variants bearing allosterically acting substitutions (e.g. &#x003b2;Q513P); consistent with its exclusive effect on pausing, RfaH is able to rescue these variants. In contrast, two enzymes with substitutions near the active site (&#x003b2;S1105A, &#x003b2;M1107A) are resistant to the RfaH-induced acceleration. These residues are located near the three basic side chains (&#x003b2;R678, &#x003b2;R1106 and &#x003b2;&#x02032;R731) that hold the substrate phosphates in the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>)&#x02014;thus substitutions of &#x003b2;S1105 and &#x003b2;M1107 may trigger the displacement of the Arg side chains, consequently altering the substrate positioning in the active site and slowing catalysis. We surmise that RfaH is unable to correct defects in the active site caused by &#x003b2;S1105A and &#x003b2;M1107A substitutions which confer diminished catalytic competence.</p></sec><sec><title>RfaH may function by facilitating RNAP translocation</title><p>RfaH (or another factor/fast RNAP) may reduce pausing by (i) stabilizing the pre-translocated state from isomerization into a paused state or (ii) favoring the TEC transition into the post-translocated state, in which the active site is programmed for facile nucleotide addition. While at least some fast RNAPs (e.g. &#x003b2;P560S,T563I) are thought to utilize the first mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), RfaH likely acts by shifting equilibrium towards the post-translocated state. Indeed, the RfaH-induced increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> ratio, and thus presumably the apparent rate of substrate binding, is a predictable consequence of the increase in the fraction of post-translocated TEC. Moreover, we show that RfaH inhibits pyrophosphorolysis of the nascent RNA and thus likely facilitates translocation directly and independently on the substrate NTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Interestingly, the RfaH paralog NusG is also thought to reduce transcriptional pausing by affecting the TEC translocation; specifically, by preventing RNAP backtracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The NT strand and the &#x003b2; pincer as the targets for RfaH action</title><p>We envision at least two mechanisms by which RfaH may facilitate translocation. First, RfaH directly cross-links to the NT strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and may act as a ratchet to favor the forward translocation by binding to the upstream portion of the NT DNA on the surface of the TEC; such an effect does not necessarily require a change in the active site conformation. To evaluate this possibility, we need an experimental model for the RfaH/NT/RNAP interactions within the TEC. However, none of the TEC structures currently available contains the NT DNA strand, and the only bacterial species for which the high-resolution structures exist (<italic>Thermus</italic>) lack RfaH and differ from <italic>E. coli</italic> in many RNAP surface features, which are likely essential for RfaH action.</p><p>Second, RfaH may allosterically control the positioning of RNAP elements that affect its translocation along the DNA. These elements are yet unknown but several models that emphasized the key role of the conformational transitions (bending/straightening) of the bridge helix (BH) in translocation were proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). However, our structural analysis argued against the BH flexibility and instead revealed two mobile structural elements, the &#x003b2;&#x02032;-subunit trigger loop (TL) and the &#x003b2;-subunit pincer, that change their positions in the bacterial TECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>).</p><p>In the current view of the nucleotide addition cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), the TEC translocation between the pre- and post-states is driven by thermal motions and is biased toward the post-translocated state by binding of the incoming NTP substrate in the pre-insertion site. The TL, which is unstructured in the substrate-free post-translocated TEC, refolds into two &#x003b1;-helices (trigger helices, TH) which align with the BH to form the three-helical bundle in the presence of substrate; this dramatic structural transition effectively &#x02018;closes&#x02019; the active site and likely represents the rate-limiting step for catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). After catalysis and PP<sub>i</sub> release, the reverse transitions occur and the active site opens. The TH may unfold upon PP<sub>i</sub> release or during translocation. We favor the latter pathway, in which unfolding occurs in concert with the &#x003b2; pincer closure, because this scenario is simpler, does not contradict any data that we are aware of, and readily explains the formation of the paused state, which occurs from the pre-translocated state and is accompanied by the TL folding into an unknown conformation (TL*; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>) likely stabilized by the frayed 3&#x02032; RNA nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Accordingly, both structuring (TL&#x02192;TH) and unstructuring (TL*&#x02192;TL) of the TL may, theoretically, provide an anti-pausing effect. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>The nucleotide addition cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). The TEC elements shown are as follows: RNAP (light gray), BH (magenta), RNA (yellow), NT DNA (black), template DNA (red), TL (cyan) and &#x003b2; pincer (dark gray). Substrate NTP (blue) in complex with Mg2 binds to the post-translocated TEC in the pre-insertion site (PS) and then moves to the active, insertion site (IS); this transition is accompanied by the active site closure through folding of the TH and opening of the &#x003b2; pincer. At a pause site, the TL apparently folds into an alternative state (TL*), trapping the frayed 3&#x02032; nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>).

Studies in the yeast system also highlighted the regulatory importance of the TL and suggested that regulatory proteins may exert their effects through altering the TL position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). However, RfaH binds on the opposite side of the TEC in the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B) and thus cannot control the TL directly. Allosterically mediated unfolding of the TL (that would destabilize both the pre- and paused states) by RfaH cannot be ruled out off hand, although we cannot envision a plausible structural mechanism for this action.</p><p>The TEC transition between the open and the closed, catalytically competent state is also accompanied by rearrangements of several bulky &#x003b2; domains that trigger the displacement of the &#x003b2;-pincer and subsequently to opening (by &#x0223c;4.5 &#x000c5;) of the downstream DNA channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). We speculate that the &#x003b2; pincer may be the ultimate target of the RfaH-induced allosteric signal: RfaH may facilitate the &#x003b2; pincer closure, and thus favor the TEC transition to the post-translocated state. Consistently, RfaH interacts with the RNAP domain (&#x003b2;459&#x02013;505) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) that belongs to the group of the interconnected &#x003b2; domains undergoing systematic structural rearrangement in the TEC. Interestingly, this &#x003b2; domain is directly connections to the rifamycin-binding site, wherein a hypothetical allosteric signal propagated to the active site originates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and in which slow (&#x003b2;Q513P) and fast (&#x003b2;H526Y) RNAP substitutions are located&#x02014;these substitutions can therefore also affect the &#x003b2; pincer movements. Finally, the stabilization of the &#x003b2; pincer in a closed conformation may explain the inhibitory effect of RfaH on the pause-free elongation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) that is likely limited by the concerted TH-folding/&#x003b2; pincer opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Overall, our results suggest that RfaH reduces pausing by disfavoring the pause-forming TEC state. Distinguishing whether RfaH acts as a ratchet through its contacts to the NT DNA strand, as an allosteric switch which controls domain rearrangements that accompany transitions between closed and open RNAP states, or as a combination thereof is not trivial, and awaits not only the atomic resolution structure of the RfaH-bound TEC but also a better understanding of the physicochemical properties of the elemental nucleotide addition cycle of the RNAP.</p></sec><sec><title>Fundamental congruity of antitermination mechanisms</title><p>Our analysis revealed many unexpected similarities between RfaH and &#x003bb;Q, from the mechanism of recruitment to the downstream RNAP modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>).

(Left) RNAP pauses downstream from the &#x003bb; <italic>p<sub>R&#x02032;</sub></italic> promoter start site (shown by a bent arrow); the pause depends on the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> interaction with a &#x02013;10-like sequence element positioned 12 nt downstream from the promoter &#x02013;10 hexamer. Q (shown as a dimer) binds to the QBE DNA site located between the &#x02013;35 and the &#x02013;10 promoter elements and to the region 4 of the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) in the promoter-proximal paused complex. Domain rearrangements in &#x003c3; (likely triggered by the nascent RNA extrusion) accompany the paused complex formation: &#x003c3;<sup>4</sup> is repositioned relative to &#x003c3;<sup>2</sup>, and apparently interacts with the &#x02013;35-like element adjacent to the pause-inducing sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Destabilization of the &#x003c3;<sup>4</sup>&#x02013;&#x003b2; flap interactions unmasks the Q target on core RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). (Right) RNAP pauses at a promoter-distal <italic>ops</italic> site and the N-domain of RfaH binds specifically to the NT DNA, triggering domain dissociation that in turn unmasks the site on the N-domain that binds to the &#x003b2;&#x02032; CH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>). Post-recruitment TEC modification. (Left) Q (likely together with NusA) remains bound to RNAP throughout transcription of the late &#x003bb; operon making RNAP resistant to pause and all termination signals. (Right) RfaH also remains bound to RNAP through contacts between the N-domain and the &#x003b2;&#x02032; CH (and non-specific interactions with the NT DNA); RNAP becomes resistant to pause and some termination signals. The C-domain of RfaH may mediate binding to translation and secretion factors.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm600f8"/></fig></p><sec><title>Recruitment to the TEC</title><p>RfaH is recruited to the elongating RNAP at <italic>ops</italic> sequences, which are positioned 100 nt or more downstream from a promoter. The <italic>ops</italic> element induces RNAP pausing, and likely not only makes specific interactions with RfaH but also induces a conformational change in RNAP that is required for RfaH recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In the context of the <italic>ops</italic>-paused TEC, the most conserved <italic>ops</italic> nts are exposed on the TEC surface in the NT DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Specific interactions between RfaH and the <italic>ops</italic> DNA delay RNAP downstream from the <italic>ops</italic> site (C45 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), apparently by inducing backtracking (G.A.B., unpublished data), and facilitate dissociation of RfaH domains to unmask the RNAP-binding site located at the domain interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>Q is recruited to RNAP at the late &#x003bb; promoter. Q binds to the double-stranded DNA element (QBE) that overlaps the promoter; however, productive Q recruitment requires the &#x003c3; initiation factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), which interacts with the NT DNA immediately downstream from the start site to induce a promoter-proximal pause. &#x003c3;/DNA interaction is thought to induce a specific, Q-receptive state of the TEC, in which partial release of &#x003c3;-promoter and &#x003c3;-core contacts exposes a target for Q on the core enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Specific contacts between &#x003c3; and the &#x02013;10-like element in the NT DNA also induce RNAP backtracking and thus delay its escape from the promoter-proximal pause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).</p><p>Thus, in both cases the specific (but totally different) NT DNA sequence mediates recruitment of antiterminator to RNAP; RfaH recognizes the <italic>ops</italic> sequence directly, whereas Q relies on the &#x003c3; factor. Both sets of specific contacts must be broken for RNAP escape from the recruitment site&#x02014;transient retention of these contacts induces a characteristic pause. Interactions with the DNA induce conformational changes in the protein (RfaH or holoenzyme) that expose the binding site for its partner, core RNAP or Q, respectively. Finally, the same RNAP region, the &#x003b2;&#x02032; CH, mediates recruitment, either directly, by binding to RfaH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), or indirectly, though binding to &#x003c3; necessary for Q recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Post-recruitment modification</title><p>Following the escape from their respective recruitment sites, RfaH and Q likely lose all specific interactions with the nucleic acids but remain bound to the TEC, essentially turning into the accessory subunits. The interaction surfaces are likely distinct: Q may bind to the &#x003b2; flap domain near the nascent RNA exit channel, whereas RfaH remains bound to the &#x003b2;&#x02032;CH. Both proteins, however, apparently induce allosteric signals that suppresses RNAP pausing. These signals may converge: the genetic screen for Q-resistant mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) identified substitutions near the rifampicin-binding site and near the active site, the two regions where the substitutions conferring resistance to RfaH are located; substitutions of &#x003b2;D675 render RNAP defective in response to both Q and RfaH. Similarly to RfaH, the resistance to Q unlikely results from the loss of Q binding&#x02014;most of the substituted residues are located in the interior of the TEC and far apart. This remarkable convergence in regulatory mechanisms between Q and RfaH may extend even further, as slow RNAP variant, &#x003b2;Q513P, was shown to be hypersensitive to Q-dependent acceleration, while the fast one, &#x003b2;H526Y, turned out to be resistant, with both enzymes retaining ability to bind Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Elongation enhancement versus TEC stabilization</title><p>There is one principal difference between the action of Q and RfaH: while both proteins increase the overall elongation rate, Q (and &#x003bb; N) additionally stabilizes the TEC, thereby preventing RNA release at terminators. RfaH acts more as an anti-pausing factor, and is apparently specific for those signals that may be particularly sensitive to changes in the elongation rate. This difference likely stems from the distinct regulatory roles of these proteins: unlike the phage regulators, which ultimately cause cell death, RfaH modification has to be transient and must be turned off at the end of the operon. Thus, while RfaH apparently only reduces pausing (that serves as a prelude to termination) and does not actively stabilize the complex against dissociation, other antiterminators apparently employ additional mechanisms to inhibit RNA release; the anti-pausing effect alone is insufficient to explain the dramatic effect of Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) and N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) on termination. The simplest explanation is that the other contacts within the TEC, such as that to the nascent RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) and/or the &#x003b2; flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), may directly stabilize the RNA against the action of terminator hairpins or Rho protein.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm600_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm600_nar-00620-m-2007-File006.doc"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="nar_gkm600_nar-00620-m-2007-File007.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="nar_gkm600_nar-00620-m-2007-File008.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="nar_gkm600_nar-00620-m-2007-File009.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="nar_gkm600_nar-00620-m-2007-File010.jpg"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported in part by the NIH grants GM67153 and AI064819 (to I.A.) and GM74252 (to D.G.V.).
