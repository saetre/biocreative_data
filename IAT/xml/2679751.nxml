Little is currently known, however, regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms that govern the development of this intricate structure. Zebrafish represent a particularly tractable model system for the study of inner ear development. This is because the ear can be easily visualized during early embryogenesis, and both forward and reverse genetic techniques are available that can be applied to the discovery of novel genes that contribute to proper ear development.

Our findings reveal a novel signalling pathway involved in development of the semicircular canal system, and suggest a previously unrecognized role for NCS-1 in mitochondrial function via its association with several mitochondrial proteins.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The vestibular system of the vertebrate inner ear is a highly complex set of structures that relays information about motion and spatial orientation to the brain. The structural and functional properties of the vestibular apparatus are highly conserved among all vertebrate species. The semicircular canals, one subdivision of the vestibular system, function as sensors of angular acceleration. These structures enhance survival by implementing postural and visual stabilization during motion in a three-dimensional environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Zebrafish has emerged as an important model system for the study of ear development. Zebrafish represent an especially attractive system for analyzing otogenesis, owing to the fact that the ear can be easily visualized during early embryogenesis, and that many mutations in ear development have been described in zebrafish that appear to resemble those that cause human hearing and balance disorders (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). In zebrafish, as well as other vertebrates, the semicircular canal system consists of three non-sensory components, the anterior, posterior, and lateral canal ducts (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]) which are positioned in three different planes. Sensory regions lie at the end of each canal and detect differential flow of fluid through the non-sensory structures during angular rotation of the head.</p><p>The formation of the semicircular canals in zebrafish begins at 45 hpf with the development of three epithelial outpocketings: one anterior protrusion, one posterior protrusion, and one lateral protrusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. At 60 hpf, the lateral protrusion bifurcates into an anterior branch and a posterior branch that fuse with the anterior and posterior protrusions, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Shortly after the formation of the horizontal hub, a ventral protrusion develops at the bottom of the vesicle and fuses with the lateral protrusion. Finally, a thin septum arises from the dorsal wall forming a dorsolateral partition. At 72 hpf, the four hubs are completely formed and appear as a cross shaped structure that spans the lumen of the otic vesicle. Little is currently known, however, regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms that govern the development of this intricate structure.</p><p>Mutagenesis screens in zebrafish have uncovered several types of mutants with semicircular canal defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. For example, a mutation in the <italic>jekyll </italic>gene leads to interrupted ear columns (epithelial pillars which form the hubs of the semicircular canals) and malformations of pharyngeal cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The <italic>jekyll </italic>gene encodes Ugdh, an enzyme required for the production of several components of the extracellular matrix including hyaluronic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Localized secretion of hyaluronic acid has been proposed to drive propulsion of the non-sensory epithelium during canal morphogenesis, a process shown to be necessary for proper semicircular canal formation in Xenopus embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The zebrafish ortholog of the human deafness gene <italic>dfna5</italic>, was subsequently shown to be necessary for <italic>ugdh </italic>expression and proper semicircular canal and jaw development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Another zebrafish mutant, <italic>gallery</italic>, displays only a lateral semicircular canal protrusion and an immature anterior protrusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Although the <italic>gallery </italic>gene has not yet been identified, the defects in this mutant are believed to be caused by overexpression of Bmp4 (bone morphogenetic protein 4) in the presumptive cristae.</p><p>Several other genes required for proper semicircular canal formation in zebrafish have recently been identified. These include <italic>sparc</italic>, a gene encoding a matricellular glycoprotein (osteonectin) that functions in the genetic network regulating pharyngeal and inner ear development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], <italic>tmie </italic>(transmembrane inner ear), a gene coding for a protein of unknown function that is important for normal hearing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and the Na, K-ATPase &#x003b1; subunit gene <italic>&#x003b1;1a.2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>We have recently found that in zebrafish, the gene encoding neuronal calcium sensor-1a (<italic>ncs-1a</italic>) is required for semicircular canal formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. NCS-1 is the mammalian ortholog of Drosophila frequenin, a protein critical for synaptic transmission within the Drosophila nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In mammalian cells, NCS-1 has been shown to promote exocytosis from dense core vesicles in both neurons and neuroendocrine cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and plays a key role in G-protein coupled receptor desensitization via a direct interaction with the D2 dopamine receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In zebrafish, morpholino knockdown of <italic>ncs-1a </italic>blocks normal development of the non-sensory portion of the semicircular canals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, the biochemical function of NCS-1 in regulating semicircular canal formation has not been elucidated.</p><p>To gain a better understanding of the role of NCS-1 in regulating inner ear development, we initiated a proteomic screen to identify NCS-1 binding partners (NBPs). Using yeast two-hybrid and bioinformatic approaches, we identified a cohort of human NBPs and their zebrafish orthologs. We examined expression of ten NBPs and identified seven that are expressed in the developing zebrafish inner ear. Based on their functional profiles, the hypothesis is presented that Ncs-1a/Pi4k&#x003b2;/Arf1 form a signaling pathway that is required for semicircular canal formation. A second set of NBPs, consisting of <italic>pink1</italic>, <italic>hint2</italic>, and <italic>slc25a25</italic>, are destined for localization in mitochondria. Using antisense morpholinos, we show that <italic>pink1 </italic>is also required for proper development of the semicircular canals. Our findings reveal a cohort of novel intracellular NBPs. NCS-1/NBP interactions are likely to contribute to the molecular mechanisms that regulate the development of the vestibular apparatus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of NCS-1 Binding Proteins (NBPs)</title><p>To identify NCS-1 binding proteins (NBPs), we used full-length human NCS-1 as bait in a Y2H screen of an adult human brain cDNA library. Candidate NCS-1 binding partners are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Based on their functional properties we chose to pursue DAN (differential screening-selected gene aberrant in neuroblastoma), a secreted Bmp antagonist that has previously been shown to play a role in semicircular canal formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]; VAMP2, a synaptosomal protein involved in exocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]; and the mitochondrial proteins HINT2, SLC25A25 (SCAMC2), and PINK1, a mitochondrial kinase which has been found to be mutated in inherited forms of Parkinson's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Additional interacting proteins identified in the Y2H screen were not examined further in this study. By conducting literature and protein database searches, we also identified several previously characterized NBPs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) whose potential role in ear development was analyzed.

The same band was detected by pulldown after the bacterial lysate was incubated with the NCS-1-GST fusion protein, but not when the lysate was incubated with GST-containing beads alone. We next used the GST-pulldown assay to test whether NCS-1 also interacted with Dan, Pi4k&#x003b2;, Hint2, and Pink1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Lysates from bacteria expressing S-tagged fragments of Dan (~34 kDa), Pi4k&#x003b2; (~58 kDa), Hint2 (~25 kDa), and Pink1 (~58 kDa), each produced an immunoreactive band of the expected size (left lane in each panel). In each case, the same band was detected by pulldown after incubation with the NCS-1-GST fusion protein (middle lane of each panel). Virtually no immunoreactivity was detected when the lysates were incubated with beads containing GST alone (right lane in each panel). These results support the validity of the interaction between NCS-1 and Arf1, Dan, Pi4k&#x003b2;, Pink1, and Hint2.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>GST-pulldowns</bold>.

To better understand of the role of NCS-1 in ear development, we employed a multistep functional proteomic strategy to identify molecular partners of NCS-1 that contribute to the development of the vestibular apparatus. First, by performing a Y2H screen in combination with literature and database searches, we identified 10 human NBPs. Second, zebrafish orthologs of each of these NBPs were identified using BLAST searches of the zebrafish EST and genomic databases. Third, by investigating the expression profiles of NBPs, we were able to deduce which candidate NBPs were likely to interact with <italic>ncs-1a </italic>in the ear and contribute to semicircular canal formation. We found that mRNA sequences encoding seven of the putative zebrafish NBPs were detected in the developing ear and exhibited an overlap in expression with that of the <italic>ncs-1a </italic>gene. On the other hand, three NBP genes (<italic>vamp2</italic>, <italic>trpc5</italic>, and <italic>ip3r</italic>) were not expressed in the ear, and thus were eliminated from further analysis. Fourth, GST pulldown experiments were carried out to confirm that candidate zebrafish NBPs also interacted with NCS-1. Finally, MO-mediated knockdowns confirmed that four selected NBPs were essential for semicircular canal formation in zebrafish.</p><p>The strategy outlined above has proven to be a fruitful method for identifying novel genes that contribute to inner ear development. Using this approach, we show that two previously identified (<italic>arf1</italic>, <italic>pi4k&#x003b2;</italic>) and two novel (<italic>dan</italic>, <italic>pink1</italic>) NBP genes are required for semicircular canal formation (see interaction map, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]). In the present study, we did not examine the role of <italic>hint2</italic>, <italic>slc25a25</italic>, or <italic>trpc1 </italic>using a morpholino knockdown approach. Further studies will be required to analyze the role of these and other NBPs in ear development. Mutagenesis screens in zebrafish combined with positional cloning approaches have traditionally been used to identify genes that contribute to ear development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. For example, the zebrafish <italic>dog-eared </italic>mutation was identified in a large-scale ENU screen by abnormal morphology of the inner ear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The identity of this gene was then determined to be zebrafish <italic>eya1 </italic>via positional cloning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. While mutagenesis screens provide an unbiased strategy for gene discovery, this approach is generally extremely labor intensive and time consuming. Our strategy, on the other hand, circumvents some of the limitations inherent in an unbiased screen, by rapidly identifying interacting partners of genes already known to regulate inner ear development. This approach, in combination with the reverse genetic techniques available in zebrafish, should make it feasible to identify in a systematic fashion additional genes whose roles in ear development were previously unknown or overlooked.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>NCS-1 interaction map</bold>.

First, morpholinos targeted against <italic>pi4k&#x003b2;</italic>, <italic>arf1</italic>, and <italic>dan </italic>all caused similar phenotypes including vestibular malformation, shortened body axis, reduced head and eye size, and curved tails. Since each of these genes is expressed throughout the brain and jaw during embryonic development, defects in head formation were not unexpected. These defects are not likely due to off-target effects, since for each of the genes tested, two independent non-overlapping MOs produced identical phenotypes. Second, injection of buffer alone did not produce morphant phenotypes. Third, a MO targeted against otopetrin, a gene previously shown to be required for otolith formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], blocked development of otoliths but did not affect semicircular canal development. Fourth, injection of subeffective doses of <italic>pi4k&#x003b2;</italic>, <italic>arf1</italic>, and <italic>ncs-1a </italic>MOs alone did not produce inner ear, jaw, or brain defects. Co-injection of subeffective doses of MOs against a pair of genes was synergistic and phenocopied the ear, jaw, and brain defects obtained using an effective dose of each of MO alone. Finally, brain and ear development appear normal in <italic>pi4k&#x003b2;</italic>, <italic>arf1</italic>, and <italic>dan </italic>morphants until 48 hpf, indicating that disruption of early patterning events is not likely to have caused vestibular phenotypes or developmental delay. Together, these results support the idea that the phenotypes produced by NBP knockdowns are specific, and do not result from non-specific cytotoxic or off-target gene effects.</p><p>Our double MO knockdown studies, together with the pulldown experiments, indicate that NCS-1, Arf1 and Pi4k&#x003b2; form a small interaction network (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> adapted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]) that is likely to have functional significance for development of the zebrafish semicircular canal system. We now propose a model in which these three proteins regulate the targeted secretion of molecules, such as Dan, that are required for formation of the semicircular canals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). This model is based on the following lines of evidence. Pi4k&#x003b2; is the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, a lipid species that regulates trafficking of cargo from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane in yeast and mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Pi4k&#x003b2; has also been shown to regulate secretion in both PC12 cells and pancreatic &#x003b2; cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. NCS-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and Arf1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] are known activators of Pi4k&#x003b2;, however a direct interaction between NCS-1 and Arf1 has been shown to antagonize the enzymatic activity of Pi4k&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Bidirectional control of Pi4k&#x003b2; activation/inhibition may thus serve to regulate the trafficking of molecules involved in inner ear development from the trans-golgi network to the plasma membrane during otogenesis.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Proposed model for functional interaction between Ncs-1a, Pi4k&#x003b2;, and Arf1 in trafficking and secretion</bold>.

BMPs are expressed in the developing vertebrate inner ear and participate in axial patterning of the otic vesicle and differentiation of the sensory epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Bmp4 is secreted from the apical membrane of cells located in the cristae of the otic vesicle and its regulated expression is essential for proper development of the non-sensory portion of the semicircular canals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Dan is a Bmp antagonist that plays a key role in the patterning of the chick inner ear, and is also secreted from the apical membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In chick, loss of Dan leads to structural deformities in the semicircular canals and the endolymphatic duct and sac. The MO knockdown experiments we performed show that Dan also contributes to semicircular canal formation in zebrafish. We have also demonstrated a direct interaction between Dan and NCS-1. Although the significance of this interaction is currently unknown, it is possible that the Dan/NCS-1 interaction may be required to deliver Dan to the Golgi apparatus. This idea is supported by previous studies which showed that the yeast ortholog of NCS-1 (Frq1p) can recruit Pik1p (yeast ortholog of PI4k&#x003b2;) from the endoplasmic reticulum to the trans-Golgi network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>Hyaluronic acid (HA) is an extracellular matrix molecule that is secreted from the basolateral membrane of otic epithelium during semicircular canal formation and is thought to drive the outgrowth of the developing protrusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Hyaluronan synthases (HAS) are the enzymes responsible for HA synthesis and secretion at the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. It is possible that trafficking of HAS from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane may also be regulated by Pi4k&#x003b2; activity. Since HA secretion from epithelial pillars in zebrafish inner ear can be monitored histochemically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], it should be possible to test this hypothesis by determining whether knockdown of Ncs-1a, Arf1, or Pi4k&#x003b2; inhibits HA secretion.</p><p>Our yeast two-hybrid screen revealed interaction of NCS-1 with three proteins, HINT2, SLC25a25, and PINK1, that are destined to localize to mitochondria. The interaction of NCS-1 with Pink1 <italic>(</italic>phosphatase/tensin homolog on chromosome 10 (PTEN)- induced putative kinase 1) is of particular interest. Mutations in the human PINK1 gene are the second most common cause of autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], and are also implicated in sporadic cases of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. MO knockdown studies we performed indicate that <italic>pink1 </italic>morphants exhibit severe brain abnormalities as well as defects in development of the semicircular canal system. Interestingly, a recent study in zebrafish also showed that <italic>pink1 </italic>morphants display severe defects in brain morphology, as well an impaired escape response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. In this context, it is important to consider that no direct link has been established between mutations in Pink1 and defects in inner ear development in mammalian systems. It is therefore possible that Pink1 has evolved to perform a critical role in brain and ear development in zebrafish, while mammals may have developed compensatory mechanisms that regulate development of these organs.</p><p>The interaction of NCS-1 with zebrafish Pink1 raises another interesting issue. NCS-1 does not possess a defined mitochondrial targeting sequence, and its expression in mitochondria has not been documented. In mammalian cells, NCS-1 is constitutively associated with the plasma membrane and Golgi complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. It will be important to determine whether NCS-1 serves to regulate Pink1 function, either within mitochondria or other cellular compartments, and whether the NCS-1/Pink1 interaction contributes to the etiology of Parkinson's disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we show that several new and previously identified NBPs appear to play an important role in the development of the zebrafish inner ear. We suggest a model in which Ncs-1a/Arf1/Pi4k&#x003b2; interactions may form a signaling pathway that mediates trafficking and export of secreted molecules that are required for semicircular canal formation. We also made an unexpected observation that NCS-1 interacts with several mitochondrial proteins, including Pink1, a gene that contributes to familial Parkinson's disease. These findings suggest a previously unrecognized role for NCS-1 in mitochondrial function via its association with mitochondrial proteins, and reveal a new and potentially important signaling pathway involved in development of the vestibular apparatus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Yeast two-hybrid Screen</title><p>A yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] using human NCS-1 as bait to screen an adult human brain cDNA library.
