Although considerable amounts of polyamines are synthesized and stored in the testes, their roles remain unknown. Ornithine decarboxylase antizymes (OAZs) control the intracellular concentration of polyamines in a feedback manner. OAZ1 and OAZ2 are expressed ubiquitously, whereas OAZ-t/OAZ3 is expressed specifically in germline cells during spermiogenesis. OAZ-t reportedly binds to ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and inactivates ODC activity. In a prior study, polyamines were capable of inducing a frameshift at the frameshift sequence of OAZ-t mRNA, resulting in the translation of OAZ-t. To investigate the physiological role of OAZ-t, we generated OAZ-t&#x02013;disrupted mutant mice. Homozygous OAZ-t mutant males were infertile, although the polyamine concentrations of epididymides and testes were normal in these mice, and females were fertile. Sperm were successfully recovered from the epididymides of the mutant mice, but the heads and tails of the sperm cells were easily separated in culture medium during incubation. Results indicated that OAZ-t is essential for the formation of a rigid junction between the head and tail during spermatogenesis. The detached tails and heads were alive, and most of the headless tails showed straight forward movement. Although the tailless sperm failed to acrosome-react, the heads were capable of fertilizing eggs via intracytoplasmic sperm injection. OAZ-t likely plays a key role in haploid germ cell differentiation via the local concentration of polyamines.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Polyamines are essential for cell proliferation and differentiation, but their role in these processes is unknown. Ornithine decarboxylase antizymes (OAZs) are enzymes that control the concentration of polyamines in cells. To elucidate the role of one of these enzymes, OAZ-t, in the regulation of polyamine concentration during sperm formation, we generated mutant mice in which the OAZ-t gene was disrupted. When we observed sperm from the mice lacking a functional Oaz-t gene, we found that the sperm heads separated easily from the tails, indicating that OAZ-t is essential for the formation of a rigid junction between the head and tail during sperm development. Many of the headless tails could continue swimming, but they were unable to participate in the signaling processes required for successful fertilization. However, tailless heads could produce healthy pups when injected into unfertilized eggs. Such a phenotype has not been previously found. The mutant mice evoked rare cases of infertile human patients whose sperm behaves in a proper fashion. Our study underscores the importance of research into the processes of spermatogenesis and fertilization.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>As many as 15&#x00025; of human couples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000712-Skakkebaek1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> are infertile, and male infertility is associated with about half of these cases. A decrease in sperm production has recently been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000712-Skakkebaek1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Although advances in medical technology have allowed some infertile couples to have children, more than half of all infertility is idiopathic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000712-Skakkebaek1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Because unresolved environmental problems such as global pollution might be causing endocrine disruption, a thorough understanding of the basic mechanisms of germ cell differentiation is critical for development of infertility treatments. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of spermiogenesis, we isolated many cDNA clones specifically expressed in haploid germ cells using a subtracted haploid germ cell-specific cDNA library <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000712-Fujii1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Full-length TISP15, also known as OAZ in testis (OAZ-t/OAZ3), was specifically expressed in haploid germ cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000712-Tosaka1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000712-Ivanov1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Polyamines, such as putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, are essential for cell proliferation and differentiation via binding to nucleic acids as cations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000712-Tabor1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000712-Pegg1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

The biosynthesis of polyamines is regulated strictly by many proteins via the key enzyme of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). OAZ is a major regulator of ODC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000712-Kankare1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon stimulation with polyamines, OAZ protein is translated by programmed &#x0002b;1 frameshifting to inhibit ODC activity specifically, and the OAZ&#x02013;ODC complex drives the rapid degradation of ODC by the 26S proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000712-Matsufuji1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000712-Kanamoto1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. OAZ belongs to a conserved gene family with at least three members in the vertebrate lineage. OAZ1 and OAZ2 are expressed ubiquitously in all somatic tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000712-Kankare1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000712-Nilsson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000712-Ivanov2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Tubules with an abnormal arrangement of cells undergoing spermatogenesis were rarely observed in the homozygous mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000712-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

The concentrations of polyamines in testis and sperm were not affected by the disruption of <italic>OAZ-t</italic>. Since the activity of ODC was not regulated only by OAZ-t but by other regulatory proteins such as OAZ inhibitor (AZI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000712-Tang1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, it was assumed that the polyamines amount was kept normal by other factors. OAZ-t was dispensable in regulation of total cellular polyamine concentration. A previous study showed that exogenous primary amines induced head-tail dissociation as a result of the separation of the inner and outer nuclear envelope membranes adjacent to the tail basal plates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000712-Young1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. These results indicated that the concentration of primary amines affected construction at the head&#x02212;tail junction of sperm. Because polyamines are alkanes and include primary amines, the segregation of sperm heads and tails may be caused by a change in the local concentration of polyamines.</p><p>The orthologue of the <italic>OAZ-t</italic> gene is reported in human. One team investigated the relationship between OAZ-t polymorphism and male infertility. The researchers found one Pro164Ser mutation in one of the azoospermic patients but it is not clear if this substitution affects OAZ-t function.

The primers used to amplify the arms were designed to incorporate synthetic enzyme sites at both ends. The amplified fragments were digested to create sticky ends and the clone was sequentially ligated into the poly-linker cloning sites on either side of the neomycin resistance gene in the targeting vector backbone. The targeting vector contained the neomycin resistance gene and a thymidine kinase gene, both under the control of the PGK promoter. The vector plasmid was linearized by <italic>Not</italic>I digestion prior to electroporation into W9.5 ES cells. Of 720 G418 gancyclovir-resistant clones screened, two were found to have undergone homologous recombination correctly by Southern blot analysis. The four targeted cell lines were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts, resulting in the birth of male chimeric mice. Highly chimeric males were mated with C57BL/6J wild-type females to generate F1 offspring, half of which were heterozygous for the targeted allele. Of the two ES cell lines injected, both lines produced a high percentage of chimeras that entered the germline. Heterozygous F1 males were then crossed to C57BL/6 females to obtain heterozygous F2 animals. The heterozygous F2 animals were bred to produce homozygous mutants and to check for Mendelian inheritance.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Breeding of the mice</title><p>The mice were bred and maintained in our laboratory animal facilities and used in accordance with the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals set forth by the Japanese Association for Laboratory Animal Science.
