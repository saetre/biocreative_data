RA characteristically involves the infiltration of leukocytes into the synovium, which undergo inflammation and swelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. RA in humans is a heterogenous disease, and the environmental and genetic factors involved in its manifestation and perpetuation may vary from individual to individual. Although there is an HLA association, the classification of RA is based primarily on diagnostic criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], of which the presence of joint swelling in the hands, the duration and symmetry of the joint swelling, and abnormal levels of rheumatoid factors are some examples. More recently, it has been shown that the serum levels of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) are elevated in a high proportion of patients suffering from RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], which not only is of diagnostic interest but also may indicate that this cartilage protein is involved in the disease process.</p><p>In 1977, Trentham and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] developed the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model in rats as a model for the study of RA. Since then, several modified CIA models have been developed in mice, and CIA is still one of the most common animal models of RA. The CIA model shares some important features with RA, namely major histocompatibility complex (MHC) association and the fact that peripheral joints primarily are affected and that the disease can be divided into an acute and a chronic stage. In the CIA model, an immunization against one specific cartilage protein, collagen II (CII), starts an autoimmune reaction leading to arthritis. In the chronic stage of the disease, when the erosion of the cartilage is taking place, it is possible that immune reactions to other cartilage proteins are initiated and contribute to the disease course. In fact, the immunization with other cartilage proteins in some cases will cause a disease similar in type to CIA, which has been shown to be immunized with COMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>COMP is a 524-kDa homopentameric extracellular matrix glycoprotein and a member of the thrombospondin (TSP) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. To date, five members of the TSP family have been identified. Among them, TSP-1 and TSP-2 contain three identical subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], whereas TSP-3, TSP-4, and COMP (also called TSP-5) contain five identical subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. COMP is present in cartilage, tendon, vitreous of the eye, and vascular and smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In adult articular cartilage, COMP is most abundant in the inter-territorial matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. As previously mentioned, COMP has recently been found to be a useful biomarker for pathological conditions since the detection of COMP fragment levels in synovial fluid or serum can be used to assess the presence and progression of arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The importance of COMP for cartilage structure and function is underscored further by the findings that COMP mutations cause human skeletal dysplasia, pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH), and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The clinical features of PSACH and MED are mild to severe short limbs, joint laxity, and early osteoarthritis. Although the clinical features are similar, PSACH is normally more severe than MED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>We have previously generated COMP-deficient mice to study the role of COMP in cartilage tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Surprisingly, the total absence of COMP did not result in an obvious phenotype, and the COMP-deficient mice did not show any abnormalities in their cartilage and skeletal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The function of COMP in cartilage remains unknown. Interestingly, mice deficient in the cartilage matrix protein collagen type IX, which (like COMP-deficient mice) appear phenotypically normal, showed cartilage properties significantly different from those of the wild-type mice when investigated in the CIA and CII antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) models. Apparently, the microstructure of the cartilage of collagen IX-deficient mice had changed in a way that anti-CII antibodies could more easily reach immunogenic CII epitopes, which in turn caused a more severe arthritis in the acute stage of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Thus, the absence of one cartilage protein can affect how effector molecules of the immune system reach and bind other cartilage proteins.</p><p>To test whether COMP deficiency, like collagen IX deficiency, influences the antigenic/immunogenic properties of the cartilage, we decided to study COMP-deficient mice in the CIA and CAIA models. In this paper, we present results indicating that COMP deficiency makes arthritic mice develop an early onset and more severe disease during the chronic phase. We also present data showing that the exacerbation of the disease in arthritic COMP-deficient mice is independent of how pathogenic antibodies penetrate the cartilage in the acute stage of the disease, which is contrary to the case in collagen IX-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Finally, a role for COMP in the cartilage repair mechanism is discussed as a possible explanation for the exacerbation of the chronic stage of the disease in COMP-deficient mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>The generation of COMP-deficient 129/Sv mice has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. COMP-deficient 129/Sv mice were backcrossed for 10 generations to B10.Q mice (originally obtained from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA), which are susceptible to CIA. The mice were kept in a climate-controlled environment with 12-hour light-dark cycles, housed in polystyrene cages containing wood shavings, and provided with standard rodent chow and water <italic>ad libitum </italic>in the animal house of the Department of Pathology, Lund University (Lund, Sweden). All experiments described here were performed on age-matched mice between 8 and 10 weeks of age. The Lund-Malm&#x000f6; laboratory animal ethics committee approved the animal experiments described in this article.</p></sec><sec><title>Induction and evaluation of collagen II-induced arthritis</title><p>The mice were injected subcutaneously at the base of the tail with 100 &#x003bc;g of rat CII emulsified in 0.1 M acetic acid combined with an equal amount of complete Freund's adjuvant (Difco Laboratories, now part of Becton Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). CII was purified from the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. At day 30 after primary CII immunization, a booster injection of 50 &#x003bc;g of rat CII in incomplete Freund's adjuvant was given at the same location. Arthritis development was monitored in all four limbs by means of a macroscopic scoring system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Briefly, one point was given for each swollen or red toe, one point for each swollen joint (metatarsal phalangeal joints, metacarpal phalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, and distal interphalangeal joints), and five points for a swollen ankle (maximum score per limb was 15 and maximum score per mouse was 60). The mice typically were examined three times per week up to 5 months after immunization.</p></sec><sec><title>Induction and evaluation of collagen II antibody-induced arthritis</title><p>To induce CAIA, the mice were injected with a mixture of equal concentrations of sterile filtered CIIC1 (IgG2a), M2139 (IgG2b), CIIC2 (IgG2b), and UL1 (IgG2b) monoclonal antibodies against different CII epitopes (C1, J1, D3, and U1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Mice were injected intravenously with 0.33 mL of antibody mixture as a single dose on day 0. Subsequently, on day 8, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>055:B5 (25 &#x003bc;g/mouse) was injected intraperitoneally to enhance the incidence and severity of arthritis. The mice were monitored daily for arthritis development after antibody injection (both before and after LPS injection), using the same macroscopic scoring system as described above for CIA.</p><p>Production of recombinant mouse cartilage oligomeric matrix proteinA mouse COMP cDNA clone was kindly provided by Liu Chan Ju (Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, New York University Hospital for Joint Diseases, New York, NY, USA). A cDNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 72 to 2,282 in the mouse COMP reference sequence [GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM016685">NM016685</ext-link>] and comprising the entire COMP open reading frame, except the signal peptide, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using primers mCOMP-TNT-F (5'-CAGGGCCAGATCCCGCTG-3') and mCOMP-TCG-R (5'-CGTGCTAGCCTAAACTCTCTGCAGCC-3'), introducing a downstream <italic>Nhe </italic>I restriction site. The PCR product was subcloned into plasmid pCR-SCRIPT and sequenced. This revealed a mutation (C493T, Thr160Ile) compared with the reference sequence. This may represent a naturally occurring allele, but since the mutated residue is conserved in human, chimp, bovine, equine, and rat COMP, the cDNA sequence was corrected by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) and primers FwdMUT (5'-CCCCCTGGGTTCAGCGGGCCCACCCACGAGGGCGTGGGACTGACC-3') and RevMUT (5'-GGTCAGTCCCACGCCCTCGTGGGTGGGCCCGCTGAACCCAGGGGG-3'). The corrected COMP cDNA fragment was isolated by digestion with <italic>Bgl </italic>I and <italic>Not </italic>I restriction enzymes and ligated into the corresponding sites in the expression vector pCEP4-BM40-hisEK. The resulting mouse COMP expression plasmid was transfected into 293-c18 cells (ATCC CRL-10852) and selected with hygromycin. Afterwards, conditioned medium was collected and the his-tagged recombinant mouse COMP was purified through Ni<sup>2+</sup>-metal chelating and MonoQ ion exchange chromatography. Protein content was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm, using a calculated extinction coefficient of 71,390/M per cm.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of serum levels of antibodies against cartilage oligomeric matrix protein and collagen II</title><p>Antibody levels against COMP in serum were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using recombinant mouse COMP. Recombinant COMP (50 &#x003bc;L/well; 5 &#x003bc;g/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4) was used for coating overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, and plates were pre-blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS to avoid background disturbance. All washings were performed by using PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (pH 7.4). The serum was diluted in PBS and analyzed in duplicate, and then biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse heavy- and light-chain antibodies were added, followed by europium-labeled streptavidin (Delfia, Wallac OY, Turku, Finland), and enhancement solution (Delfia Wallac); the amount of antibody was detected by dissociation-enhanced time-resolved fluoroimmunoassays research fluorometer. Serum samples from COMP-induced arthritis mice were used as a positive control. Antibody titers against CII in serum were determined by sandwich ELISA similar to COMP antibody assay, except the plates were coated with 10 &#x003bc;g/mL CII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].

After blocking, serum samples were co-incubated with rabbit polyclonal antiserum against rat COMP (generously provided by Dick Heineg&#x000e5;rd, Section for Connective Tissue Biology, Lund University) and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature.

The experiments were performed in animals after backcrossing for 10 generations to B10.Q mice. Remaining differences in the genome background were excluded by littermate-controlled experiments. COMP-deficient mice in B10.Q background have no microscopic or macroscopic sign of osteoarthritis or other pathologies in a large number of normal young and old (more than 1 year) mice (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Early onset and increased severity in chronic phase of collagen II-induced arthritis in cartilage oligomeric matrix protein-deficient mice</title><p>To test whether COMP deficiency makes the cartilage more susceptible to CIA, we immunized the mice with heterologous rat CII. The male mice in the COMP-deficient and wild-type groups started to develop arthritis on day 32, and the disease course could be divided into two phases, acute phase (from days 32 to 66) and chronic phase (from days 66 to 158), because there was a decrease in the mean arthritis score after day 66 in wild-type mice. COMP deficiency led to early onset of the disease, with a mean onset of arthritis at 37.5 &#x000b1; 2.81 days in COMP-deficient mice compared with 48.4 &#x000b1; 13.7 days in the wild-type littermate group (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05). There was no change in severity during the acute phase between COMP-deficient mice and wild-type mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In the chronic phase of the disease course, the mean arthritis score in COMP-deficient mice continued to increase. COMP-deficient mice developed significantly more severe arthritis during the chronic phase of the disease course compared with wild-type mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The incidence of arthritis in COMP-deficient male mice (75%) was not significantly different compared with wild-type mice (88.8%). For the female mice, both COMP-deficient and wild-type mice were less susceptible to CIA: only two of eight COMP-deficient female mice developed arthritis, and two of nine wild-type mice developed arthritis. Because of this low incidence of arthritis, it was not possible to compare the onset day and the severity of arthritis developed among the female mice.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP)-deficient B10.Q mice show earlier onset and more severe collagen II (CII)-induced arthritis.

This raises the argument that COMP in cartilage may be functionally redundant</p><p>Here, we show that COMP-deficient mice develop an early-onset CIA and more severe arthritis during the chronic phase of the disease.</p><p>The findings that COMP-deficient mice develop severe autoimmune CIA indicate that COMP deficiency makes the cartilage more susceptible to an inflammatory attack. Antibodies play a critical role in the initiation of CIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The COMP-deficient mice developed the same high levels of anti-CII antibodies as wild-type mice during CIA. We have previously reported that collagen IX-deficient mice are more susceptible to CAIA, most likely due to the higher penetrance of anti-CII antibodies into cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Accordingly, there might be a difference in accessibility of antibodies to cartilage matrix due to COMP deficiency. However, the susceptibility to CAIA was not enhanced in COMP-deficient mice although there is a possible trend toward an earlier onset. COMP, however, is released systemically during CIA and it is likely that these fragments affect T cell-dependent immune regulation, a phenomenon that may be different in COMP-deficient mice. The nature of the T-cell response in wild-type versus COMP-deficient animals requires another set of experiments as the circulating COMP affects T-cell tolerance, and we therefore need to determine the major T-cell epitopes. Again, since there were no changes in anti-CII antibody titers and anti-CII antibodies are T cell-dependent, the T-cell responsiveness as such is not an obvious explanation.</p><p>It has been reported that pentameric COMP binds to collagen I/collagen II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and collagen IX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] with high affinity via the C-terminal globular domains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Indeed, COMP appears to function as an accelerator of collagen fibril formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. These COMP-collagen interactions may be crucial for the formation of a cartilage collagen network. It is possible that COMP deficiency leads to instability and changed exposure of concealed epitopes, and it would be interesting to study whether new epitopes on CII and CIX indeed are exposed and, if so, whether this could mediate pathologic changes in COMP-deficient mice. Furthermore, COMP may have direct effects on chondrocytes (for example, through interaction with integrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]), which may regulate chondrocyte cellular activities and phenotypic development. These functions of COMP might be especially important during remodeling of cartilage after injury or during inflammatory conditions. In the present study, the observation that COMP-deficient mice show a more severe arthritis during the chronic phase of CIA, but not during the acute phase, supports the hypothesis that COMP is important in cartilage repair processes and thus in cartilage regeneration and remodeling.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Schematic picture of interactions of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) with collagen II and collagen IX. In cartilage, collagen II is the main collagen and makes up a fiber network that provides a cohesive framework. COMP binds via each C-terminal globule to triple-helical collagen II with high affinity. The binding between COMP and triple-helical collagen domains influences collagen fibril assembly. In addition, interactions between COMP and collagen IX provide the potential for crossbridging collagen fibrils to form a cartilage collagen network. Figure is modified from Heineg&#x000e5;rd and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ar2551-5"/></fig><p>The primary target cartilage antigen in CIA is CII, which initiates the autoimmune reaction leading to arthritis. In the course of the disease, when the erosion of the cartilage is taking place, it is possible that immune reactions to other cartilage proteins are initiated and contribute to the disease course. In the CIA model, COMP was found to be released to serum. Using COMP-deficient mice as a negative control and mice immunized with COMP to induce arthritis as a positive control, we investigated whether there was an immune response against COMP during CIA. We did not find COMP antibodies at any point during the whole disease course, suggesting no involvement of immune response against COMP in CII-induced arthritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>COMP deficiency in mice subjected to CIA did not affect either incidence or anti-CII antibody titers but caused a significant early onset and increase in the severity of the disease during the chronic phase of arthritis. Arthritic B10.Q mice suffering from CIA did not respond immunologically to COMP by means of COMP antibody synthesis. Results of the CAIA study demonstrate that antibodies accessed CII epitopes similar in COMP-deficient and COMP-sufficient mice. Our results emphasize the importance of COMP in cartilage stability, and the mechanism underlying the exacerbation of CIA in COMP-deficient mice is assumed to be found in COMP-dependent changes in the cartilage erosion/repair process.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CAIA: collagen II antibody-induced arthritis; CIA: collagen-induced arthritis; CII: collagen II; COMP: cartilage oligomeric matrix protein; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; MED: multiple epiphyseal dysplasia; MHC: major histocompatibility complex; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; PSACH: pseudoachondroplasia; RA: rheumatoid arthritis; TSP: thrombospondin.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HG was responsible for the majority of the practical work and the writing of the manuscript.
