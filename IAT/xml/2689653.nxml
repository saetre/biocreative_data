Currently, many efforts are focused on studying miRNA expression patterns, as well as miRNA target validation. Here, we show that the over expression of miR-23a&#x0223c;27a&#x0223c;24-2 cluster in HEK293T cells induces apoptosis by caspase-dependent as well as caspase-independent pathway as proved by the annexin assay, caspase activation, release of cytochrome-c and AIF (apoptosis inducing factor) from mitochondria. Furthermore, the over expressed cluster modulates the expression of a number of genes involved in apoptosis including FADD (Fas Associated protein with Death Domain). Bioinformatically, FADD is predicted to be the target of hsa-miR-27a and interestingly, FADD protein was found to be up regulated consistent with very less expression of hsa-miR-27a in HEK293T cells. This effect was direct, as hsa-miR-27a negatively regulated the expression of FADD 3&#x02032;UTR based reporter construct. Moreover, we also showed that over expression of miR-23a&#x0223c;27a&#x0223c;24-2 sensitized HEK293T cells to TNF-&#x003b1; cytotoxicity. Taken together, our study demonstrates that enhanced TNF-&#x003b1; induced apoptosis in HEK293T cells by over expression of miR-23a&#x0223c;27a&#x0223c;24-2 cluster provides new insights in the development of novel therapeutics for cancer.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>miRNAs are a class of highly conserved, non-coding single-stranded RNAs (18&#x02013;24 nt) derived from the endogenously produced pre-miRNA (precursor) having a hairpin (stem-loop) structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005848-Lee1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005848-Carrington1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. miRNAs refine gene expression post-transcriptionally either via the cleavage of target mRNAs or the inhibition of translation of target mRNAs depending upon complementarity between miRNA and the 3&#x02032; untranslated regions (UTRs) of targeted mRNA in animals and plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005848-deMoor1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005848-Lu1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Caspases, a family of aspartate-specific cysteine proteases, play a critical role in the execution of apoptosis. Broadly caspases can be divided into two types - Initiator and Effector. Initiator caspases, with long prodomains, such as caspases-8, -9 and -10, either directly or indirectly activate effector caspases, such as caspases-3, -6 and -7. These effector caspases then cleave intracellular substrates, including structural and regulatory proteins such as cytokeratin, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and are directly responsible for many of the morphological features of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005848-Radovi1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Literature also shows that cells can undergo apoptosis in caspase-dependent and/or -independent manner. Caspase-dependent pathway can be further divided based on the initiator caspases into the extrinsic pathway or intrinsic pathway. The extrinsic pathway (the death receptor-mediated pathway) is triggered by the members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor super family. Binding of the ligand to its cognate receptor results in receptor trimerisation and subsequent recruitment of the dual adaptor molecule FADD leading to rapid activation of caspase-8 through recruitment of procaspase-8. Intrinsic pathway (the mitochondrial-mediated pathway) is activated in response to a variety of stress conditions, such as cytotoxic drugs, UV irradiation or growth factor withdrawal, which induce mitochondrial perturbation and the cytoplasmic release of pro-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins such as cytochrome-c leading to the activation of caspase-9. Both pathways finally lead to activation of caspase-3, the executioner caspase responsible for the final morphological changes observed during apoptosis. Accumulating evidences suggest that a cross-talk between two pathways exists in cells as the active caspase-8 cleaves a BH3-domain-only subfamily protein, Bid. This truncated Bid (tBid) translocates to mitochondria and mediates cytochrome-c release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005848-Li1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Caspase- independent pathway occurs via the translocation of AIF (Apoptosis Inducing Factor) from the mitochondria towards the nucleus; ultimately resulting in apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005848-Cregan1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Resistance towards apoptosis is a key factor for the survival of a malignant cell. Cancer results if there is too little apoptosis and cells grow faster and live longer than normal cells. In addition, defects in apoptosis signaling contribute to drug resistance of tumor cells. Thus, one of the main goals for oncologic treatment is to overcome resistance of tumor cells towards apoptosis. The exciting challenge in oncology is to translate the growing knowledge of apoptotic pathways into clinical applications.</p><p>The objective of the present study was to examine the role of the miRNA cluster (miR-23a&#x0223c;27a&#x0223c;24-2) in apoptosis. Understanding the role of miRNA in apoptosis is likely to provide deeper insights into various disease processes and thus totally revolutionize the scientific approach towards developing therapies against these diseases. Since their discovery, a number of bioinformatic softwares have come up predicting the targets of miRNAs, yet very few miRNA-target interactions have been validated experimentally.</p><p>Here, we show that the over expression of miR-23a&#x0223c;27a&#x0223c;24-2 cluster in HEK293T cells induces apoptosis by caspase-dependent as well as -independent pathway. We also show that hsa-miR-27a negatively regulated the expression of FADD.</p><p>FADD/Mort1 is a cytosolic adaptor molecule which is critical for signaling from CD95 (FAS/Apo1) and certain other members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) family (called death receptors). Two protein interaction domains have been identified in FADD. The C-terminal &#x0201c;death domain&#x0201d; (DD) is needed for recruitment of FADD/Mort1 to ligated death receptor and N-terminal &#x0201c;death effector domain&#x0201d; (DED) mediates oligomerization and activation of caspase-8 zymogens. Caspase-8 activates other caspases by cleavage and this starts a proteolytic cascade which constitutes the &#x0201c;point of no return&#x0201d; in apoptotic signaling. Besides its role in apoptosis, this protein has also been implicated in survival/proliferation and cell cycle progression. FADD can also function as tumor suppressor gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005848-Newton1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Many reports also reveal the underexpression of FADD in several cancers like thyroid adenoma and acute myeloid leukemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005848-Tourneur1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005848-Tourneur2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

Contrary to their findings is our study where for the first time it is shown that upregulation of miR-23a&#x0223c;27a&#x0223c;24-2 cluster induces caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptosis in human embryonic kidney cells. Consistent to our findings there are reports in the literature where it has been shown that the same microRNA can act as an oncogene under one set of conditions and as a tumor suppressor in another <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005848-He1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005848-ODonnell1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this investigation, several observations suggest that miR-27a regulates FADD expression. For example, over expression of miR-23a&#x0223c;27a&#x0223c;24-2 cluster in HEK293T cells induces dose-dependent increase of hsa-miR-27a and dose dependent decrease of FADD as seen by northern and western analysis, respectively. This effect was direct, as p(23a&#x0223c;27a&#x0223c;24-2) cluster negatively regulated the expression of FADD 3&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR)-based reporter construct.</p><p>Our data shows that over expression of this cluster induces down regulation of FADD and up regulation of caspase-8 thereby showing that there is FADD-independent caspase-8 activation in HEK293T cells. In regard to caspase-8 activation there are mixed reports. Caspase-8 activation has been extensively studied in apoptosis mediated by members of the death domain receptor family such as Fas/CD95 and TNFR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005848-Ashkenazi1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Interactions between Fas and FADD via their C-terminal death domains expose the N-terminal death effector domain (DED) of FADD, which can interact with DED domains in the caspase-8 proform, resulting in the oligomerization of this protease and its subsequent autocleavage and activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005848-Muzio1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005848-Medema1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent studies have also suggested that alternative pathways may also be responsible for caspase-8 activation. Indeed, it has been observed that TGF-mediated caspase-8 activation in Burkitt cells does not involve death domain receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005848-Inman1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, and FADD-independent caspase-8 activation by anticancer drugs has also been reported by Wesselborg et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005848-Wesselborg1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The data here suggests that there are at least two different pathways through which miR-23a&#x0223c;27a&#x0223c;24-2 cluster induces apoptosis in HEK293T cells: conventional caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death and caspase-independent cell death. Both occur via the mitochondrial membrane disruption pathway. Here, we propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005848-g007">Fig. 7</xref>) for miR-23a&#x0223c;27a&#x0223c;24-2 cluster induced apoptosis in HEK293T cells. There is FADD-independent caspase-8 activation which in turn is followed by cleavage of Bid, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, release of apoptotic proteins from mitochondria, and subsequent caspase-dependent apoptosis. Our findings were confirmed by the upregulation of active form of caspase 3, down regulation of 116 kD PARP protein, Bcl-2, Bax and release of cytochrome-c from mitochondria to cytosol after over expression of miR-23a&#x0223c;27a&#x0223c;24-2 cluster in HEK293T cells. Rapid ROS generation might be causing the release of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondria to the cytosol and nucleus, hence, leading to caspase 3-independent apoptosis by miR-23a&#x0223c;27a&#x0223c;24-2 cluster in HEK293T cells. There are several reports in the literature which support this fact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005848-Ohara1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005848-Thayyullathil1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Further dissection of miR-23a&#x0223c;27a&#x0223c;24-2 induced apoptosis shows that there was increased TRAF2 expression after miR-23a&#x0223c;27a&#x0223c;24-2 cluster over expression. Literature suggests that trimerised TNFR1 can recruit proteins that engage various signal transduction pathways, some of which either abrogate or potentiate the apoptotic response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005848-Chen2">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref> for example, the serine threonine kinase RIP and TRAF-2. Studies using RIP and TRAF-2 deficient cells indicate that RIP is most likely responsible for NF-&#x003ba;B activation, whereas, TRAF-2 preferentially activates c-Jun N- terminal kinase (JNK) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005848-Yeh1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Since in our study we observed increased TRAF-2 and decreased RIP levels we can hypothesize that in HEK293T cells TRAF-2 plays a major role in this cluster induced apoptosis. To prove this we did western blot analysis and observed that there was increased JNK activation as we observed increased p-JNK after miR-23a&#x0223c;27a&#x0223c;24-2 cluster over expression in HEK293T cells. We also did not observe any NF-&#x003ba;B activation and the NF-&#x003ba;B expression was found to be decreased after over expression of this cluster. In conclusion, we can say that over expression of miR-23a&#x0223c;27a&#x0223c;24-2 cluster induces caspase-dependent and independent apoptosis via JNK.</p><fig id="pone-0005848-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005848.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Hypothetical model for p(23a&#x0223c;27a&#x0223c;24-2) induced apoptosis.</title><p>The green arrows indicate down regulation and red arrows indicate up regulation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0005848.g007"/></fig><p>Our study extends the knowledge on FADD protein, a key death receptor adaptor molecule.

FADD deficient tumor cells resist death receptor-mediated apoptosis by chemotherapeutics drugs.
