There are 4 closely related dengue viruses referred to as DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. They are mosquito borne viruses with a single stranded positive sense RNA genome around 11 kilobases in length, and are able to infect both mosquito and human hosts. A wide range of cell types from multiple species is susceptible to infection with dengue viruses <italic>in vitro</italic>. Numerous studies have attempted to identify the cell surface receptor or receptors utilized by the dengue viruses to gain entry into susceptible cells, but multiple approaches using different cell lines and different dengue virus strains have generated many candidate DENV interacting proteins identified in some cases only by molecular mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Heparan sulfates[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and the C-type lectins DC-SIGN and L-SIGN have been shown to mediate infection by dengue viruses[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and most recently, studies using a standard virus overlay protein binding assay (VOPBA) have suggested that in the liver cell line HepG2, different DENV serotypes utilize different cell surface molecules[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. More specifically, mass spectrometric methods have been used to identify reactive bands using VOPBA and it has been suggested that DENV-2 interacts with GRP78[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] while DENV-1 interacts with the 37 kDa/67 kDa high affinity laminin receptor[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>In a standard VOPBA, complex protein preparations are separated according to molecular mass in a single dimension and transferred to membranes to be probed with virus antigen[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. When complex mixtures are used there are often many co-migrating proteins that cannot be adequately resolved for accurate interpretation of mass spectrometric data when single dimension separations are used. We have used two dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] for separation of cell membrane preparations. After electrotransfer of 2D gel-separated proteins to nitrocellulose membranes, we probed the membranes with various dengue virus antigen preparations. This 2D VOPBA approach has facilitated the separation of multiple proteins of similar molecular mass along a pH gradient. Reactive spots recovered using this approach were identified on companion 2D gels using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF MS)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. A schematic diagram of our experimental design is shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.

Numerous spots were seen and it was necessary to attempt to fractionate the components of the cell monolayer by sequential treatment with 1% &#x003b2; octyl-glucopyranoside (&#x003b2;OG) followed by 1% NaDOC. Beta octyl-glucopyranoside soluble proteins and post-&#x003b2;OG residual NaDOC-extracted proteins were resolved separately on 2D gels. Major protein spots were picked and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion followed by MALDI-TOF MS. It was found that the &#x003b2;OG extract contained both cytoplasmic as well as some membrane proteins while the post-&#x003b2;OG residual NaDOC extract contained mainly cytoskeletal and nucleus associated proteins.

Bound envelope protein (E) was detected by using the monoclonal antibody 4G2, a flavivirus-reactive anti-E antibody[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Replicate blots were also probed with individual dengue serotypes separately. Antigens prepared from uninfected mosquito cells were used as negative controls in order to identify non-dengue specific interactions present in all blots. These blots are shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. In the 2D VOPBA blots probed with a dengue virus antigen or cocktail, 2 reactive spots were seen. The blots probed with dengue cocktail, DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3 had identical reactivities. The major spot that was clearly reactive was around 45 kD in molecular mass with a pI of 4&#x02013;5. A weaker, less obvious reaction was seen with a spot at 50&#x02013;60 kD and a slightly higher pI of around 5. MALDI-TOF MS-generated peptide mass fingerprints identified these spots as 37 kDa/67 kDa laminin binding protein or laminin receptor (LAMR1) and an SH3 domain-containing protein, Hip 55, respectively. The blot probed with DENV-4 did not show any reactivity with LAMR1 but there was a weak reactivity with Hip 55. Furthermore, a clearly reactive pair of spots identified as p47 protein (a cofactor of NSFL1/p97) was seen in the DENV-4 VOPBA.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>2D VOPBA of &#x003b2; octyl-glucopyranoside soluble proteins from PS Clone D cell monolayer. </bold>The antigen preparation used in the VOPBA staining of the 2D blots is labelled on the bottom left of each blot.

Determination of the nature of the early interactions of the infecting viruses with molecules on the surface of susceptible cells provides for the possibility that this understanding can lead to the development of therapeutic agents that can be used to inhibit virus infection. The laminin receptor has already been described as a receptor for DENV-1 by single dimension VOPBA followed by MS/MS[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The results from the MASCOT[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] search showed multiple hits in this particular study, indicating several possibilities, including ATP synthase &#x003b2; chain, &#x003b2; actin and the laminin receptor, but the authors selected the lower scoring laminin receptor for further investigation. This was a reasonable choice since this molecule has previously been identified as a receptor for the alphaviruses Sindbis virus[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and the flavivirus tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>In our study, 2D VOPBA was used to eliminate the problem of co-migrating bands in a single dimension and the mass list generated from trypsin digestion of the most prominent reactive spot turned up numerous hits unambiguously listing the same protein, variously known as protein 40 kD, laminin-binding protein, 34/67 kDa laminin receptor, laminin receptor 1, LAMR1, Lamr1 protein, 67 kDa laminin receptor, 40S ribosomal protein SA, and so on. Contrary to earlier suggestions that LAMR1 is a DENV-1 specific receptor[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], in our hands, DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3 were all shown to interact with the same molecule LAMR1 although DENV-4 did not. It is thus likely that in the PS Clone D cells we have studied, at least 3 of the 4 different dengue serotypes utilize the same surface protein to gain entry into the cells. In our study we also did not find any evidence of DENV-2 binding to BiP/GRP78 as has been shown using single dimension VOPBA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>LAMR1 is a non-integrin receptor interacting with the extracellular matrix. It is generally accepted that the 37 kDa form is the precursor to the 67 kDa form although it is still not clear how this transition occurs. We have used a commercially available rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a recombinant protein corresponding to amino acids 110&#x02013;250 of human LAMR1 to show that this protein can be found in patches on the surface of PS clone D cells which are not contact inhibited <italic>in vitro</italic>. This distribution of LAMR1 is consistent with the findings of Donaldson et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and it is thus possible that LAMR1 may be utilized as a receptor by the dengue viruses. Other groups have already shown that LAMR1 is a functional receptor for Sindbis virus, VEEV, TBEV and DENV1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We have not included functional studies in this present work, as this study is meant to be an exploratory study of dengue virus interacting proteins in PS Clone D cells using 2D VOPBA as an interrogating tool. There is no doubt that the treatment of the cell extracts limits the ability of this method to identify interactions dependent upon conformational structures, nevertheless, we managed to identify LAMR1 confirming previous observations by other investigators[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We have further shown that LAMR1 interaction is not limited to DENV-1 alone, but that DENV-2 and DENV-3 also interact with LAMR1 and that this may be a common receptor for dengue virus entry into cells.</p><p>Many integrins have been shown to function as receptors for different viruses, for example the &#x003b1;6 integrins mediate human papillomavirus entry[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], &#x003b2;3 integrins mediates cell entry by hantaviruses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1 integrin is a receptor for human echovirus 1.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 integrin binds human parvovirus B19[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1;x&#x003b2;2 mediate rotavirus infection[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 is the receptor for the flavivirus West Nile virus (WNV).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Many viruses are now known to infect cells through a multistep process involving binding to the cell surface followed by internalization, often through interacting with more than one surface molecule. Outside-in binding of integrins leads also to signal transduction, and this functional activation has been shown to be necessary for internalization as in the example of human parvovirus B19. In the case of adenoviruses, integrin clustering due to receptor binding initiates the signalling events required for internalization[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The finding that DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3 interact with the laminin receptor is thus consistent with this growing body of work describing the utilization by viruses of extracellular matrix protein receptors for gaining entry into cells.</p><p>In this study we have also identified dengue virus envelope protein interaction with an actin binding protein Hip55, which has been shown to be involved in endocytosis, vesicular transport and signal transduction[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Hip55 has also been shown to interact with CD2v protein of African swine fever virus (ASFV) and colocalizes to areas surrounding perinuclear virus factories in ASFV infected cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The role of Hip55 in the life cycle of dengue virus should be further investigated.</p><p>In our preparations of dengue virus antigens, DENV-4 antigen had the weakest reactivity in ELISA (data not shown) suggesting a lower titre of antigen than the other 3 serotypes, but the DENV-4 2D VOPBA did show a different reactivity pattern, picking out lamin B1 instead of LAMR1. Lamin B1 is not a plasma membrane protein but is part of the nuclear membrane[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and is thus unlikely to be an alternative receptor for DENV-4. The significance of the reaction of DENV-4 envelope protein with lamin B1 is unclear and will be the subject of further studies. It is also interesting that DENV-4 envelope also reacted with another protein involved in vesicle transport and target membrane fusion, the p47 protein cofactor of NSFL1/p97[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The similarity of function of the p47 protein with that of Hip 55, which is reactive with all 4 dengue serotypes, suggests that DENV-4 may use a different pathway than DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3 in the course of infection of a particular cell.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Two-dimensional VOPBA was used to identify cell membrane proteins interacting with dengue virus envelope protein. This approach identified several interactors including LAMR1, a non-integrin laminin binding protein, which has previously been suggested as a receptor for DENV-1 but not other dengue virus serotypes. Using more rigorous tools we have shown clearly that LAMR1 interacts not only with DENV-1 but also with DENV-2 and DENV-3. We have further shown that dengue virus envelope protein from all 4 serotypes also interacts with an actin binding protein Hip55 and that DENV-4 differs from the other three dengue virus serotypes in that it's envelope protein interacts with lamin B1 and p47 and does not interact with LAMR1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Preparation of virus antigens</title><p>The 4 prototype dengue viruses were used in this study.

The resulting solution was removed and designated &#x003b2;OG-insoluble NaDOC-extract.</p><p>All extracts were spun in a microfuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes and the supernatants stored at -20&#x000b0;C until use.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample preparation for 2D gel electrophoresis</title><p>All samples were prepared for 2D gel electrophoresis using the Ready Prep 2-D Cleanup Kit (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>2D gel electrophoresis</title><p>Protein pellets were resolubilized in IPG strip rehydration solution (8 M urea, 2% CHAPS, 40 mM DTT, 0.5% IPG buffer pH3-10, bromophenol blue) at room temperature for 30 minutes, then spun in a microfuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. 125 ul of the resulting supernatant was used for each IPG strip (ReadyStrips pH 3-10, 7 cm, BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) and rehydration was achieved at 50 uA for 15 hours at 20&#x000b0;C using the IPGphor IEF system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Subsequently IEF was carried out for 30 minutes at 500 V, 30 minutes at 1000 V and 2 to 2.5 hours at 8000 V with a step-and-hold gradient until a total of 8500 volt-hours had been achieved.</p><p>IPG strips were then washed with distilled water and then equilibrated by rocking for 20 minutes at room temperature in SDS equilibration buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS) containing 10 mg/ml DTT, allowing for at least 5 ml of buffer per strip.</p><p>Strips were then washed with distilled water and placed on the top surface of the second dimension gel which was a 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel polymerized overnight. Molecular weight markers were applied onto small pieces of chromatography paper and inserted next to each strip on the top of each gel, after which the strips and markers were sealed with 0.7% agarose in 0.125 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8. The second dimension separation of proteins by molecular mass was achieved at a constant 140 V (Mini Protean 3, BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Electrotransfer of 2D gels to nitrocellulose</title><p>The Hoefer TE series Transfor Electrophoresis Unit (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA, USA) was used to electrotransfer proteins from 2D gels to nitrocellulose membranes at 200 mA for 1 hour in ice cold Towbin buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol). Nitrocellulose blots were then stained using Ponceau S. A record of the positions of the visible protein spots on each blot was made by scanning the Ponceau S probed blot using ImageScanner (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and the software ImageMaster Labscan v3.00 (Amersham Biosciences, UK). After scanning, the Ponceau S was stripped by washing in water and the blots were then blocked by rocking for 1 hour in PBS containing 5% skimmed milk.</p></sec><sec><title>Virus overlay protein binding assay (VOPBA)</title><p>The 2D blots were incubated overnight with rocking at room temperature with clarified antigen preparations and mock-infected controls. The blots were then washed with PBS and incubated with the anti-flavivirus monoclonal antibody 4G2 in another overnight incubation at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the blots were incubated with rabbit-anti-mouse Ig HRP (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) at 1:1000 dilution in 5% skimmed milk in PBS for 2 hrs at room temperature. The blots were then washed with PBS and reactive protein spots were visualized by developing with the chromogenic substrate, 4-chloro-1-naphthol/hydrogen peroxide. Reaction was stopped after 1 hr by washing with water. The membranes were scanned and compared with the Ponceau S images scanned previously using Adobe Photoshop version 5.0 LE (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>In-gel trypsin digestion and analysis by MALDI-TOF MS</title><p>Reactive spots seen on the blots were identified in the Ponceau S scans which had been recorded previously and the corresponding spots in the coomassie blue-stained gel were picked and stored in UHQ water in 0.5 ml microfuge tubes at 4&#x000b0;C. During all steps in the digestion process the buffer used was 5 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>. Gel spots were first destained with 50% HPLC grade methanol. Destained spots were dehydrated with acetonitrile for 10 minutes before incubation with 10 mM DTT for 50 minutes at 55&#x000b0;C. This was followed by incubation with 55 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark. The spots were then washed twice with buffer for 20 minutes each time, dehydrated with acetonitrile for 10 minutes and rehydrated with buffer. Finally the gel spots were dehydrated twice with acetonitrile for 10 minutes each time and dried completely by centrifugation under vacuum (DNA Speed-Vac DNA110, Savant Instruments Inc, Farmingdale, NY, USA) for 10 minutes. Each gel spot was then reswelled in 5 ul of 12.5 ng/ul of sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in 5 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3 </sub>for 45 minutes on ice. Excess trypsin solution was then removed, the spots were covered in 5 ul buffer and digestion was allowed to proceed at 37&#x000b0;C overnight. Digests were stored at -20&#x000b0;C until analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis by MALDI-TOF MS</title><p>For MALDI analysis, digests were thawed, spun in a microfuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes. One ul of the supernatant was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with a 1:10 dilution of saturated &#x003b1;-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (ACCA) matrix in 0.25% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile, 50% water. This mixture was spotted onto MALDI target plates and spectra were acquired using Voyager-DE STR Biospectrometry workstation (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Peptide mass lists were submitted for search against the NCBI database (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) using the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK). No constraints were set for species but carbamiodomethylation of cysteine residues and possible missed-cleavages were included.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunostaining of 2D gel blots</title><p>The 2D blots were incubated with polyclonal rabbit antisera against LAMR1 and Lamin B1 diluted 1:200 in PBS with 5% skimmed milk at room temperature, overnight with rocking. After extensive washing with PBS, the bound antibodies were detected with anti rabbit Ig conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, and visualized using the chromogenic substrate 4-chloro-1-naphthol/hydrogen peroxide as described above. Antisera were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Surface staining of cells and photomicrography</title><p>Cells were resuspended at 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells per ml in Leibovitz 15 media containing 3% heat inactivated foetal calf serum, antibiotics and tryptose phosphate broth. Resuspended cells were delivered in 25 ul volumes to individual wells of multitest slides (Erie Scientific Co., Portsmouth, NH, USA) and allowed to adhere overnight in a moist box at 37&#x000b0;C. Cells were then washed in PBS and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehye in PBS at pH 7.4 for 15 minutes followed by a shift to 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS at pH 8.5 for a further 15 minutes. After washing in PBS slides were air dried and stored at -20&#x000b0;C until use.</p><p>Prior to staining, slides were incubated in 50 mM ammonium chloride in PBS for 5 minutes, washed thoroughly and blocked in 1% foetal calf serum in PBS for 30 minutes. Immunofluorescence staining of the surface of cells was achieved by incubation for 1 hour with polyclonal rabbit antisera against LAMR1 at 1:25 dilution in PBS containing 1% foetal calf serum. After washing with PBS the cells were incubated with anti rabbit Ig conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) at 1:1000 dilution for 30 minutes following by washing with PBS. DAPI was used to counterstain nuclei. Slides were viewed using an Axiovert 200 (Zeiss, Germany) with filter sets appropriate for FITC and DAPI.</p><p>Photomicrography was achieved using a cooled CCD monochrome 12 bit camera Evolution QEi and Image-Pro 5.0 software (Media Cybernetics Inc., Canada) was used for preparing fluorescence composite images with pseudocolour. Adobe Photoshop version 5.0 LE was used to compose and present the figure collage.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare no competing interests in relation to this work.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PHT and WWJ performed the proteomics work, MJC and PHT prepared the virology reagents and the immunofluorescence.
