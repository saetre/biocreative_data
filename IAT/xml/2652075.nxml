To examine risks beyond the established effects of these mutations, we analyzed the data excluding both deaths and follow-up times after reported diagnosis of melanoma and cancer of the breast, ovary, prostate, and pancreas. Using an extension of the kin-cohort method that accounts for informative censoring, we estimated that, in the absence of breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers, and melanoma, female carriers had a life expectancy that was 6.8 years lower (95&#x00025; CI: 1.2&#x02013;10.5) than non-carriers. In male mutation carriers, the reduction in life expectancy, in the absence of prostate and pancreatic cancers and melanoma, was 3.7 (95&#x00025; CI: &#x02212;0.4, 6.8) years. When deaths and follow-up times after any cancer diagnosis were excluded, the difference in life expectancy was 5.7 years for women (95&#x00025; CI: &#x02212;0.1, 10.4) and 3.7 years for men (95&#x00025; CI: &#x02212;0.4, 6.9).

Use of human subject data in this study was approved by the Special Study Institutional Review Board and Clinical Center Institutional Review Board of the National Cancer Institute, in accordance with an assurance filed with and approved by the Department of Health and Human Services. All patients provided written informed consent for the collection of samples and subsequent analysis.</p><p>We used data available from the cohort of FDR of participants in the Washington Ashkenazi Study (WAS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004812-Struewing1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> to study the association between <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutations and mortality risk at different ages for both men and women. Details of subject recruitment methods, data collection and laboratory testing for the WAS have been reported elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004812-Struewing1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In brief, Ashkenazi Jewish men and women living in the Washington D.C area were recruited through public media such as posters, newspaper, and radio announcements. A total of 5,318 volunteers were enrolled over a nine-week period in 1996. All participants provided blood samples after giving written informed consent. Genotyping for the three specific Ashkenazi founder mutations in this population, 5382insC and 185delAG in <italic>BRCA1</italic> and 6174delT in <italic>BRCA2</italic>, was performed with PCR-based assays for all individuals enrolled in the WAS. Through a self-administered questionnaire, the participants also provided detailed information regarding their family history of cancer, including age at diagnosis, vital status information, year of birth and year of death, for all FDR. Thirty one participants who did not contribute any relative with known vital status were excluded from this report. Cause of death was not ascertained and could not be retrieved because the data were anonymized. First-degree relatives were categorized into parents, siblings, and children. For families in which two or more family members participated in the study, only one member was selected in the determination of carrier status for FDR; thus no relative was included more than once. If volunteers from the same family included a mutation carrier and a non-carrier, the mutation carrier was used as the proband.</p><p>We previously described the &#x0201c;kin-cohort&#x0201d; analytic approach, demonstrating how the penetrance of a disease related to a genetic mutation can be estimated from the disease history data of the relatives of genotyped subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004812-Wacholder1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. This method relies on the basic principle that, although the genotype of the relatives are not known, one can use Mendelian laws to estimate the expected proportions of carriers and non-carriers among the relatives of the genotyped individuals; alternatively, one can think of the cohort of relatives as having &#x0201c;missing&#x0201d; genotypes, whose distribution can be inferred via Mendelian laws from participants who were genotyped. Generally, the proportion of carriers of a rare mutation will be much higher in close relatives of a mutation carrier than in relatives of a mutation non-carrier. We can test the association between mutation and disease, as well as estimate genotype-specific absolute risk (penetrance) for the disease using the inferred genotype distribution for all relatives. Following the same principles as in our studies of cancer incidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004812-Struewing1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004812-Wacholder1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> and survival after diagnosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004812-Lee1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, we used mortality data from the relatives of the WAS participants to obtain age-specific cumulative risks and hazards (interval risk) of mortality among <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutation carriers and non-carriers.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Mortality in the absence of <italic>BRCA</italic>-related cancers</title><p>We treated a diagnosis of breast, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic cancer, or melanoma as a censoring event to eliminate the established effects of <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutations on mortality risk. Unlike previous applications of kin-cohort estimation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004812-Wacholder1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004812-Chatterjee2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004812-Moore1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, we could not assume that the censoring events were independent of the mutations under study because diagnosis of a <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutation-related cancer made the unknown genotype more likely to include a mutation. The analytic approach of Chatterjee and Wacholder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004812-Chatterjee1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> accounts for possible bias due to this dependent censoring. We estimated hazards of mortality for carriers and non-carriers in 10-year intervals and plotted the non-parametric estimate of the age-specific cumulative risk functions. We estimated life expectancy by numeric integration of the survival function, i.e. the complement of the cumulative-risk function, over the observed range of ages at mortality in the data. We obtained confidence intervals and standard error for parameter estimated by bootstrap sampling (500 replicates) of the WAS families in a way that automatically accounts for the correlation of the relatives within a family. For a global test of the difference in mortality risk between carriers and non-carriers, we compared their average life-expectancies based on estimates of the age-specific risk of mortality. Wald statistics were computed by parameter estimates divided by their bootstrap standard errors, and the associated p-values were reported.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Mortality in the absence of all cancer</title><p>We also estimated mortality risk in the absence of any cancer diagnosis using the same method with follow-up censored at the time of cancer diagnosis at any site.</p><p>To examine possible impact of birth cohort effects in our analysis, we first performed tests for interactions in the Cox proportional hazard regression model to detect potential differences in the mortality risk between carriers and non-carriers by birth cohort. As no significant differences were found, we adjusted for the effect of birth cohort assuming the effect on mortality is the same for both carriers and non-carriers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Participants who tested positive for one of the <italic>BRCA</italic> Ashkenazi founder mutations reported having a higher proportion of female siblings and children than did participants who tested negative.

The retrospectively constructed time of follow-up for the relatives of the study participants gave us a unique opportunity to estimate age-related mortality risks associated with <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutations.</p><p>One limitation of our study is the potential bias due to under-reporting by WAS participants of cancer diagnoses in their relatives. The known high risk of certain cancers among carriers could lead to substantial overestimation of mortality risk seemingly from other causes if cancers were under-reported in this group. At the time this study was done, clinical testing for <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> was not available, and participants were not aware of their mutation status. Thus, we would not expect differential reporting due to genotype. However, even if the misreporting was non-differential between mutation carriers and non-carriers, the greater number of missed mutation-related cancers in mutation carriers could exaggerate the effects. Nevertheless, the mortality differences we observed for both women and men seem too great to be explained completely by deaths following unreported cancers. Moreover, the findings did not change significantly when the data was limited to relatively recent deaths or stratified by generations. This observation suggests that the apparent mortality difference was unlikely to be entirely due to under-reporting of cancers in relatives.</p><p>The major limitation of this report is that the WAS did not ask participants about non-cancer causes of death in relatives. Consequently, we cannot identify specific conditions that might explain the observed association between the three <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> Ashkenazi founder mutations and non-cancer mortality. We censored follow-up duration at the time of any cancer diagnosis, and used a statistical method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004812-Chatterjee2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> that ensures that the observed association between mutation status and mortality were not due to any reported cancers. Previously, we showed that in this study population, the overall mortality after breast or ovarian cancer diagnosis was similar in relatives of carriers and non-carriers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004812-Lee1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

If real, this observed excess mortality risk in the absence of any cancer suggests that <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutations may exert biologic effects quite apart from their well-established influence on cancer risk. Theoretically, these mutations may either be associated with a small increase in risk of a variety of different diseases, or they may be associated with moderate increase in risk of a few major diseases. There are currently very little available data on the effects of <italic>BRCA</italic> mutations on either overall or cause-specific mortality, and there has been no study investigating the association between <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutations and non-malignant conditions. However, before speculating on specific mechanisms by which <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutations might contribute to non-cancer conditions, confirmatory studies are essential. Moreover, although the findings in our study are intriguing, it is not clear whether the same findings can be generalized to persons with <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutations not studied in the current cohort, or to other, non-Ashkenazi populations. Thus, additional studies, both among Ashkenazim and with other unselected <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> carrier populations, are needed to verify this finding. Identifying underlying mechanisms for effects of <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> on non-cancer mortality, if the finding is confirmed, could lead to a better understanding of the biological basis through which the <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> genes exert their impact on cancer risks as well as on other non-cancer conditions. Furthermore, insights into the mechanism of action of the <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> genes could in turn facilitate research efforts aimed at finding innovative preventive management options for <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutation carriers.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0004812-Ford1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ford</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Easton</surname><given-names>DF</given-names></name><name><surname>Bishop</surname><given-names>DT</given-names></name><name><surname>Narod</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldgar</surname><given-names>DE</given-names></name></person-group><year>1994</year><article-title>Risks of cancer in <italic>BRCA1</italic>-mutation carriers.</article-title><source>Lancet</source><volume>343</volume><fpage>692</fpage><lpage>695</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7907678</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0004812-Antoniou1"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Antoniou</surname><given-names>AC</given-names></name><name><surname>Pharoah</surname><given-names>PDP</given-names></name><name><surname>Narod</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Risch</surname><given-names>HA</given-names></name><name><surname>Eyfjord</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><year>2003</year><article-title>Average risks of breast and ovarian cancer associated with <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutations detected in case series unselected for family history: a combined analysis of 22 studies.</article-title><source>Am J Hum Genet</source><volume>72</volume><fpage>1117</fpage><lpage>1130</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12677558</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0004812-King1"><label>3</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Marks</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Mandell</surname><given-names>JB</given-names></name></person-group><year>2003</year><article-title>Breast and ovarian cancer risks due to inherited mutations in <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic>.</article-title><source>Science</source><volume>302</volume><fpage>643</fpage><lpage>646</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14576434</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0004812-Ford2"><label>4</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ford</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Easton</surname><given-names>DF</given-names></name><name><surname>Stratton</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Narod</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldgar</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><year>1998</year><article-title>Genetic heterogeneity and penetrance analysis of the <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> genes in breast cancer families.
