Factor H binds to Sbi in combination with C3b or C3d, and forms tripartite Sbi&#x02236;C3&#x02236;Factor H complexes. Apparently, the type of C3 influences the stability of the complex; surface plasmon resonance studies revealed a higher stability of C3d complexed to Sbi, as compared to C3b or C3. As part of this tripartite complex, Factor H is functionally active and displays complement regulatory activity. Sbi, by recruiting Factor H and C3b, acts as a potent complement inhibitor, and inhibits alternative pathway-mediated lyses of rabbit erythrocytes by human serum and sera of other species.

Complement, which mediates a powerful immediate innate immune defense of vertebrate hosts, is activated, within seconds upon entry of a foreign invader <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000250-Zipfel1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000250-Lambris1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Activation of the complement system occurs through three pathways, the alternative, the classical, or the lectin binding pathway. The activated system cleaves the central complement protein C3 into the fragments C3a and C3b, and deposits C3b onto the surface of a microbe, which normally results in opsonization and elimination of the microbe by phagocytosis. This surface deposited C3b initiates further activation of the complement cascade and results ultimately in the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which forms a pore in the membrane and destroys the microbe by complement-mediated lyses. However for Gram positive bacteria MAC mediated lyses seems of minor significance. The cleavage products C3a and C5a serve as potent anaphylatoxins, which attract immune effector cells to the site of infection. Non-pathogenic microbes are effectively killed and eliminated by the complement system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000250-Walport1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In order to restrict complement activation to the surface of an invading microbe host cells are protected from complement attack by membrane bound and soluble regulators. Factor H is the major fluid-phase complement regulator that controls alternative pathway activation at the level of C3. The 150-kDa Factor H protein is exclusively composed of 20 structural repetitive protein domains, termed short consensus repeats (SCR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000250-RodriguezdeCordoba1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Factor H is a member of a protein family, that includes the Factor H like protein 1 (FHL-1), encoded by an alternatively spliced transcript of the Factor H gene, and five Factor H related proteins (FHRs) that are encoded by separate genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000250-Zipfel2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Factor H controls complement activation by acting as a cofactor for the serine protease Factor I, which cleaves surface-bound C3b into iC3b. In addition, by competing with Factor B for C3b binding Factor H accelerates the decay of the alternative pathway C3 convertase. Thus, Factor H blocks C3b deposition and amplification of the complement cascade on the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000250-Zipfel2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000250-Whaley1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In order to survive and to establish an infection, pathogens need to inhibit the host complement attack and apparently utilize diverse escape mechanisms. Several pathogens acquire host fluid-phase complement regulators, like Factor H, FHL-1, FHR-1 and C4b-binding protein (C4BP) from host plasma and body fluids. Bound to the surface of a pathogen, these host regulators retain complement regulatory functions, and inhibit complement activation. Therefore, acquisition of host regulators masks the pathogenic surface, which results in survival of the pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000250-Rooijakkers1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000250-Kraiczy1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>This common strategy of complement evasion has been identified for multiple pathogens, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, human pathogenic fungi, parasites and viruses and several of the corresponding surface proteins were identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000250-Zipfel1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The vast majority of these pathogenic surface proteins bind additional host plasma proteins and display multiple functions.

Inhibition experiments showed that polyclonal Factor H antiserum blocks Factor H binding to Sbi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000250-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). In the proposed tripartite complex the regulatory region of Factor H (i.e. SCRs 1&#x02013;4) is freely accessible as demonstrated by the Factor I mediated cleavage of C3b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000250-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The staphylococcal Sbi protein is composed of four globular N-terminal domains connected to a tyrosine-rich C-terminal domain via a prolin-rich region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000250-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000250-Atkins1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. A recombinant fragment with domains I&#x02013;IV (Sbi-E), as well as constructs Sbi-III/IV and Sbi-IV, but not Sbi-I bound Factor H in combination with C3b or C3d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000250-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000250-g005">Figure 5</xref>), thus localizing the Factor H binding region to Sbi domains III and IV. As the Factor H/C3b binding sites in domain III and IV and the IgG binding sites in domain I and II are separated, the Sbi protein may simultaneously bind several host proteins.</p><p>The binding properties of Sbi are unique, as &#x02013;to our knowledge&#x02013; Sbi is the first bacterial protein identified that forms such a tripartite complex with Factor H and C3, C3b or C3d. It will be of interest to demonstrate whether other proteins of pathogen origin or virulence factors form similar tripartite complexes. The Sbi&#x02236;C3 interaction appears rather complex, as intact C3 and the two processed forms C3b and C3d display different binding profiles resulting in different stabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000250-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). C3d complexed to Sbi showed the highest binding intensity of binding, and C3b or C3 a lower interaction. In addition the rate constants of C3d and Sbi-III/IV when assayed by surface plasmon resonance did not fit a 1&#x02236;1 langmuir model of interaction, but rather fit a bivalent analyte model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000250.s002">Figure S2A and S2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000250.s003">Figure S3</xref>).The proposed bivalent analyte interaction together with the different binding profiles for the three C3 forms suggest that C3 undergoes a conformational change upon binding to Sbi and exposes additional binding epitopes, which affect Sbi interaction, or that these C3b/C3d binding region(s) is/are differently accessible to the bacterial Sbi protein.</p><p>During complement activation C3 is cleaved, the C3 cleavage products bind to Sbi, increase Factor H binding and enhance the stability of the tripartite complex. Such a feed back regulation may increase the amount of inhibitory host regulators like Factor H at the site of infection and result in protection of the pathogen from complement attack and thus improves bacterial survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000250-g009">Figure 9E</xref>).</p><p>This inhibition of the alternative pathway by Sbi indicates that Factor H bound to Sbi affects the C3 convertase. Within the tripartite complex Factor H displays complement regulatory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000250-g007">Figure 7</xref>) and seems responsible for hemolytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000250-g009">Figure 9A</xref> and data not shown). This explains why Sbi domains III and IV display an inhibitory effect. Compared to the other staphylococcal complement regulators Efb and Ecb, Sbi does not interfere with the activity of the classical pathway and did not affect hemolysis mediated by the classical pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000250-g009">Figure 9D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000250-Jongerius1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus Sbi forms a tripartite complex with the two human complement proteins Factor H and C3, revealing- to our knowledge- a novel mechanism for complement inhibition.</p><p>The inhibitory activity of Sbi is not restricted to human complement as the protein also blocks complement of other species i.e. mouse and guinea pig. Demonstrating that Sbi is a staphylococcal virulence factor with a broader species range as compared to the human specific inhibitor SCIN, which acts specifically in the human system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000250-Jongerius1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000250-Rooijakkers3">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Sbi is a potent complement inhibitor, which interferes with the hemolytic activity of human serum.

However when used at higher concentrations of 1000 &#x000b5;g/ml in an ELISA approach the Sbi-III/IV fragment blocks all three activation pathways of human complement but the Sbi-IV fragment is a specific inhibitor for the alternative pathway (Burman et al.

Proteins were detected using following antibody combinations: anti-Sbi F(ab&#x02019;)2 and a secondary goat anti-rabbit F(ab&#x02019;)2- hrp (Lane 1 and 2), rabbit anti-goat - hrp (Lane 3 and 4), Sbi antiserum and the secondary anti-rabbit F(ab&#x02019;)2 - hrp (Lane 5 and 6).</p><p>(0.26 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="ppat.1000250.s001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1000250.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>1:1 model (langmuir). (A) Concentration-dependent interaction of the C3d to immobilized Sbi-E was recorded in real time by surface plasmon resonance. A kinetic model shows that this profile does not fit a 1:1 langmuir interaction. Solid lanes representing the calculated data do not match the experimental data. (B) The experimental data fit a theoretical 2:1 interaction much better, as experimental and fitted data show a good match and rather low deviation. The residual blots (C,D) show the difference between the experimental and the fitted data for each curve. This presentation reveals systematic deviations between the experimental and the calculated data. (C) The curves for a 1:1 interaction show a large variation. (D) The 2:1 interaction model show a much better fit between the experimental and fitted data. The deviation is very low. For a perfect fit, the scatter in the residual plot is a measure of the noise in the signal. Normally the noise levels are in &#x0002a;/- 2 RU.</p><p>(0.29 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="ppat.1000250.s002.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1000250.s003"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p>Immobilization of Sbi I onto the surface of the sensor chip was followed. (A) Upon sequential injection of the protein, a bulk effect is observed. When the probe was washed, an increase in the base line is detected which demonstrates immobilization of the ligand. This step was repeated four times until a level of immobilization of approximately 1,800 RU was detected (D). (B) An unspecific mouse IgG preparation binds to immobilized Sbi-I, thus demonstrating that immobilized Sbi-I is accessible and binds ligands. Similarly, IgG did also bind to the immobilized IgG binding Sbi-E. No binding was observed for the NON IgG binding Sbi-III/IV fragment. This profile represents the unspecific bulk effect. However, when binding of C3d was analysed, the immobilized Sbi-III/IV fragment showed binding (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000250-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>(0.01 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="ppat.1000250.s003.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Docent Dr. Peter Kraiczy, University of Frankfurt a.
