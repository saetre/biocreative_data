Serum levels of antigen specific IgM, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3 were similar between the two groups of animals. DPP-IV null animals mounted an efficient germinal center reaction by day 10 after antigen stimulation that was comparable to wild type mice. Moreover, the antibodies produced by DPP-IV null animals after repeated antigenic challenge were affinity matured. Similar observations were made using wild type animals treated with a highly selective DPP-IV inhibitor during the entire course of the experiments. T cell recall responses to ovalbumin and MOG peptide, evaluated by measuring proliferation and IL-2 release from cells isolated from draining lymph nodes, were equivalent in DPP-IV null and wild type animals. Furthermore, mice treated with DPP-IV inhibitor had intact T-cell recall responses to MOG peptide. In addition, female DPP-IV null and wild type mice treated with DPP-IV inhibitor exhibited normal and robust <italic>in vivo</italic> cytotoxic T cell responses after challenge with cells expressing the male H-Y minor histocompatibility antigen.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data indicate Selective inhibition of DPP-IV does not impair T dependent immune responses to antigenic challenge.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>DPP-IV (CD26) is a cell surface 110 kDa glycoprotein expressed on epithelial cells and leukocyte subsets possessing dipeptidyl peptidase activity. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The DPP-IV enzyme is known to cleave the N-terminal dipeptide from the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). This cleavage inactivates the hormones thereby neutralizing their prandial insulinotropic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Targeting the dipeptidyl peptidase activity with low molecular weight enzyme inhibitors restores incretin activity and has led to the successful development of a DPP-IV inhibitor, sitagliptin, as an effective therapy for Type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A concern regarding the potential for DPP-IV inhibitors to affect immune function and increase infection rates has been raised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], although a recently published analysis of safety using pooled source data showed no significant difference in the incidence of overall or specific types of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The role of DPP-IV enzymatic activity in immune function has not been extensively studied, however there are a few reports suggesting that DPP-IV can modulate immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Cell culture studies have implicated DPP-IV as a co-receptor in T cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In addition, DPP-IV may affect leukocyte trafficking via cleavage of certain chemokines such as SDF-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. DPP-IV null animals were shown have reduced humoral immune responses to pokeweed mitogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In an Ova asthma model, rats expressing a truncated inactive form of DPP-IV due to a genetic polymorphism were shown to have reduced T cell recruitment to the lungs and decreased Ova-specific IgE titers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, studies with DPP-IV deficient animals do not directly address the role of the dipeptidyl peptidase activity as this cell surface protein may possess other non-enzymatic functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In addition, some reports that attributed immunomodulatory effects to DPP-IV enzymatic activity may have been confounded by use of non-selective inhibitors. Indeed, we have previously shown that blockade of T cell activation <italic>in vitro </italic>correlates with inhibitor activity directed against DPP8/9 but not against DPP-IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Moreover, inhibitors that were previously reported to modulate T cell responses were found to be potent inhibitors of DPP8/9 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>To extend these observations to an <italic>in vivo</italic> setting in order to better characterize any potential role of DPP-IV in immune function, we investigated the T cell-dependent responses in mice using genetic ablation or pharmacological blockade of DPP-IV. T cell-dependent antibody responses provides a useful model for addressing immune competence as it is dependent on many factors such as antigen processing and presentation, CD4 T cell help, germinal center reactions, B cell activation and differentiation, affinity maturation, and memory cell formation. We report here that genetic ablation or specific inhibition of DPP-IV did not impair T cell-dependent antibody responses. In addition, we find that genetic ablation or specific inhibition of DPP-IV did not compromise cytotoxic T cell function <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>Female 8 week old C57Bl/6J and DPP-IV<sup>-/- </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] mice were obtained from Taconic Laboratory, (Taconic Laboratories, Tarrytown, NY, USA). The DPP-IV<sup>-/- </sup>mice were originally obtained from Dr. D Marguet and backcrossed on C57BL/6 to homogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

Briefly, exons 1 and 2 were replaced with neomycin which led to elimination of CD26 expression on the surface as determined by FACS. There was no DPP-4 enzyme activity detected in the plasma of these mice. DPP-IV knockout animals had no major differences in the leukocytes populations in spleen, thymus and blood as compared to their wild type controls (data not shown). DPP-IV null mice and their wild type littermate control animals were immunized with NP-CGG in alum and the primary humoral immune response was measured at day 21 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The animals were boosted at day 32 with NP-CGG in PBS to measure secondary humoral immune response 10 days later. The primary anti-NP response is dominated by &#x003bb; bearing antibodies and B cells that make these antibodies are recruited into the memory compartment. These memory B cells secrete high affinity antibodies upon re-challenge with antigen. There were no differences observed in the primary and secondary anti NP &#x003bb;-responses between the DPP-IV null and wild type control animals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). These antibodies in the secondary responses were predominantly of high affinity as determined by the altered ligand density assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] in which antibody titers are assayed by ELISA using different hapten (NP) density capture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Higher affinity antibodies bind high and low NP-capture plates equally well and hence the ratio of titers is close to 1. Lower affinity antibodies bind better to high NP-coated plates compared to low NP-coated plates and hence the ratio of titers are &#x0003c; 1. There were no differences observed in the dominant anti-NP lambda bearing or IgG1 antibody titers between the two groups of animals during the primary or secondary anti-NP response (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Furthermore affinity matured antibodies produced by memory B cells upon boosting were equivalent between the two groups as measured by the ratio of titers on NP2/NP25. Antibody titers to the carrier protein CGG are dominated by the G1 bearing heavy chain and these were unaltered in the DPP-IV null animals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). All the other isotypes were also unaltered in the DPP-IV null mice as compared to the control animals (data not shown). Equivalent responses were also observed between the CD26 null and control animals immunized with NP-Ova and unconjugated Ova (data not shown). These results indicate intact antigen specific T cell-dependent antibody responses in the DPP-IV<sup>-/- </sup>animals.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Primary and secondary immune responses to T cell-dependent antigen are intact in DPP IV null and inhibitor treated mice</bold>.

Des-fluoro-sitagliptin has properties that are virtually indistinguishable from sitagliptin itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Indeed, it differs from sitagliptin by only 1 fluorine molecule.

This concentration of compound was sufficient to give &#x0003e;90% inhibition of DPP-IV enzyme activity that was sustained for 24 hours (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Similar to the DPP-IV<sup>-/- </sup>animals, the total anti-NP response as measured by &#x003bb;-bearing and G1 isotype were unaltered in animals with pharmacological inhibition of the DPP-IV enzyme activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Moreover, the ability to produce high affinity antibodies from memory B cell stimulation was intact in drug treated animals as observed from the ratios of NP2/NP25 ELISA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). The titers of other isotypes (data not shown) and anti-CGG IgG1 were similar in the drug treated and control animals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). These data therefore show that there are no differences in the amplitude or quality of antibody responses between C57BL/6 controls or drug treated animals. Therefore pharmacological blockade of the DPP-IV enzyme activity has no effect on the primary and secondary T cell-dependent antibody responses to model antigens.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Properties of Des-flurositagliptin</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center">IC<sub>50 </sub>hDPP-IV</td><td align="center">IC<sub>50 </sub>hDPP-8</td><td align="center">IC<sub>50 </sub>hDPP-9</td><td align="center">IC<sub>50 </sub>mDPP-IV</td><td align="center">IC<sub>50 </sub>hDPP-2</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">27 nM</td><td align="center">&#x0003e;10 &#x003bc;M</td><td align="center">&#x0003e;10 &#x003bc;M</td><td align="center">97 nM</td><td align="center">&#x0003e;10 &#x003bc;M</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Des-flurositagliptin dosed at ~400 mpk in feed is able to inhibit the DPP IV enzyme activity for 24 hours in blood.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center" colspan="3"><bold>Conversion of substrate in nmol/min</bold></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center">Day 1</td><td align="center">Day 2</td><td align="center">Day 3</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Des-flurositagliptin, am bleed</td><td align="center">4.53 &#x000b1; 0.22</td><td align="center">5.44 &#x000b1; 0.79</td><td align="center">6.12 &#x000b1; 0.48</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Des-flurositagliptin, pm bleed</td><td align="center">4.90 &#x000b1; 0.37</td><td align="center">8.08 &#x000b1; 1.8</td><td align="center">8.29 &#x000b1; 1.42</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Control, am bleed</td><td align="center">39.8 &#x000b1; 4.0</td><td align="center">47.5 &#x000b1; 5.23</td><td align="center">40.1 &#x000b1; 6.94</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Control, pm bleed</td><td align="center">31.4 &#x000b1; 0.65</td><td align="center">43.3 &#x000b1; 6.01</td><td align="center">40.3 &#x000b1; 7.65</td></tr><tr><td align="center">DPP-IV<sup>-/- </sup>mice</td><td align="center">1.02 &#x000b1; 0.51</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The animals were fed chow milled with 6.7 grams of desflurositagliptin in 1 kg of Tekland chow to deliver an effective dose of 400 mpk.

Since this protein is also expressed on the surface of T cells, it is conceivable that DPP-IV inhibitors could have immunomodulatory activity. This possibility was tested by assessing T cell-dependent immune responses in pre-clinical models using both DPP-IV knockout mice and mice treated with a highly selective DPP-IV inhibitor. This inhibitor, des-fluro sitagliptin, has no activity against other dipeptidyl peptidases including DPP-2, DPP-8 and DPP-9 (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x0003e;10 &#x003bc;M). Several distinct types of assays were used to evaluate <italic>in vivo</italic> T cell-dependent responses after antigen challenge including measurements of serum antibody titers, T cell recall responses, and cytotoxic T cell killing activity. We found that loss of DPP-IV activity had no significant effect in any of these T cell-dependent immune response assays.</p><p>DPP-IV knockout animals did not show any difference in the kinetics, amplitude or quality of antigen specific antibody responses to a hapten or the protein CGG. In addition, the germinal center reaction, affinity maturation and isotype switching of antibodies, all obligately dependent on T cell help, were similar in wild type and DPP-IV knockout animals. Moreover, treatment of animals with a DPP-IV inhibitor did not alter any of the parameters described above showing that DPP-IV enzyme activity is not essential for mounting T cell- dependent antibody responses.</p><p>Recently it has been reported that DPP-IV knockout mice T cell exhibited enhanced proliferative responses to a self peptide MOGp35&#x02013;55 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Despite using similar experimental procedures, our results failed to reproduce these observations in two independent experiments. In addition, treatment of mice with the DPP-IV inhibitor, des-fluro sitagliptin, did not have any significant effect on MOG-specific T cell recall responses. The reason for this discrepancy is uncertain. Of note, the lack of effect of DPP-IV inhibition on MOG-specific immune responses is similar to results seen for other protein antigens such as CGG and Ova. These results strongly suggest that DPP-IV does not play a significant role in T cell recall responses to protein antigens.</p><p>CD8 T cells play an important role in immunity against intracellular pathogens. We investigated the effects of DPP-IV blockade on <italic>in vivo</italic> cytotoxic T cell functions by challenging the female mice with male cells to generate H-Y specific cytotoxic T cells. The primed animals challenged with male cells demonstrated equivalent cytotoxicity when the DPP-IV expression was genetically ablated or the DPP-IV enzyme activity blocked with des-fluro sitagliptin in comparison to the wild type animals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These results indicate that the CD8 T cell cytotoxic function is intact in animals with DPP-IV blockade.</p><p>Our data add to and extend the earlier observation that the DPP-IV enzyme activity is not required for T cell activation or co-stimulating properties <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Busso <italic>et al </italic>have observed no effects of CD26 deficiency on <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> proliferation of lymph node and spleen cells nor on <italic>in vivo </italic>antibody response to mBSA immunization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Furthermore, although lower IgG1 and IgG2a titers were found in CD26 knockout animals as compared to wild type mice immunized with poke weed mitogen (PWM) in the primary response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] these differences were eliminated upon boosting with PWM. Earlier reports assessing the effect of DPP-IV on T cell functions have used inhibitors that were non-selective against other dipeptidyl peptidases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The compound des-fluro sitagliptin used in the current studies is structurally similar to sitagliptin, a highly selective DPP-IV inhibitor that is approved for clinical use in type II diabetic patients. We have previously shown that highly selective DPP-IV inhibitors do not impair T cell activation <italic>in vitro</italic>, in contrast to less selective inhibitors that cross-inhibit DPP8 and DPP9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The current studies extend these observations by showing that highly selective inhibition of DPP-IV does not disrupt T cell responses <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>While DPP-IV does not appear to affect T cell-dependent responses, this protein could modulate other types of immune responses. For example, in humans, DPP-IV is reported to associate with adenine deaminase (ADA) on the surface of the T cell and could prevent the inhibitory effects of adenosine on T cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The crystal structures of both the sitagliptin/DPP-IV complex and the ADA/DPP-IV complex have been solved. While sitagliptin binds DPP-IV to inhibit its enzymatic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], this binding does not alter the overall conformation of the DPP-IV molecule, including the aspect of the molecule that binds to ADA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Therefore, sitagliptin is highly unlikely to alter the ADA-binding properties of DPP-IV. However, since the CD26 molecule does not associate with ADA in mice its impact on T-cell function cannot be addressed in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. DPP-IV has also been reported to associate with CD45 and could thereby modulate signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. We did not directly address functions that could be altered by disrupting the cell surface association of CD45 with DPP-IV. Of note, inhibition of DPP-IV enzymatic activity would not be expected to affect the association of DPP-IV with other cell surface proteins. Our studies focus on the role of DPP-IV in <italic>in vivo</italic> T-cell functions. Several studies including work done by Morimoto <italic>et al</italic> has implicated potentially diverse roles for DPP-IV in human T-cell functions. For instance expression of CD26 on T-cells has been associated with co-stimulatory functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Studies performed by this group have used isolated T-cells stimulated <italic>in vitro</italic> in a variety of ways (including with anti-CD26 antibody, recombinant soluble CD26, and an Fc-caveolin-1 fusion protein). Indeed, the more recent results from this group focus on dissecting <italic>in vitro</italic> protein-protein interactions and signaling by the CD26 molecule and its putative ligand, caveolin-1. DPP-IV was reported to have co-stimulatory activity in studies using isolated T-cells or T-cell lines stimulated by cross-linking surface CD26 with antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. However, the physiological relevance of these studies is uncertain, e.g., endogenous cross-linking ligands have not been identified and, clearly, there is much work to be done to further establish the potential physiologic role that CD26 might play in immune processes.</p><p>Isolated human Th1 cells expressed three to six fold more CD26 protein than Th2 cells and were more responsive to anti-DPP-IV cross-linking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Interestingly, DPP-IV enzyme activities were equivalent in both Th1 and Th2 cells. DPP-IV could have different role in distinct T-cell populations. The potential role of DPP-IV in other T-Cell subsets Th17, Treg requires further studies.</p><p>It has been previously shown that DPP-IV is capable of <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage of SDF-1&#x003b1; and a number of other chemokines like CXCL6, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CCL3L1, CCL5, CCL11 and CCL22 <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Recently it was shown that DPP8 could also cleave CXCL10, CXCL11 and CXCL12 <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. However, whether cleavage of these chemokines occurs <italic>in vivo</italic> has yet to be demonstrated and thus the physiological relevance is uncertain. DPP-IV<sup>-/- </sup>mice were found to be resistant to G-CSF mediated mobilization of hematopoietic stem cell, suggesting a potential role for DPP-IV in regulating SDF-1&#x003b1; in the bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. This has led to the postulation that DPP-IV inhibitors could be clinical useful for bone marrow transplantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The manuscript provides important data on the role of DPP-IV on T-cell immune function.
