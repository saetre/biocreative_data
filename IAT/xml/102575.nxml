In this report, we describe the structural organisation of the human p68 gene and aspects of the regulation of its expression. Northern blot and primer extension analyses indicate that, although its level is variable, the p68 RNA helicase appears to be expressed from a single transcription start site in all tissues tested. Sequence analysis revealed that the p68 promoter harbours a &#x02018;TATA&#x02019;, a &#x02018;CAAT&#x02019; and an initiator element and contains high affinity binding sites for Sp1, AP-2, CRE and Myc. This and functional promoter analyses in transient expression assays suggest that transcriptional regulation of the p68 gene is complex. Furthermore, there are indications that p68 expression is also regulated post-transcriptionally. Steady-state pools of poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA from human cells contain completely spliced p68 mRNA and alternatively spliced forms that contain introns 8&#x02013;11 or 8&#x02013;12 (from a total of 12 introns) and are not translated. Analysis of a conditionally p68-overproducing HeLa cell line points to negative autoregulation at the level of splicing, which is confirmed by a recently reported association of p68 with spliceosomes in human cells.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x8bbfca0.0x8c065a8" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank accession no.

The N- and C-terminal extensions from the core region of individual DEAD box proteins show little sequence homology to each other and seem to bring about the helicase activity in specific processes like RNA splicing, nuclear export, ribosome assembly or translation (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c11">11</xref>). Above all, DEAD box proteins have drawn our attention to the importance of RNA secondary and tertiary structure and their dynamic alterations in RNA-dependent processes whereby their biochemical functions are far from being understood.</p><p>A gene closely related to p68 has been found in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (DBP2) and also in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (dbp2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c12">12</xref>). Deletion of the DBP2 gene, like that of several other DEAD box genes, renders yeast cells cold-sensitive for growth, most probably reflecting the greater stability of RNA duplexes at low temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c13">13</xref> and references therein). The p68 gene of man and mouse as well as the yeast homologues each contain a large intron, which has been conserved during evolution with respect to size and relative position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c14">14</xref>). A more extending analysis of the genomic DNA encoding human or mouse p68 is missing. In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, the intron spans 1001 nt, which is twice the size of other known introns there, and is involved in a post-transcriptional autoregulatory feedback loop of DBP2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c13">13</xref>). Whether a similar p68 expression control also exists in higher cells is unknown, though recently p68 has been shown to be associated with spliceosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c15">15</xref>).</p><p>Immunohistochemical studies revealed a weak granular staining pattern within the nucleus of interphase cells that spares the nucleoli, and during telophase p68 transiently enters pre-nucleolar bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c16">16</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> studies suggest that the RNA unwinding activity of p68 is controlled by protein kinase C phosphorylation and calmodulin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c17">17</xref>), though phosphorylation cannot be detected <italic>in vivo</italic> (H.Stahl, unpublished results). Recently, a 72 kDa nuclear DEAD box protein (p72) that shows striking homology to p68 has been identified in human cells and thus may have similar biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c18">18</xref>).</p><p>p68 is found in a wide range of vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c19">19</xref>). Very recently its chicken homologue has been found to be tightly associated with the 5-methylcytosine-DNA glycosylase complex of developing embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c20">20</xref>). The glycosylase complex is required for active (methylcytosine) demethylation of DNA and contains RNA rich in CpG pairs that serves as a guide for the enzyme to its DNA sites. There is strong evidence that the pattern of DNA methylation is vital for normal development of vertebrates and, interestingly, a high abundance of p68 transcripts has been detected in differentiating embryonic tissues from chickens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c20">20</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c13">13</xref>). In adult rat tissues, p68 mRNA and an alternatively spliced RNA form of unknown structure have been found in the steady-state RNA pool and p68 mRNA and protein seem to be differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c14">14</xref>).</p><p>To gain more insight into the biological role of p68 in mammalian cells we determined the genomic organisation of its human gene, including the promoter region and upstream sequences. In order to understand its post-transcriptional regulation, we determined the structure of the alternatively spliced p68 transcripts and analysed the influence of p68 overproduced from a conditional allele on endogeneous p68 mRNA production in HeLa cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Isolation of genomic clones and DNA sequencing</title><p>A human genomic DNA library (generated by insertion of partial <italic>Sau</italic>3A-digested human lymphocyte DNA in &#x003bb;L.47.1 and kindly given to us by Dr B.

The gene consists of 13 exons and 12 introns (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f1">1</xref>A). Exon length varies between 60 and 706 bp, while the introns were between 81 and 1243 bp in size (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f1">1</xref>B). Exon I contains the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR), an AUG initiation codon and encodes the N-terminal 15 amino acids. Exons IV, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI and XII each encode one or two of the nine conserved amino acid motifs characteristic of DEAD box proteins, with one motif (RGXD) being interrupted by an intron. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f1">1</xref>B, all intron&#x02013;exon boundaries match with published consensus sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c35">35</xref>) and each intron contains a potential lariat acceptor site upstream of its 3&#x02032; splice junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c36">36</xref>). The intron splice phase is type 0 (introns occuring between codons) for introns 2, 4 and 5, type I (between the first and second bases of a codon) for introns 3, 6, 10, 11 and 12 and type II (between the second and third bases of a codon) for introns 1, 8 and 9, respectively. As is typical for mammalian genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c37">37</xref>), the last exon of the p68 gene was found to be the largest one. It encodes the 134 C-terminal amino acids followed by a stop codon for translation (TAA) and a relatively long (301 bases) 3&#x02032;-UTR with two potential polyadenylation consensus signals. A previous cDNA analysis has revealed that one of two adenosine residues positioned 16&#x000a0;nt downstream of the second signal functions as the poly(A) attachment site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c22">22</xref>). The 3&#x02032;-non-coding part of human p68 mRNA contains potential U-rich regulatory elements that are known to direct rapid mRNA turnover (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c38">38</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Localization of the transcription initiation site</title><p>Two p68-specific hybridization signals at ~2.3 and 4.4 kb can be detected in poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA from rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c14">14</xref>) and human tissues (see below) by northern blot analysis. To examine whether p68 transcripts were synthesised from the same transcription initiation site in different tissues, primer extension analysis was performed using a primer complementary to the N-terminal sequence of p68 cDNA and poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA from human liver, thymus, testis and HeLa cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f2">2</xref>, one major extended product of 63 bases was specifically generated in each case that ended with a T residue 171 bases upstream of the translational initiation codon. The same results were obtained by RNase A protection experiments using a complementary RNA probe that contained the p68 gene sequence from &#x02013;433 to &#x0002b;170 (data not shown). Taken together, these experiments exclude that multiple transcriptional start sites are utilised within the 5&#x02032;-UTR, including proximal upstream sequences (up to ~0.5 kb; see also Discussion). In comparison to the initiation site identified here, the human p68 cDNA contains three additional nucleotides (GGC) at the 5&#x02032;-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c22">22</xref>). These nucleotides are also present in the genomic sequence but nevertheless may have been artificially introduced into the cDNA during library construction, since no signal was obtained at the respective position in the primer extension experiment.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence analysis and promoter activity of the upstream genomic region</title><p>The sequence of the transcrition start site (C<sub>&#x02013;1</sub>ACCTCA<sub>&#x0002b;5</sub>) resembles that of the consensus initiator element (Inr; CAPyPyPyPyPy) defined in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c39">39</xref>), and an increased G and C content (63&#x00025;) within 1 kb upstream of the start site of transcription is observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f3">3</xref>A).

They were transiently transfected into 293 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f3">3</xref>B) or HeLa cells (data not shown) together with plasmid pSV&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c29">29</xref>) to correct for variations in transfection efficiencies. When compared to the relatively weak HSV TK promoter, the p68 promoter was found to be much stronger in 293 cells and, to a lesser extent, also in HeLa cells. No activity was detected upon transfection of empty control vectors or when the &#x02013;432&#x0002f;&#x0002b;168 p68 fragment was used in an antisense orientation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f3">3</xref>B). Removing nucleotides &#x02013;432 to &#x02013;382 of the p68 promoter had only a modest effect (&#x0003c;20&#x00025; reduction in 293 cells), whereas a deletion of the next 5 bp, which destroys the canonical E box motif, cut the promoter activity in half. Deletions at nucleotides &#x02013;177, &#x02013;80 or &#x02013;3 further reduced the promoter activity to ~10 and 5&#x00025; of the original level or completely abolished it, respectively.</p><p>The p68 promoter region also contains a putative p53 binding site (<underline>TGGGAAGTTT</underline>A<underline>GAGACCATTC</underline>, consensus PuPuPuC<sup>A</sup>&#x0002f;<sub>T</sub><sup>A</sup>&#x0002f;<sub>T</sub>GPyPyPy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c41">41</xref>) and a double-stranded oligonucleotide comprising this sequence was specifically bound by isolated p53 in band shift experiments, although with reduced affinity as compared with the established p53 consensus sequence. In preliminary transfection assays the same sequence, however, showed no effect on promoter activity independent of p53 and, therefore, it remains uncertain whether p68 is a p53-responsive gene (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell type-specific expression of p68</title><p>We analysed the distribution of p68 mRNA in various human tissues by northern blot analysis. Two classes of p68 transcripts, ~2.3 and 4.4 kb in size, were detected with a cDNA probe in the poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA from each tissue analysed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f4">4</xref>A, left). Their absolute level, as well as the ratio of the 2.3 to the 4.4 kb RNA, appeared different in each organ. Size comparison by gel electrophoresis with an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcript of full-length p68 cDNA identified the 2.3 kb product as mature p68 mRNA (data not shown) and, therefore, the 4.4 kb RNA was regarded as representing alternatively (or incompletely) spliced p68 RNA as has previously been found in rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c14">14</xref>). The blot was stripped and successively hybridized with probes specific for intron 1 or 11, which are the largest among the p68 gene introns. Now, only the 4.4 and not the 2.3 kb RNA was detected and only with the intron 11-specific probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f4">4</xref>A, right, and data not shown). The 4.4 kb p68 RNA species was also found in the steady-state poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA pool from HEF, 293 and HeLa cells in addition to mature mRNA and, again, the proportions of the two RNA classes to each other differed from cell line to cell line (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f4">4</xref>B). To compare p68 RNA with protein levels, protein extracts of the cultured cells were analysed by western blotting with the p68-specific monoclonal antibody C10. This antibody binds strongly to native and denatured p68 from several species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c32">32</xref>). The p68 content of the individual cell lines appeared to inversely correlate with the concentration of unspliced p68 RNA but not at all with that of mature mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f4">4</xref>B). When different mouse organs were subjected to western blot analysis, p68 contents also did not correspond to their respective mRNA levels. The testes showed the highest level of p68 while all other tissues contained relatively low amounts, which nevertheless differed from each other (data not shown, but see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c14">14</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Structures of incompletely spliced p68 transcripts</title><p>The 4.4 kb RNA apparently originates from alternative splicing of p68 pre-mRNA whereby the unspliced intron 11 sequence by itself cannot account for its full length. To learn more about this apparently regulated splicing process we determined the exact primary structure of this p68 RNA species. A HeLa cDNA library was screened with an intron 11-derived p68 DNA probe and two positive clones of ~4.4 kb (in addition to some smaller ones) were isolated. Sequence analysis revealed that the two cDNA clones indeed represent partially spliced p68 RNA still harbouring either introns 8&#x02013;11 or 8&#x02013;12 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f5">5</xref>A). An analysis of HeLa cell RNA by RT&#x02013;PCR confirmed the existence of the two alternatively spliced p68 RNA forms in HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f5">5</xref>B) while no other splice variants could be detected with respective primer combinations (data not shown). The occurrence of the alternatively spliced RNAs was, however, restricted to the nucleus, in contrast to mature p68 mRNA, which was found in both cellular compartments, with accumulation in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f5">5</xref>B). Intron 8 contains several stop codons at its 5&#x02032;-end and thus the 4.4 kb RNA encodes a truncated p68 polypeptide of 328 amino acids that should, however, not be expressed in light of its nuclear restriction. Accordingly, we were unable to identify truncated p68 in HeLa cells or human tissues by western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies specific for an N-terminal p68 peptide (amino acids 45&#x02013;59; data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of conditionally p68-overproducing HeLa cells</title><p>We took advantage of HeLa cells that constitutively express a tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) and integrated a p68 expression vector controlled by a tTA-dependent promotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c33">33</xref>). For a higher expression efficiency, the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-UTRs were removed and the p68 cDNA was tagged with a chimeric intron at the 5&#x02032;-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c42">42</xref>) and at the 3&#x02032;-end with an oligonucleotide encoding the epitope of monoclonal antibody KT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c43">43</xref>). Several clones were obtained that overexpressed p68 from the exogenous cDNA construct after withdrawal of tetracycline from the medium (see below). The KT3-tagged p68 was localised in the nucleus and showed RNA-dependent ATPase activity (data not shown). Furthermore, identically modified Dbp2p has been shown to rescue the cold-sensitive growth defect of yeast strain DBP2&#x00394; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c13">13</xref>). Exogenous p68 mRNA could first be detected by northern blot analysis 24 h after gene induction and its concentration increased strongly with time (up to 96 h after induction; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f6">6</xref>A). Contemporaneously the cellular concentration of p68 increased more than 4-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f6">6</xref>C). p68-overproducing cells showed a slightly reduced growth rate but otherwise looked normal (data not shown). Interestingly, after induction the cells showed a decrease in endogenous p68 mRNA over time whereas the concentration of the alternatively spliced 4.4&#x000a0;kb RNA increased slightly. Moreover, we observed the simultaneous appearance of an even larger, most probably unspliced, p68 transcript of ~6.5 kb in the poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA pool (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f6">6</xref>A and B). The 4.4 and 6.5 kb p68 RNA species could also be detected with an intron 11-specific probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f6">6</xref>B), and similar data were obtained with a second p68-overproducing HeLa cell clone. Taken together, these results indicate that the maturation of p68 primary transcripts is most probably inhibited at increasing cellular p68 concentrations at the level of splicing. The chimeric intron of the integrated p68 cDNA, in contrast, was quantitatively spliced out and unspliced p68 RNA of this size could not be detected in the steady-state poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA pool (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f6">6</xref>A). Furthermore, maturation of other pre-mRNAs, like that of the highly p68-related DEAD box protein p72 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c18">18</xref>), was not affected under the same conditions (data not shown). The inhibition of splicing by overproduced p68, therefore, seems to specifically affect endogenous p68 gene transcripts and apparently represents a negative autoregulatory control of p68 gene expression in human cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>p68, a member of the DEAD box protein family, is highly conserved in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c4">4</xref>). In humans it is encoded by a single gene locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c44">44</xref>) and its genomic organisation is shown here to be consistent with other eukaryotic genes. The transcribed part of the human p68 gene is ~6.7 kb in size and split into 13 exons. In parallel with mouse eIF-4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c45">45</xref>), the prototype of DEAD box proteins, the conserved RNA helicase domains, with the exception of the RGXD motif, are not interrupted by introns. Primer extension and RNase A protection experiments have identified only one start site within the 5&#x02032;-UTR of the cDNA and further upstream up to ~0.5 kb in all human tissues tested. This is in contrast to the Ddx5 gene (the mouse homologue of human p68), where alternative start points seem to be used within this area in a tissue-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c46">46</xref>). Our experiments do not exclude, however, that additional start sites for human p68 transcription may exist further upstream. In light of their structures, the resulting transcripts should, however, be larger than those identified here (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f5">5</xref>), except for the case when most of the 5&#x02032;-transcribed sequence is spliced out. An Inr element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c39">39</xref>) encompasses the transcriptional start site of the human p68 gene, and a suboptimal TATA box, TACAAA, is located 30 nt upstream. The TATA box binds TFIID and, along with Inr, helps assemble RNA polymerase II and other basal initiation factors into a stable preinitiation complex (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c47">47</xref>). Point mutations in the consensus TATA box lower the rate of reinitiation several-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c49">49</xref>). According to our transient expression studies, efficient initiation of transcription of the p68 gene seems to depend on the presence of binding sites for Sp1 (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f3">3</xref>B), a ubiquitous transcription factor that has been shown to specifically tether the basal transcription machinery to TATA-less promoters via interaction with the TFIID complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c50">50</xref>).</p><p>The p68 promoter contains a CRE, two E boxes and four binding sites for the retinoic acid-inducible transcription factor AP-2, which plays an essential role during murine development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c52">52</xref>). According to our preliminary expression data, the canonical E box at least seems to be critical for p68 promoter activity (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f3">3</xref>). E box motifs can be recognized by Myc&#x02013;Max heterodimers that are known to function in the regulation of many growth regulating genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c53">53</xref>). As in the human p68 gene, E boxes have also been found in association with CRE and AP-2 sites in other gene promoters resulting in negative or positive cooperativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c57">57</xref>). Furthermore, a canonical E box is also present in the 5&#x02032;-region of the mouse Ddx5 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c46">46</xref>) and in two other DEAD box protein genes, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pitchoune (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c58">58</xref>) and the mouse MrDb (Myc-regulated DEAD box protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c59">59</xref>) genes; in the latter case it was demonstrated to be a direct target for Myc. p68 has just been identified as functioning as a transcriptional co-activator specific for the activation function of human oestrogen receptor &#x003b1; and to bind to CBP, the CREB-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c60">60</xref>). CBP bridges the CRE&#x0002f;CREB complex to components of the basal transcriptional apparatus, and it is possible that p68 directly influences its own transcription. Taken together, transcription of the p68 gene seems to be highly complex and its promoter structure suggests that p68 is developmentally regulated, as has been confirmed by respective analyses of mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c20">20</xref>).</p><p>In adult rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c14">14</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c60">60</xref>; this report) the p68 gene appears to be ubiquitously expressed, at least at the level of transcription, though to different extents. There seems, however, to be additional post-transcriptional control, at both the levels of splicing and translation. This is suggested by the existence of an alternatively spliced p68 poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA, 4.4 kb in size (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f4">4</xref>A), and the lack of a correlation between mRNA and protein content in tissues and cultured cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f4">4</xref>B and data not shown; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c14">14</xref>). We have shown here by cloning and sequence analysis that the alternatively spliced p68 poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA contains either introns 8&#x02013;11 or 8&#x02013;12 in addition to the complete coding sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f5">5</xref>). The fact that intron 12 is spliced out from part of the larger RNA confirms the observation that splicing of the last intron seems to stimulate polyadenylation and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c61">61</xref>). The 4.4 kb RNA seems not to be expressed. Its abundance in the nuclear steady-state pool, therefore, rather hints at a regulatory process involved in the maturation of p68 primary transcripts. A function of intron 11 in this process is suggested by the fact that it is conserved in size and relative position from yeast to man. Furthermore, it is involved in autoregulatory post-transcriptional expression control in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> that also requires intact Dbp2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c13">13</xref>). We have extended these findings to human cells by demonstrating that conditional overexpression of p68 from a cDNA causes a reduction in endogenous p68 mRNA, combined with an enrichment of unspliced and partially spliced RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd192f6">6</xref>). RNA transcription by polymerase II, polyadenylation, splicing and export from the nucleus are intimately linked <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c62">62</xref>), and this chain of reactions may be interrupted by a p68-induced secondary or tertiary RNA structure inaccessible to the progressing splicing machinery. Interestingly, accumulation of unspliced RNA was not observed in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> under the same conditions, which may hint at different handling or degradation pathways of immature mRNAs in the two species or, alternatively, at a function of the immature p68 RNA in higher cells. RNA analysis of the highly p68-related DEAD box protein p72 also revealed the existence of alternatively spliced RNA in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd192c18">18</xref>). In our inducible HeLa cell line, overexpression of p68 did not influence the steady-state pool of p72 mRNA, which points to a highly specific regulatory role of p68 in the processing of its primary transcript. How this role of p68 as a negative regulator of splicing can be reconciled with its function as a transcriptional co-activator is unclear. The two functions may come into effect at different cellular p68 concentrations, with co-activation at very low protein levels and splicing inhibition at higher ones. We note, however, that in light of the complexity of p68 gene expression, overexpression by nearly a factor of five is apparently not harmful to HeLa cells.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd192f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Structure of the human p68 gene (EMBL accession no.
