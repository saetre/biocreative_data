Complications from skeletal metastasis result in a dramatic reduction in the patient's quality of life and invariably lead to death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A clear understanding of the factors and mechanisms that promote the migration of prostate cancer cells to bone, their colonization of the bone environment and subsequent formation of metastases is critically needed to prevent and effectively treat this disease. The commonly held "seed and soil" theory emphasizes the importance of the bone microenvironment in determining the colonization success of neoplastic "seed" cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. On the other hand, prostate cancer cells can alter gene expression and cell functions in osteoblasts, suggesting that invading tumor cells might also influence the host bone milieu making it a favourable "soil" for metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This latter view fuels the on-going search for factors secreted by prostate cancer cells that might uniquely signal to bone and promote metastases.</p><p>Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted glycopeptide that plays essential functions in development and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The binding of Shh to its transmembrane receptor Patched 1 (Ptc1) triggers the release of the transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo) from Ptc1-mediated inhibition. Subsequent activation of the intracellular signalling cascade leads to the transcriptional regulation of Shh target genes by the Gli family of transcription factors: Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3.</p><p>Shh and members of its signalling pathway are expressed in prostate carcinoma and increased levels of their expression appear to correlate with cancer progression and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Shh expression has been localized in prostatic epithelia or glandular lumens of prostate tumors indicating that epithelial-derived prostate cancer cells are a primary if not sole source of the Shh protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>We have shown previously that Shh-expressing human prostate cancer cells upregulated <italic>Gli1 </italic>expression in surrounding tumor stroma and accelerated tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model of human prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This apparent paracrine activation of the pathway in prostate tumorigenesis is highly reminiscent of Shh-Gli signalling at epithelial-mesenchymal boundaries in several developing organ systems including the prostate that promotes cell proliferation and morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The mechanism by which Shh-Gli signalling could promote prostate carcinoma metastasis in bone has not been previously determined. The present study provides evidence of direct and specific paracrine Shh-Gli signalling between prostate cancer cells and pre-osteoblasts which leads to osteoblast differentiation, a requisite process for osteoblastic metastasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Shh-expressing human prostate cancer cells, LNShh, directly activate hedgehog signalling in MC3T3 pre-osteoblasts</title><p>Paracrine interactions between cells have traditionally been studied in vitro by co-culturing cells in separate chambers while sharing the same culture medium. We have developed a non-conventional mixed culture system where different cell populations are cultured within the same chamber, thus, allowing them to establish physical associations that most likely occur in vivo and influence cell-cell signalling.</p><p>Shh-expressing LNCaP human prostate cancer cells obtained via stable transfection with h<italic>Shh </italic>cDNA cloned into a pIRES2-EGFP vector, designated as LNShh cells, or vector-transfected control LNCaP cells were cultured within the same culture chamber with MC3T3 mouse pre-osteoblasts. The cells in this mixed culture system established, in a time-dependent manner, a distinctive morphologic pattern. There were no apparent differences in the spatial organization of the mixed cultures of MC3T3 cells and either control LNCaP or LNShh cells, and only images of mixed cultures of MC3T3 and LNShh cells are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Beginning about two weeks of mixed culture, clusters of LNShh cells, identified by their GFP fluorescence, were surrounded by a compact "stroma" of MC3T3 cells which exhibited more intense phalloidin staining of their F-actin filaments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, panels a, b and c). Identification of the epithelial-derived LNShh cells in mixed cultures was further confirmed by their positive immunostaining for human cytokeratin 8 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, panel d). When cultured alone, LNShh cells also formed colonies which became interconnected over time forming a meshwork instead of remaining discrete as shown in mixed cultures. On the other hand, single cultures of MC3T3 cells which reached confluence at about two weeks formed a sheet of cells instead of the reticulate network evident in mixed cultures (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Morphologic pattern of LNShh human prostate cancer cells and MC3T3 mouse pre-osteoblasts in mixed culture</bold>.

We now provide data which indicate that prostate cancer cells that express high levels of Shh can directly and specifically activate the signalling pathway in osteoblast progenitors and induce osteoblast differentiation, an essential process in new bone formation that characterizes prostate carcinoma metastasis.</p><p>LNCaP human prostate cancer cells genetically engineered to overexpress Shh (designated LNShh cells) upregulated the expression of Shh-responsive target genes <italic>Gli1 </italic>and <italic>Ptc1 </italic>in co-cultured MC3T3 mouse pre-osteoblasts and this action was inhibited by cyclopamine, a specific chemical inhibitor of hedgehog signalling, and mimicked by exogenous Shh peptide. LNShh cell-induced activation of the Shh signalling pathway in pre-osteoblasts led to the induction of early phase osteoblast differentiation characterized by abrogated cell proliferation and increased expression and activity of alkaline phosphatase. Conversely, failure to activate the Shh pathway by a dominant negative form of the transcription factor Gli1 in pre-osteoblasts inhibited LNShh cell-induced osteoblast differentiation. These data confirm previous findings which have demonstrated a role for the hedgehog proteins, Shh and Indian hedgehog (Ihh), in osteoblast differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p><italic>Ihh</italic>, <italic>Ptc1</italic>, <italic>Smo</italic>, <italic>Gli1</italic>, <italic>Gli2</italic>, and <italic>Gli3 </italic>are expressed in developing bone, and hedgehog signalling plays a vital role in skeletal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The expression of <italic>Ptc1</italic>, <italic>Smo</italic>, and <italic>Gli1 </italic>in perichondrial cells adjacent to <italic>Ihh</italic>-expressing prehypertropic chondrocytes strongly suggests a paracrine pathway through which hedgehog signalling might induce differentiation of perichondrial cells into osteoblasts during endochondral bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Our data suggest that the apparent paracrine pathway of hedgehog signalling in bone development may be recapitulated in bone metastasis where Shh-expressing prostate cancer cells activate the pathway in osteoblast progenitors and induce osteoblast differentiation. Reciprocally, differentiated osteoblasts might provide factors that are favourable to tumor growth in bone. Many identified downstream target genes of Gli1 transcriptional activity are known to regulate cell proliferation and cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>The downstream mechanism through which Shh signalling induces osteoblast differentiation is not fully understood. <italic>Runx2 </italic>(also known as <italic>Cbfa1</italic>: <italic>core-binding factor 1</italic>) encodes a major and critical transcription activator of osteoblast differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. A recent study has demonstrated that Ihh promotes osteoblast differentiation in multipotent mesenchymal cells C3H10T1/2 by upregulating the expression and function of <italic>Runx2 </italic>through the transcriptional action of Gli2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Our data, however, show that LNShh cell-induced early phase differentiation in MC3T3 pre-osteoblasts was not accompanied by a significant increase in endogenous levels of <italic>Runx2 </italic>and its downstream target genes <italic>Ocn </italic>and <italic>Opn</italic>. Moreover, exogenous Shh-N did not directly upregulate <italic>Runx2 </italic>expression in MC3T3 cells; whereas, the osteoblast differentiation factor AA increased <italic>Runx2 </italic>levels in MC3T3 cells without activating the Shh pathway. These data suggest that in cells that are already committed to the osteoblast lineage and express endogenous levels of <italic>Runx2</italic>, as is the case with MC3T3 cells, the induction of osteoblast differentiation by Shh signalling occurs through a mechanism that does not require further transcriptional upregulation of <italic>Runx2</italic>. Similarly, Xiao and co-workers concluded that osteoblast differentiation induced by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) in mature osteoblast precursors does not require increased expression of <italic>Cbfa1 </italic>(<italic>Runx2</italic>) but might involve posttranscriptional regulation of the Runx2 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].

Prostate cancer cells secrete signalling ligands including growth factors, bone morphogenetic proteins, and parathyroid hormone-related protein which are known to regulate osteoblast functions and whose actions have been linked to hedgehog signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. More studies are needed to tease out the functional interplay between hedgehog signalling and other pathways in the development of prostate carcinoma metastasis in bone.</p><p>Prostate cancer cells that metastasize to bone or those that are directly injected in bone in animal models will be in close physical contact with bone stromal cells including bone cells and their osteoblast progenitors, fibroblasts, hematopoetic cells, and multipotent mesenchymal stem cells. In the presence of mixed cell populations within the bone environment, it is difficult to isolate and determine direct cell-cell interactions that might impact the development of prostate carcinoma metastasis. The non-conventional mixed culture system developed in these studies provides an excellent in vitro model to investigate early outcomes of paracrine signalling between defined cell populations and to evaluate how these interactions might be impacted by other signalling pathways and/or therapeutic interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study presents evidence that Shh-expressing prostate cancer cells directly and specifically activate the Shh signalling pathway in pre-osteoblasts. Paracrine Shh signalling in pre-osteoblasts leads to osteoblast differentiation via a Gli1-dependent mechanism that does not require transcriptional upregulation of endogenous <italic>Runx2 </italic>expression.
