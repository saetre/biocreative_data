The cell-surface mucin MUC1 is a large glycoprotein which is highly expressed on the mucosal surface and limits the density of <italic>H. pylori</italic> in a murine infection model. We now demonstrate that by using the BabA and SabA adhesins, <italic>H. pylori</italic> bind MUC1 isolated from human gastric cells and MUC1 shed into gastric juice. Both <italic>H. pylori</italic> carrying these adhesins, and beads coated with MUC1 antibodies, induced shedding of MUC1 from MKN7 human gastric epithelial cells, and shed MUC1 was found bound to <italic>H. pylori</italic>. Shedding of MUC1 from non-infected cells was not mediated by the known MUC1 sheddases ADAM17 and MMP-14. However, knockdown of MMP-14 partially affected MUC1 release early in infection, whereas ADAM17 had no effect. Thus, it is likely that shedding is mediated both by proteases and by disassociation of the non-covalent interaction between the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits. <italic>H. pylori</italic> bound more readily to MUC1 depleted cells even when the bacteria lacked the BabA and SabA adhesins, showing that MUC1 inhibits attachment even when bacteria cannot bind to the mucin. Bacteria lacking both the BabA and SabA adhesins caused less apoptosis in MKN7 cells than wild-type bacteria, having a greater effect than deletion of the CagA pathogenicity gene. Deficiency of MUC1/Muc1 resulted in increased epithelial cell apoptosis, both in MKN7 cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, and in <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected mice. Thus, MUC1 protects the epithelium from non-MUC1 binding bacteria by inhibiting adhesion to the cell surface by steric hindrance, and from MUC1-binding bacteria by acting as a releasable decoy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The bacterium <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> can cause peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma and MALT lymphoma. <italic>H. pylori</italic> colonize the mucosal surface of the stomach, where adherence helps the bacteria to remain in the neutral and protected niche under the mucus layer, and helps it withstand the continuous mucus washing of the mucosal surface.

The cell-surface mucin MUC1 is highly expressed on the mucosal surface and limits the density of <italic>H. pylori</italic> in a murine infection model. We now demonstrate that the majority of <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains can bind to human MUC1 and that release of MUC1 following binding limits adhesion to the cell surface. Furthermore, MUC1 protects the epithelium from non-MUC1 binding bacteria by acting as a physical barrier to adhesion to other cell surface molecules.

Immunohistochemistry of cell layers incubated with the beads demonstrated that the MUC1-antibody-coated beads attached to the cell surface but that they were not endocytosed (data not shown).

This pattern is consistent with a loss of beads from the cell surface once the MUC1 binding sites on the beads are filled and/or the MUC1 on the epithelial cell surface is depleted. The amount of beads in the conditioned culture supernatant followed the opposite pattern, demonstrating that the decrease of beads attached to the cells is due to release into the supernatant rather than bleaching of the fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000617-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

We have now extended these observations by examining the mechanism by which this mucin can limit infection by <italic>H. pylori</italic>. Here we demonstrate that MUC1 protects the epithelial cell from both bacterial adhesion and apoptosis. When the pathogen does not bind to MUC1, the 200&#x02013;500 nm long extracellular domain of the mucin appears capable of physically distancing the bacteria from the host cell surface, thus sterically inhibiting adhesion to other potential cell surface ligands. When the pathogen does bind to MUC1, the extracellular domain of the mucin is released from the epithelial surface, thereby acting as a releasable decoy and preventing prolonged adherence. In the process <italic>H. pylori</italic> are coated with MUC1 via, as we demonstrate here, interactions between the mucin and the BabA and SabA adhesins. We propose that this would further prevent anchorage to the mucosal surface by blocking these key adhesins. Limiting attachment of the bacteria to the epithelial surface would also be expected to reduce pathogenicity, by restricting the functional activity of secretion systems such as that encoded by the Cag pathogenicity island, which delivers proinflammatory mediators into epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000617-Viala1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>An isogenic CagA deletion mutant induced less cell death in the polarized MKN7 cultures we established in microaerophilic conditions, consistent with previous studies in other cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000617-Minohara1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in our experiments which are the first to test the influence of SabA and BabA adhesins on apoptosis empirically, ablation of both adhesins had a substantially greater impact on <italic>H. pylori</italic> induced apoptosis than loss of CagA. Thus, both adhesion to the epithelial cell and CagA affect viability, but to get the maximal effect of CagA, <italic>H. pylori</italic> needs to bind to the epithelial cell via the lectin adhesins. Interestingly, at very high non-physiological bacterial infection densities, similar to those used by most researchers, these nuances were lost. Infection with BabA positive <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains has been associated with higher lymphocytic infiltration, increased epithelial proliferation, and the presence of glandular atrophy and intestinal metaplasia in human antral biopsies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000617-Yu1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, severe neutrophil infiltration and atrophy (important indicators of more severe pathology) are associated with the expression of functional SabA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000617-Yanai1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we showed that <italic>H. pylori</italic> induces apoptosis and necrosis in gastric epithelial cells in a dose dependent manner, and that an isogenic mutant strain lacking the BabA and SabA adhesins had diminished ability to induce cell death. This indicates that these adhesins are major determinants of cell surface binding and that it is the amount of adherent <italic>H. pylori</italic> that determines the impact on epithelial cell viability.</p><p>To inhibit bacterial access to the epithelial cells, the mucosal surfaces are covered with a mucus layer primarily composed of secreted mucins. This mucus layer is continuously secreted and transports away trapped material.

For example, in the human-like rhesus monkey model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000617-Lindn2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, monkeys secreting mucins with less <italic>H. pylori</italic> binding capacity develop higher <italic>H. pylori</italic> density infections and gastritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000617-Linden3">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

In cultured MKN7 cells we observed a progressive depletion of MUC1 as it was shed off the cell surface. In human patients with chronic gastritis, depletion of the MUC1 extracellular domain &#x003b1;-subunit, but not the transmembrane &#x003b2;-subunit, has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000617-Vinall2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is likely that during chronic infection rapid shedding of the extracellular domain of MUC1 occurs <italic>in vivo</italic>, producing a similar result to that we observed <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>We have shown that <italic>H. pylori</italic> adherence to live gastric epithelial cells is increased when the bacterial strain carries the BabA and SabA adhesins. However, adherence to live epithelial cells occurs even when these adhesins are absent, albeit to a reduced level.

During the initial contact with gastric cells, MUC1 inhibits adhesion of both MUC1-binding and non MUC1-binding <italic>H. pylori</italic> to epithelial cells. <italic>H. pylori</italic> bind to MUC1 isolated from epithelial cells as well as to MUC1 shed into the gastric juice of human patients. In this study we have shown that, <italic>in vitro</italic>, <italic>H. pylori</italic> carrying these adhesins caused the gastric epithelial cells to shed MUC1 which bound to the bacteria. Inert bacterial sized beads coated with MUC1 antibodies also caused shedding of MUC1, demonstrating that MUC1 can act as a releasable decoy following engagement by particulate ligands in a Toll like receptor independent manner. Our demonstration of progressive depletion of cellular MUC1 is consistent with a previous study where MUC1 expression decreased in Kato III cells after 4 h of co-culture with <italic>H. pylori</italic> (with unknown adhesion properties) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000617-Byrd1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, MMP-14 only partially affected MUC1 shedding during infection and had no influence on MUC1 shedding in non-infected cells, indicating that other factors are involved in MUC1 release. Although cleavage by another unknown MUC1 sheddase cannot be definitively excluded, the most likely scenario is disassociation of the non-covalent interaction between the transmembrane and extracellular domains at the SEA module, a site of cleavage during synthesis found in most cell surface mucins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000617-Macao1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000617-Wreschner1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Disassociation could occur due to conformational changes in MUC1 following binding or due to shear forces following binding to the highly motile bacteria. Additionally, secreted isoforms of <italic>MUC1</italic> expressed via alternative splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000617-Imbert1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, could potentially be shed without prior <italic>H. pylori</italic> binding and contribute to the MUC1 pool in the mucus and gastric juice. The pattern of focal binding of MUC1 to bacteria that we observed by confocal microscopy is consistent with binding of MUC1 to regions of the bacteria coming in contact with the cell surface, followed by MUC1 shedding and bacterial detachment. However, this pattern could also arise if the SabA and BabA adhesins are focally expressed or if they are aggregated on the bacterial surface following ligation by MUC1.</p><p>MUC1 confers resistance to apoptosis induced by genotoxic drugs, the <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> cytolethal distending toxin and oxidative stress <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000617-McAuley1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000617-Wei1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

Paradoxically, however, necrosis was lower in cells with reduced MUC1. A similar increase of damage induced apoptosis and delay of secondary necrosis has previously been described for mono(ADP-ribosyl)transferases, which control signal transduction pathways in response to cell damage during cell repair and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000617-Cerella1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.

Similarly, NF-&#x003ba;B regulates genes that control cell proliferation and cell survival, and NF-&#x003ba;B is constitutively active in some cancers. MUC1 interacts directly with the I&#x003ba;B kinase complex, resulting in degradation of the NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000617-Ahmad1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, high expression of MUC1, as occurs in the stomach and is commonly found in human cancers, confers increased proliferation and resistance to apoptosis both via &#x000df;-catenin and the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway. NF-&#x003ba;B is also the master regulator of inflammatory responses, including responses to <italic>H. pylori</italic>. In addition to a possible effect on NF-&#x003ba;B, it is possible that MUC1 modulates responses to PAMPs mediated by TLRs. In respiratory cells, MUC1 binding of bacterial flagellin (TLR5 ligand) appears to repress TLR5-mediated activation of inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000617-Lu1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000617-Lillehoj1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, in addition to limiting bacterial attachment to the cell surface, MUC1 may modulate inflammatory responses possibly limiting unnecessary responses when bacteria fail to stably bind to the cell surface.

VNTR length polymorphisms have been used to characterize these alleles and short VNTR alleles which encode MUC1 proteins with shorter extracellular glycosylated domains are associated with disease. Our data are consistent with the interpretation that shorter forms of MUC1 are less efficient at sterically inhibiting attachment or acting as releasable decoys, thereby allowing increased bacterial binding to the epithelial surface and exacerbation of pathology. Experiments where cells were transfected with MUC1 expressing differing VNTR lengths suggest that longer alleles are more efficient at binding <italic>H. pylori</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000617-Costa1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it is possible that these VNTR length polymorphisms are surrogate markers for SNP's encoding functional changes in other domains (for example, SNPs affecting cytoplasmic domain signaling or cleavage of the extracellular domain) or promoter polymorphisms affecting the level of MUC1 expression during infection.

The reaction efficiency was determined with a dilution series of cDNA containing the PCR products. Genes were normalized to the unregulated housekeeping gene GAPDH and the results were expressed as ratio of target gene and GAPDH expression (arbitrary units). Control experiments were also performed to ensure that GAPDH expression was not differentially regulated under the experimental conditions employed.</p></sec><sec id="s4m"><title>ADAM 17 and MMP-14 gene silencing in MKN7 cells with siRNA</title><p>siRNA specific for ADAM17 and MMP-14 as well as scrambled siRNA were chemically synthesized (Dharmacon Research, Lafayette, USA) as a mixture of four siRNAs targeting different regions of the same gene to enhance the silencing performance (21 mers, SMARTpool).
