Here we report that in human embryonic stem cells Lin28 facilitates the expression of the pivotal pluripotency factor Oct4 at the post-transcriptional level. We provide evidence that Lin28 binds Oct4 mRNA directly through high affinity sites within its coding region and that an interaction between Lin28 and RNA helicase A (RHA) may play a part in the observed regulation. We further demonstrate that decreasing RHA levels impairs Lin28-dependent stimulation of translation in a reporter system. Taken together with previous studies showing that RHA is required for efficient translation of a specific class of mRNAs, these findings suggest a novel mechanism by which Lin28 may affect target mRNA expression and represent the first evidence of post-transcriptional regulation of Oct4 expression by Lin28 in human embryonic stem cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Lin28 is an evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding protein that plays a critical role in the developmental timing in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In the mouse, Lin28 is widely expressed in early stage embryos, with expression declining and becoming restricted to a limited number of tissues as embryonic development proceeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In human tissues, Lin28 expression has been detected in normal ovarian surface epithelium and in mature oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Lin28 expression is high in human and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, and decreases dramatically during ES cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The biological importance of Lin28 is further underscored by its ability to facilitate the reprogramming of human somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Predominantly cytoplasmic, Lin28 plays pleiotropic roles in the regulation of gene expression. Lin28 has been shown to block let-7 microRNA processing in embryonic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11 B12">8&#x02013;12</xref>). Two recent studies, however, have demonstrated that the let-7 family microRNAs are not the only targets of Lin28 regulation&#x02014;a handful of other microRNAs are also substrates of Lin28 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Lin28 has also been reported to bind a specific subset of mRNAs and to modulate their translation. For example, in differentiating skeletal muscle cells, Polesskaya <italic>et al.</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) demonstrated that Lin28 binds IGF-2 mRNA and stimulates its translation. Similarly, our studies using mouse ES cells identified mRNAs of a subset of cell cycle-related genes as putative Lin28 targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In an attempt to further understand Lin28-mediated translational regulation in muscle cells, Polesskaya <italic>et al.</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) performed affinity chromatography and proteomics analysis and found that the translation initiation factor eIF3beta interacts specifically with Lin28, suggesting a role for Lin28 in the modulation of translation initiation. However, this interaction has not yet been reported in other cell types.</p><p>Oct4, known also as Oct3 and Oct3/4, is a POU-domain transcription factor that regulates transcription via binding to an octamer motif located in the promoter and enhancer regions of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The mouse and human Oct4 orthologs exhibit a high conservation of nucleotide sequence and genomic organization. Essential for regulating cell fate during early development, Oct4 is also critical for maintaining self-renewal and pluripotency of ES cells. A less than two-fold increase in Oct4 level results in ES cell differentiation into primitive endoderm and mesoderm, while reduction of Oct4 expression induces differentiation towards trophectoderm, suggesting that a precise level of Oct4 is required for maintaining pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). To further highlight its key role in pluripotency, Oct4 was recently demonstrated to be both necessary and sufficient to reprogram mouse adult neural stem cells to pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). These results also suggest that ES cells must possess a sophisticated regulatory network to maintain Oct4 expression at an optimal level. In line with this view, multiple factors have been identified that regulate Oct4 expression at the transcriptional level. Among the well-studied regulators are Nanog, Sox2, FoxD3 and Oct4 itself, which partner with one another to activate the transcription of Oct4. In fact, Oct4 represses its own transcription when over-expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Thus, these factors apparently work in concert to establish regulatory circuitry composed of autoregulatory and feed-forward loops that contribute to the maintenance of pluripotency and self-renewal.</p><p>In this report, we reveal a novel mechanism of regulation of Oct4 expression: regulation at the post-transcriptional level by Lin28. Importantly, we identify RNA helicase A (RHA) as a novel interacting partner of Lin28 and provide evidence that this interaction may play a role in the Lin28-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Antibodies, plasmids and siRNAs</title><p>The anti-Lin28 antibody (Abcam, ab46020), anti-RHA (Abcam, ab54593), anti-beta-actin (Sigma, A2228), anti-beta-tubulin (Abcam, ab6046), anti-gapdh (Abcam, ab9484), anti-Oct4 (Chemicon, AB3209), anti-Flag (Sigma, F3165), anti-PABP (Santa Cruz, sc-32318), anti-eIF3beta (Santa Cruz, sc-30251) and rabbit pre-immune serum (SouthernBiotech, 0040-01) were purchased. siLin28 (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool, L-018411-01), siLin28-2 (an equal molar mixture of two siRNAs, J-018411-09 and J-018411-11), siRHA (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool, L-009950-00-0005) and consiRNA (D-001810-10-05) were purchased from Dharmacon.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture and siRNA transfection</title><p>Human ES line H1 (listed in the NIH hES registry under the name WA01, WiCell) was maintained as undifferentiated state by culturing on Matrigel-coated plates (B&#x00026;D) in feeder-free and components defined conditions to avoid any feeder-related contamination to the experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).

The B1U1 luciferase construct was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The constructs were transfected into HEK293 cells, together with increasing amounts of Flag-Lin28 DNA. In addition, a Renilla reporter was included in all transfections for normalization purposes.

The amount of total plasmid DNA per well was 400 ng that included 100 ng of firefly reporter DNA, 2 ng of Renilla DNA, and the indicated amounts of Flag-Lin28. Luciferase activities were determined using a TD 20/20n (Turner BioSystems) and the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Luciferase mRNA levels were determined by RT-qPCR and levels plotted after normalization against beta-tubulin and Renilla mRNAs. In the case of the combined RHA siRNA knockdown and luciferase assays, HEK293 cells were transfected with siRHA or control siRNA as usual. Seventy-two hours later, cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid DNAs which include 100 ng of firefly reporter DNA containing the Oct4 R2, 2 ng of Renilla DNA, and 0 or 20 ng of Flag-Lin28. Luciferase activities were assayed 24 h later.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> transcription and UV-XL assays</title><p>These were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).

The resulting PCR fragments were gel purified and used to generate R2, R3, R4 and B1U1 RNAs using MEGAscript T7 (Ambion, AM1334) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The resulting RNA fragments were used in the XL and competition assays. To prepare cell extract for XL, Flag-Lin28 was transfected into HEK293 cells and cell extracts prepared 24 h later by incubating cells in 10 cell volumes of lysis buffer [0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 1 mM DTT, 1X protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem)] on ice for 20 min, followed by centrifugation to remove insoluble material.

To explore the possibility of Oct4 mRNA being a regulatory target of Lin28, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments. We used an antibody specific for Lin28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) to isolate RNPs from human embryonic stem (hES) cell line H1 and embryonic carcinoma (EC) PA-1 cells. Both cells express Lin28 and Oct4, which are localized predominantly to the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1071/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). Following IP, RNAs were extracted from the IP complexes and used to generate cDNAs that were subsequently subjected to quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> (upper panels), the amounts of mRNAs present in the Lin28-containing complexes (blue bars) relative to those in the pre-immune IgG IP complexes (which were arbitrarily set as 1, red bars) are shown. Beta-actin mRNA was used as a control for non-specific RNA binding. While Oct4 mRNA exhibited &#x0223c;5-fold enrichment in the Lin28-containing RNPs in both H1 and PA-1 cells, the mRNAs for Nanog and Sox2, two other pluripotency factors, did not. The preferential enrichment of Oct4 mRNA in the Lin28-containing complexes likely reflects its high affinity for Lin28, which is suggested by the lack of enrichment of the actin mRNA that is present at a comparable level in the extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, bottom panels). Therefore, these results together suggest that Oct4 mRNA could be a target for Lin28 regulation at the post-transcriptional level. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Lin28 is specifically enriched in Oct4 mRNA-containing RNPs.

We therefore asked whether Lin28 affects Oct4 translation. First, we performed siRNA knockdown experiments to assess the effect of Lin28 depletion on Oct4 expression. Lin28-specific siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) or a control siRNA was transfected into H1 or PA-1 cells. Seventy-two hours later, RNAs and proteins were extracted from the transfected cells and subjected to RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. We observed an average of 87&#x02013;88% reduction of Lin28 at the protein level in Lin28 siRNA transfected compared to control siRNA transfected H1 and PA-1 cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, left panels, top blots, compare lanes 2 to 1). Importantly, we also observed an average of 37&#x02013;41% reduction in Oct4 protein levels in H1 and PA-1 cells, respectively, that were transfected with Lin28 siRNA versus control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, left panels, second blots from the top, compare lanes 2 to 1), while the housekeeping Gapdh protein levels were not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, left panels, third blots from the top, compare lanes 2 to 1). The efficacy and specificity of the Lin28 siRNA was confirmed by RT-qPCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, right panels, transfection of Lin28-specific siRNA leads to a reduction in Lin28 mRNA level by at least 95% in both H1 and PA-1 cells, compared to that of control siRNA. Meanwhile, the levels of the untargeted Oct4 and beta-actin mRNAs were not affected, suggesting that the Lin28 siRNA effect was specific. We also tested Lin28-specific siRNAs targeted to different regions of Lin28 mRNA and obtained similar knockdown effects (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1071/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). While this appears to be in contrast to our previous work with mouse ES cells where we did not observe a decrease in Oct4 protein level following Lin28 siRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), it is likely that the discrepancy is due to insufficient Lin28 knockdown in the previous experiments. Insufficient Lin28 knockdown may also account for the failure to observe Oct4 level reduction in hES cells, which was indicated by the estimated siRNA knockdown efficiency of &#x0003c;70% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Consistent with this, we have been unable to observe significant Oct4 protein level decreases in experiments where Lin28 knockdown efficiencies were &#x0003c;80% (data not shown). Taken together with the fact that Oct4 mRNA levels were not affected by Lin28 siRNA knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, right panels), our results suggest that Lin28 may regulate Oct4 at the translational level. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Lin28 depletion leads to decreased levels of Oct4 in hES cells and EC cells. H1 (<bold>A</bold>) or PA-1 cells (<bold>B</bold>) were transfected with control siRNA (consiRNA) or Lin28-specific siRNA (siLin28). Seventy-two hours later, RNAs and proteins were extracted from transfected cells, and the levels measured by RT-qPCR and Western blot, respectively. In the left panels, representative results of two Western blot analyses are shown. In lanes 1 and 2, cells were transfected with consiRNA and siLin28, respectively. The antibodies used in the Western blot analyses are labeled on the left. The Lin28, Oct4 and Gapdh protein levels in siLin28-transfected cells relative to those in consiRNA-transfected cells (which were set as 100%) are shown on the right. Protein levels on Western gels were determined using Bio-Rad Quantity One software, and calculated after normalization against beta-tubulin loading control. Average numbers of two (A) or three (B) independent experiments are presented. In the right panels, relative mRNA levels are shown after normalization against beta-tubulin control. mRNA levels in cells transfected with consiRNA were arbitrarily set as 1. Numbers are mean &#x000b1; SD (<italic>n</italic> = 3).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp1071f2"/></fig></p><p>Based on the fact that mRNAs actively being translated are associated with polysomes, we asked whether Lin28 is associated with Oct4 mRNA in polysomes. Thus, we carried out IP experiments using polysome fractions prepared from H1 cells. We reasoned that if stimulation of translation by Lin28 is target mRNA-specific, we would expect to see an enrichment of a target mRNA in Lin28-containing polysomes, while non-target mRNAs would not be enriched. Consistent with this prediction, we observed a reproducible 2-fold enrichment of Oct4 mRNA in Lin28-associated polysomes, while no enrichment was seen with mRNAs for Nanog, Sox2 and beta-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The observed difference in the fold of enrichment between IP RNP (5-fold enrichment, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) and polysomes (2-fold enrichment, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B) is likely due to the different conditions used for the two types of IP experiments. Taken together, these results suggest that Lin28 may play a role in Oct4 mRNA translation. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Lin28 preferentially associates with Oct4 mRNA in polysomes.

To further dissect the molecular mechanism by which Lin28 may modulate Oct4 translation, we set out to identify Lin28-interacting proteins in hES cells. We hypothesized that Lin28 stimulates Oct4 mRNA translation by actively recruiting components of translational machinery to the mRNA. Thus, we performed co-IP experiments using the anti-Lin28 antibody to isolate Lin28-containing protein complexes from H1 cells. Co-IP was carried out in the presence of an excess amount of RNase A to disrupt any RNA-bridged interactions that are formed through two RNA-binding proteins simultaneously binding to the same RNA molecule. Protein components in the Lin28-containing complexes were resolved by SDS&#x02013;PAGE, followed by mass spectrometry analysis of protein bands that were present in the anti-Lin28 IP complexes and not in the pre-immune IP complexes. We identified RHA as a putative Lin28-interacting protein (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1071/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>).

Importantly, the interaction between Lin28 and RHA is direct since poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), which binds to all polyadenylated mRNAs, was not present in the anti-Lin28 co-IP complexes (Lane 4, third panel from the top). Interestingly, we also observed an interaction between Lin28 and the translation initiation factor eIF3beta that was identified by Polesskaya <italic>et al.</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) as a Lin28-interacting partner in muscle cells, although under our assay conditions the interaction with Lin28 was much weaker compared to RHA. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Lin28 interacts with RHA.

Importantly, in the cells where RHA was down-regulated, the ability of Lin28 to stimulate the translation of a firefly luciferase reporter gene was also decreased.

These results thus indicate that RHA may be an important partner of Lin28 in the regulation of translation of target mRNAs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We show here that Lin28 associates with Oct4 mRNA in RNPs and polysomes in human ES cells and EC cells. The functional significance of these associations is underscored by the fact that inhibition of Lin28 leads to reduced Oct4 protein levels and that Lin28 stimulates luciferase activity from reporter transcripts containing putative Lin28 recognition sites from the Oct4 mRNA. Taken together, these observations suggest a role for Lin28 in the regulation of Oct4 translation. We have further identified RHA as a novel Lin28-interacting protein and provide evidence that this interaction may be important for Lin28&#x02019;s function in regulating target mRNA translation.</p><p>In humans, two isoforms of Oct4, Oct4A and Oct4B, are produced via alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Oct4A has been demonstrated to be essential for &#x02018;stemness&#x02019; by acting as a transcription factor with a pivotal role in the regulation of expression of genes important for the maintenance of pluripotency and the self-renewal ability of ES cells. On the other hand, the function of Oct4B is currently unknown, although multiple Oct4B isoforms resulting from alternative translation initiation have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Owing to its clear role in pluripotency, it is not surprising that cells have evolved complex mechanisms to control Oct4 expression to ensure appropriate levels of its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Until now, however, all pathways involved in the regulation of Oct4 expression have been reported to be at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Our studies demonstrating that Oct4 expression is also modulated at the post-transcriptional level by another pluripotency factor, Lin28, further highlight the complexity of this important regulatory circuitry.</p><p>Our studies in mouse ES cells have shown that Lin28 plays a role in ES cell proliferation partly by modulating the expression of cell cycle-related genes including those for cyclin A, cyclin B, cdk4 and the replication-dependent histone H2a at the post-transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Here, we reveal yet another function of Lin28&#x02014;affecting the expression of Oct4 which is essential for the pluripotency and self-renewal of ES cells. Taken together with the notion that Lin28 inhibits the production of let-7 microRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11 B12">8&#x02013;12</xref>) involved in cell growth and differentiation, we speculate that all three functions of Lin28 may contribute collaboratively in the process of reprogramming human somatic cells to iPS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Related to this work, Darr and Benvenisty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) have reported that overexpression of Lin28 in human ES cells triggers ES cell differentiation preferentially towards the primitive endoderm lineage, a phenotype similar to that seen when Oct4 expression was slightly elevated (&#x0003c;2-fold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Based on our findings that Lin28 stimulates Oct4 production, Lin28 overexpression might well lead to an increased level of Oct4 [which was not examined in the work of Darr and Benvenisty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>)], which subsequently permits lineage-specific differentiation.</p><p>Despite accumulating evidence pointing to the role of Lin28 as a target-specific translational regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>), the precise mechanism underlying the process is unclear. The finding that Lin28 interacts with the translation initiation factor eIF3beta (this report and ref. 15) is intriguing, given that translation initiation is the rate-limiting step of translation. During initiation, ribosomes are recruited to the mRNA by eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) that include eIF4E, eIF4A, eIF4G and eIF3. eIF3beta is one of the 13 subunits of the mammalian eIF3 complex (27 and references therein). The interaction between Lin28 and eIF3beta may increase the efficiency of assembly of translation initiation complexes on an mRNA, thus facilitating ribosome loading.</p><p>In addition to eIF3beta, we have identified RHA as another Lin28-interacting partner in hES cells. RHA (also called DHX9 and NDHII) is a highly conserved DEAD-box protein that functions in multiple cellular processes, including transcription, splicing, nuclear export, translation, and RNAi, by catalyzing RNA&#x02013;RNA and RNA&#x02013;protein rearrangements in RNP complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). In particular, RHA has been shown to promote translation of a specific class of mRNAs that contain highly structured 5&#x02032; UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). These include the cellular JUND growth-control gene and viral transcripts that contain a post-transcriptional control element (PCE) in their 5&#x02032; UTRs. It has been proposed that complex 5&#x02032; UTR structures create a barrier for efficient ribosomal scanning of the transcripts and that direct binding of RHA to the PCE stimulates RNA&#x02013;RNA and RNA&#x02013;protein rearrangements necessary for efficient translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>Most RNA helicases characterized <italic>in vitro</italic> lack RNA substrate specificity, yet <italic>in vivo</italic> perform very specific functions with no redundancy, supporting a view that these RNA helicases require cofactors to convey specificity <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). We speculate that RHA may function through interaction with Lin28 as a cofactor to specify its RNA substrates. This is supported by the following observations. First, Lin28 interacts with RHA in an RNA-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). Second, down-regulation of RHA impedes Lin28-dependent stimulation of translation from transcripts containing Lin28-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B and C). Third, Lin28-binding sequences that confer translational stimulatory effects have been mapped to 3&#x02032; UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) as well as to the coding regions of target mRNAs (17; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), instead of 5&#x02032;UTRs. Fourth, we find no obvious sequence and/or structural similarity between the Lin28-binding sequences and the post-transcriptional control element PCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). We therefore postulate that Lin28 may selectively bind RNA substrates by recognition of high affinity binding sites and subsequently recruit eIF3beta (to enhance translation initiation) as well as RHA (to facilitate RNP remodeling during translation) to enhance translation efficiency.</p><p>Finally, RHA has recently been reported to be associated with RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC), and to promote their formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). In addition, Lin28 has been shown to inhibit Dicer (a component of the RISC) cleavage of let-7 pre-microRNAs <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Taken together, these observations raise the possibility that RHA-Lin28 interaction provides a molecular link between these processes.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1071/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Connecticut Stem Cell Research Grants (06SCA02 and 09SCAYALE14) to Y.H.; Connecticut Stem Cell Research Grants Program Core Award (06SCD01) and Hybrid Award (06SCE01) Project 2 to Haifan Lin.
