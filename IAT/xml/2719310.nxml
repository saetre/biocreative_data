To improve our understanding of HIF-1 regulation by kinome, we screened a kinase-specific small interference RNA library using a hypoxia-response element (HRE) luciferase reporter assay under hypoxic conditions. This screen determined that depletion of cellular SMG-1 kinase most significantly modified cellular HIF-1 activity in hypoxia. SMG-1 is the newest and least studied member of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinase family, which consists of ATM, ATR, DNA-PKcs, mTOR, and SMG-1. We individually depleted members of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinase family, and only SMG-1 deficiency significantly augmented HIF-1 activity in hypoxia. We subsequently discovered that SMG-1 kinase activity was activated by hypoxia, and depletion of SMG-1 up-regulated MAPK activity under low oxygen. Suppressing cellular MAPK by silencing ERK1/2 or by treatment with U0126, a MAPK inhibitor, partially blocked the escalation of HIF-1 activity resulting from SMG-1 deficiency in hypoxic cells. Increased expression of SMG-1 but not kinase-dead SMG-1 effectively inhibited the activity of HIF-1&#x003b1;. In addition, cellular SMG-1 deficiency increased secretion of the HIF-1&#x003b1;-regulated angiogenic factor, vascular epidermal growth factor, and survival factor, carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9), as well as promoted the hypoxic cell motility. Taken together, we discovered that SMG-1 negatively regulated HIF-1&#x003b1; activity in hypoxia, in part through blocking MAPK activation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="CS100">National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id rid="CS100">CA079871</award-id><award-id rid="CS100">CA114059</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Solid tumors contain poorly vascularized areas that are hypoxic. Hypoxic tumor cells are resistant to apoptosis, prone to migrate to less hypoxic regions of the body (metastasis), and produce pro-angiogenic factors to stimulate neovascularization leading to tumor oxygenation and tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In fact, hypoxic tumors are typically associated with poor patient prognosis due to the aggressive and pro-angiogenic nature of hypoxic tumor cells, as well as their resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Hypoxia-induced cancer cell responses are regulated at multiple levels, including gene transcription, protein translation, post-translational modification, and subcellular translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2"><sup>2</sup></xref> a heterodimer consisting of a HIF-1&#x003b1; and a HIF-1&#x003b2; subunit, is the master regulator of these cellular responses to low oxygen. HIF-1&#x003b1; activity is regulated by O<sub>2</sub>-dependent degradation and by the rate of transcription and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Moreover, oncogenic ERK-dependent phosphorylation of HIF-1&#x003b1; and its coactivator p300 promotes the transcriptional activity of HIF-1&#x003b1; possibly through enhancing the accessibility of RNA polymerase II to the promoters containing hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>HIF-1 binds to HREs in the promoters or enhancers of target genes and activates the expression of at least 150 genes encoding proteins that regulate cell metabolism, survival, motility, basement membrane integrity, angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, and other functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In particular, hypoxia-induced HIF-1 activation up-regulates the expression of a metastatic gene (lysyl oxidase), critical angiogenic factors (VEGF-A and Ang-2), and survival factors (carbonic anhydrase IX and XII) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Among these molecules, HIF-1&#x003b1;, VEGF, and carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9) proteins are clinical biomarkers for hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>The phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family of high molecular mass signaling proteins comprises ATM, ATR, DNA-PKcs, mTOR, and SMG-1. PIKKs are serine-threonine kinases and mediate cellular reaction to a variety of stresses, including genome and RNA surveillance and accessibility of nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Among them, SMG-1 is the newest and least studied member of the PIKKs, and was first recognized for its role in regulating nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, a cellular surveillance mechanism that degrades mRNA transcripts containing premature translation termination codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). So far, SMG-1 is known for responding to different cellular stresses. For example, like the genotoxic stress-responsive kinases, ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs that SMG-1 closely resembles, SMG-1 is activated by DNA damage and phosphorylates p53 during genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Moreover, SMG-1 is involved in cell survival during tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;-induced stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), lifespan regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), as well as in cell cycle checkpoint signaling under oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>It has been demonstrated that hypoxic stress inhibits mTOR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), which may lead to suppression of HIF-1&#x003b1; translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). ATR and ATM were also indicated in the repair of hypoxia/re-oxygenation-induced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). However, the role of SMG-1 in regulating cellular response to hypoxia is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that SMG-1 was activated by hypoxia in cancer cells and consequently suppressed HIF-1&#x003b1; activity in part via inhibition of the MAPK pathway, thereby reducing the hypoxia-induced secretion of angiogenic factor, VEGF, and survival factor, CA9, as well as restricting the migration of hypoxic cancer cells.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Cell Culture</title><p>The human cell lines HeLa, HEK293, and SKOV-3 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

In this assay, hypoxia strongly increased HRE luciferase activity and HIF-1&#x003b1; protein stabilization in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). Among the 779 kinases screened by siRNA-mediated silencing, depletion of 18 kinases significantly increased HIF-1 activity and another 10 kinases decreased HIF-1 activity under hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>). Among these kinases, the depletion of SMG-1 impacted HIF-1 activity most significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>). SMG-1 belongs to the PIKK family of protein kinases. We found that siRNA-mediated depletion of SMG-1, but not other members of the PIKK family, ATM, ATR, DNA-PKcs, and mTOR, markedly increased the HIF-1 activity in hypoxic cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>). To further confirm that the increase in hypoxia-induced HIF-1 activity in SMG-1-depleted cells was directly related to an on-target effect of the siRNA, we repeated this experiment using four different siRNA duplexes to deplete cellular SMG-1 and obtained similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>). Next, we forced expression of wild-type (WT) SMG-1 and its kinase-dead (KD) mutant separately in SMG-1-depleted cell and found that forced expression of WT, but not KD SMG-1, could reverse the increased HIF-1 activity observed in hypoxic tumor cells depleted of cellular SMG-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>).

HIF-1 is a master transcriptional activator of &#x0223c;100&#x02013;200 genes that promote adaptation and survival under hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). To identify novel kinase regulators of HIF-1, we screened a siRNA library targeting 779 human kinases and used the HRE reporter assay as readout under hypoxia. Among these 779 human kinases, we found that 18 kinases positively regulated HIF-1 activity. Especially, the depletion of ERK1 and MAPK3K1, two key kinases of the ERK MAPK pathway, significantly decreased HIF-1 activity. It has been reported that treatment of tumor cells with the MEK1/2 inhibitors PD98059 or U0216, or expression of a dominant-negative form of ERK1, blocked HIF-1 activation in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Herein, using specific siRNA targeting of cellular ERK1 or MAPK3K1, we confirmed that the MAPK positively regulated the HIF-1 activity under hypoxia.</p><p>On the other hand, we discovered that the depletion of 10 other kinases significantly increased the HIF-1 activity. Among these kinases, it has been reported that suppression of DUSP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) and VRK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) could result in up-regulation of HIF-1 activity in hypoxic conditions. Interestingly, of these novel candidates that negatively regulate HIF-1 activity, the depletion of SMG-1 had the strongest enhancing effect on HIF-1 activity.</p><p>SMG-1, the newest member of the PIKK family, contains a large (&#x0003e;1000 amino acid) insert region between the kinase domain and FATC domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Moreover, SMG-1 is found in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), unlike the related genotoxic stress-responsive kinases, ATM and ATR, which are confined to the nucleus in most cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). The cytoplasmic presence of SMG-1 suggests that this PIKK may play additional roles other than stress signaling restricted within the nucleus such as DNA repair. In this study, we found that SMG-1 was activated under hypoxic conditions, the depletion of cellular SMG-1 significantly enhanced HIF-1&#x003b1; activity, and increasing expression of SMG-1 markedly inhibited HIF-1&#x003b1; activity. These results implied that SMG-1 activity potently suppressed HIF-1-dependent cellular responses in hypoxic cells. However, the activity of mTOR, another member of the PIKK family, was inhibited by hypoxic stress, thereby suppressing HIF-1&#x003b1; protein translation. These observations suggest that hypoxia induces activation of SMG-1 and deactivation of mTOR pathways to contain the HIF-1&#x003b1; activity at post-translational and translational levels, correspondingly, thereby maintaining appropriate cellular responses for numerous physiological and pathological conditions under hypoxia.</p><p>HIF-1&#x003b1; activity is regulated in two major ways. The first relies on hydroxylation-dependent degradation/inactivation. The second involves control of HIF-1&#x003b1; protein synthesis via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT and MAPK pathways. To investigate the mechanism of HIF-1&#x003b1; activity in SMG-1-deficient cells, we first studied the effect on the stability of HIF-1&#x003b1; of SMG-1 deficiency under hypoxia and found that SMG-1 knockdown did not affect HIF-1&#x003b1; stability, which suggests that SMG-1 does not involve in the regulation of von Hippel-Lindau ubiquitin ligase complex. HIF-1&#x003b1; activity is also regulated by AKT, mTOR, and MAPK. To determine whether the activated SMG-1 kinase had an effect on other cellular kinase cascades, we analyzed the ERK1/2, mTOR, AKT, and BMK1 kinase pathways and found that depletion of cellular SMG-1 altered only the intensity of ERK1/2 activation. ERK1/2 activity is up-regulated by oxygen deficiency and is involved in HIF-1 activation in hypoxic tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Our siRNA library screen result indicated that ERK1 is a positive regulator of HIF-1&#x003b1;. Furthermore, we found that SMG-1 inhibited the HIF-1&#x003b1; transactivation activity in part though suppressing MAPK ERK1 in hypoxia. ERK1/2 has been shown to phosphorylate HIF-1&#x003b1; <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). MAPKs are critical for the transactivation activities of both HIF-1&#x003b1; and p300 through promoting HIF-1-p300 interaction by mediating the phosphorylation of these two molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Therefore, it is very likely that the activation of SMG-1 by low oxygen restrains the hypoxia-induced malignant responses in tumor cells partially through inhibition of the MAPK pathway and the consequent HIF-1&#x003b1; activation.</p><p>Hypoxia promotes a range of malignant responses in tumor cells such as proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, migration, and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Herein, we demonstrated that SMG-1 activity is critical, in hypoxic tumor cells, in repressing HIF-1 activity and consequent secretion of the angiogenic factor, VEGF, and the survival factor, CA9, and in blocking cell motility under low oxygen conditions as well. There are reports from the COSMIC data base of The Sanger Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) describing mutations of SMG-1 in its kinase, TS, and insertion regions that are found in human breast cancers. It should be interesting to further investigate whether these mutations compromise the ability of SMG-1 to suppress HIF-1 activity in hypoxia and consequently augment the malignant potential of hypoxic breast tumor cells.</p><p>Herein, we demonstrated that SMG-1 was a strong negative regulator for hypoxia-induced tumor cell responses such as the secretion of angiogenic factor, VEGF, and survival factor, CA9, as well as for hypoxic tumor cell motility. Thus, our findings have important prognostic and therapeutic implications for the treatment of hypoxic tumors. Analysis of SMG-1 expression levels or mutations in human cancer could be used as a biological marker to predict efficacy of treatment with MAPK or angiogenesis inhibitors. SMG-1 targeted drugs up-regulating SMG-1 protein, mRNA levels, and/or its activity could be used for treating cancer patients, in combination with angiogenesis inhibitors and/or other traditional cancer therapeutic approaches such as chemo- and radiotherapies.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="supported-by"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by National Institutes of Health Grants CA079871 and CA114059 (to J.-D.
