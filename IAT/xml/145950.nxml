Here we show that the fork head encoded protein binds to an upstream regulatory region of the larval salivary gland glue protein gene Sgs3. Mobility shift assay in the presence of an anti-Fork head antibody demonstrated that the Fork head factor interacts with the TGTTTGC box shown to be involved in tissue-specific Sgs3 expression. Experiments employing a set of oligonucleotide competitors revealed that Fork head binding was prevented by the same single base substitutions that were previously shown to interfere with the TGTTTGC element function in vivo. Furthermore, the anti-Fork head antibody bound to &#x0003e;60 sites of polytene chromosomes, including the puffs of all Sgs genes and Fork head protein was detected in the nuclei of salivary glands of larvae of all examined stages. These data provide experimental evidence for the hypothesis that the protein encoded by the fork head gene is required initially for salivary gland formation and is utilized subsequently in the control of larval genes specifically expressed in this organ.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
