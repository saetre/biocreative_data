Among the components identified is 2-enoyl thioester reductase/mitochondrial enoyl-CoA reductase (Etr1/Mecr), which catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of <italic>trans-</italic>2-enoyl thioesters, generating saturated acyl-groups. Although the FAS type II pathway is highly conserved, its physiological role in fatty acid synthesis, which apparently occurs simultaneously with breakdown of fatty acids in the same subcellular compartment in mammals, has remained an enigma. To study the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of the mitochondrial FAS in mammals, with special reference to <italic>Mecr</italic>, we generated mice overexpressing <italic>Mecr</italic> under control of the mouse metallothionein-1 promoter. These <italic>Mecr</italic> transgenic mice developed cardiac abnormalities as demonstrated by echocardiography <italic>in vivo</italic>, heart perfusion <italic>ex vivo</italic>, and electron microscopy <italic>in situ</italic>. Moreover, the <italic>Mecr</italic> transgenic mice showed decreased performance in endurance exercise testing. Our results showed a ventricular dilatation behind impaired heart function upon <italic>Mecr</italic> overexpression, concurrent with appearance of dysmorphic mitochondria. Furthermore, the data suggested that inappropriate expression of genes of FAS II can result in the development of hereditary cardiomyopathy.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Progress in molecular cardiology has revealed circumstances predisposing individuals to development of cardiomyopathies.

Transgenic construct consisting of the MT-1 promoter driving mouse <italic>Mecr</italic> expression; a 5&#x02032; noncoding region of the human <italic>ODC</italic> gene which includes the first two introns; full length mouse <italic>Etr1/Mecr</italic> cDNA including the translation initiation codon (ATG) and the stop codon in frame; followed by the 3&#x02032; UTR and termination signal of the mouse <italic>Mecr</italic> gene (Term. Mecr). C. Southern blot genotyping, schematic presentation of the integration of the <italic>Mecr</italic> transgenic construct into the mouse genome. Mouse genomic DNA was digested by <italic>Bam</italic>HI, giving a 6 kb fragment which is a marker for the transgene construct. The arrow head showed the size of the transgene construct (&#x0223c;6 kb); the unfilled arrow shows an additional 9.5 kb fragment recognized by the probe only in tg62. The greater intensity of the 6 kb transgene band over that of the single-copy wild type band seen at approximately 4.3 kb in all three DNA samples demonstrates integration of multiple copies of the construct. The 9.5 kb signal arises from the 5&#x02032; end of the construct together with about 3.5 kb from the integration site. D. Reverse template PCR analysis of <italic>Mecr</italic> expression levels. Oligonucleotides which can recognize <italic>Mecr</italic> mRNA were used in left picture.

The heart rate, left ventricular systolic pressure, coronary flow, and oxygen consumption were measured. There was a stabilization period of at least 30-minutes before electrical pacing with an epicardial Ag/AgCl electrode was begun at a voltage 50&#x00025; above the threshold. All experiments ended with freeze-clamping of the heart.</p><p>The heart was enclosed in a thermostated, light-tight chamber equipped with fiber optics for epicardial readout of reflectance spectrum changes (605 nm versus 630 nm for cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase) and fluorescence (emission above 510 nm with 465-nm excitation for flavin) by means of a three-channel spectrophotometer-fluorometer and the data collected via DAQ-card (National Instruments, Austin, TX) and stored on a PC at 2-s intervals. Left ventricular pressure was monitored through the ventricular wall by inserting a saline-filled Teflon cannula connected to a Statham P231D pressure transducer linked to a Statham SP1400 pressure monitor. The pressure wave signal was fed to a Lab-PC&#x0002b; data acquisition card (National Instruments, Austin, TX) and heart function parameters (heart rate, peak systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and peak pressure development) were calculated on-line with custom designed software and stored on a computer at 4-s intervals. Coronary flow was measured during the experiments by using a drop counter with an analog frequency output. Oxygen consumption was calculated from the arteriovenous concentration difference multiplied by coronary flow.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Metabolite assays</title><p>The heart was quick-frozen with aluminum clamps precooled in liquid nitrogen, and stored in liquid N<sub>2</sub> until processed further.

The previous protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005589-Massett1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> was revised slightly with respect to speed and inclination. Two days before the exercise performance test, all mice were familiarized with running on a motorized running belt with rotating flexible plastic strips at the rear of the treadmill to prod the mice to run. 10 min exercise with a treadmill inclination of 9&#x000b0; was used for the familiarization run. Treadmill speed was 9 m/min on the first day and 11 m/min on the second day. Before the final test, mice were placed on the belts and allowed to adapt to the surroundings for 5 min before running. The treadmill was started at a speed of 9 m/min with a 0&#x000b0; slope for 9 min. Then the speed and inclination were raised to 11 m/min and 6&#x000b0;, respectively. Speed was increased by 1&#x02013;3 m/min every 3 min to a maximum of 28 m/min, and the inclination gradually increased by 3&#x000b0; every 9 min to a maximum of 12&#x000b0;. Exercise was stopped when mice were unable to maintain running despite repeated contact with the rotating plastic strips. Each mouse was then immediately returned to its home cage from the treadmill. Exercise performance was assessed from the performance tests based on the following three parameters: the duration of the run (in minutes), the distance run (in meters), and vertical work performance (in kg&#x02022;m). Vertical work performance was calculated as the product of body weight (kg) and vertical distance (meters), where vertical distance equals distance run &#x000d7; sin&#x003b1;, where &#x003b1; is the slope of the treadmill from 0&#x000b0; to 12&#x000b0;.</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Values are expressed as mean&#x000b1;standard deviation (SD) and analyzed by the Student's <italic>t</italic> test for detecting significant differences.
