HCV non-structural protein 4A (NS4A) binds to the N-terminal NS3 protease domain to stimulate NS3 serine protease activity. In addition, the NS3 protease domain enhances the RNA binding, ATPase, and RNA unwinding activities of the C-terminal NS3 helicase domain (NS3hel). To determine whether NS3hel enhances the NS3 serine protease activity, we purified truncated and full-length NS3-4A complexes and examined their serine protease activities under a variety of salt and pH conditions. Our results indicate that the helicase domain enhances serine protease activity, just as the protease domain enhances helicase activity. Thus, the two enzymatic domains of NS3-4A are highly interdependent. This is the first time that such a complete interdependence has been demonstrated for a multifunctional, single chain enzyme. NS3-4A domain interdependence has important implications for function during the viral lifecycle as well as for the design of inhibitor screens that target the NS3-4A protease.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> Grant <grant-num>GM60620</grant-num>.

The NS3 N-terminal domain adopts a chymotrypsin-like fold, and it displays serine protease activity in the presence of the NS4A co-factor protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). The genomic HCV RNA is initially translated into a long polyprotein that must be cleaved into the core, envelope, and nonstructural (NS) proteins, which are required for viral replication and packaging. The NS3-4A protease is essential for this process, as it cleaves several sites within the HCV polyprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). It may also enhance HCV replication by cleaving host proteins such as Cardif (also known as IPS-1, MAVS, or VISA), which are involved in innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). In this way, NS3-4A may down-regulate the cellular antiviral response.</p><p>The NS3 C-terminal domain (NS3hel) belongs to the DE<italic>X</italic>H/D-box subgroup of helicase superfamily 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). It exhibits NTPase activity and, in the presence of the protease domain, it is a reactive RNA helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). The NS3 helicase, along with the HCV NS5A phosphoprotein and the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is required for replication of the viral RNA genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>) and is possibly required for viral packaging as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). Thus, NS3-4A must be able to function as a serine protease, an RNA helicase, and a packaging enzyme in an HCV-infected cell in order for the virus to propagate.</p><p>Recently, we observed that RNA binding and unwinding by NS3hel are greatly enhanced by the covalently attached NS3 protease domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). This suggests that, despite their seemingly unrelated enzymatic functions, the helicase and protease domains have evolved to become interdependent and functionally coupled. It is well established that the NS3 protease domain requires binding of NS4A for reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>), and that the protease domain can function in the absence of NS3hel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). However, it has not been determined whether the NS3hel domain enhances the inherent activity of the NS3 protease domain. If the hel domain does influence the protease domain function, this finding will guide the design of NS3 constructs that are used for future functional, structural, and screening studies on the NS3 protease. It would also provide a clear-cut, biochemically characterized example of functional coevolution among viral protein domains. Finally, it would implicate the protein-protein interface between the helicase and protease as a major functional element and potential drug target. We therefore set out to determine whether the NS3 protease is stimulated by the presence of the NS3hel domain.</p><p>To address this issue, we coexpressed and purified native, full-length NS3-4A serine protease complexes using a bacterial expression system and we measured NS3-4A protease activities with a fluorescently labeled HCV substrate mimic. Here, we show that the native, full-length NS3-4A complexes are conformationally homogeneous and that they display robust serine protease activity under a variety of salt and pH conditions, including conditions that support efficient helicase activity.</p><p>In parallel experiments, we prepared reconstituted NS3-NS4A complexes in which the two proteins were individually expressed and then added together to form the active protease. The reconstituted complexes enabled us to compare the protease activity of full-length NS3 (NS3 + NS4A) with that of the NS3 protease domain in isolation (NS3 protease + NS4A). We observe that the full-length NS3 + 4A construct is a much more reactive protease, indicating that the NS3hel domain enhances activity of the NS3-4A serine protease domain. Taken together with prior work, these findings indicate that the two disparate enzyme domains of the NS3 protein are strongly interdependent: the NS3 protease domain enhances the activity of NS3hel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>) and NS3hel enhances activity of the protease domain.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Materials</italic>&#x02014;RNA oligonucleotides described in this work were obtained from Dharmacon and DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen.

We cloned <italic>NS3</italic>+ and <italic>NS3-4A</italic>+-expressing cDNA from the hepatitis C viral genotype 1a (version H77, kindly donated by Dr. Charlie Rice) into the vector pET15b (Novagen). The DNA oligonucleotides used for PCR of NS3 and NS3-4A were NS3 1a-1 and NS3 1a-2 or NS4A(1a)&#x003b2; BamHI. An internal XhoI site in the <italic>NS3</italic>(1a)+ gene was removed through a silent base pair change using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene).

The DNA oligonucleotides used were the same as those described above for pET15b cloning, except that the 5&#x02032; PCR oligonucleotide in the genotype 1a case was NS3(1a) SUMO start and in the genotype 1b case was NS3(1b) 5&#x02032; SUMO start.</p><p>To produce pET-SUMO-<italic>NS4A</italic>(1a)+, the <italic>NS4A</italic>(1a)+ gene was PCR amplified using the DNA oligonucleotides NS4A 1a SUMO start and NS4A 1a SUMO end and then cloned into pET-SUMO.

Mutagenesis was conducted via QuikChange (Stratagene), using DNA oligonucleotides NS3prot(1a)-1 and NS3prot(1a)-2. To create the NS3/4A polyprotein with an Ala/Ala cleavage site instead of a Thr/Ser cleavage site, the wild-type <italic>NS3&#x02013;4A(1b</italic>)+ construct was mutated by QuikChange (Stratagene), using oligonucleotides AA NS3&#x02013;4A-1 and AA NS3&#x02013;4A-2. All constructs were verified initially through PCR screening as necessary and subsequently sequenced for accuracy (Keck Facility, Yale University).</p><p><italic>Protein Purification</italic>&#x02014;Because there are a multitude of reports describing the purification of various autocleaved and reconstituted forms of the NS3-4A complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>) and because all of these factors greatly influence NS3 enzymatic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>), we believe it is necessary to describe our constructs, purification strategies, and reconstitutions in detail. All proteins were purified according to the methods described in Beran <italic>et al.</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). Briefly, 4 liters of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> culture in LB (supplemented with 35 &#x003bc;g/ml kanamycin) were grown at 37 &#x000b0;C with shaking. Upon reaching the exponential growth phase, the temperature was shifted to 15 &#x000b0;C, the cultures were supplemented with 1 m<sc>m</sc> isopropyl 1-thio-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-galactopyranoside (final concentration), and subsequently incubated overnight at 15 &#x000b0;C with shaking. After lysing the cells using an Emusiflex C5 cell disruptor (Avestin), the cellular extract was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm (14,500 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic>) at 4 &#x000b0;C for 10 min before being passed through a nickel column. The His<sub>6</sub> and His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO fusion proteins were purified through a nickel column (Qiagen), treated with 10 units of SUMO protease (Invitrogen) overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C, and subsequently passed through a gel filtration column (HiLoad Superdex 200 16/60) equilibrated with a buffer containing 25 m<sc>m</sc> Hepes (pH 8.0), 0.3 <sc>m</sc> NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 m<sc>m</sc> dithiothreitol, and 0.2% Triton X-100. Ninety-six 1.2-ml gel filtration fractions were collected at a rate of 0.4 ml/min.</p><p>The NS3-4A complex eluted between fractions 45 and 55, presumably in a detergent micelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). Fractions containing NS3-4A were identified using the RET-S1 protease assay (the RET-S1 protease assay details are described later in this section) as well as through SDS-PAGE analysis. Moreover, anti-NS3 and anti-NS4A (monoclonal antibodies in both cases) Western blotting were used to confirm the identity of the purified protein complex, which was then used for experimentation (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>, and the Western blotting procedure described later in this section).</p><p>Free NS3 protein eluted from the gel filtration column between fractions 60 and 70. Fractions containing NS3 were identified using RNA unwinding assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>) and SDS-PAGE analysis. In addition, anti-NS3 Western blotting was used to confirm the identity of the purified protein, which was then used for experimentation (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref> and the Western blotting procedure described later in this section).</p><p>Because there is a 13-kDa size difference between His-SUMO tagged and untagged protein, the untagged proteins were initially analyzed side by side using SDS-PAGE with uncleaved His-SUMO NS3&#x02013;4A or uncleaved His-SUMO-NS3 to verify that the purified proteins were, in fact, untagged species (data not shown).</p><p>After purification, preparations were divided into 10-&#x003bc;l aliquots and stored at -80 &#x000b0;C. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The NS3 and NS3-4A proteins were examined for purity and their sizes compared using SDS-PAGE (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Protein samples (40 pmol) were subjected to electrophoresis on a NuPAGE 4&#x02013;12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen) in MES-SDS buffer for 2 h at 200 V. The gel was subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue.</p><p>For reconstitution of the protease complex using purified NS3 and purified NS4A proteins (&#x0201c;NS3 + NS4A&#x0201d;), we expressed His-SUMO-NS3 as well as His-SUMO-NS4A in <italic>E.</italic> coli using the pET-SUMO vector system (Invitrogen). After partial purification using a nickel column, His-SUMO-NS3 and a 4-fold excess of His-SUMO-NS4A were mixed and incubated together at 4 &#x000b0;C overnight in the presence of 10 units of SUMO protease (Invitrogen). Reconstituted, untagged NS3 + 4A was subsequently isolated from untagged NS3 and untagged NS4A (based upon size differences) by passing the protein mixture through a gel filtration column (HiLoad Superdex 200 16/60) using the same methods as described above for autocleaved NS3-4A. The same procedure was followed to reconstitute and purify untagged NS3 protease domain with untagged NS4A (&#x0201c;NS3 protease domain + NS4A&#x0201d;). In this case, NS3 protease domain alone eluted between gel filtration fractions 75 and 80 and NS3 protease domain + NS4A eluted between fractions 70 and 75. The RET-S1 serine protease assay as well as SDS-PAGE analysis was used to identify the fractions containing reconstituted NS3 protease domain + NS4A. In all cases, protein concentration was determined using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad).</p><p><italic>Western Blot Analysis</italic>&#x02014;SDS-PAGE was performed using a Bio-Rad MiniProtean II apparatus according to the manufacturer's protocols. The Western blot transfer was performed using a Bio-Rad transfer apparatus according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-NS3 and anti-NS4A monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Virogen (Watertown, MA) and diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions. In these experiments (as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>), 25 pmol of each protein was subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for 1 h at 200 V. Subsequently, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by applying 100 V for 1 h at 4 &#x000b0;C. Finally, the blots were incubated with either anti-NS3 or anti-NS4A monoclonal antibody and subsequently developed using a Pierce Supersignal Western blot analysis kit.</p><p><italic>Protease Assays</italic>&#x02014;Protease assays were performed at 37 &#x000b0;C using the Resonance Energy Transfer-S1 substrate (RET-S1) (Anaspec) designed by Taliani <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). RET-S1 is an NS4A/NS4B junction mimic that fluoresces upon cleavage. All assays, unless otherwise indicated, were performed in 60-&#x003bc;l reaction volumes containing 40 n<sc>m</sc> NS3-4A and 5 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> RET-S1. The data shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> were collected using 120 n<sc>m</sc> protein with the indicated amounts of RET-S1 substrate.

In previous studies, NS3-4A has been overexpressed in insect cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>) or in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>).

To our knowledge, a recombinant NS3-4A complex that lacks tags or additional modifying amino acids has never been produced. We therefore designed an approach for generating native, full-length NS3-4A complex (<italic>e.g.</italic> lacking modifications to the terminal sequences of NS3 or NS4A) using the pET-SUMO expression system in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref> and see &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures&#x0201d;). In this system, the protein of interest is tagged at the N terminus with the SUMO polypeptide, which enhances solubility of the protein and is then readily removed upon incubation with the SUMO protease, thereby resulting in native protein that lacks additional amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>).</p><p>We expressed NS3-4A as a His-SUMO-NS3/4A polyprotein in <italic>E. coli</italic>, designing the construct so that NS3 would be expected to spontaneously cleave NS4A from its C terminus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>), thereby forming an active protease complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>).

The uncleavable NS3/4A polyprotein was produced by mutating the conserved junction amino acid sequence between NS3 and NS4A from Thr/Ser to Ala/Ala.

As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>), both free NS3 and the uncleavable mutant NS3/4A polyprotein are proteolytically inactive, as they fail to react with RET-S1 (see below).

Taken together, the physical and functional information provided by both the electrophoretic and proteolysis assays indicate that we have successfully overexpressed untagged, unmodified NS3-4A in a form that is conformationally homogeneous, appropriately cleaved, and highly reactive. This approach now makes it possible to quantitatively assess the proteolysis and helicase activities of the NS3-4A complex, and to compare these activities with the behavior of other NS3 constructs.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Steady-state proteolysis of RET-S1 by NS3-4A and His-NS3-4A.</bold> The <italic>y</italic> intercept of the line in each case corresponds to the active fraction of protein (see &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures&#x0201d;).

For comparison purposes, we also constructed an NS3-4A complex with a His tag on the N terminus of NS3.

A His tag at the NS3 N terminus is therefore detrimental for folding and/or assembly of the protease domain, and it also diminishes the ultimate levels of proteolytic activity by the tagged NS3-4A complex.

However, the mutant NS3/4A construct has also provided valuable additional information about the activities that we should expect for HCV polyproteins. To our knowledge, catalytic activities of uncleaved NS3/4A constructs have never been tested.

Taken together, our findings suggest that NS3 protease activity is tuned and regulated by other viral components, which have coevolved to maximize the role of the protease in the HCV viral lifecycle.</p><p><italic>The Helicase and the Protease Are Interdependent Enzymes within a Single Protein</italic>&#x02014;Like many viral proteins, NS3 is multifunctional and it contains different enzymatic activities within a single protein chain. It has long been known that the protease and ATPase/helicase activities of NS3 are located on separate domains of NS3, and given the disparate nature of these activities, and their presumably different roles in function of the virus, it was generally assumed that the protease and helicase activities had no relationship to one another. However, structural analysis revealed that the protease domain is located in close proximity to the ATPase and RNA binding sites of NS3hel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). We therefore wondered whether the two enzymes in NS3 might actually be interdependent, having evolved to function optimally as a unit. Allosteric coactivation would have important ramifications for the function of the HCV replication complex and for the testing of HCV inhibitors, which tends to be studied with the isolated domains.</p><p>In our first study of this problem, we showed that RNA binding, ATPase, and RNA unwinding activities of the helicase are all stimulated by the presence of the covalently attached NS3 protease domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Here we demonstrate that the NS3-4A serine protease activity is stimulated by the presence of NS3hel as well. Importantly, the NS3hel domain must be covalently attached to the NS3 protease domain, as adding NS3hel in <italic>trans</italic> had no effect on NS3 protease domain + NS4A protease activity (data not shown). Thus, the different enzymatic domains of NS3 are fully interdependent, which suggests that they have coevolved and that their presence on a single protein may have provided a selective advantage to the virus. Perhaps most importantly, the results suggest that these seemingly disparate enzymatic activities may somehow be coupled during some aspect of viral function.</p><p><italic>The NS3/4A Polyprotein Fails to Catalyze Proteolysis or Unwinding</italic>&#x02014;Just as the helicase domain activates serine protease activity, the presence of an uncleaved NS3/4A junction inhibits serine protease activity. The data presented herein show that polyprotein cleavage must occur before NS3 becomes proteolytically active. Even NS3 helicase activity requires cleavage of the NS3/4A junction sequence before any RNA unwinding activity is observed (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that polyprotein processing must necessarily be a very early event, as it is required for catalytic functions of viral constituents.</p><p><italic>Proteolysis and Helicase Activities Are Not Mutually Exclusive</italic>&#x02014;Previous work has suggested that NS3-4A protease activity occurs under conditions that are incompatible with helicase activity. This finding implies that helicase and protease activities might be mutually exclusive, or that their viral functions are completely unrelated. Importantly, it had been reported that NS3-4A protease activity is very sensitive to salt concentrations when the protein is studied at low concentrations (&#x0003c;1 n<sc>m</sc>) and less sensitive to salt concentrations at higher protein concentrations (&#x02265;1 n<sc>m</sc>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). We therefore conducted protease assays with relatively high NS3-4A concentrations (40&#x02013;120 nm) that fall within the range typically employed for RNA helicase assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>). Our ability to observe helicase and protease activity under the same conditions may also stem from the fact that we utilized untagged NS3-4A, which is more reactive than His-tagged NS3-4A. An N-terminal His tag reduces both the rate of serine protease activity and the active fraction of protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Indeed, proteolysis by untagged NS3-4A is not highly salt dependent and the reaction is efficient under diverse conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>Earlier work has demonstrated that NS3 functions as a robust RNA helicase at NaCl concentrations as high as 100 m<sc>m</sc> and it can unwind RNA at even higher NaCl concentrations, although less efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). The fact that NS3 can cleave protein or unwind RNA in the same range of salt and pH conditions (including ionic conditions that approach physiological (150 m<sc>m</sc>)) indicates that NS3-4A is capable of transitioning smoothly between proteolysis and RNA unwinding during various stages of HCV replication. Immediately after NS3-4A autocleaves from the HCV polyprotein, it may unwind HCV RNA or use NS3hel as a motor to translocate along the HCV polyprotein and scan for subsequent peptide cleavage sites. Protein translocation by NS3hel has never been demonstrated, but its potential importance is underscored by the translocase activities of related proteins such as ClpX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>).</p><p><italic>Reconstituted Forms of NS3-4A Are Significantly Less Reactive Than Autocleaved NS3-4A</italic>&#x02014;To perform this study, it was necessary to create reconstituted forms of the NS3-4A complex, in which the 4A protein was added in <italic>trans</italic> to the serine protease domain or to the full-length NS3. This provided an opportunity to compare the reactivities of NS3-4A molecules that, despite identical sequences, were produced in different ways (through autocleavage of polyprotein or reconstitution from separate proteins). Here we observe that autoproteolyzed NS3-4A is a much more active serine protease than complexes that were reconstituted from separate NS4A molecules (NS3 + NS4A). Consistent with this, the NS3-4A complex that is disrupted by dilution into low salt buffers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>) cannot be restored to normal levels of the protease activity by the addition of salt (data not shown). Specifically, we observe that NS3-4A has a <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> for RET-S1 proteolysis that is 34 times faster than NS3 + NS4A (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Intriguingly, the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> values for NS3-4A and NS3 + NS4A proteolysis of RET-S1 do not vary significantly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Taken together, the kinetic analysis of proteolysis by NS3-4A, NS3 + NS4A, and NS3 protease + NS4A suggests that all of these constructs bind substrate with a similar affinity, but they have large differences in efficiency of chemical catalysis.</p><p>One possible explanation is that the NS4A co-factor may not properly intercalate with the NS3 protease domain when NS3 and NS4A are simply mixed, potentially resulting in misalignment of active site residues within the NS3 protease domain. Autocleavage between NS3 and NS4A and the concurrent intercalation of NS4A into the NS3 protease domain requires a specific cleavage site sequence that slows the proteolysis reaction (Thr/Ser as opposed to Cys/Ser at other HCV polyprotein sites) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>). Presumably, this slow autocleavage between NS3 and NS4A facilitates the correct intercalation of NS4A into the NS3 protease domain as NS4A is being cleaved from the NS3 C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>). Therefore, whereas our findings suggest that the helicase domain allosterically influences the protease active site, an alternative interpretation of the results is that a coexpressed helicase domain is required for proper folding of the protease domain and/or appropriate docking of the 4A cofactor. In addition, the expression strategy employed in this work may not optimally recapitulate folding of the individual proteins. But regardless of the mechanistic basis for the apparent codependence of the protease and the helicase, the data clearly show that reconstituted NS3 and 4A constructs are significantly impaired, which has major implications for the design of protein constructs used in drug screening and for structure/function efforts on HCV.</p><p>Many investigators have aimed to disrupt NS3-4A protease activity as an approach toward antiviral therapeutics and various forms of the complex have been employed in these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>). Although it has been suggested that NS3hel might enhance NS3-4A protease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>), this synergy was not demonstrated until now. Our findings suggest that screens for NS3-4A protease inhibitors should involve full-length NS3 constructs rather than truncated protease domains. Moreover, these screens should utilize constructs in which NS3-4A is produced through autoproteolysis rather than reconstitution. Indeed, a recent study comparing the effects of NS3-4A serine protease inhibitors on full-length NS3-4A produced through autocleavage, NS3 + NS4A peptide, and NS3 protease domain + NS4A peptide demonstrated that BILN 2061 and VX-950 are much better inhibitors of autocleaved NS3-4A serine protease activity than of reconstituted NS3 + NS4A peptide or NS3 protease domain + NS4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). The greater protease activity of autocleaved NS3-4A creates the potential for increased sensitivity when measuring protease activity in the presence of new drugs (<italic>i.e.</italic> more easily measured inhibition of protease activity in screening assays of compound libraries), which will lead to a greater diversity of promising lead compounds. Given the synergies observed among components of the NS3 helicase-protease, it will be interesting to monitor the influence of NS4A on RNA binding, ATPase, and RNA unwinding activities of NS3 in future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M804065200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M804065200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. William Delaney, Dr. Brett D.
