To better define the role of Cernunnos in end joining, whole-cell extracts were prepared from Cernunnos-deficient human cells. These extracts effected little joining of DNA ends with cohesive 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; overhangs, and no joining at all of partially complementary 3&#x02032; overhangs that required gap filling prior to ligation. Assays in which gap-filled but unligated intermediates were trapped using dideoxynucleotides revealed that there was no gap filling on aligned DSB ends in the Cernunnos-deficient extracts. Recombinant Cernunnos protein restored gap filling and end joining of partially complementary overhangs, and stimulated joining of cohesive ends more than twentyfold. XLF-dependent gap filling was nearly eliminated by immunodepletion of DNA polymerase &#x003bb;, but was restored by addition of either polymerase &#x003bb; or polymerase &#x003bc;. Thus, Cernunnos is essential for gap filling by either polymerase during nonhomologous end joining, suggesting that it plays a major role in aligning the two DNA ends in the repair complex.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>XLF/Cernunnos is a recently discovered core protein of the nonhomologous end-joining pathway of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In humans, deficiency in Cernunnos confers immunodeficiency and microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).

Monolayers (5000 cm<sup>2</sup> total) were harvested two days after reaching confluence (which appeared to improve the end joining proficiency of extracts), and whole-cell extracts were prepared by Dounce homogenization as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp283/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link>).

At an optical density (600 nm) of 0.4, IPTG was added to 1 mM for induction. Four hours later, cells were harvested and the dry pellets were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until use.</p><p>Cell pellets were resuspended in 12 ml lysis buffer (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 8.0, 0.3 M NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride). After 30 min on ice, cells were sonicated 6 &#x000d7; 15 s on 30% power (Sonicator from Ultrasonic Inc.). Crude extracts were centrifuged at 14 000<italic>g</italic> at 4&#x000b0;C for 30 min. Soluble proteins were mixed with 1.5 ml Qiagen Ni-NTA Superflow beads and gently stirred 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C.

Bound proteins were then eluted four times with 1 ml of the same buffer containing 0.5 M imidazole. All four fractions were analyzed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE electrophoresis and peak fractions dialyzed against 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.0 overnight. Cernunnos wild-type and mutant proteins were filtered (0.22 &#x003bc;m), loaded on a MonoQ FPLC column (Pharmacia) and eluted with a gradient of 0&#x02013;0.8 M NaCl in 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.0.

Cernunnos-containing fractions eluted at &#x0223c;0.75 M NaCl and were stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C in the elution buffer plus 50% glycerol. Final concentration of the protein was determined using Pierce BCA assay with BSA as standard, and verified by quantification of bands on gels stained with SYPRO orange and scanned with a Typhoon fluorescence imager (GE Healthcare), which agreed within a factor of 1.5&#x000d7;. Stock solutions of Cernunnos were diluted at least 100-fold in end joining reactions.</p><p>For baculoviral expression of His-tagged Cernunnos, the cDNA was inserted into pFastBac-HTB vector and recombinant Cernunnos-expressing baculovirus was generated with the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Sf9 cells were infected with Cernunnos baculovirus and harvested 60 h after infection. Cells were lysed in 50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 8, 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM &#x003b2;&#x02013;mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and the lysate was sonicated and then centrifuged for 1 h at 150 000<italic>g</italic>. The supernatant was mixed with Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and incubated for 4 h at 4&#x000b0;C with rotation.

Finally, Cernunnos-containing fractions were loaded into a Mono Q (HR 5/5) column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1 to 1 M KCl in CB buffer.

Typically, a 16-&#x003bc;l reaction contained 10 &#x003bc;l of extract, resulting in a final concentration of 8 mg/ml protein, 66 mM potassium acetate and 16% glycerol, and an effective Mg<sup>++</sup> concentration of 1 mM (taking into account &#x0223c;0.3 mM EDTA from the extract). Buffer components were first mixed with cell extract at 22&#x000b0;C. Cernunnos was added and the solution mixed by pipeting. In some reactions, KU-57788 in DMSO or DMSO alone (final concentrations of 1 &#x003bc;M and 2%, respectively) was added and the sample mixed by pipeting. Finally, substrate (10&#x02013;100 ng) was added and the reaction again mixed by pipeting, and placed in a 37&#x000b0;C water bath, usually for 6 h. Samples were deproteinized as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and either loaded directly onto 0.8% agarose gels, or cut with BstXI and AvaI and analyzed on 20% polyacrylamide DNA sequencing gels.

We have shown that a variety of human cell extracts can join DNA ends bearing partially complementary &#x02212;ACG/&#x02212;ACG 3&#x02032; overhangs, and that they do so almost exclusively by a mechanism involving annealing of the terminal self-complementary &#x02212;CG/&#x02212;CG, filling of the 1-base gap in each strand, and ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Using an internally labeled plasmid substrate, these end joining events are detected after BstXI/AvaI cleavage as 43-base (head-to-tail) and 24-base (head-to-head) labeled products on a denaturing gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Requirement for Cernunnos in joining of partially complementary DNA ends.

This apparent repair deficiency could be complemented by mixing the Cernunnos-deficient extract with a similar extract from DNA-PKcs-deficient M059J cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), or by addition of purified recombinant Cernunnos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). As with other human cell extracts, only two major repair products, of 43 and 24 bases, were detected, corresponding to accurate annealing, patching and ligation of the -ACG overhangs. Treatment with BsaHI in addition to BstXI and AvaI converted most of the 43-mer and about half of the 24-mer to a 13-mer, confirming the predicted GACGTC repair joint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). The remaining uncleaved 43- and 24-base products may have been resistant to BsaHI due to incomplete repair of the opposite strand. Cernunnos produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> was as effective in supporting end joining as that produced in baculovirus-infected insect cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). A titration with limiting amounts of Cernunnos revealed greater-than-linear concentration dependence between 25 and 100 nM, consistent with multiple molecules of Cernunnos being required, as suggested by structural studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E).</p></sec><sec><title>Cernunnos is required for gap filling on aligned DSB ends by pol&#x003bb; or pol&#x003bc;</title><p>To directly determine whether Cernunnos is involved in gap filling, end joining reactions were performed in the presence of ddTTP, which supports gap filling by polymerases &#x003bb; and &#x003bc;, but blocks the final ligation step. In such reactions, the predicted 16-mer corresponding to the elongated but unligated intermediate was detected only in extracts supplemented with Cernunnos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), implying that gap filling in these extracts is completely dependent on Cernunnos. Some ligation products were still generated in the presence of ddTTP, probably due to residual dTTP in the extracts, which are dialyzed for only 3 hr after ultracentrifugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). End joining of the partially complementary substrate in the presence of dTTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), as well as gap filling in the presence of ddTTP, was almost completely abolished by immunodepletion with antibodies to pol&#x003bb;, and restored by addition of recombinant pol&#x003bb;, suggesting that pol&#x003bb; is the dominant Cernunnos-dependent gap-filling polymerase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). However, addition of pol&#x003bc; promoted gap filling and end joining to the same extent as pol&#x003bb; (ratio 1.1 &#x000b1; 0.1, <italic>N</italic> = 3, for gap filling), but again only in the presence of Cernunnos, indicating that Cernunnos is required for gap filling by either polymerase. Taken together, these results indicate that there was insufficient pol&#x003bc; activity in the extracts to support end joining; however, inasmuch as earlier results suggested that pol&#x003bc; is more susceptible than pol&#x003bb; to nonspecific inactivation during immunodepletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), the results do not exclude a significant role for pol&#x003bc; in gap filling <italic>in vivo</italic>. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Requirement for Cernunnos and pol&#x003bb; or pol&#x003bc; in alignment-based gap filling.

To address this question, end joining of substrates bearing fully cohesive ligatable overhangs was examined. End joining of either a KpnI-cut plasmid bearing cohesive 4-base 3&#x02032; overhangs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A) or a BsaI-cut plasmid bearing cohesive 5&#x02032; overhangs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B) was almost completely dependent on Cernunnos, with a concentration dependence similar to that for the partially cohesive overhang. However, in contrast to the partially cohesive substrate, a trace of joining of the fully cohesive substrates was detected in the absence of Cernunnos, typically &#x0223c;0.5% with 20 ng substrate and &#x0223c;2% with 100 ng. Nevertheless, end joining of the cohesive substrates was stimulated as much as 75-fold by Cernunnos. While the DNA-PK inhibitor KU-57788 blocked Cernunnos-dependent end joining, the residual Cernunnos-independent end joining was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). As reported previously for DNA-PK-complemented M059J extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), the ATM inhibitor KU-55933 had no detectable effect on end joining at a concentration sufficient to block all ATM-catalyzed phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). Overall, the results suggest that the final ligation step of DNA-PK-dependent end joining is also completely dependent on Cernunnos, but that there is a low level of residual end joining that does not require either Cernunnos or DNA-PK. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Cernunnos dependence of joining of cohesive 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; overhangs.

All these proteins supported end joining of the substrates bearing either partially cohesive or fully cohesive 3&#x02032; overhangs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). These data imply that neither phosphorylation at S245 nor at S251 is required for either gap filling or ligation of 3&#x02032; overhangs. The efficiency of end joining with the mutant proteins was comparable to that with wild-type, and there was no change in the fidelity of repair. The S245 and S251 phosphorylation sites also appear to be dispensable for DSB repair in intact cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The finding that phosphorylation of the major sites on Cernunnos is not essential, raises the possibility that Cernunnos might only be required at a later stage in the end joining pathway, after the essential phosphorylations have been completed. However, order-of-addition experiments (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp283/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>) indicated that in the absence of Cernunnos there was little or no accumulation of active, appropriately phosphorylated repair complexes that could proceed to gap filling and ligation in the presence of DNA-PK inhibitor when Cernunnos was added. Instead, successful end joining appears to require the simultaneous presence of Cernunnos and catalytically active DNA-PK. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Effect of S&#x02192;A mutations in Cernunnos on complementation of end joining.

It has a structure similar to that of XRCC4, with a globular head and long &#x003b1;-helical tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Cernunnos binds to Ku as well as to XRCC4, and induces supershifts of both Ku-DNA and XRCC4-DNA complexes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The cellular phenotype for Cernunnos deficiency is similar to that for Ku or XRCC4, and includes radiosensitivity and failure to rejoin a substantial fraction of radiation-induced DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In reactions with purified proteins, Cernunnos stimulates ligation of DNA ends by X4L4, and confers an ability to join mismatched ends and protruding single strands, albeit at low efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). All these results suggest that Cernunnos is a core factor in the end joining repair complex. The finding that alignment-based gap filling in whole-cell extracts is completely dependent on Cernunnos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) suggests that, in addition to stimulating ligase IV, Cernunnos is also important for DNA end alignment.</p><p>Previously, we (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) have shown that in extracts of CHO (hamster) cells, end joining events requiring gap filling are completely dependent on Ku, while resection-based joining events are not. We also showed directly that X4L4 is required for gap filling, both in hamster whole-cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and in human nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>); furthermore, at least in the hamster extracts, XRCC4 alone could not substitute for the X4L4 complex. Given that these various extract systems show the same specificity in gap filling and the same requirement for either pol&#x003bb; or pol&#x003bc;, it appears reasonably certain that they share the same basic gap filling process. Thus, from all these data we infer that gap filling for nonhomologous end joining requires the full complex of Ku, XRCC4, DNA ligase IV and Cernunnos. The requirement for Cernunnos in gap filling is consistent with a recent proposal that end alignment is promoted by assembly of a filament of alternating homodimers of Cernunnos and XRCC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In principle, the Cernunnos dependence of gap filling could be due to more specific interactions between Cernunnos and pol&#x003bb; or pol&#x003bc;, but gel mobility shift experiments indicate that Ku and X4L4 are sufficient to efficiently recruit either polymerase to DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22">20&#x02013;22</xref>). Nevertheless, a model in which Cernunnos is required for proper positioning of the polymerase within the repair complex, rather than for end alignment as such, remains a formal possibility.</p><p>The polymerase complementation results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) are consistent with previous work showing that pol&#x003bb; and pol&#x003bc; have distinct but overlapping specificities. Either polymerase can efficiently fill in one-base gaps in aligned DSB ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), but only pol&#x003bb; can fill longer gaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and only pol&#x003bc; can fill gaps with no base pairing, for example, when noncomplementary single-base 3&#x02032; overhangs are present on both ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Nevertheless, as shown previously with HeLa nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), immunodepletion of pol&#x003bb; almost completely eliminates gap filling, suggesting that the level of pol&#x003bc; in the extracts is too low to support robust gap filling. However, we previously found that the activity of pol&#x003bc; (but not pol&#x003bb;) was substantially reduced when the recombinant enzyme was mock-depleted from solution with pre-immune rabbit IgG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), and thus it is possible that pol&#x003bc; in the extract is more susceptible than pol&#x003bb; to nonspecific loss or inactivation during the extraction procedure.</p><p>Previous studies with purified DNA-PKcs, Ku, Artemis, XRCC4 and ligase IV indicate that all of these proteins except ligase IV are extensively phosphorylated by DNA-PK when they are incubated together in the presence of DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). However, only phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs itself has been shown to be important for end joining in cells, and phosphorylation of XRCC4 and Ku is apparently dispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Our results with mutant Cernunnos proteins not only confirm a previous report that S245A and S251A mutations do not affect repair efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), but also indicate that they do not affect repair fidelity.</p><p>As yet, we have been unable to detect gap filling on aligned DSB ends when the partially complementary (&#x02212;ACG/&#x02212;ACG) DSB substrate is incubated with the combination of Ku, DNA-PKcs, X4L4, Cernunnos, and pol&#x003bb;, either with or without inositol hexakisphosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), even though we have shown that each of these recombinant proteins is able to complement gap filling and end joining of the same substrate in the corresponding repair-deficient extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Although it has been reported that alignment-based gap filling and ligation can be achieved with only purified recombinant Ku, X4L4 and pol&#x003bb; or pol&#x003bc;, this reaction requires high concentrations of substrate, as well as polyethylene glycol to promote macromolecular crowding. Moreover, these reactions are inhibited by Cernunnos as well as DNA-PKcs, both of which are required for the same reactions in cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Thus, while it is difficult to rigorously eliminate the possibility that there is some artifact associated with combining multiple recombinant proteins, the simplest explanation of the available data is that there are additional components in cell extracts which, even if they are not part of the core end-joining complex, are nevertheless required for it to function properly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp283/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp283_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkp283_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>National Cancer Institute (CA40615, CA72955); USDHHS.
