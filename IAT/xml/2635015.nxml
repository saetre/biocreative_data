The focus was on the role of the co-inhibitory molecule PD-1, a CD28-related receptor expressed on activated T- and B-lymphocytes associated with immune homeostasis and autoimmunity. PLPtg/PD-1-deficient double mutants and the corresponding bone marrow chimeras were generated and analysed using immunohistochemistry, light- and electron microscopy, with particular emphasis on immune-cell number and neural damage. In addition, the immune cells in both the CNS and the peripheral immune system were investigated by IFN-gamma elispot assays and spectratype analysis. We found that mice with combined pathology exhibited significantly increased numbers of CD4&#x0002b; and CD8&#x0002b; T-lymphocytes in the CNS. Lack of PD-1 substantially aggravated the pathological phenotype of the PLPtg mutants compared to genuine PLPtg mutants, whereas the PD-1 deletion alone did not cause alterations in the CNS. CNS T-lymphocytes in PLPtg/PD-1-/- double mutants exhibited massive clonal expansions. Furthermore, PD-1 deficiency was associated with a significantly higher propensity of CNS but not peripheral CD8&#x0002b; T-cells to secrete proinflammatory cytokines. PD-1 could be identified as a crucial player of tissue homeostasis and immune-mediated damage in a model of oligodendropathy-induced inflammation. Alterations of this regulatory pathway lead to overt neuroinflammation of high pathogenetic impact. Our finding may have implications for understanding the mechanisms leading to the high clinical variability of polygenic or even monogenic disorders of the nervous system.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>We have recently investigated a mouse myelin mutant overexpressing the proteolipid protein (PLP) in oligodendrocytes leading to myelin degeneration and late onset axonal degeneration.

Reconstitution experiments with RAG-1 deficient myelin mutants, receiving bone-marrow from either CD8&#x0002b;/CD4&#x02212; or CD8&#x02212;/CD4&#x0002b; mutants, clearly identified CD8&#x0002b; T-lymphocytes cells as pathogenic mediators.

In this model, CD8&#x0002b; lymphocytes show clonal expansions in the diseased CNS but not in peripheral lymphatic organs. This serves as a strong hint for a pathogenetic, antigen-specific role of these cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004405-Leder1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The link between oligodendrocyte damage and components of the adaptive immune system is particularly relevant for inflammatory disorders of the nervous system. It has been recently hypothesized that subtypes of multiple sclerosis (MS) may be caused by a primary oligodendropathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004405-Lucchinetti1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004405-Barnett1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. This hypothesis is strongly supported by recent clinical reports, showing that PLP mutations in humans can be linked to primary progressive or relapsing-remitting MS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004405-Warshawsky1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004405-Gorman1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, our recent work identifying a primary oligodendropathy as a &#x0201c;trigger&#x0201d; for immune-driven pathological changes is important for our understanding of pathomechanisms occurring in some forms of MS.</p><p>It is well known, that genetic and environmental factors control disease onset and disease course of CNS inflammatory autoimmune disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004405-Hafler1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The co-inhibitory molecule &#x0201c;programmed death&#x0201d; (PD)-1 (CD279) is a CD28-related receptor expressed on activated T- and B-lymphocytes and associated with immune homeostasis and autoimmunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004405-Okazaki1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004405-Okazaki2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Moreover, inactivation of PD-1 in an animal model for inherited demyelination in the peripheral nervous system implicating T-lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004405-Schmid1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> leads to a substantial aggravation of the primarily genetically-caused neuropathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004405-Kroner2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, we investigate the impact of immune-regulatory mechanisms involved in the modulation of the immune response in PLP transgenic mice, a model of oligodendropathy-induced inflammation.

Interestingly, not only CNS damage was more pronounced per individual, but most severely affected individuals always belonged to the group of PLPtg mice in combination to functional disruption of PD-1.</p><p>How does ablation of the PD-1 pathway affect CNS pathology? PD-1-deficiency alone only transiently affected the number of CD8&#x0002b; cells found in the CNS and, more importantly, the corresponding mice showed normal histological features in the CNS. While it has been reported that PD-1-/- mice on a C57/Bl6 background show lupus-like glomerulonephritis when aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004405-Nishimura1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> we did not observe any obvious organ pathology, urinal glucose or protein content (not shown) or spontaneous autoreactions associated with loss of PD-1. Furthermore, the peripheral immune &#x0201c;status&#x0201d; was not changed in the tested groups (wt, PD-1-/-, PLPtg, PLPtg/PD-1-/-). However, we found clonal expansions of T-cells in the periphery in PD-1-/- mice using CDR3 spectratyping analysis. While numerically not elevated in the CNS at 12 months, the PD-1-deficient CD8&#x0002b; cells of PLPwt/PD-1-/- mice showed multiple clonal T-cell expansions, as opposed to PD-1-expressing CD8&#x0002b; cells of normal wild type mice which do not show any repertoire perturbations. The corresponding CD8&#x0002b; cells of PLPtg mice display their characteristic mono- or oligoclonal expansion in the CNS as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004405-Leder1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The combination of the PLP transgene with PD-1 deficiency led to significantly higher numbers of T-cells within the CNS. Moreover, CD8&#x0002b; T-lymphocytes of PD-1 mutants are aberrant with regard of their strong numerical increase and prominent clonal expansions. This suggests that PD-1 prevents a large number of possible clonal expansions of a variety of T-cell clones in PLPtg mice. PD-1 signalling is known to attenuate signals of the T-cell receptor such as PKCtheta and ZAP-70/CD3&#x003b6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004405-Sheppard1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. This could also be the explanation that only CNS T-cells deficient of PD-1 show markedly enhanced INF-&#x003b3; secretion after stimulation, whereas CNS CD8&#x0002b; cells from genuine PLPtg mice show no relevant production of this proinflammatory cytokine. These findings suggest that although prominently expanded and highly susceptible to become activated, PD-1-deficient T-lymphocytes appear to be pathologically &#x0201c;silent&#x0201d; in a healthy environment.</p><p>Due to its inhibitory properties the cognate ligand PD-L1 has been proposed to contribute to maintaining peripheral tolerance and limiting inflammatory damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004405-Magnus1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004405-Sharpe1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004405-Carter1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004405-Fife1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004405-Keir1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

CNS-derived, but not spleen-derived CD8&#x0002b; cells show mono- or oligoclonal expansions, further suggesting CNS-restricted specificity against yet unidentified CNS-antigens. PD-1 is critically involved in these processes: in the presence of PD-1 on CNS CD8&#x0002b; cells, activation and proliferation is limited, whereas absence of PD-1 leads to substantial increase of CD8&#x0002b; cells, a higher propensity to secrete proinflammatory cytokines, multiple clonal expansions and an aggravation of neural damage.</p><p>Taken together, our study demonstrates the important role of a co-inhibitory molecule, PD-1, in modulating glial-injury-related immune responses in the CNS.
