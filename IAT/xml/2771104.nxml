Our efforts are focused on the challenge of over-producing &#x003b1;-helical MPs in <italic>E. coli</italic> by optimizing targeting to the inner membrane. Most native <italic>E.coli</italic> inner membrane proteins are thought to integrate in a co-translational manner, via the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) and the SRP receptor FtsY.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> An early step in this pathway is SRP recognition of a sufficiently hydrophobic N-terminal signal sequence upon emergence from the ribosome tunnel.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> In contrast, most exported proteins possess less hydrophobic N-terminal signals, which evade SRP recognition thereby allowing translation to be completed before targeting of the protein to the SecYEG translocase. Most soluble exported proteins are thought to remain in a partially folded, translocation-competent form by interaction with chaperones such as SecB. One notable exception is the SRP-dependent export of DsbA to the periplasm.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref></p><p>SRP-dependent membrane translocation is important to prevent release of nascent membrane proteins into the cytoplasm where the hydrophobic segments promote aggregation. Also, tightly folded protein domains may jam the translocation machinery if they are presented to SecYEG protein conducting channel after translation has been completed. Thus, engineering a protein to utilize the SRP pathway may directly result in reduced cytoplasmic toxicity and increased throughput through the SecYEG translocase. Bowers <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> recently reported one such example of protein engineering. For many years, the LamB-LacZ42-1 fusion protein has been employed as a model to study the secretion process. This fusion protein depends on the SecB chaperone for post-translational targeting to the SecYEG translocase where it jams the secretion pathway, presumably by rapid, stable folding of LacZ. However, Bowers <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that Sec pathway jamming may be alleviated simply by increasing the hydrophobicity of the LamB-LacZ signal peptide to promote SRP recognition. The finding that SRP-dependence may reduce over-expression toxicity is especially relevant when attempting to produce heterologous MPs in <italic>E. coli</italic>. In particular, in the case of some eukaryotic organellar MPs, a proper signal for <italic>E.coli</italic> inner membrane targeting may not be present.</p><p>The hydrophobic character of a protein is certainly not the only requirement for efficient membrane insertion in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The net charge distribution of acidic and basic residues flanking TM segments is clearly important for the determination of membrane topology.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> Remarkably, addition of a single arginine or lysine has been shown to block the membrane translocation of a model protein in <italic>E. coli</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> Realization of the higher frequency of basic residues within the cytoplasm segments of bacterial membrane proteins in the late 1980s led von Heijne to propose the &#x0201c;positive-inside rule&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> to guide researchers in predicting &#x003b1;-helical membrane protein topology. In subsequent years, many studies have demonstrated that a net negative charge in extra-cytoplasmic sequences flanking either a TM segment or a signal peptide promotes membrane translocation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> This phenomenon is related to the electro-chemical membrane potential across the inner membrane of <italic>E. coli</italic>. Altering the amino acid charge distribution of the model MP &#x0201c;Pf3 coat&#x0201d; results in a complete reversal of membrane topology.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> This study also demonstrated that the membrane potential-dependent translocation of Pf3 coat protein requires the presence of acidic residues in the translocated N-terminal segment. The major coat protein of M13 bacteriophage (M13 Procoat, pVIII or P8 for simplicity) has also been used as a model protein to study membrane potential-dependent translocation. Several studies have concluded that the P8 protein possesses an optimal amino acid charge distribution for efficient inner membrane insertion without the aid of the SecYEG translocase.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref></p><p>After contemplating the wealth of knowledge concerning membrane protein biogenesis in <italic>E. coli</italic>, we have designed the P8CBD fusion partner to aid in the over-expression of heterologous membrane proteins. The membrane protein fusion partner P8CBD possesses the following desirable characteristics: (1) SRP-dependence, (2) optimal charge distribution of the N-terminal 73 amino acids which dictates the topology of the fused protein of interest and (3) a net negative charge at the end of TM2 (at the fusion junction) to promote membrane translocation of the fused protein of interest. Other practical features have been incorporated to enable P8CBD fusion protein detection, purification, and optional <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage by enterokinase (P8CBDek).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Design of the P8CBD fusion partner</title><p>The P8CBD N-terminal fusion partner was designed for optimal membrane targeting. The P8CBD sequence begins with the wild-type M13 phage major coat protein, hereby referred to as P8. Interestingly, wild-type P8 does not depend on SRP for membrane targeting, but does require the YidC insertase for proper membrane assembly.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> The N-terminal processed signal peptide of P8 is only moderately hydrophobic (1.421 on the Goldman-Engelman-Steitz scale<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). However, the P8 TM segment (amino acids 44&#x02013;64) is sufficiently hydrophobic for SRP recognition (1.801 on the GES scale). Translation of the entire 73 amino acid P8 protein may be completed before the hydrophobic TM segment emerges from the ribosome tunnel, so the lack of SRP/FtsY recognition may simply be due to the short length of wild-type P8. Engelman and Steitz<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> proposed that the P8 phage protein has evolved to efficiently insert into membranes by forming a helical hairpin structure by association of its two amphipathic helices. Although wild-type P8 does not require SRP, it is conceivable that P8 fusion proteins may be recognized by SRP due to the hydrophobic nature of residues 44&#x02013;64. In fact, de Gier <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> demonstrated SRP-dependence of a protein where P8 was fused at the C-terminus to a soluble domain of 104 amino acids. Therefore, we anticipated that P8-membrane protein fusions would also be recognized by SRP.</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref> shows the membrane topology of P8CBD. The P8 TM segment is drawn as a helix (the processed signal peptide is not shown). The P8 ORF was extended by fusing DNA encoding 58 amino acids of <italic>E. coli</italic> Signal peptidase to provide a second TM segment (TM2) in order to extend the protein fusion junction into the periplasmic space. TM2 from Signal peptidase was chosen since this peptide is known to efficiently establish the desired orientation within the inner membrane. Furthermore, TM2 from Signal peptidase acts an efficient inner membrane export signal in its native context and in the context of the P8CBD fusion partner. The chitin binding domain (CBD) was engineered into the cytoplasmic loop to serve as an optional affinity tag or detection epitope. Insertion of CBD or other affinity domains at this position does not affect the membrane targeting properties (data not shown). Finally, the Enterokinase (ek) protease cleavage site (DDDDK&#x02193;) and corresponding FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) were incorporated at the fusion junction. <fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The P8CBDek N-terminal protein fusion partner.

SRP-dependence was demonstrated by comparing the membrane translocation of <italic>E. coli</italic> alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) fused to the P8CBD fusion partner in wild-type SRP and mutant SRP-<italic>ffh77</italic> cells. In this cell-based assay, PhoA is only functional when translocated across the inner membrane to the periplasm (after being targeted to the SecYEG translocase by either SecB or SRP). The <italic>ffh77</italic> strain was constructed to carry the chromosomal point mutation described by Tian and Beckwith,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> which results in expression of an A37P variant of Ffh (SRP <italic>F</italic>ifty-<italic>f</italic>our <italic>h</italic>omolog). PhoA fusion proteins were induced with 100 &#x003bc;<italic>M</italic> IPTG and expressed for 60 min at 30&#x000b0;C. Each PhoA activity result is the average of two individual cultures derived from independent colonies. In the wild-type SRP strain MC1061, exceptionally high phosphatase activity was detected upon expression of each P8CBD-PhoA fusion protein [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>(A)]. In contrast, phosphatase activity levels were significantly less in <italic>ffh77</italic> cells, ranging from 31&#x02013;37% of the level measured in MC1061 cells. Importantly, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>(B) shows that the P8CBD-PhoA fusion protein expression level was similar in each strain: wt MC1061 versus <italic>ffh77</italic>. Accordingly, we conclude that the lower levels of PhoA activity in <italic>ffh77</italic> cells relate to a deficiency in SRP-mediated membrane targeting and that P8CBD fusion proteins utilize the SRP pathway. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>(B) also shows that P8CBD fusions are not processed by Signal peptidase to the same extent in <italic>ffh77</italic> cells (Lane 8 vs. Lane 7 and Lane 10 vs. Lane 9), providing additional direct evidence for less efficient inner membrane targeting in cells where the function of the SRP pathway is compromised (doublet in Lanes 8 and 10 indicates precursor and mature forms of P8CBD-PhoA and P8CBDek-PhoA, respectively). Supporting Information Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">2(A) and 2(B)</xref> show protease mapping results where the upper precursor band is protected from digestion thus confirming cytoplasmic localization of a significant fraction of the PhoA domain in <italic>ffh77</italic> cells. PhoA was also expressed with its wild-type signal peptide and with an exceptionally hydrophobic signal sequence from the <italic>E. coli</italic> protein TorT. As expected, wild-type PhoA export was not significantly affected in <italic>ffh77</italic> cells as the native protein is known to be exported by the post-translational SecB pathway. When expressed with the TorT signal, PhoA export also was not affected by the <italic>ffh77</italic> host mutation. This result was unexpected as the TorT signal was shown to promote SRP-dependent export of thioredoxin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> Finally, a practical consideration is that expression and membrane translocation of the PhoA domain is significantly higher when fused to P8CBD as compared to the two <italic>E. coli</italic> signal peptides. <fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>(A) PhoA activity is a measure of membrane targeting and membrane translocation of PhoA in wt MC1061 cells versus mutant <italic>ffh77</italic> cells.

However, one approach to test protein function and proper membrane assembly is to use a host suitable for complementation. The <italic>E. coli</italic> inner membrane protein YidC is essential for cell viability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> In the YidC-depletion strain JS7131, the <italic>araBAD</italic> promoter controls YidC expression from the chromosome. In JS7131, YidC expression is induced by arabinose and the level of YidC protein in the cell may be depleted by growth in the presence of glucose. Thus, JS7131 does not grow on glucose plates unless transformed with a plasmid induced to express a complementing protein. Complementation of YidC-depletion has been shown previously: The YidC homologue from chloroplasts (Alb3) and the yeast mitochondrial protein Oxa1p were both shown to function in <italic>E. coli</italic> when each was expressed as a chimeric fusion to the N-terminal region of YidC.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> In this study, we have demonstrated complementation of YidC depletion by expression of <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> YidC or Oxa1p as fusions to the P8CBD membrane targeting fusion partner. PSI-BLAST<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> was used to search for a homologue of the <italic>E. coli</italic> YidC 548 amino acid protein (accession number NP_418161) within the ORFs of the <italic>T. maritima</italic> MSB8 genome sequence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> A 445 amino acid <italic>Tma</italic> protein (accession number NP_229260) was identified as the homologue of <italic>E. coli</italic> YidC. The two YidC proteins are 48% similar and 35% identical throughout transmembrane segments 2&#x02013;5. The N-terminal amino acids of YidC family proteins are less conserved.

The P8CBD-<italic>Tma</italic>YidC fusion construct was created by replacement of the first 29 codons of the <italic>Tma-yidC</italic> ORF by the P8CBD coding sequence (189 amino acids ending in SGS). When plasmids encoding either protein were transformed into JS7131, colony formation was dependent on the presence of 10 &#x003bc;<italic>M</italic> IPTG to induce the respective recombinant YidC protein from a <italic>Ptac</italic> promoter (data not shown). In this experiment, glucose was added to the media to turn-off expression of the chromosomal <italic>ParaBAD-yidC</italic> gene.

In yeast, Oxa1p is required for the biogenesis of certain respiratory chain complexes,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> a function that has been shown to be conserved among Oxa1p/YidC family members.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Oxa1p is encoded by a nuclear gene (<italic>OXA1</italic>) and the protein is targeted to the mitochondrial inner membrane by a mitochondrial matrix targeting peptide (amino acids 1-42). The P8CBD-Oxa1p fusion construct was designed so that the Oxa1p ORF begins at codon 43. Therefore, the matrix targeting peptide is replaced by P8CBD. In addition, the Oxa1p ORF was extended at the 3&#x02032; end to encode a C-terminal 8-HIS tag. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>(A) shows a genetic representation of the initial <italic>OXA1</italic> construct tested for complementation. We observed that the P8CBD-Oxa8HIS protein complemented the depletion of YidC when the fusion protein was induced with 10 &#x003bc;<italic>M</italic> IPTG (data not shown). However, agar plates containing 100 &#x003bc;<italic>M</italic> IPTG did not produce colonies of JS7131 indicating that this level of Oxa1p induction may be lethal to <italic>E. coli</italic>. Heterologous membrane protein over-expression toxicity is well-documented. One primary cause of such toxicity is that the SecYEG translocase becomes overwhelmed with the over-expressed protein and Sec-dependent endogenous proteins accumulate within the cytoplasm.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> A simple remedy to alleviate such toxicity is to moderate the expression of the heterologous membrane protein to a level where host cell growth is maintained. We accomplished this situation by mutating the ribosomal binding site (rbs) of the <italic>OXA1</italic> construct to moderate the level of translation. Work within our laboratory previously confirmed that rbsH from supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">2(b)</xref> of Gardner <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> is a less efficient translation signal than the original wild-type P8 ribosomal binding site (labeled as rbsO). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>(B) shows an outline of the rbsH-<italic>OXA1</italic> construct that was secondarily tested for complementation. As expected, complementation of YidC depletion using the rbsH-<italic>OXA1</italic> construct required the addition of higher levels of IPTG (100 &#x003bc;<italic>M</italic>) to produce colonies. The practical benefits of employing a weaker rbs (in combination with a <italic>tac</italic> promoter) for membrane protein expression are demonstrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>(C,D). Over-expression of the Oxa8HIS fusion protein is improved significantly when comparing the final yield of protein after 20 h of induction with either 40 or 400 &#x003bc;<italic>M</italic> IPTG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>(B) Lanes 11 and 12 vs. Lanes 8 and 9, respectively).

Huber demonstrated that most <italic>E. coli</italic> signal peptides with hydrophobicity scores greater than that of DsbA mediated SRP-dependent export of the rapidly folding thioredoxin protein, but there were clear exceptions. For example, the very hydrophobic TreA signal did not direct export of thioredoxin. The motivation for using an SRP-dependent signal peptide is generally to promote the co-translational export or membrane integration of the target protein to increase the probability that the target protein is presented to the SecYEG translocase in an export-competent, unfolded state. Our evaluation of TorTss-PhoA export indicates that the simple solution of fusing a hydrophobic signal peptide to a protein of interest does not dictate SRP-dependent inner membrane translocation. However, each variant of P8CBD displayed SRP-dependence when fused to the PhoA domain. When P8CBD was fused to two different polytopic membrane proteins (<italic>Tma</italic>YidC and Oxa1p) SRP-dependence was not directly analyzed. Both proteins possess large periplasmic domains in addition to multiple TM segments so membrane integration after release into the cytoplasm is extremely unlikely. Importantly, both <italic>Tma</italic>YidC and Oxa1p were shown to be functional when moderately over-expressed as fusions to the P8CBDek membrane targeting fusion partner. In the case of <italic>Tma</italic>YidC, P8CBD simply replaced the native uncleaved N-terminal signal anchor. For Oxa1p expression, P8CBDek replaced the mitochondrial matrix targeting peptide. We anticipate that other heterologous membrane proteins may be over-expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> using the P8CBD strategy by replacement of the native N-terminal signal or targeting sequence. These examples are especially encouraging for the over-expression of other &#x003b1;-helical membrane proteins with an N-out topology (e.g. GPCRs).</p><p>The P8CBD membrane-targeting fusion partner was rationally designed with practical needs in mind. Firstly, multiple epitopes allow for immuno-detection and verification of full-length expression of the protein of interest. The N-terminus of mature P8 was readily detected in our studies by monoclonal antibody B62-FE2 (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>). The cytoplasmic CBD domain may also be detected by poly- or monoclonal antibody reagents (NEB). Furthermore, FLAG immuno-detection of the enterokinase (ek) recognition site is possible for P8CBDek fusion proteins. Poly-histidine sequences may be incorporated to aid protein purification and immuno-detection. We expect that C-terminal tag addition will be preferred so that only proteins expressed in full-length are isolated by metal-chelate chromatography. N-terminal His-tagging is not a viable approach as the N-terminus of P8 is subject to Signal peptidase processing. However, a second option for poly-histidine tagging is to replace the CBD tag sequence in the cytoplasmic loop. Polyhistidine sequences in extra-cytoplasmic regions are not recommended as membrane translocation may be affected by basic amino acid residues. This may explain the reduced export of PhoA when fused to P8CBDek versus P8CBD [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>(A)], as the only difference in the two constructs is the insertion of the DYKDDDDKGS amino acid sequence at the fusion junction. Even with the observed reduction in PhoA export, the P8CBDek fusion partner performed very well in a direct comparison to membrane targeting mediated by two different <italic>E. coli</italic> signal peptides. In particular, the P8CBDek fusion partner outperformed the wild-type PhoA signal in terms of producing periplasmic functional PhoA activity. Current work in the lab involves testing a P8CBD fusion partner containing a Signal peptidase (sp) site at the end of TM2 (vector p8CBDsp) so that soluble proteins may be constitutively delivered into the periplasmic space.</p><p>Protein expression level is especially sensitive to the DNA sequence at the 5&#x02032; end of the ORF. For example, Qing <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> reported that translation initiation in <italic>E. coli</italic> is enhanced by A/T-rich sequences downstream of the start codon. Of note is that the P8 ORF (gene VIII from M13 phage) happens to begin with the coding sequence 5&#x02032;-ATGAAAAAG... Efficient translation of P8CBD apparently provides a running start for the expression of membrane protein fusions and may minimize potential bias against translation of heterologous proteins where the genes have not been codon-optimized for <italic>E. coli</italic>. The <italic>Thermatoga maritima yidC</italic> gene contains ten AGA and two AGG arginine codons that are rarely used in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Specifically, an AGA codon at position four of the native signal might be limiting the expression of the wild-type <italic>Tma</italic> protein in <italic>E. coli</italic> as rare codons at the 5&#x02032; end of an ORF have been shown to be more influential than rare codons in other segments of an ORF. The finding that a weaker ribosomal binding site results in a greater level of over-expressed membrane protein might be puzzling. However, one must simply imagine the SecYEG translocase as a bottleneck to understand why tuning the expression level of a membrane protein is so critical.</p><p>Our results in over-expressing <italic>Tma</italic>-YidC as a P8CBD fusion have prompted the notion of pursuing structural studies since this thermostable member of the YidC family may be more amenable to x-ray crystallography. Other future studies will include testing the over-expression of human membrane receptors and quantifying the level of protein capable of ligand binding. Alternative protease sites may be tested at the fusion junction for their effect on membrane translocation and for susceptibility to <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage. Finally, we expect that the P8CBD fusion technology will help to advance many studies of membrane protein structure and function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and plasmids</title><p>This MC1061-<italic>ffh77</italic> strain was modeled after the <italic>ffh77</italic> strain isolated by Tian and Beckwith.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> The <italic>ffh77</italic> allele refers to a single base change resulting in an alanine to proline substitution at position 37.
