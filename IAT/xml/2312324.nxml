On the contrary, changes in the levels of H3K9-14ac were more subtle. Components of the H3K4 methylating MLL complex are not recruited in the absence of NF-Y.

Initial evaluation of the data between chromatin of cells infected with Ad-GFP and wt Ad-NF-YA yielded similar results (See below), so we pursued analysis by comparing GFP and YA-DN. NF-Y binding was controlled with anti-YB antibodies, reasoning that for the YA-DN to be effective, efficient removal of one of the histone-like subunits should be monitored. With respect to the anti-Flag control antibody, binding was indeed severely affected -2 to 10-fold- on all promoters tested, although some residual binding was still observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002066-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). ChIPs with histone marks were performed in parallel and evaluated after normalization for the total recoveries of histone H3, as measured with an antibody directed against non modified H3. The plotted data indicate a decrease of both H3K4me3 and H3K79me2 that paralleled almost perfectly that of NF-YB. The only exception was Chop, an inducible ER-stress gene, which is expressed at very low levels: indeed, it has a low level of H3K79me2, and H3K4me3 varies little. Interestingly, H3K9-14Ac behaved differently in YA-DN infected cells: in most promoters, there was a 2-fold increase, and only on APOBEC3B we observed a decrease.

H3K9-14Ac levels were high and an increase was observed on three genes -IL2RB, SUHW1 and SEZ6- which also show an increase in H3K4me3. In summary, the promoters in which the decrease in NF-YB association was more pronounced were also those in which the switch between positive and negative methyl marks are more prominent.

This is in agreement with the decrease in positive methyl marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002066-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) and repression of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002066-g001">Fig. 1</xref>); note that Suhw1, which shows no change in the histone methyl patterns, is also invariant in the -low- transcription rates after NF-Y removal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002066-Ceribelli1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we conclude that NF-Y controls a switch in methyl marks deposition and a dramatic change in promoter functions.</p><fig id="pone-0002066-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002066.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Removal of NF-Y leads to loss of H4K20me3 from inactive promoters and deposition of active methylation marks.</title><p>A.

In this report, we find that DNA interactions are not affected by the presence of positive H3 methyl modifications. A <italic>premiere</italic> among transcription factors, NF-Y removal alters substantially the histone methylation patterns leading to important functional consequences.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>NF-Y in the build-up of positive methyl marks</title><p>It is clear that specific histone modifications are associated with &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;inactive&#x0201d; chromatin. Among active marks, genetic and biochemical experiments suggest a step-wise deposition of modifications along the promoter and transcribed regions of a gene. In general, a relevant question is what determines the location of these marks on genomes. It has long been known that the binding of transcription factors and cofactors to promoters are hallmarks of expression, by signalling to the Pol II transcription machinery the positional coordinates. It would seem logical, therefore, to postulate that positive histone marks are positioned according to a code determined by the sequence-specific TFs. Reassuringly, several studies have confirmed that TFs binding indeed correlates with the presence of &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; marks and with expression. In a detailed correlative analysis between histone marks and MYC binding <italic>in vivo</italic>, it was established that this TF is always associated with a specific context of H3K4me3 and H3K79me2. However, MYC removal -and comparison between myc<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and myc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells- leaves this pattern intact, while ablating H4 acetylations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002066-Guccione1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The conclusion was that MYC actually requires certain modifications to bind to the target E box and that binding is a signal for further modifications. Similarly, we and others found high levels of NF-Y binding and H3K4 and H3K79 methylations at poised promoters before induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002066-Baumeister1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002066-Donati1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, begging for the question of which comes in first.</p><p>Surprisingly, in genome-wide analysis of NF-Y and H3K4me3 sites with tiling arrays, we find that NF-Y <italic>loci</italic> can be divided in two distinct groups: (i) an expected large one overlapping with H3K4me3 and correlating with expression; (ii) a second group, devoid of H3K4me3, on silent genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002066-Ceribelli1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggested that the presence of this mark is not a pre-requisite for NF-Y binding. Rather, we find here that NF-Y binding is required for recruitment of key components of the MLL methylating complex &#x02013;MLL1 and Menin- and for deposition of H3K4me3 and H3K79me2. It is apparent, therefore, that at least two classes of TFs exist: one which acts early in promoter identification and predisposes the recruitment of specific methylating complexes; a second class, <italic>a la</italic> MYC, which takes advantage of the &#x0201c;stage&#x0201d; set up by modifications set up by NF-Y (and the likes). This interpretation is entirely consistent with biochemical and functional experiments gathered in several inducible systems in which NF-Y, itself a poor &#x0201c;activator&#x0201d;, cooperates in recruiting neighbouring inducible TFs, such as HSF1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002066-Li1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, SREBP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002066-Bennett1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, ATF6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002066-Yoshida1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Invariably, NF-Y binding precedes and is required for TF and coactivator positioning and transcriptional activation.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>NF-Y and H4K20me3</title><p>A role of NF-Y in active mechanisms of repression is emerging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002066-Imbriano1">&#x0005b;33 and References therein&#x0005d;</xref> and recent experiments in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have genetically linked ceNF-Y to Polycomb repression through ESC/E(Z) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002066-Deng1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. It was therefore not completely unexpected to find that the NF-Y dependence of positive marks on active promoters is mirrored, on repressed genes, by the behaviour of H4K20me3. We have specifically analyzed this mark because it was the most consistently counter-correlative to H3K4me3 in the cohort of <italic>loci</italic> derived from our ChIP on chip experiments. As for the other two major negative methyl marks, we could not find any enrichment of H3K9me3, and only a subset of H3K4me3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> sites were H3K27me3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. H4K20 tri-methylation is performed by the Suv4-20 Set domain methylase and is apparently associated with heterochromatin formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002066-Schotta1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. NF-Y appears to be important to anchor this negative mark on many, but not all promoters: we note that the results, in this set, are more variegated with respect to positive marks: LOC441956, IL2RB, IGCL1 show a parallel decrease of NF-YB and H4K20me3, LOC198537 and FLJ90181 of the former by marginally of the latter, SUHW11 of the latter, but not the former, SEZ6 of neither. There is an important issue that needs to be underlined when considering the lack of NF-YB removal in ChIPs: we are measuring NF-Y binding with an antibody against NF-YB, under conditions in which the dominant negative is NF-YA-based; the lack of removal of the histone-fold dimer could be due to additional interactions with other TFs, independently from the CCAAT box. The NF-YB-NF-YC dimer, indeed, has several residues in the L1 and L2 that could contact DNA <italic>a la</italic> H2A-H2B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002066-Romier1">&#x0005b;27 and References therein&#x0005d;</xref>. SUHW1 and SEZ6, which do respond to Ad YA-DN infections by switching histones marks, but maintaining NF-YB association, might uncover a specific role of the NF-YA subunit in this switch, uncoupled to the dimer. In addition, there is an excess of NF-YB-NF-YC over NF-YA -2&#x02013;3-fold on average (M. Ceribelli, in preparation)- and thus there might be sites occupied by the histone-fold dimer, but not by NF-YA: these would be predicted to be oblivious of the NF-YA dominant negative, as used here. It will be essential to perform genome-wide analysis of NF-YA and specific inactivation of the histone fold dimer to establish clarify these points.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>NF-Y as a variant H2B-H2A?</title><p>Monoubiquitination of H2B at Lysine 123 -K120 in humans- by the E2 conjugating RAD6 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase BRE1 is an early event in the establishment of a chromatin environment conducive of transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002066-Osley1">&#x0005b;Reviewed in Refs. 34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002066-Laribee2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.

Interestingly, these two Lysines are conserved in NF-YB and required for DNA-binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002066-Sinha1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, the NF-YB Lysine corresponding to H2B K85 -K107- is acetylated by p300 (G. Caretti, R.M., unpublished). There is currently no data about NF-Y ubiquitination, but the molecular basis for modifications are present, both in NF-YB (K135, K140, K146, K149 in the &#x003b1;-C) and NF-YC (K124 and K127 also in &#x003b1;-C). Clearly, this is an area that will have to be investigated thoroughly in the future.</p><p>The switch between positive and negative marks detailed here leads us to speculate that NF-Y might represent a specialized version of the H2A-Ub/H2B-Ub system, one that would have a strict sequence-specificity and affinity for core promoters. In an elegant study on the rules determining global nucleosome positioning in yeast, Segal et al. found low nucleosome occupancy at TSS and examined frequencies of TFs for the occurrence of nucleosome occupancy: the yeast NF-Y homologues HAP2/3/5 came on top of the ranking for binding site accessibility by intrinsic nucleosome positioning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002066-Segal1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, CCAAT boxes would be specifically left open for binding in core promoters. We propose a scenario whereby NF-Y is a &#x0201c;variant&#x0201d; sequence-specific histone, more distantly related with respect to H2A.Z and H3.3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002066-Sarma1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, that marks transcription units containing the CCAAT recognition sequence. Much biochemical and genetic work lies ahead to establish whether there is indeed an &#x0201c;NF-Y code&#x0201d; of modifications that funnels histone modifying machines to promoters and other regulatory areas of the genome and thus regulating local chromatin accessibility.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and Infections</title><p>NIH3T3 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10&#x00025; Foetal Calf serum (FCS), 1&#x00025; antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) and L-glutamine in 5&#x00025; CO2.
