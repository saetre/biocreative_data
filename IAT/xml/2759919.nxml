The PMR1 mediated decrease in PTH mRNA levels involves the PTH mRNA 3'-UTR ARE, KSRP and the exosome.

Serum calcium and phosphate concentrations, in turn, control PTH gene expression post-transcriptionally through regulated binding of the <italic>trans-</italic>acting proteins AU rich binding factor 1 (AUF1), Upstream of N-<italic>ras </italic>(Unr) and KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) to a type III AU rich element (ARE) in PTH mRNA 3'-UTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. AUF1 and Unr stabilize PTH mRNA both in an in-vitro degradation assays (IVDA), using parathyroid extracts, and in intact cells. We have recently shown that the mRNA decay promoting protein KSRP decreases PTH mRNA stability and steady-state levels through the PTH mRNA ARE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Both KSRP and AUF1 bind to PTH mRNA in vitro and in intact parathyroid glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In the parathyroid, the interaction of PTH mRNA with KSRP and AUF1 is regulated by changes in serum calcium and phosphate. Calcium depletion increases the association of AUF1 with the PTH mRNA ARE and decreases KSRP binding to the ARE resulting in mRNA stabilization. These interactions are reversed by phosphate depletion where PTH mRNA is destabilized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In tranfected cells, over-expression of KSRP destabilizes the PTH mRNA and this is mediated by the PTH mRNA ARE. KSRP-PTH mRNA interaction is prevented by over-expression of AUF1 p45 isoform. Over-expression of AUF1 p45 also attenuates the KSRP-mediated destabilization of PTH mRNA in transfected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 is also a PTH mRNA destabilizing protein. Pin1 mediates its effects via interaction with KSRP, which leads to KSRP dephosphorylation and activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The regulated interactions of KSRP and AUF1 with the PTH mRNA ARE determine its half life in vivo and in vitro.</p><p>AREs are destabilizing elements located in the 3'UTRs of many inherently labile mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. AREs are targets for trans-acting proteins regulating mRNA localization, stability and translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Upon deadenylation, ARE-containing mRNAs are degraded in either a 3' to 5' or a 5' to 3' direction by two distinct exoribonucleolytic pathways mediated by the exosome and XrnI, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It has been recently demonstrated that these two pathways are functionally linked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. KSRP recruits the multiprotein 3'-5'exoribonuclease complex, exosome to target mRNAs. The central part of KSRP contains four adjacent KH domains that are required for its interaction with the decay-promoting machinery and with ARE containing mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. AU rich binding factor 1 (AUF1) promotes either decay or stabilization, depending on the mRNA and cell type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In addition, a number of mRNAs are targeted by endonucleases that initiate decay by cleaving within the body of the mRNA while it is actively engaged by translating ribosomes. Three mRNA endonucleases have been linked to specific decay pathways; polysomal ribonuclease 1 (PMR1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], G3BP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and IRE-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In Xenopus Laevis hepatocytes, many mRNAs are destabilized by estrogen through the activation of PMR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. PMR1 forms a selective complex with its substrate mRNA to initiate decay by cleaving within the mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Xenopus (x) PMR1 is a member of the peroxidase gene family and is synthesized as a 80-kDa precursor (PMR80) that is processed to the active 60-kDa form (PMR60) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The ability of PMR1 to target polysomes and activate mRNA decay depends on tyrosine phosphorylation at position 650 in the C-terminus of PMR60 by c-Src [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Here we show that PTH mRNA is a substrate for PMR1 in vitro and in transfected cells. The PTH mRNA 3'-UTR ARE is required for PMR60-dependent PTH mRNA destabilization. PMR60 co-immunoprecipitates with PTH mRNA, the exosome and KSRP. Surprisingly, siRNA mediated knock-down of either exosome components or KSRP reduces the PMR1-mediated PTH mRNA decay in intact cells. We suggest that KSRP recruits a degradation complex, comprising both endo- and exo-ribonucleases to PTH mRNA, thus controlling its mRNA half-life.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>PMR60 decreases PTH mRNA and protein levels in transfected HEK293 cells by promoting ARE-dependent PTH mRNA decay</title><p>Using an antibody to Xenopus PMR1 we identified the mammalian PMR1 ortholog in rat parathyroid, rat liver, and human HEK293 cells (unpublished observation).

To determine if the regulation of PTH mRNA levels by PMR60 is exerted via the PTH mRNA ARE, We used a rPTH expression plasmid with an internal deletion of the PTH mRNA 3'-UTR ARE. In contrast to the full-length PTH mRNA, co-tranfected PMR60 had no effect on the mutated PTH mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Therefore, the decrease in PTH mRNA levels by PMR60 is dependent on an intact ARE. We then used a GH reporter gene containing the rat PTH 63 nt ARE (GH63) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

KSRP interacts with the exosome that is required for PTH mRNA rapid decay in the presence of parathyroid extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We hypothesized that PMR1 may cooperate with KSRP and the exosome to facilitate PTH mRNA decay. We first studied the association of PMR60 with KSRP. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids for either TAP- and Myc-tagged PMR60 or GFP-TAP. GFP and PMR60 containing complexes were affinity purified, digested by Tev protease, and analyzed by immunoblot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, upper panel). Anti-KSRP immunoblot demonstrated that endogenous KSRP co-purifies with PMR60 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, middle panel).

A ~70% Rrp46 knock-down compared to control (CAT) siRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), led to a marked increase in the mRNA levels of co-transfected PTH (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>), thus confirming our previous data that the exosome is required for PTH mRNA decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. As expected, PMR60 reduced PTH mRNA levels when co-transfected with the control siRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, see also Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Neither siRNAs affected mRNA levels of the endogenous control GAPDH mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, bottom panel). Similar results were obtained by knocking-down the exosome subunit Rrp40 (data not shown).

KSRP was knocked down by specific siRNAs in cells expressing PTH and either PMR60 or control plasmid. KSRP knock-down (~60%, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>) increased PTH mRNA levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>) as we have previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].

Similar results were obtained using an additional set of siRNAs targeting a different sequence of KSRP mRNA (data not shown).

This element leads to decreased mRNA levels of reporter genes in transfected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The regulated binding of the PTH mRNA stabilizing proteins, AUF1 and Unr, and the destabilizing factor KSRP to this 63 element controls PTH mRNA levels in vivo in the parathyroid gland and in vitro in transfected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. KSRP promotes rapid mRNA decay by recruiting the exoribonucleolytic complex exosome to its target mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We now show that the endoribonuclease PMR1 decreases PTH mRNA levels in transfected cells and that this involves the PTH mRNA ARE, KSRP and the exosome.</p><p>Few vertebrate mRNA endonucleases have been identified, one of which is PMR1. Since a PMR1 immunoreactive protein similar to the mammalian ortholog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] is expressed in the parathyroid, we asked whether this endoribonuclease may be part of the PTH mRNA decay machinery. Reagents for mammalian PMR1 are not available so we used the closely-related Xenopus protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Over-expression of the catalytically active form of PMR1 (PMR60) decreased PTH mRNA levels in co-transfected cells and this was dependent upon the PTH mRNA 63 nt ARE. Similarly, in IVDA experiments, extracts from PMR60 over-expressing cells led to a more rapid decay of PTH mRNA with an intact ARE, when compared to extracts from mock-transfected cells. These results identify PTH mRNA and in particular the PTH mRNA ARE as a target for PMR1 in transfected cells. A PMR60 enriched fraction also specifically cleaved PTH mRNA in vitro. At least one cleavage site was identified ~70 nt from the PTH mRNA 3' end. It has been reported that PMR1 preferentially cleaves single-stranded RNAs at UG dinucleotides within albumin mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The PTH mRNA 3'-UTR is an open region with little folded base pairing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and contains several UG dinucleotides that may be potential targets for PMR1. Specifically, the 3' terminal region of rat PTH mRNA contains a single UG dinucleotide compatible with the production of a ~70 nt 3' PTH mRNA fragment upon digestion. Interestingly, this UG dinucleotide is part of the PTH mRNA 3'-UTR 63 nt ARE instability element that is both necessary and sufficient to confer regulation of PTH mRNA stability by changes in calcium and phosphate levels by rat parathyroid extracts and in vitro in transfected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>We also show that PMR60<sup>0 </sup>specifically interacts with PTH mRNA. Furthermore, PMR60 displays an unanticipated association with the exosome component Rrp4 and with KSRP. Both interactions occur in the absence of PTH mRNA. It is of interest that KSRP KH domains 3-4 that mediate KSRP-exosome association and promote ARE-containing mRNA decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], are sufficient for KSRP-PMR60 association. KH domains 3 and 4 also mediate the binding of KSRP to the PTH mRNA ARE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We can hypothesize that KSRP recruits PMR1 to additional labile mRNAs and this protein-protein association would facilitate KSRP-dependent decay promoting activity.</p><p>Our results show that the effect of the endoribonuclease PMR1 on PTH mRNA levels is dependent upon the expression of exosome components and KSRP, which interacts with both the exosome and PMR1. These results suggest that PMR1, KSRP and the exosome participate in PTH mRNA decay by forming a multi-subunit degradation complex with the PTH mRNA ARE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Upon PMR1 cleavage, PTH mRNA decay may proceed through exosome mediated removal of the 5' fragment or of both fragments by exonucleolytic cleavage. Of interest, PMR60 over-expression prevented the increased PTH mRNA levels induced by either exosome or KSRP depletion, suggesting that PMR60 may also have an effect on PTH mRNA expression that is independent of both KSRP and the exosome.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Model for the role of PTH mRNA interacting proteins in PTH mRNA stability</bold>. PTH mRNA stability is regulated through the interaction of AUF1, Unr and KSRP with the PTH mRNA 3'-UTR ARE (light green) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. KSRP, the exosome and PMR1 are recruited to PTH mRNA through KSRP-exosome interaction leading to decreased PTH mRNA stability and levels. PMR1-PTH mRNA association may be mediated by additional unidentified binding protein/s (PMR1-BP).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-10-70-6"/></fig><p>Cooperation between ribonucleolytic machineries have been reported also in other systems. Knock-down of the de-capping protein Dcp2 reduces decay from the 3' end of a &#x003b2;-globin mRNA carrying the c-fos ARE, and knockdown of the exosome subunits PM/Scl-100 or Rrp41 reduce decay from the 5' end, indicating that the 5' and 3' decay pathways are functionally linked and that unstable mRNAs can be degraded simultaneously from both ends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Wang and Kiledjian have similarly shown that mRNA decay proceeds through a coupled 3' to 5' and 5' to 3' exoribonucleolytic pathway that involves the interaction of a sub-set of the exosome proteins with DcpS and the decapping pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Moreover, it was recently shown that eukaryotic exosome itself contains both exonuclease and endonuclease activity, mediated by two distinct domains of its Dis3 (Rrp44) subunit. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Our studies do not exclude the possibility of an endonuclease activity of the exosome that co-purifies with PMR60 and is distinct from PMR60 and cleaves PTH mRNA. The combination of endo and exoribonucleases in one RNA-degrading machine may offer a fundamental advantage to the cell and appears to be more widespread in nature than could be expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Altogether, the above observations and the data presented here demonstrate that interactions of the exosome complex with other mRNA decay enzymes facilitate and coordinate mRNA decay, both endo- and exonucleolytically.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>PTH mRNA is a target for the endonuclease PMR1. The PMR1 mediated decrease in PTH mRNA levels involves the PTH mRNA 3'-UTR ARE, KSRP and the exosome. Our findings suggest an unanticipated mechanism by which KSRP and the exosome regulate the half-life of a target mRNA by facilitating its endoribonucleolytic cleavage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Protein extractions</title><p>For IVDA post-mitochondrial extracts were prepared.
