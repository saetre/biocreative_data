Two of the most widely used attenuated strains in the history of tuberculosis research are <named-content content-type="genus-species">Mycobacterium bovis</named-content> BCG (BCG) and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</named-content> H37Ra (H37Ra), which both lost their virulence during in vitro serial passage. Whereas the attenuation of BCG is due mainly to loss of the ESAT-6 secretion system, ESX-1, the reason why H37Ra is attenuated remained unknown. However, here we show that a point mutation (S219L) in the predicted DNA binding region of the regulator PhoP is involved in the attenuation of H37Ra via a mechanism that impacts on the secretion of the major T cell antigen ESAT-6. Only H37Ra &#x0201c;knock-ins&#x0201d; that carried an integrated cosmid with the wild-type <italic>phoP</italic> gene from <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> H37Rv showed changes in colony morphology, increased virulence, ESAT-6 secretion, and induction of specific T cell responses, whereas other H37Ra constructs did not.

The pathogenesis of this bacterium is closely linked with its ability to circumvent destruction by the host cell, which depends on a large variety of mycobacterial lipids and secreted proteins. Genome comparison of fully virulent strains with closely related, but attenuated strains that have lost their ability to cause disease is a powerful approach to identify factors contributing to mycobacterial virulence. In this study we have compared the virulent paradigm strain of tuberculosis research <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> H37Rv, with the widely used, attenuated laboratory variant, H37Ra. This analysis, combined with gene complementation studies, has identified a mutation in the two-component system regulator PhoP that impacts on the secretion and T cell recognition of the 6-kD early-secreted antigenic target ESAT-6. In previous studies, both PhoP and the ESAT-6 secretion system ESX-1 have been identified independently as major virulence determinants of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content>, so the finding that their action is interconnected opens exciting new insights and perspectives into the virulence regulation of tubercle bacilli.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Frigui W, Bottai D, Majlessi L, Monot M, Josselin E, et al.

In spite of the great progress that has been made in the understanding of some basic features of its pathogenesis, tuberculosis remains a major threat to human life in most parts of the world. Indeed, <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> has retained many secrets of its so successful pathogenic lifecycle. Among the different possibilities to obtain new insight into the mechanisms employed by <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> to infect its host, the analysis of attenuated strains is one promising approach, and there are some well-documented examples of laboratory-attenuated strains. One of them is the &#x0201c;Bacille de Calmette et Gu&#x000e9;rin&#x0201d; (BCG), which was originally derived in 1921 from a virulent <named-content content-type="genus-species">Mycobacterium bovis</named-content> strain by 230 passages on potato-glycerol-ox bile medium &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040033-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;.

This strain was obtained in 1934 by serial passage of patient isolate <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> H37 through media with different pHs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040033-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d; and since then has been widely used in many laboratories in the world. Despite its long use, the reasons for its stable attenuation have not yet been elucidated. As H37Ra is derived from the same parent strain as <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> H37Rv (&#x0201c;v&#x0201d; for virulent) (H37Rv), the sequenced paradigm strain of tuberculosis research &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040033-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;, genomic comparisons of the attenuated and virulent variants of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> H37 are particularly interesting and have the potential to identify subtle genetic changes that might be responsible for the phenotypic differences observed between the two strains. In a previous study we have tried to reveal these determinants &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040033-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, but the methods employed only identified large genetic polymorphisms, associated with IS<italic>6110</italic>, which were not found to be responsible for the attenuation of H37Ra &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040033-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. In another study, Pascopella et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040033-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; transformed a cosmid library of H37Rv into H37Ra and then selected for clones that were enriched on passage through the mouse. A number of overlapping cosmid clones that gave enhanced growth and survival in the spleens of infected mice relative to that of wild-type H37Ra were identified &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040033-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the effects of these complementation attempts on virulence remained limited, and no sequence information was described, which makes it difficult now to identify the genes implicated. H37Ra was also the subject of extensive micro-array based analyses, including whole genome comparative DNA/DNA analyses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040033-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d; and transcriptional studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040033-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040033-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, which have identified some candidate genes that were consistently downregulated. However, a definitive conclusion about the molecular determinants of the attenuation could not be drawn.</p><p>As all these previous attempts have failed to identify the genetic basis for the attenuation, we subjected H37Ra to microarray-based DNA re-sequencing (NimbleGen Systems). This technique has previously permitted single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of a PA-824 drug resistant mutant strain of H37Rv to be detected &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040033-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. This approach was combined with gene &#x0201c;knock-in&#x0201d; strategies, to complement selected lesions, that allowed recombinant H37Ra strains to be engineered, whose virulence and immunogenicity were then evaluated in in vitro, ex vivo and animal models. This strategy led us to identify and characterize a point mutation in the <italic>phoP</italic>/<italic>phoR</italic> two-component regulatory system of H37Ra that has uncovered novel regulatory links, which impact on the secretion and T cell recognition of the major T cell antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Microarray-Based Comparative Genome Sequencing of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> H37Ra</title><p>The genome-wide comparative mutational analysis of H37Ra and H37Rv was carried out by NimbleGen Systems following a previously published method &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040033-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.

For the other 13 genes we found no indication that would identify them as potential virulence genes, as none of them belong to the 5&#x00025; of genes that were previously determined by transposon site hybridization (TraSH) as being essential for in vivo growth of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040033-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>While writing this article, the whole genome sequence of H37Ra became publicly available (NC&#x0005f;009525), and comparison of the SNP data obtained from the H37Ra strain used in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0040033-st001">Table S1</xref>) with the NC&#x0005f;009525 data, showed that some differences existed between the H37Ra strains, a phenomenon which was also previously observed for BCG &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040033-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d; and H37Rv &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040033-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.
