Treatment of the human bronchial epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B, with arsenic(III) chloride (As<sup>3+</sup>) resulted in a significant increase in GADD45&#x003b1; protein and mRNA. However, As<sup>3+</sup> only exhibited a marginal effect on the transcription of the GADD45&#x003b1; gene. The accumulation of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA is largely achieved by the stabilization of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA in the cellular response to As<sup>3+</sup>. As<sup>3+</sup> is able to induce binding of mRNA stabilizing proteins, nucleolin and less potently, HuR, to the GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA. Although As<sup>3+</sup> was unable to affect the expression of nucleolin, treatment of the cells with As<sup>3+</sup> resulted in re-distribution of nucleolin from nucleoli to nucleoplasm. Silencing of the nucleolin mRNA by RNA interference reversed As<sup>3+</sup>-induced stabilization of the GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA and accumulation of the GADD45&#x003b1; protein. Stabilization of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA, thus, represents a novel mechanism contributing to the production of GADD45&#x003b1; and cell cycle arrest in response to As<sup>3+</sup>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Growth arrest and DNA damage inducible gene 45&#x003b1; (GADD45&#x003b1;) is a widely expressed, inducible nuclear protein that plays critical role in the checkpoint function of cells in response to a wide spectrum of DNA-damaging or stress signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). GADD45&#x003b1; has been shown to inhibit cyclin B/CDC2, a key protein kinase complex governing G<sub>2</sub>/M transition of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). In addition, GADD45&#x003b1; is an important protein involved in genomic stability by its contributions to DNA excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Furthermore, GADD45&#x003b1; has been implicated in cell apoptosis, cell survival and innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The human GADD45&#x003b1; is an acidic protein composed of 165 amino acids, with some similarities to GADD45&#x003b2;, GADD45&#x003b3; and ribosomal protein S12. In addition to binding to cyclin B/CDC2 as originally demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>), GADD45&#x003b1; is also capable of interacting with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), p21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>), histone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), TAFII70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), p38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) and MTK1/MEKK4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), a MAPK kinase kinase that can activate JNK and p38 subgroups of MAP kinase.</p><p>The transcriptional regulation of GADD45&#x003b1; has been extensively studied during the past several years. The best-studied transcriptional regulator for the expression of GADD45&#x003b1; is the tumor suppressor protein, p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). In response to ionizing radiation or methyl methansulfonate, GADD45&#x003b1; was rapidly up-regulated through a p53-dependent mechanism. A consensus p53 binding site has been identified in the third intron region of the GADD45&#x003b1; gene. Ionizing radiation or certain other DNA-damaging signals induce binding of p53 to this site, followed by the recruitment of acetyltransferase p300/CBP and protein arginine methyltransferases PRMT1 or CARM1 to this region to stimulate the transcription of GADD45&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). The promoter region of GADD45&#x003b1; lacks a consensus p53 binding site. However, p53 can also stimulate the transcription of GADD45&#x003b1; by forming a complex with WT1 that binds directly to the proximal promoter of GADD45&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Other transcription factors that possibly contribute to a p53-independent regulation of GADD45&#x003b1; include FoxO3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), Oct1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), C/EBP&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), Egr-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), POU family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), and two transcriptional repressors of GADD45&#x003b1;, c-myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) and ZBRK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p><p>Arsenic is a naturally occurring metalloid that exhibits potent carcinogenic effects in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). It exists in both inorganic and organic forms with different oxidation states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). The primary forms of arsenic in environment are the inorganic trivalent (As<sup>3+</sup>) and pentavalent arsenic (As<sup>5+</sup>). Humans are exposed to arsenic mainly through oral consumption of contaminated water, food or drugs, and inhalation of arsenic-containing dust or smoke in several occupational settings. Paradoxically, arsenic has also been used as an effective single therapeutic agent for several tumors, especially acute promyelocytic leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms of arsenic-induced carcinogenesis or arsenic-induced remissions of tumors are not fully understood. We and others have previously shown that arsenic is a potent inducer of GADD45&#x003b1; expression in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). We have also shown that activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) might be partially responsible for the induction of GADD45&#x003b1; by arsenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). The involvement of JNK in GADD45&#x003b1; expression was further confirmed in the cellular response to UV radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) or a PPAR&#x003b3; agonist, troglitazone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). In an attempt to gain insight into the detailed mechanism of arsenic-induced expression of GADD45&#x003b1;, we examined the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations of GADD45&#x003b1; expression in human bronchial epithelial cells subjected to arsenic exposure. The data presented here reveal that the arsenic-induced expression of GADD45&#x003b1; is mainly regulated by post-transcriptional mechanism in which the mRNA of GADD45&#x003b1; was bound and stabilized by the RNA binding proteins, mainly nucleolin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture, transfections and luciferase assays</title><p>The human bronchial epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B, was purchased from American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and grown at 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified incubator. Transfections were performed using lipofectamine 2000 as suggested by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The human GADD45&#x003b1; promoter and intron 3 luciferase reporter constructs were provided by Dr Albert J. Fornace at National Institutes of Health (NIH, Bethesda, MD). In these vectors, the GADD45&#x003b1; promoter region from &#x02212;994 to +26 and the entire intron 3 region were inserted into the upstream of the luciferase reporter gene, respectively. Cells were harvested at 36 h and analyzed for luciferase activity using the Promega Dual-Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI).

Total cell lysate was prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Twenty-five micrograms of the protein lysate from the cells cultured in the absence or presence of As<sup>3+</sup> were analyzed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. The antibodies against GADD45&#x003b1;, actin, nucleolin, HuR and IKK&#x003b3; were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA).

The primers for GADD45 (Accession no. L24498) were forward, 5&#x02032;-TCAGCCCAGCTACTCCCTAC; reverse, 5&#x02032;-AATCTGCCCTGCTAAAGGAAT, used with Universal Probe #16. The primers for the house-keeping gene GAPDH (NM_002046) were forward, 5&#x02032;-AGCCACATCGCTCAGACAC; reverse, GCCCAATACGACCAAATCC, used with Universal Probe #60.

The cells were fixed directly in the culture plate by 10% formalin and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature, respectively. Cells were incubated for 6 h at 4&#x000b0;C with primary antibody diluted (1:100) in PBS containing 5% BSA. After extensive washing with PBS, cells were incubated with Fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz, CA) in 1:100 dilution in PBS containing 5% BSA and 1 &#x000b5;g/ml of propidium iodide (PI) for 1 h at room temperature.

To obtain insight into the possible mechanism of As<sup>3+</sup>-induced GADD45&#x003b1;, the cells were pre-treated with 10 mM N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), a widely used antioxidant that provides cells with exogenous glutathione (GSH) precursor, for 12 h and then treated with 0&#x02013;20 &#x000b5;M As<sup>3+</sup> for an additional 12 h. The expression of GADD45&#x003b1; was barely detectable in the cells without As<sup>3+</sup> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The induction of GADD45&#x003b1; by As<sup>3+</sup> was dose-dependent. A plateau of GADD45&#x003b1; induction was reached when the cells were treated with 20 &#x000b5;M As<sup>3+</sup>. Further elevation of As<sup>3+</sup> concentrations (more than 50 &#x000b5;M) did not increase the expression of GADD45&#x003b1; due to cytotoxicity (data not shown). Pre-treatment of the cells with 10 mM NAC completely blocked the induction of GADD45&#x003b1; by As<sup>3+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 7&#x02013;12), suggesting that As<sup>3+</sup>-induced GADD45&#x003b1; expression is possibly through either an oxidative stress response or a direct depletion of GSH. In an additional experimental setting, we pre-treated cells with increasing concentrations of aspirin, another antioxidant which acts as a free radical scavenger, and found that the induction of GADD45&#x003b1; by As<sup>3+</sup> was partially inhibited by 10&#x02013;20 mM aspirin (data not shown).</p><p>The inhibition of As<sup>3+</sup>-induced GADD45&#x003b1; by NAC and aspirin implies a possible involvement of reactive oxygen species in this process. Indeed, our previous report had demonstrated a substantial accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the cells treated with As<sup>3+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). To determine whether H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> itself is able to induce GADD45&#x003b1;, the cells were treated with 50&#x02013;800 &#x000b5;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 12 h. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> indicates that the induction of GADD45&#x003b1; by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is very marginal in comparing with the cells treated with As<sup>3+</sup>. An appreciable induction of GADD45&#x003b1; could be observed only in the cells treated with 400&#x02013;800 &#x000b5;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lanes 5 and 6, upper panel). At this concentration, however, the cells showed cytotoxic responses as indicated by the notable cell death determined microscopically (data not shown). Densitometry analysis of the GADD45&#x003b1; protein bands in four separate experiments indicated a more than 20-fold induction of the GADD45&#x003b1; by 20 &#x000b5;M As<sup>3+</sup> and a 3- to 4-fold induction of the GADD45&#x003b1; by 800 &#x000b5;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>As<sup>3+</sup> has a weak effect on the transcription of GADD45&#x003b1; gene</title><p>Earlier studies have indicated that the consensus p53 binding site in the third intron region of the human GADD45&#x003b1; gene is critical for the genotoxic stress-induced expression of GADD45&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). It is unclear whether As<sup>3+</sup> induces GADD45&#x003b1; expression through transcriptional regulation in a manner of either p53-dependent or p53-independent. By the use of GADD45&#x003b1; promoter- and intron3-based luciferase reporter gene vectors, we noted that As<sup>3+</sup>, at 20 &#x000b5;M, only induced 3- and 2-fold increase of GADD45&#x003b1; promoter-luciferase activity and GADD45&#x003b1; intron3-luciferase activity, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, left panel). Similar to that of immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exhibited no significant induction on the GADD45&#x003b1; promoter-luciferase activity at each dose point tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, right panel). Only about 1.5-fold induction of intron3-luciferase activity was observed in the cells treated with 400&#x02013;800 &#x000b5;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, right panel).</p><p>There is considerable limitation in reporter gene-based transcriptional analysis due to the absence of distant transcription enhancer elements in the reporter constructs. To address whether As<sup>3+</sup> truly regulates the transcription of the GADD45&#x003b1; gene, we next performed a RT&#x02013;PCR-based nuclear run-on assay. Since we had demonstrated that the accumulation of the GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA was peaked by a 4 h As<sup>3+</sup> treatment (following), we incubated the cells with 20 &#x000b5;M As<sup>3+</sup> for 4 h in this nuclear run-on assay. Exposure of the cells to As<sup>3+</sup> did not induce an appreciable transcription in this assay (data not shown). Thus, these data indicate that it is unlikely that transcriptional regulation is the main mechanism of As<sup>3+</sup>-induced expression of the GADD45&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of Akt has marginal effect on the expression of GADD45&#x003b1; induced by As<sup>3+</sup></title><p>Akt signaling pathway is best known for its ability to counteract stress responses that lead to growth arrest or cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). As a serine-threonine kinase, Akt is able to phosphorylate and inactivate proteins involved in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. These proteins include FoxO3a, GSK3, Bad, eNOS and procaspase-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). In response to DNA damage signals, FoxO3a appears to be the key transcription factor that up-regulates the transcription of GADD45&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Phosphorylation of FoxO3a by Akt suppresses the transcriptional activity of FoxO3a on the expression of GADD45&#x003b1; gene. Thus, inhibition of Akt, a negative regulator of FoxO3a, might indirectly contribute to the induction of GADD45&#x003b1;. To test whether As<sup>3+</sup>-induced GADD45&#x003b1; is through its effect on Akt-FoxO3a pathway in human epithelial cells, the phosphorylation status of Akt and FoxO3a was investigated in the cells treated with As<sup>3+</sup> for different time periods. Induction of GADD45&#x003b1; occurred at 4&#x02013;20 h of As<sup>3+</sup> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). A significant increase, rather than decrease of phosphorylation of FoxO3a and Akt, was observed at these time points. Thus, these results suggest that As<sup>3+</sup>-induced GADD45&#x003b1; is not through the inhibition of Akt in the human epithelial cells. In contrast, As<sup>3+</sup> induces activation of Akt that subsequently phosphorylates and inactivates FoxO3a, which offsets the effect of As<sup>3+</sup> on the induction of GADD45&#x003b1;.</p><p>We observed an increase in the phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO3a in the cellular response to As<sup>3+</sup>. Thus, it is worth testing whether inhibition of Akt amplifies the As<sup>3+</sup>-induced expression of GADD45&#x003b1;. Ly294002, a relatively specific inhibitor for phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K), could completely block the activation of Akt and substantially, decrease the phosphorylation of FoxO3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, only about 1- to 2-fold increase of GADD45&#x003b1; induction by As<sup>3+</sup> was observed in the cells pre-treated with 10 &#x000b5;M Ly294002 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Similarly, in a GADD45&#x003b1; promoter-based luciferase activity analysis, only a marginal amplification of As<sup>3+</sup>-induced luciferase activity could be seen in the cells pre-treated with Ly294002 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, these observations suggest that although As<sup>3+</sup> is capable of stimulating the activation of Akt, a negative regulator for FoxO3a and the subsequent transcription of GADD45&#x003b1; gene, inhibition of Akt has a very weak effect on the induction of GADD45&#x003b1; by As<sup>3+</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>As<sup>3+</sup> induces accumulation GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA</title><p>To demonstrate the correlation between the levels of protein and gene expression, the effect of As<sup>3+</sup> on the induction of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA was determined by RT&#x02013;PCR. A substantial induction of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA was observed in the cells treated with 20 &#x000b5;M As<sup>3+</sup> for 1&#x02013;6 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). After 8 h, the GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA was declined to the basal level, indicating turnover of mRNA. The PCR primers we used correspond to the exon1 and exon4 region of the GADD45&#x003b1; gene, respectively, which amplify a fragment of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA with a size of 453 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, fragment a). Interestingly, two additional fragments with size of &#x0223c;430 bp and &#x0223c;350 bp were observed in this RT&#x02013;PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, fragments &#x02018;b&#x02019; and &#x02018;c&#x02019;), possibly resulted from mRNA alternative splicing. DNA sequencing indicated that the fragment &#x02018;a&#x02019; is indeed the full-length GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA as expected. The fragment &#x02018;c&#x02019; was resulted from the splicing out of the entire exon2 region (GenBank ID <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DQ008445">DQ008445</ext-link>), whereas the sequencing of fragment &#x02018;b&#x02019; was inclusive (data not shown). The accumulation of the GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA induced by As<sup>3+</sup> was further verified by a quantitative real-time RT&#x02013;PCR. In fully agreement with the results of the traditional RT&#x02013;PCR, a 6- to 10-fold induction of the GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA was observed in the cells treated with As<sup>3+</sup> for 1&#x02013;4 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>As<sup>3+</sup> does not affect the degradation of GADD45&#x003b1; protein</title><p>We have observed a more than 10- to 20-fold induction of GADD45&#x003b1; protein and 6- to 10-fold increase of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA by As<sup>3+</sup> in our western blotting and RT&#x02013;PCR experiments, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). However, we have failed to observe a significant transcriptional induction of the GADD45&#x003b1; gene by As<sup>3+</sup> in both promoter/intron3 luciferase activity assay and nuclear run-on assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and data not shown). In several other experimental settings, we have also tested the effect of As<sup>3+</sup> on some different GADD45&#x003b1; promoter constructs that contain 1&#x02013;2 kb promoter regions. In these experiments, we have failed to observe a more than a 3-fold induction of these promoter-luciferase activities by As<sup>3+</sup> (D. Bhatia, V. Castranova and F. Chen, manuscript in preparation). Thus, we assume that As<sup>3+</sup>-induced GADD45&#x003b1; might be mainly through post-transcriptional mechanisms including alterations in mRNA or protein stability. We have failed to determine the protein stability of GADD45&#x003b1; by using cycloheximide (data not shown), since the GADD45&#x003b1; protein was barely detectable in the cells without As<sup>3+</sup> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>).</p><p>One possibility that As<sup>3+</sup> induces accumulation of GADD45&#x003b1; protein is through interfering with either the ubiquitination of or the subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of GADD45&#x003b1;. We have previously shown that As<sup>3+</sup> induced proteasomal degradation of Cdc25C protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Therefore, it is unlikely that As<sup>3+</sup> induces GADD45&#x003b1; through inhibiting the proteolytic activity of the proteasome. To test whether As<sup>3+</sup> is able to interfere with the process of GADD45&#x003b1; ubiquitination, the cells were pre-treated with a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, for 2 h and then treated with As<sup>3+</sup> for 12 h. The ubiquitination of proteins can be visualized as smear high molecular weight bands in immunoblotting using lysates from the cells treated with MG132 or other proteasome inhibitors. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using antibody against GADD45&#x003b1; (Supplement Figure 1, lanes 1&#x02013;4) or ubiquitin (Supplement Figure 1, lanes 5&#x02013;8) and then the proteins in the immune complexes were immunoblotted with either anti-GADD45&#x003b1; antibody (Supplement Figure 1, upper panel) or re-probed with anti-ubiquitin antibody after stripping (Supplement Figure 1, lower panel). As can be seen in this figure, we did observe induction and ubiquitination of GADD45&#x003b1; in the cells pre-treated with MG132 in the absence of As<sup>3+</sup>. Treatment of the cells with As<sup>3+</sup> did not decrease, but rather increased the ubiquitination of GADD45&#x003b1; protein. Thus, it is unlikely that As<sup>3+</sup>-induced accumulation of GADD45&#x003b1; is through preventing the ubiquitination of GADD45&#x003b1; protein.</p></sec><sec><title>As<sup>3+</sup> stabilizes GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA through nucleolin</title><p>Next, we tested the possibility that As<sup>3+</sup> might be able to regulate the stability of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA. To this end, cells were incubated with or without 20 &#x000b5;M As<sup>3+</sup> for 4 h before that the transcription was blocked by adding 5 &#x000b5;g/ml of actinomycin D. The level of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA was monitored by quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR after 0, 1, 2, 4 or 8 h of post-actinomycin D treatment. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, the GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA from untreated cells displayed a strong reduction by almost 50% in the mRNA level after 8 h of transcription inhibition. In contrast, more than 80% GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA remained at this time point in the cells treated with As<sup>3+</sup>, indicating that As<sup>3+</sup> stabilizes GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA substantially. The stability of the GAPDH mRNA was not affected by As<sup>3+</sup>. In fact, the GAPDH mRNA appears to be relatively stable (Supplement Figure 2).</p><p>The stability for many inducible mRNAs is regulated by a number of RNA-binding proteins that either stabilize or destabilize mRNAs. In mammalian cells, the functional characteristic of several mRNA stabilizing proteins, including nucleolin, HuR and YB-1, has been extensively investigated. To determine the involvement of these RNA-binding proteins in the regulation of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA, the expression of nucleolin, HuR and YB-1 was investigated. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the expression of nucleolin and HuR was detectable under the basal condition. Addition of As<sup>3+</sup> for 4, 8, 12 or 20 h did not change the level of nucleolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, top panel), whereas the level of HuR was marginally decreased by As<sup>3+</sup> in a roughly time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the second panel). The expression of YB-1 was undetectable under the conditions tested.</p><p>To determine the binding of nucleolin and HuR to GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA, we next performed RNA immunoprecipitation, an established method described in the literatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), by using antibody against either nucleolin or HuR. The mRNAs of GADD45&#x003b1; and GAPDH in the immune complexes and the supernatants post-immunoprecipitation were determined by RT&#x02013;PCR. In agreement with the western blotting data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), the amount of nucleolin in the immune complexes was unchanged upon treatment of cells with As<sup>3+</sup>, whereas the level of HuR was marginally reduced after the treatment of As<sup>3+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, bottom panel). Trace amount of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA in the control cells could be co-precipitated by either anti-nucleolin or anti-HuR antibody, indicating basal association of nucleolin and HuR with GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA. Treatment of the cells with 20 &#x000b5;M As<sup>3+</sup> for 4 h increased the association of GADD45&#x003b1; with nucleolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, the panel of GADD45&#x003b1; in IP, lane 2). As<sup>3+</sup> was also capable of inducing the association of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA with HuR, although in a less potent fashion compared with nucleolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, the panel of GADD45&#x003b1; in IP, lane 5). Since there are reports indicating interconnection between PI3K-Akt and mRNA stability or nucleolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>), we then tested the possible involvement of Akt signaling in the association of RNA-binding proteins with the GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA. Pre-treatment of the cells with Ly294002 inhibits phosphorylation of Akt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, Ly294002 showed no effect on the As<sup>3+</sup>-induced association of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA with nucleolin or HuR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lanes 3 and 6). The association of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA with nucleolin and HuR appeared to be specific, since there was no detectable GAPDH mRNA in the immune complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, the panel of GAPDH in IP, lanes 1, 2, 4 and 5). A non-specific association of GAPDH mRNA with either nucleolin or HuR was observed in the cells pre-treated with Ly294002 alone (data not shown) or in the presence of As<sup>3+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lanes 3 and 6). We also monitored the levels of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA in the supernatants after immunoprecipitation with anti-nucleolin and anti-HuR antibody, respectively. The GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA was barely detected in these supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, the panel of GADD45&#x003b1; in lysate), indicating that the majority of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA had been co-precipitated by immunoprecipitation for either nucleolin or HuR. In a control experiment, we used an antibody against IKK&#x003b3; in immunoprecipitation and found no association of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA with IKK&#x003b3; protein in the cells without or with As<sup>3+</sup> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, top panel, lanes 7 and 8). The basal and As<sup>3+</sup>-induced GADD45&#x003b1; mRNAs remained in the cell lysates that had been subjected to IKK&#x003b3; immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, the &#x02018;GADD45 in lysate&#x02019; panel, comparing lanes 7 and 8 with lanes 1&#x02013;6). Therefore, these data strongly suggest that the stabilization of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA by As<sup>3+</sup> is through the inducible binding of nucleolin and less potently, HuR to GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA.</p><p>As<sup>3+</sup> appeared to be very potent in inducing binding of nucleolin to the GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, As<sup>3+</sup> was unable to influence the expression of nucleolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, it is worth testing whether the functional aspect of nucleolin was modulated by As<sup>3+</sup>. For that purpose, we investigated the intracellular location of nucleolin in the cells without or with As<sup>3+</sup> treatment by immunofluorescent techniques. In control cells, nucleolin was concentrated in nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, top panel). Following treatment of the cells with 20 &#x000b5;M As<sup>3+</sup> for 4 h, a notable intracellular re-distribution of nucleolin from nucleoli to nucleoplasm was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, bottom panel). In addition, some As<sup>3+</sup>-treated cells showed cytoplasm staining of nucleolin. In both control cells and the cells treated with As<sup>3+</sup>, the HuR protein was localized throughout nucleoplasm and cytoplasm, but was predominantly stained in nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Nucleolin silencing reversed As<sup>3+</sup>-induced stabilization of the GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA</title><p>To address the importance of nucleolin in As<sup>3+</sup>-induced stabilization of the GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA, we next used small interference RNA (siRNA) technique to knockdown nucleolin and determined the mRNA stability of the GADD45&#x003b1; in the cells treated with As<sup>3+</sup>. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, nucleolin siRNA effectively reduced the level of nucleolin protein after 36 h of siRNA transfection, whereas the control siRNA against luciferase showed no inhibition on the level of the nucleolin protein. The data of mRNA stability analysis by a quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR showed a significant decrease in the stability of the GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA induced by As<sup>3+</sup> in the cells transfected with nucleolin siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, comparing the control siRNA with the nucleolin siRNA).</p><p>Finally, we examined the effect of nucleolin siRNA on the induction of GADD45&#x003b1; protein induced by As<sup>3+</sup>. In agreement with the observations in western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), immunofluorescent staining showed that the GADD45&#x003b1; protein was undetectable in the cells without As<sup>3+</sup> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, top panels). A substantial elevation of nuclear-stained GADD45&#x003b1; protein was observed in the cells treated with As<sup>3+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, middle panels). Transfection of the cells with nucleolin siRNA partially diminished the increase of GADD45&#x003b1; protein induced by As<sup>3+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, bottom panels).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this report, we have provided evidence that As<sup>3+</sup>-induced expression of GADD45&#x003b1; is through both transcriptional and more importantly, post-transcriptional mechanisms: stabilization of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA. We have demonstrated that the accumulation of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA induced by As<sup>3+</sup> is very likely due to the inducible binding of nucleolin, and less potently, HuR, two RNA stabilizing proteins, to the GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA. Silencing of nucleolin by an siRNA specifically targeting nucleolin reversed As<sup>3+</sup>-induced stabilization of the GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA and elevation of the GADD45&#x003b1; protein.</p><p>A number of stress signals can induce accumulation of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA or protein. Oxidative stress due to the generation of reactive oxygen species appears to be a common feature in cellular responses to a variety of stress signals, such as As<sup>3+</sup>- or inflammatory cytokine-induced stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). It is plausible, therefore, to assume that the induction of GADD45&#x003b1; by As<sup>3+</sup> is mediated by oxidative stress. Indeed, pre-treatment of the cells with antioxidants prevented As<sup>3+</sup>-induced accumulation of GADD45&#x003b1; protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, administration of the cells with the exogenous reactive oxygen species, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, only resulted in a marginal induction of GADD45&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The reporter gene assay using GADD45&#x003b1; promoter and intron3 constructs indicated that As<sup>3+</sup> regulated GADD45&#x003b1; promoter and intron3 activity, whereas H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> only exhibited its effect on intron3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, these data provide evidence indicating that As<sup>3+</sup>-induced GADD45&#x003b1; is independent of oxidative stress.</p><p>Transcriptional up-regulation appears to be the most important and common mechanism in genes encoding stress response proteins. The majority studies on the expression of GADD45&#x003b1; induced by a variety of stress signals focused on the transcription of the GADD45&#x003b1; gene. The data presented in this study suggest that As<sup>3+</sup> has a very limited effect on the transcription of the GADD45&#x003b1; gene, as can be seen in both reporter gene activity analysis and nuclear run-on assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and data not shown). However, As<sup>3+</sup> appeared to be very capable of inducing a nucleolin-dependent stabilization of the GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA. These observations are compensatory to a recent study by Fan <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>) who showed an increased ratio of UVC-induced GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA transcript versus UVC-induced transcription in a nuclear run-on assay (Supplementary Table 2, row 938). The involvement of nucleolin in GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA stabilization was further verified by siRNA-mediated gene knockdown of nucleolin, which reversed As<sup>3+</sup>-induced stabilization of the GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescent staining suggested that nucleolin was constitutively expressed in the cells used in the present studies. Although As<sup>3+</sup> exhibited no influence on the expression of nucleolin protein, As<sup>3+</sup> was able to induce intracellular re-distribution of nucleolin from nucleoli to nucleoplasm. This could be an indication in the functional up-regulation of nucleolin in response to As<sup>3+</sup>, which contributes to the stabilization of the GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA.</p><p>Several earlier reports suggested that UV, DNA-damaging agents, retinoid CD437 or glutamine deprivation induced GADD45&#x003b1; through stabilization of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA in Chinese hamster ovary cells or human breast carcinoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). It was unclear, however, how the stability of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA was regulated in these cells under such conditions. The findings that nucleolin and less potently, HuR, bind to GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA in the cellular response to As<sup>3+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) provide a mechanistic explanation for the stress-induced accumulation of GADD45&#x003b1;. Nucleolin is a ubiquitous nucleolar phosphoprotein that consists of four RNA-binding domains that are responsible for the binding of this protein to pre-rRNA or mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). In addition, nucleolin has also been implicated as the human helicase IV that destabilizes helices of DNA&#x02013;DNA, DNA&#x02013;RNA and RNA&#x02013;RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). Accumulating evidence indicates that nucleolin is a key protein involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs. Previous studies by other laboratories suggested that nucleolin was able to stabilize mRNAs of IL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), &#x003b2;-amyloid precursor protein (APP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>), bcl2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>), renin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>) and CD154 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). In response to T-cell activation, nucleolin stabilizes IL-2 mRNA by interacting with the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR) of IL-2 mRNA in a JNK-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Recently, we have demonstrated an oxidative stress-mediated binding of nucleolin to mouse GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA in mouse fibroblast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). In an <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis for the selection of mRNA ligands by nucleolin, Yang <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>) demonstrated a binding of nucleolin to a number of other mRNAs, such as heat shock protein 90, glutathione peroxidase, peroxiredoxin 1, etc. Several lines of evidence indicate that nucleolin binds to pre-rRNA that contains a consensus sequence, (U/G)CCCG(A/G), in a loop of stem structure with 7&#x02013;14 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>). Although the recognition elements of nucleolin in the 5&#x02032;- or 3&#x02032;-UTR of IL-2, APP, bcl2 and CD154 have been identified, no consensus sequence or homology sequence has been found in these mRNAs. Sequence comparison suggested that there is no sequence similarity among the 5&#x02032;-UTRs of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA and the mRNAs of IL-2, APP, bcl2 or CD154. However, it is interesting to note that both 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-UTR of human GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA contain a potential stem&#x02013;loop with sequence, GCCCGG. This sequence matches completely with the nucleolin recognition element, (T/G)CCCG(A/G), in pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>).</p><p>Nucleolin has also been implicated in the cap-independent but internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation of hepatitis C virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). Analysis of the 5&#x02032;-UTR region of human GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA revealed a potential IRES domain proximal to the AUG code. We have recently observed that As<sup>3+</sup> was also very potent in the induction of GADD45&#x003b1; protein in the growth-arrested cells where the general protein synthesis machinery was inhibited by rapamycin (data not shown). This phenomenon is very likely due to the IRES-dependent translational regulation. Whether nucleolin or other factors participated in this process remains to be investigated.</p><p>In summary, our data suggest that elevation in the expression of GADD45&#x003b1; in cellular response to As<sup>3+</sup> is mainly through the regulation of mRNA stability of GADD45&#x003b1;. Treatment of the cells with As<sup>3+</sup> increased binding of nucleolin and to lesser extent, HuR to the mRNA of GADD45&#x003b1;, which extends the half-life of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA. It is unknown at present how the association of nucleolin with the GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA is regulated, despite we noted a re-distribution of nucleolin protein from nucleoli to nucleoplasm in the cells treated with As<sup>3+</sup>. Changes in mRNA stability have been considered important mechanisms in which cells sense stress or damage in concert with transcriptional and/or other mechanisms. The contributions of GADD45&#x003b1; mRNA stabilization to the cell cycle regulation and apoptosis are currently under investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_34_2_485__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain" xlink:href="nar_34_2_485__gkj459_supp_mat_fig_1.JPG"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain" xlink:href="nar_34_2_485__gkj459_supp_mat_fig_2.JPG"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr Albert J.
