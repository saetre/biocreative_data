The fidelity of protein translocation depends on the efficient recognition of effector proteins by the T4SS. <named-content content-type="genus-species">Legionella pneumophila</named-content> delivers a large number of effector proteins into eukaryotic cells using the Dot/Icm T4SS. How the Dot/Icm system is able to recognize and control the delivery of effectors is poorly understood. Recent studies suggest that the IcmS and IcmW proteins interact to form a stable complex that facilitates translocation of effector proteins by the Dot/Icm system by an unknown mechanism. Here we demonstrate that the IcmSW complex is necessary for the productive translocation of multiple Dot/Icm effector proteins. Effector proteins that were able to bind IcmSW in vitro required <italic>icmS</italic> and <italic>icmW</italic> for efficient translocation into eukaryotic cells during <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. pneumophila</named-content> infection. We identified regions in the effector protein SidG involved in <italic>icmSW</italic>-dependent translocation. Although the full-length SidG protein was translocated by an <italic>icmSW</italic>-dependent mechanism, deletion of amino terminal regions in the SidG protein resulted in <italic>icmSW</italic>-independent translocation, indicating that the IcmSW complex is not contributing directly to recognition of effector proteins by the Dot/Icm system. Biochemical and genetic studies showed that the IcmSW complex interacts with a central region of the SidG protein. The IcmSW interaction resulted in a conformational change in the SidG protein as determined by differences in protease sensitivity in vitro. These data suggest that IcmSW binding to effectors could enhance effector protein delivery by mediating a conformational change that facilitates T4SS recognition of a translocation domain located in the carboxyl region of the effector protein.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Intracellular pathogens often manipulate the activities of the eukaryotic host cell in which they reside by using a specialized transport apparatus known as a type IV secretion system to deliver proteins that directly manipulate host cell processes. How proteins to be delivered into eukaryotic cells are recognized by a type IV section system is not well understood. For <named-content content-type="genus-species">Legionella pneumophila</named-content>, the bacterium that causes a severe pneumonia known as Legionnaires disease, a type IV system called Dot/Icm is used to deliver an estimated 150 different proteins into host cells during infection. In this study, we demonstrate that a complex consisting of the proteins IcmS and IcmW bind many of the substrate proteins transported into eukaryotic host cells by the Dot/Icm system. Binding of the IcmSW complex to Dot/Icm substrate proteins enhanced the efficiency by which the substrate proteins were transported into cells by a process that involved altering the conformation of the substrate protein. Thus, this work defines a step that is important for the type IV secretion process and provides new molecular details on substrate protein recognition by type IV secretion systems.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Cambronne ED, Roy CR (2007) The <named-content content-type="genus-species">Legionella pneumophila</named-content> IcmSW complex interacts with multiple Dot/Icm effectors to facilitate type IV translocation.

Cleavage products from whole cell lysates partially digested with trypsin were detected by immunoblot analysis using antibodies specific for RalF or SidG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030188-g009">Figure 9</xref>B). Cleavage products observed for RalF were indistinguishable in the presence and absence of the H<sub>6</sub>IcmW/IcmS complex. These data indicate that IcmSW does not affect RalF conformation and are consistent with data showing that IcmSW does not bind to RalF. Differences in the appearance of a predominant SidG cleavage product were observed when reactions containing IcmSW were compared to reactions without IcmSW, which is consistent with the hypothesis that IcmSW binding alters the conformation of SidG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030188-g009">Figure 9</xref>B). Similar assays were performed on SidG lysates where the trypsin was diluted 1,000-fold. A difference in the appearance of a major cleavage product was again observed when reactions containing IcmSW were compared to reactions without IcmSW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030188-g009">Figure 9</xref>C). Importantly, cleavage products in a size range between 50 kDa and 60 kDa were detected in reactions without the IcmSW complex, and were less prominent in reactions containing the IcmSW complex. Because the SidG antibody recognizes the C-terminal 90-aa region of the protein, the locations of the cleavage sites must be located between residues 400 and 500 of SidG. These data are consistent with IcmSW interactions with SidG protecting protease-sensitive sites in the region required for IcmSW binding. To more carefully examine the emergence of these cleavage products, a time course experiment was performed with a constant protease concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030188-g009">Figure 9</xref>D). Again, SidG cleavage products in the 50- to 60-kDa range preferentially emerge in lysates that do not contain IcmSW. Collectively, these results indicate that IcmSW alters the conformation of SidG, and suggest that binding of IcmSW to the central core of SidG protects protease sensitive sites.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Over 50 different <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. pneumophila</named-content> Dot/Icm effectors have been identified, and the total number of effectors is expected to exceed 150 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030188-b012">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030188-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. Secondary structure predictions indicate that <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. pneumophila</named-content> effectors are diverse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030188-sg001">Figures S1</xref> and 6D). There are effectors with predicted membrane-spanning helices, regions of coiled-coil domains, and homologies found primarily among eukaryotic proteins. How such a large number of effectors with such diverse structural properties can be efficiently recognized by a single secretion system is a question of fundamental importance. Analysis of the RalF protein has shown that substituting individual amino acids at positions near the C-terminus can dramatically reduce Dot/Icm-mediated translocation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030188-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;, which is consistent with studies of other type IV secretion systems where individual amino acid residues critical for type IV translocation have been identified near the C-terminus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030188-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. The C-terminal 20-aa residues that comprise the translocation signal for the RalF protein were disordered in the X-ray crystal structure &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030188-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. This has led to speculation that a disordered C-terminal domain could be important for effector protein engagement with the type IV secretion machinery. In addition to a C-terminal translocation signal, the IcmSW complex had been implicated as being important for recognition of effector proteins by the Dot/Icm system &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030188-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Here, we provide data that link the function of the IcmSW complex with the hypothesis that a disordered C-terminal secretion signal is important for effector protein translocation.</p><p>Our data show that IcmSW can bind to effectors, that the binding region is located outside of the C-terminal translocation domain, and that Dot/Icm-mediated recognition of the minimal C-terminal translocation domain does not require the IcmSW complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030188-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030188-g004">4</xref>, and 5). These data are inconsistent with the IcmSW complex functioning as an adapter that facilitates recognition of a C-terminal translocation domain by binding to both the effector and the Dot/Icm translocation apparatus. If the primary function of IcmSW was to serve as an adapter, then removing the binding site for IcmSW from an effector should result in a translocation defect in wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. pneumophila</named-content> that is comparable with the translocation defect observed for the full-length effector produced in the &#x00394;<italic>icmS</italic>, &#x00394;<italic>icmW</italic> double mutant. Our data show the opposite. We found that removing regions from the effector SidG that contained binding sites for the IcmSW complex eliminated a requirement for the IcmS and IcmW proteins for efficient translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030188-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Taken together, these data identify internal regions of an effector protein that have a negative effect on recognition of the C-terminal translocation signal and show that IcmSW binding to these regions neutralizes this negative effect.</p><p>There are two likely explanations for why IcmSW binding to an effector can neutralize intrinsic signals that interfere with translocation. The first is that IcmSW binding prevents inappropriate interactions between the effector and other proteins. Alternatively, IcmSW binding could prevent interactions from occurring within the effector that masks recognition by the Dot/Icm system. We were unable to show that effectors are more prone to aggregation or degradation in the absence of the IcmSW complex, which would be effects that might result from inappropriate homo- or heterotypic protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030188-g006">Figures 6</xref> and S4). The observation that overproduction of the effector protein SidG in an &#x00394;<italic>icmS</italic>, &#x00394;<italic>icmW</italic> double mutant suppressed the translocation defect also suggests that the IcmSW complex is not preventing inappropriate homo- or heterotypic protein&#x02013;protein interactions, as overexpression would most likely promote these interactions and augment the translocation defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030188-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, we were able to show that introduction of a small epitope tag to the SidG C-terminus greatly affected the <italic>icmSW</italic> dependency for translocation, and enhanced susceptibility of SidG<italic><sup>FLAG</sup></italic> to degradation following lysis of &#x00394;<italic>icmS</italic>, &#x00394;<italic>icmW</italic> double mutant <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, suggesting that IcmSW binding alters the conformation of SidG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030188-g008">Figure 8</xref>). This evidence was further supported by limited proteolysis experiments that demonstrated conformational changes in SidG induced by IcmSW binding. Thus, our data fit better with a model that predicts IcmSW binding to effectors facilitates the display of the C-terminal translocation domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030188-sg005">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p>The model we propose also suggests that the IcmSW complex binds to effectors before the proteins have folded completely. Whether IcmSW binding to effectors is co-translational or occurs after synthesis has been completed can not be determined from our data; however, the observation that purified IcmSW does not bind in vitro to effectors expressed separately suggests that IcmSW binds poorly to effectors in their native conformation. Importantly, previous data has shown that IcmS binds very well to members of the SidE family of effectors after transfer from a SDS-PAGE gel to a nitrocellulose membrane, suggesting that IcmS can bind to an immobilized effector in a denatured state &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030188-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030188-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. These data also imply that IcmS can bind to an effector independent of IcmW. Consistent with these previous data, we show here that IcmS and IcmW can bind to the effector protein SidG independent of each other and that binding can be detected only when the proteins are synthesized in the same bacterial cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030188-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Although effectors may have independent binding sites for IcmS and IcmW, the observation that IcmW is highly unstable when it is not associated with IcmS implies that these proteins function as a complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030188-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>It is significant that IcmS and IcmW are relatively small proteins predicted to have an acidic pI, which are properties shared by chaperone proteins that function in the translocation of effector proteins by a type III secretion mechanism &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030188-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. The model we propose for the function of the IcmSW complex has parallels to what is known about the function of chaperones used for effectors translocated through the type III secretion apparatus. Chaperones used by the type III secretion system maintain effectors in a partially unfolded state, which facilitates recognition of an N-terminal secretion signal in type III effectors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030188-b042">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030188-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. Recognition of the effector by the type III secretion system stimulates disassembly of the chaperone&#x02013;effector complex by an ATPase that is essential for secretion system function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030188-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030188-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;. Our data suggest that IcmSW binding to effectors facilitates display of a C-terminal translocation signal. There are at least two proteins in the Dot/Icm system with predicted nucleotide-binding sites that might engage effectors and initiate translocation through the Dot/Icm system &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030188-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030188-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. In particular, the DotB protein is a critical component of the Dot/Icm system that is thought to hydrolyze ATP to energize transport of effectors through the apparatus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030188-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. It will be interesting to test in the future whether DotB can recognize C-terminal translocation signals directly and has an activity that disassembles the IcmSW&#x02013;effector protein complex.</p><p>The crystal structure of RalF and molecular analysis of this protein have provided clues as to why not all Dot/Icm effectors show the same level of dependency for IcmSW for translocation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030188-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. RalF does not bind to IcmSW, the IcmSW complex does not contribute to RalF translocation, and the RalF protein has a disordered C-terminal translocation signal. According to the RalF data, effectors having a C-terminal translocation domain that is disordered in the absence of IcmSW binding should be engaged by the Dot/Icm system efficiently by mutants lacking the IcmSW complex. This would explain why appending a minimal C-terminal translocation sequence to Cya results in Dot/Icm-dependent translocation by a process that is independent of IcmSW. According to our model of IcmSW function, removal of sequences that are N-terminal to the translocation signal of an <italic>icmSW</italic>-dependent effector prevents complete folding of the C-terminal domain containing this signal, mimicking what occurs when IcmSW binds to the full-length effector.</p><p>Although the model we have put forward suggests that IcmSW binding to effectors facilitates presentation of a C-terminal translocation domain, it is possible that IcmSW binding serves other functions that are more subtle and difficult to reveal using the assays available to measure effector protein translocation and our limited knowledge of the type IV secretion pathway. For instance, if type IV effectors are translocated in a partially unfolded state, IcmSW binding could potentially be important for translocation of effectors that are difficult for the type IV machinery to unfold once they have achieved their most thermodynamically stable conformation. Additionally, with over 150 predicted effectors, it remains unclear how translocation of effectors is regulated and whether spatial and temporal regulation of effector translocation is important for <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. pneumophila</named-content> modulation of host cell functions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030188-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030188-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030188-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030188-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, IcmSW could compete with inhibitory proteins that sequester substrates under unfavorable conditions for translocation. Whether IcmSW binding to effectors plays any role in regulating the timing of effector translocation remains an interesting possibility. As more information on the molecular mechanisms important for type IV secretion become available, it should be possible to test how IcmSW might affect recognition of effectors by other type IV secretion components. In conclusion, these studies on IcmSW function have provided new insight into how effector protein C-terminal translocation domains are presented to the type IV machinery and indicate that future studies on this interesting chaperone complex should reveal new information on biochemical activities important for effector protein translocation through the type IV apparatus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial strains and plasmids.</title><p>Bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers used to generate constructs in this study are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030188-st001">Table S1</xref>.
