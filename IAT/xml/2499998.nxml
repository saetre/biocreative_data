Expression of the heparanase gene is associated with the invasion and metastatic potential of a variety of tumor-derived cell types. However, the roles of heparanase in the regulation of gene expression and the subsequent cell function changes other than invasion are not clear. In the current study, we overexpressed the human heparanase gene in a human U251n glioma cell line. We found that heparanase-overexpression significantly increased cell invasion, proliferation, anchorage-independent colony formation and chemotactic migration towards fetal bovine serum (FBS)-supplied medium and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). These phenotypic appearances were accompanied by enhanced protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) signaling were not altered by heparanase-overexpression. These results indicate that heparanase has pleiotropic effects on tumor cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Tumor cell invasion and metastatic spread depend on the ability of cancer cells to invade tissue barriers by degrading extracellular matrix (ECM) and basement membrane structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The primary components of the basement membrane and ECM are structural proteins, such as collagen IV, laminin, fibronectin, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Heparan sulfate (HS) is a glycosaminoglycon (GAG) chain present in HSPGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. HS chains interact through specific attachment sites with the main protein components of basement membrane and ECM.</p><p>Heparanase is a mammalian endo-&#x003b2;-D-glucuronidase responsible for HS degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Heparanase activity may therefore play an important role in fundamental biological processes associated with ECM remodeling and cell invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Increased expression of heparanase mRNA and protein has been reported in a variety of metastatic cell lines and human tumor tissues, whereas adjacent normal-looking tissue does not exhibit detectable levels of heparanase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Moreover, increased heparanase mRNA expression correlates with reduced postoperative survival of cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Overexpression of heparanase cDNA in tumor cells with low metastatic potential confers a high metastatic potential after injection of these cells into the experimental animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Heparanase has also been shown to elicit an angiogenic response by releasing heparan sulfate-bound angiogenic factors sequestered in the ECM, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Recently, it was reported that heparanase is translocated into the cell nucleus where it may degrade the nuclear heparan sulfate and thereby affect nuclear functions (i.e. regulation of gene expression and signal transduction) that are thought to be regulated by heparan sulfate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus, the function of heparanase seems not to be only limited to degrading extracellular matrix. Cellular function may be affected by heparanase through regulating gene expression. There are accumulating evidences that certain signal transduction cascades are altered under heparanase stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, genes and cellular functions involved in heparanase regulation, other than cell invasion, is still unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate that heparanase overexpression in stably transfected human U251n glioma cells results in a marked increase of cell chemotactic migration toward fetal bovine serum (FBS)-supplied medium and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). Cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth are also increased in heparanase-overexpressing cells. These phenotypic changes are combined with elevated protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>The following antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: anti-heparanase (H-80, sc-25825), anti-phospho-FAK and anti-actin.

Cells were cultured at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>and maintained in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 4 mM glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin, and 1% nonessential amino acid (Invitrogen). Primary cultured glioma tumor cells (HF2303) were obtained from Hermelin Brain Tumor Center, Henry Ford Hospital (Detroit, MI, USA) with written consent in accordance with institutional guidelines. For stable transfection, U251n cells were transfected with the full-length human heparanase cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Ian N. Hampson, University of Manchester, United Kingdom) or a control pcDNA3 vector, using the Lipofactamine 2000 reagent (Life Technologies). Cells were selected with G418 (800 &#x003bc;g/ml) for 3 weeks, expanded, pooled and further selected for high heparanase-expressing cells, as evaluated by real-time reverse transcription-PCR. The pool with the highest heparanase expression levels was labeled as "U51n-hpa" throughout the manuscript, whereas, the parental pcDNA3 transfected cells was referred to as "U251n-pc". U251n cells were also transfected with pcDNA3-Flag-HA-AKT1 (Addgene Inc. Cambridge, MA) for 48 hours.

Specificity of the produced amplification product was confirmed by examination of dissociation reaction plots. A distinct single peak indicated that a single DNA sequence was amplified during RT-PCR. Each sample was tested in triplicate and samples obtained from three independent experiments were used for analysis of relative gene expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Cell cultures were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and scraped in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride) containing 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem). Lysates were obtained by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C and protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Twenty to forty &#x003bc;g of total protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, and probed with various primary antibodies, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Specific proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). The experiments were repeated in triplicate. &#x003b2;-actin was used as the internal protein control.</p></sec><sec><title>Matrigel invasion assay</title><p>Invasion of cells through matrix membrane was determined using 24-well BD invasion chambers (8.0-&#x003bc;m pore size with polycarbonate membrane; BD Biosciences, Cowley, United Kingdom) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions with the following modifications. The cells were detached by using 2 mM EDTA and 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>cells were placed into the upper compartment of the invasion plates in duplicate in a 0.5 ml serum-free volume. Subsequently, the lower compartment was filled with 750 &#x003bc;l of 10%FBS medium. After 22 h of incubation at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, cells remaining on the upper membrane surface were removed with a cotton swab. Cells on the lower surface of the membrane were stained with CellTracker Green (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and fixed in methanol. The invasive cells on the lower surface of membrane were counted under the fluorescence microscope at &#x000d7; 4 magnification. Each experiment was repeated three times.</p></sec><sec><title>Zymographic analysis of matrix metalloproteinase</title><p>Total cell proteins were prepared in the same way as for Western blot analysis. Twenty micrograms of each lysate or 15 &#x003bc;l of cell culture supernatant were mixed with non-reducing electrophoresis loading buffer and subjected to electrophoresis on an 8% SDS-PAGE copolymerized with gelatin (1 mg/ml). After electrophoresis, gels were washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h (3 times, 20 min each) and incubated for 24 h in enzyme assay buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.9% NaCl, and 0.05% Na<sub>3</sub>N) for the development of enzyme activity bands. After incubation, the gels were stained with 0.25% coomassie brilliant blue R-250 and destained in 10% methanol with 5% acetic acid. The gelatinolytic activities were detected as transparent bands against the blue background of the coomassie brilliant blue-stained gelatin. The experiment was repeated three times. Human MMP-2 and MMP-9 gelatinase zymography standard (Chemicon) were used as markers.</p></sec><sec><title>Chemotactic Migration Assay</title><p>A Chemicon QCM&#x02122; 96-well migration assay kit was used to study cell chemotactic migration. Cells were detached by 2 mM EDTA/PBS and resuspended with serum-free medium. Approximately 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>cells were seeded in the upper chamber of the plate. Medium with 10%FBS or 100 ng/ml SDF-1 was added to the lower chamber as a chemoattractant, and serum-free medium was also used as control. After 6 h incubation, cells migrated through the 8 &#x003bc;m pore size membrane, were detached, and treated with lysis buffer/dye solution supplied by the kit. Aliquot mixes were read using fluorescence reader with 485/525 nm filter set. Cell numbers were correlated with the optical density values and expressed as Relative Fluorescence Unit (RFU).

U251n-pc and U251n-hpa cells were initially grown to confluence before seeding in a 96-well plate at the density of 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3 </sup>cells/well. Viable cells were determined by adding 0.5 mg/ml MTT into each well and incubated for additional 2 h. The cells were then solubilized in 200 &#x003bc;l detergent (50% dimethyl formamide and 10%SDS). The absorption was determined at the wavelength of 540 nm. Observed optical density is directly correlated with the cell numbers.

Western blot analysis using cell lysates from heparanase-overexpressing U251n-hpa cells showed a great increase of protein expression of both latent (65 kDa) and active (50 kDa) forms of heparanase. Heparanase expression was confirmed by analyzing U87 and HF2303 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). U251n-hpa cells exhibited a 100 fold increase of mRNA expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) and a 12-fold increase of heparanase activity in cell lysates compared to U251n-pc cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Heparanase cleaves HS residues, participates in ECM degradation, and thereby may facilitate tumor cell invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Using the BD matrigel invasion assay, we evaluated the invasion ability of U251n cells. Matrigel, a reconstituted basement membrane containing HSPG, was used as a relevant barrier. As expected, the heparanase-overexpressing U251n-hpa cells exhibited a 10-fold increase in cell invasion as compared to control U251n-pc cells, and the increased cell invasion was significantly blocked by the heparanase inhibitor heparin at a concentration of 40 &#x003bc;g/ml (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In order to distinguish the role of heparanase on cell invasion, MMP-2 and MMP-9, members of the MMP family that is also involved in glioma invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], was measured using zymography assay and real-time PCR in both heparanase-overexpressing and control cells. No significant changes were observed in both enzyme activity and mRNA expression levels between U251n-pc and U251n-hpa cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Overexpression of heparanase in U251n cells</bold>.

The phosphorylation levels of AKT were noticeably increased in heparanase-overexpressing U251n cells. To confirm the change of p-AKT in heparanase overexpressing cells, Akt downstream targets, p-eNOS and p-GSK3, were determined by Western blot. Increased phosphorylstion of eNOS and GSK3 were found in correlation with the change of p-AKT in U251n-hpa cells.

Using U251n cells, we provide evidence that enhanced heparanase significantly increases cell invasion. The increased cell invasion can be significantly blocked by heparin, a heparanase inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], indicating that cell invasion is a direct effect of heparanase enzyme activity. Apart from its traditional function, heparanase shows a potential in regulating cell chemotactic migration, cell proliferation and anchorage-independent colony formation which seems to be independent of the degradation of ECM. Heparanase may involve in regulation of gene expression through its enzyme activity. Like what have been found in this work, increased AKT phosphorylation might be one of the targets of heparanase regulation. We have no direct evidences to conclude that increased cell migration and growth by heparanase-overexpression is the results of elevated AKT phosphorylation. As AKT is involved in multiple cellular functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], the increased AKT phosphorylation may contribute to the changes of these cell function.</p><p>In fact, heparanase has been reported in the regulation of various signal transduction pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, the transduction pathway likely differs in different cell types. For glioma cells, overexpression of heparanase in U87 cells causes increased phosphorylation of FAK and AKT, decreased phosphorylation of ERK and unchanged phosphorylation of p38 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In another study, overexpression of heparanase in rat C6 glioma cells shows increased phosphorylation of p38, but phosphorylation of ERK remain unchanged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Our results demonstrate that overexpression of heparanase in U251n cells increases phosphorylation of AKT, while phosphorylation of ERK1 and FAK is not altered. Thus, heparanase may affect several key signaling components essential for tumor progression. A key issue is to determine the heparanase binding site and how heparanase regulates gene expression and various signaling proteins.</p><p>In summary, using well described human glioma cell line U251n [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], we found that heparanase has the potential to regulate tumor cell invasion, chemotactic migration and proliferation. AKT signaling might be the target of heparanase. Further studies on different tumor cell lines are warranted.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>XH conceived of the study and wrote the manuscript.
