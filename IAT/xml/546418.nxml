It encodes a protein that is primarily involved in the regulation of sister chromatid separation during cell division. The oncogenic potential of PTTG1 has been well characterized in the mouse, particularly mouse fibroblast (NIH3T3) cells, in which it induces cell proliferation, promotes tumor formation and angiogenesis. Human tumorigenesis is a complex and a multistep process often requiring concordant expression of a number of genes. Also due to differences between rodent and human cell biology it is difficult to extrapolate results from mouse models to humans. To determine if PTTG1 functions similarly as an oncogene in humans, we have characterized its effects on human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We report that introduction of human PTTG1 into HEK293 cells through transfection with PTTG1 cDNA resulted in increased cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, and formation of tumors after subcutaneous injection of nu/nu mice. Pathologic analysis revealed that these tumors were poorly differentiated. Both analysis of HEK293 cells transiently transfected with PTTG1 cDNA and analysis of tumors developed on injection of HEK293 cells that had been stably transfected with PTTG1 cDNA indicated significantly higher levels of secretion and expression of bFGF, VEGF and IL-8 compared to HEK293 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 vector or uninvolved tissues collected from the mice. Mutation of the proline-rich motifs at the C-terminal of PTTG1 abolished its oncogenic properties. Mice injected with this mutated PTTG1 either did not form tumors or formed very small tumors. Taken together our results suggest that PTTG1 is a human oncogene that possesses the ability to promote tumorigenesis in human cells at least in part through the regulation of expression or secretion of bFGF, VEGF and IL-8.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results demonstrate that PTTG1 is a potent human oncogene and has the ability to induce cellular transformation of human cells. Overexpression of PTTG1 in HEK293 cells leads to an increase in the secretion and expression of bFGF, VEGF and IL-8. Mutation of C-terminal proline-rich motifs abrogates the oncogenic function of PTTG1. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the importance of PTTG1 in human tumorigenesis.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Pituitary tumor transforming gene 1 (PTTG1), a recently characterized oncogene, was initially identified on analysis of a rat pituitary tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]; subsequently, a human homologue of PTTG1 was cloned by us and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Three members (PTTG1, PTTG2 and PTTG3) of the PTTG family, which exhibit differential expression in normal and tumor cells have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], although only PTTG1 has been studied in detail. PTTG1 is located on chromosome 5q35.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], a locus associated with recurrent lung cancer and myelogenous leukemias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Moreover, it has been shown to be expressed highly in various tumors, and cell lines derived from such tumors, including tumors of the pituitary, thyroid, colon, ovary, testicles, and breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In normal tissues, its expression is low or undetectable except in testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Recent studies have indicated that elevated expression of PTTG1 in some tumors may serve as a prognostic marker for tumor invasiveness and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A clue to its function was gained from its structural similarity with the yeast securin, which led to its identification as a human securin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and suggested that it may play a role in regulation of sister chromatid separation. It appears, however, to have multiple effects in cells with enhanced expression being associated with an increase in the expression of the c-myc oncogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], an increase in the expression of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], an increase in the secretion and expression of basic growth factor (bFGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and an increase in the secretion and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>To date, the evidence for the oncogenic function of PTTG1 has been obtained by overexpression of PTTG1 in mouse fibroblast cells (NIH3T3) followed by assessment of its ability to induce cellular transformation in vitro (colony formation in soft agar) and tumor formation in nude mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Due to the biological differences between human and rodent cells, however, care must be taken in extrapolating results obtained using rodent cells to human cells. There are now a number of examples in which it has been demonstrated that although overexpression of an oncogene can induce transformation of primary rodent cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], it fails to induce transformation of the same cell type derived from humans. Usually this failure is attributable to the requirement for co-expression of another gene or oncogenic cooperation of another gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Similarly, much of the evidence concerning the mechanisms by which PTTG1 may affect the phenotype of the cell has been obtained using transfected NIH3T3 cells. It is known that the secretion of growth factors and cytokines by tumor cells, and the cells that infiltrate and surround the tumor mass play an essential role in the regulation of tumor growth and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Both bFGF and VEGF have been implicated in tumorigenesis and the expression and secretion of these molecules has been demonstrated on transfection of NIH3T3 cells with PTTG1 cDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], but this has not been confirmed on transfection of human cells. The effects of expression of PTTG1 on another cytokine that is known to play a key role in tumorigenesis, interleukin-8, (IL-8), have not yet been analyzed.</p><p>The purposes of this study were, therefore, three-fold. Firstly, to determine whether PTTG1 can induce cellular transformation of normal human cells; secondly, to determine if PTTG1 is sufficient in itself to induce transformation; and, thirdly, to characterize the changes in secretion and expression of key metastatic, angiogenic and chemokine factors (bFGF, VEGF and IL-8) associated with PTTG1-mediated transformation in human cells. For these studies, we selected the human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell line as our model. The transformation of these cells by human adenovirus type 5 prevents their senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These cells have been reported to have a moderate tumorigenic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and have been used as a cellular model for normal human cells to study the oncogenic potential of a number of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Mice xenografted with these cells do not develop tumors even after three months of injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation of HEK293 cells stably expressing PTTG1 and mPTTG1</title><p>HEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-PTTG1, pcDNA3.1-mPTTG1 or pcDNA3.1 vector. After G418 selection, 10 clones from each of pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-PTTG1 or pcDNA3.1-mPTTG1 transfected cells were picked, cultured and expanded. The PTTG1 protein expression of these transfectants was detected by western blot analysis using PTTG1 antiserum. Two representative clones from PTTG1 transfected (named HEKPTTG1-1 and HEKPTTG1-3) and mPTTG1 transfected (named HEKmPTTG1-2 and HEKmPTTG1-4), and one clone from pcDNA3.1 vector (named HEKpcDNA3.1) was selected for further studies. Selection of clones was based on the level of expression of PTTG1 protein. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows the protein expression of these clones. Transfection of cells with the pcDNA3.1 vector resulted in expression of very low level of PTTG1 protein. The clones of the pcDNA3.1-PTTG1 and pcDNA3.1-mPTTG1 transfected cells that exhibited approximately equivalent levels of expression of PTTG1 and mPTTG1 proteins were processed to establish stable cell lines.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Western blot analysis of HEK293 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-PTTG1 or pcDNA3.1-mPTTG1. a: HEKpcDNA3.1, b: HEKPTTG1-1, c: HEKPTTG1-3, d: HEKmPTTG1-2, and, e: HEKmPTTG1-4 cells.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1476-4598-4-3-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Stable transfection of PTTG1 induces cell proliferation and transformation of HEK293 cells overexpressing PTTG1</title><p>Previously, we have shown that over expression of PTTG1 in mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 cells results in an increase in cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. To determine if over expression of PTTG1 in HEK293 cells produces similar effects, we estimated the proliferation at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after plating of stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing high levels of PTTG1 or mPTTG1 protein. Both clones of PTTG1-transfected cells (HEKPTTG1-1 and HEKPTTG1-3) exhibited significantly greater proliferation than the cells transfected with vector only at all time points tested, and the time course of proliferation was very similar in both clones, increasing by 20&#x02013;30% after 24 hours, 30&#x02013;40% after 48 hours. This level of increase in cell proliferation was retained at least up to 96 hours (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Somewhat surprisingly, the proliferation of the cells expressing the mutated PTTG1 was equivalent to that of the cells expressing the wild-type PTTG1 and was significantly higher than that of the cells transfected with vector only (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These experiments indicate that over expression of PTTG1 does induce a significant proliferative effect in HEK293 cells; however, at least under the conditions used, mutation of the proline-rich motifs of PTTG1 does not affect this response.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Cell proliferation of HEK293 cells stably transfected with pcDNA3.1, PTTG1 or m-PTTG1.

As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, over expression of PTTG1 in HEK293 cells resulted in a higher incidence of colony formation than that observed on transfection with the vector only. The cells transfected with vector only formed few colonies and these were of small size during 14 days of culture, whereas both the cell lines expressing wild type PTTG1 formed a significantly higher number of colonies, which were of a large size. The incidence of colony formation was 2% for HEKpcDNA3.1 cell line but was 19% for the HEKPTTG1-1 cell line and 30% for the HEKPTTG1-3 cell line. In this case, mutation of the proline-rich motifs of PTTG1 resulted in a significant reduction in the number of colonies formed with the incidence of colony formation for the HEKmPTTG1-2 and HEKmPTTG1-4 cell lines being similar to the vector-only transfected cells (HEKpcDNA3.1). These results suggest that over expression of PTTG1 in HEK293 cells induces cellular transformation, and mutation of proline-rich motifs does not effect the cell proliferation but abrogates the cellular transformation ability of PTTG1.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Colony formation of HEK293 cells stably transfected with pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-PTTG1 or pcDNA3.1-m-PTTG1 a: HEKpcDNA3.1, b: HEKPTTG1-1, c: HEKPTTG1-3, d: HEKmPTTG1-2 and e: HEKmPTTG1-4.

Three out of four mice injected with the HEKPTTG1-1 or HEKPTTG1-3 cell lines developed large size tumors within four weeks of injection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Pathologic analysis of the tumors revealed that they were poorly differentiated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Mice injected with the HEKmPTTG1-2 cell line did develop tumors, but the tumors were of a small size. None of the mice injected with the other cell line-expressing mutant PTTG1 (HEKmPTTG1-4) or the vector-only cell line (HEKpcDNA3.1) developed tumors within the time frame of this experiment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The tumor volumes, measured at the end of experiment (six weeks after injection of cells), were 150&#x02013;1320 mm<sup>3 </sup>for HEKPTTG1-1, 72&#x02013;1404 mm<sup>3 </sup>for HEKPTTG1-3 and 8.8&#x02013;12.6 mm<sup>3 </sup>for HEKmPTTG1-2 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). These results clearly demonstrate that PTTG1 gene is a potent oncogene. Moreover, they demonstrate that PTTG1 possesses the ability to enhance the tumorigenic potential of immortal human cells and that it does not require the ectopic co-expression of other oncogene(s) to achieve its tumorigenic function.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Tumor development in nu/nu mice on injection of HEK293 cells stably transfected with pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1PTTG or pcDNA3.1mPTTG1 cells.

A correlation between the levels of expression of PTTG1 with increased tumor invasiveness and with the degree of malignancy has been demonstrated in pituitary and colorectal tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The specific mechanisms by which PTTG1 facilitates the invasive behaviors of tumor cells remain obscure, however. Recently, Ishikawa et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and McCabe et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] have shown that transfection of NIH3T3 cells with PTTG1 cDNA results in an increase in secretion and expression of both bFGF and VEGF. A direct correlation between high IL-8 expression and tumor metastases has been shown in a number of cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and IL-8 also has been reported to possess mitogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and angiogenic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. We therefore measured the levels of bFGF, VEGF and IL-8 in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1-PTTG1 cDNA and in tumors developed on injection of nude mice with HEK293 cells that constitutively express PTTG1. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, the levels of bFGF, VEGF and IL-8 were comparatively higher in conditioned medium of cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-PTTG1 cDNA than from cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 vector only. Cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-PTTG1 showed a 2-fold increase in bFGF, a 3.5-fold increase in VEGF and a 2-fold increase in IL-8 levels compared to cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 vector only. Measurement of the mRNA levels of these factors by RT/PCR showed significantly higher levels in cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-PTTG1 cDNA compared to cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 vector (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). To determine, if over expression of PTTG1 results in increase in levels of bFGF, VEGF and IL-8 in vivo, we measured the levels of bFGF, VEGF and IL-8 proteins in lysates from tumors developed on injection of nude mice with HEK293 cells stably transfected with PTTG1. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, the levels of bFGF, VEGF and IL-8 were significantly higher in three out of four tumors compared to normal tissues (kidney, liver, lung and heart) collected from the same animals. Since the size of the tumors that developed on injection of cells expressing mutated PTTG1 (HEKmPTTG1-2) were small, we were unable to analyze the bFGF, VEGF and IL-8 levels in these tumors. Measurement of mRNA for bFGF, VEGF and IL-8 revealed significantly higher levels of expression in tumors compared to normal tissues and tumors developed on injection of HEKmPTTG1-2 cells. As expected, levels of PTTG and mPTTG were higher in tumors as compared to normal tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). bFGF levels were found to be comparatively higher in heart which is consistent with other investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] Taken together our results suggest that over expression of PTTG1 in HEK293 cells results in an increase in secretion and expression of bFGF, VEGF and IL-8 in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that increase in secretion and expression of bFGF, VEGF and IL-8 by PTTG1 may be one of the mechanisms by which PTTG1 achieves its oncogenic function and increases tumor angiogenesis.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Introduction of PTTG in HEK293 cells induces secretion and expression of bFGF, VEGF and IL-8.

However, the differences in biology between the rodent cells and human cells have brought the validity of this model into question. There are a number of instances in which an oncogene has been shown to induce transformation in rodent cells but has failed to induce transformation of same types of cells obtained from humans. To test the ability of PTTG1 to induce transformation in human cells, we selected the human embryonic kidney-293 (HEK293) cell line as our model. Our data clearly demonstrate that over expression of PTTG1 in HEK293 results in an increase in cell proliferation induces cellular transformation in-vitro (increase in anchorage-independent growth) and promotes tumor formation in nude mice. Cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 vector did not form colonies in soft agar or develop into tumors on implantation in nude mice, confirming that HEK293 cells do not possess a tumorigenic phenotype. Furthermore our data suggest that overexpression of PTTG1 in these cells results in a greater propensity for tumor development, a shortened latency period and an enhanced growth rate compared with pcDNA3.1-transfected control HEK293 cells.</p><p>A second issue that we were able to address using the HEK293 cell model was the question of the ability of PTTG1 to induce transformation of normal human cells, i.e., whether it acts alone or in cooperation with another oncogene to achieve its tumorigenic function. It has been reported that a single oncogene may not be sufficient for induction of transformation but requires co-expression, or oncogenic cooperation, of another oncogene(s) to induce tumorigenesis in normal primary human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Our results clearly show that PTTG possess the ability to induce cellular transformation in vitro and promotes tumor formation in nude mice. Since, HEK293 cells are transformed with adenovirus type 5 thus making them different from the normal primary cells, therefore it remains unclear if PTTG is sufficient by itself to initiate the tumorigenesis of primary human cells. However, the data clearly demonstrate that PTTG1 overexpression in these cells accelerates their tumorigenic capacity in comparison to that of unmodified cells.</p><p>PTTG1 contains several-proline rich motifs (PXXP); two of these that are located in the C-terminal domain have been reported to be potential binding sites for SH3-domians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In our study we confirm that mutation of these C-terminal proline-rich motifs abrogates the tumorigenicity of PTTG1 in human cells. Such loss of tumorigenicity on mutation of PTTG1 could be due to a loss of expression. Our western blot analysis of the stable cell lines (HEKmPTTG1-2 and HEKmPTTG1-4) that constitutively express mutated PTTG1 protein showed high levels of expression of mPTTG1 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), suggesting that the loss of tumorigenic function of mPTTG1 protein is not due to loss of expression but due to the loss of its ability to induce cellular transformation. These results are consistent with other investigators for rodent cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and confirm the importance of C-terminal proline-rich motifs to mediate the oncogenic function of PTTG1.</p><p>The molecular mechanisms by which PTTG1 achieves its tumorigenic function remain unclear. PTTG1 has been reported to induce expression of the c-myc oncogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], bFGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. bFGF is a broad spectrum and pleiotropic mitogen for growth and differentiation affecting various mammalian cells and organ systems and a large number of cells lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]; besides stimulating wound healing, tissue repair and hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], bFGF induces cell migration and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and acts as an agiogenic factor that induces migration, proliferation and differentiation of endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In addition, it has been reported to modulate the invasion of tumor cells through surrounding tissue to form new capillary cord structures by regulating the activities of extracellular molecules including collagenase, proteinases and integrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Regulation of secretion and expression of bFGF by PTTG1 in NIH 3T3 cells has been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Consistent with these reports, our results demonstrate a significant increase in secretion and expression of bFGF in HEK293 cells on transient transfection with PTTG1 cDNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) as well as in tumors developed by injection of stable cell lines that constitutively express PTTG1 both at protein and mRNAs levels (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p><p>VEGF is a potent stimulant of the vascularization of tumors and is one of the most specific markers of tumor vasculature observed to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. VEGF is a multifunctional cytokine acting as a potent permeability agent, an endothelial cell chemotactic agent, an endothelial cell survival factor and an endothelial cell proliferation factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The expression and secretion of VEGF has been shown to be a crucial rate-limiting step during tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Our results demonstrate a significant increase in secretion and expression of VEGF in HEK293 cells on transfection with PTTG1 and also from tumors excised from animals injected with HEK293 cells that stably express PTTG1 (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p><p>A direct correlation between high IL-8 expression and metastases in melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], prostrate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] has been reported. To determine if overexpression of PTTG1 induces change in secretion and expression of IL-8, we measured its levels in HEK293 cells on transfection with PTTG1 cDNA and in tumors developed on injection of HEK293 cells transfected with PTTG1. Our results demonstrate for the first time that overexpression of PTTG1 induces IL-8 expression in vitro and also in tumors in vivo (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Generation of cell lines constitutively expressing PTTG1</title><p>The human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293), which had been transfected by exposing these cells to sheared fragments of adenovirus type 5 DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] was purchased from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection; Rockville, MD) and cultured according to the instructions provided.
