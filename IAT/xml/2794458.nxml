Yeast Noc4p is a component of the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) processome, can be isolated as a stable Noc4p-Nop14p SSU-processome submodule from yeast cells, and is required for nuclear steps of small ribosomal subunit rRNA maturation. We expressed a series of mutated alleles of NOC4 in yeast cells and analysed whether the corresponding protein variants support vegetative growth, interact with Nop14p, and are incorporated into the SSU-processome. The data reveal that the essential C-terminus of Noc4p which contains 237 aminoacids including the Noc-domain represents a protein-protein interaction module. It is required and sufficient for its association with Nop14p and several nuclear precursors of the small ribosomal subunit. The N-terminal Noc4-part seems to be targeted to pre-ribosomes via the C-terminus of Noc4p and plays there an essential role in SSU-processome function. Replacement of the Noc4p-Noc-domain by its homologues Noc1p-counterpart results in a hybrid Noc4p variant which fails to associate with Nop14p and pre-ribosomes. On the other hand, exchange of 6 amino acids in the Noc1-Noc-domain of this hybrid Noc4p protein is sufficient to restore its essential <italic>in vivo</italic> functions. These data suggest that Noc-domains of Noc1p and Noc4p share a common structural backbone in which diverging amino acids play crucial roles in mediating specific regulated interactions. Our analysis allows us to distinguish between different functions of certain domains within Noc4p and contribute to the understanding of how incorporation of Noc4p into ribosomal precursors is coupled to rRNA processing and maturation of the small ribosomal subunit.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic ribosomes consist of four rRNAs and more than 70 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins).

The Noc-domain containing C-terminus of Noc4p mediates protein-protein interactions, since a Nop14p-Noc4p complex lacking the N-terminal part of Noc4p can be formed in an heterologous co-expression system. We found that formation of the Noc4p-Nop14p subcomplex and association with pre-ribosomes were always coupled in all the mutants analysed but that on the other hand Nop14p is not strictly required for the incorporation of Noc4p into pre-ribosomes. Replacement of the Noc4p-Noc-domain by its homologues Noc1p-counterpart resulted in a hybrid Noc4p variant which failed to copurify with Nop14p and pre-ribosomes. Remarkably, exchange of 6 aminoacids within the Noc1-Noc-domain of this hybrid Noc4p protein was sufficient to restore its essential <italic>in vivo</italic> functions.

The Noc4p variant consisting of the 237 C-terminal amino acids of Noc4p and thereby lacking these 5 domains, appeared to be capable of coprecipitating Nop14, pre-18S rRNA and U3 snoRNA. On the other hand, truncation of any of the C-terminal domains 6 to 8 resulted in an apparent loss of association with Nop14p-HA, 18S rRNA precursors and U3 snoRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008370-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, lanes 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 30 and 32). When we immunoprecipitated HA-tagged Nop14p with anti HA antibodies from the corresponding cellular extracts, corroborative results were obtained: HA tagged Nop14p could only coprecipitate Noc4p variants which did not lack its three C-terminal domains 6 to 8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008370.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>). To prove that the C-terminal part of Noc4p represents a protein-protein interaction domain required for Nop14p binding we co-expressed either full length or the N-terminal or C-terminal truncation together with full length Nop14p in a baculovirus expression system. While both Flag-tagged full length Noc4p and the C-terminal part of Noc4p co-precipitated significant amounts of Nop14p, the N-terminal Noc4p part failed to form a complex with Nop14p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008370-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p><p>These data indicated that the C-terminal 237 amino acids of Noc4p are sufficient to bind Nop14p and required for incorporation of Noc4p into pre-ribosomal particles. We conclude that the N- and the C-terminal domain of Noc4p exhibit different functions. The C-terminal part of Noc4p represents an important interface for the incorporation of Noc4p into early pre-ribosomes and the SSU-processome and for formation of the stable Noc4p-Nop14p SSU-processome submodule. When recruited to 40S pre-ribosomal particles via the C-terminus, the N-terminal part seems then to facilitate the U3-dependent processing of the 18S rRNA precursor.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Role of Nop14p for Incorporation of Noc4p into Pre-Ribosomes</title><p>Interestingly, for none of the Noc4p-variants analysed the association of Noc4p with pre-ribosomes and with Nop14p was uncoupled. Possible explanations for this finding are that Noc4p-incorporation into the SSU-processome either depends on or is a prerequisite for its (most likely) direct interaction with Nop14p, or that Noc4p domains which mediate the interaction with Nop14p play additional independent roles in recruitment of Noc4p into pre-ribosomes. To exclude one or the other of these alternatives, we analysed whether Noc4p can associate with pre-ribosomal subunits in the absence of Nop14p. Therefore, we generated strain <italic>ToY559</italic> in which NOP14 is expressed under the control of the GAL1/10 promoter and Noc4p is encoded in fusion with a C-terminal ProtA tag (Noc4p-ProtA). After 16 hours shift to glucose-containing medium, we observed accumulation of 35S and 23S pre-rRNAs whereas 20S pre-rRNAs were significantly reduced (compare lanes 1 and 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008370-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) confirming that Nop14p is involved in an early step of pre-40S maturation. Noc4p-ProtA was affinity purified from cellular extracts and associated 18S rRNA precursors were analysed by Northern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008370-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>).

In particular, the absolute amount of 23S and 35S pre-rRNA, RNA's which strongly copurify with Noc4p in wildtype conditions, but not the Noc4p-level, are largely increased in extracts from cells depleted of Nop14p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008370-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, compare input lanes 1 and 3, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008370-Liu1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, arguing that the somewhat reduced efficiency of pre-rRNA copurification in this situation could be due to their consequent relative excess over Noc4p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008370-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).

We wondered, whether homologous coding regions of the yeast Noc4p- Noc-domain found in either yeast Noc1p and Noc3p or in predicted counterparts of Noc4p in other eukaryotic species could overtake its essential function. Therefore we constructed plasmids which support constitutive expression of ProteinA-tagged yeast Noc4p variants with its Noc-domain replaced by the counterparts from yeast Noc1p (pToKT87), yeast Noc3p (pToKT89) or the predicted human Noc4p (pToKT88) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008370-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>).

On the other hand, for none of the different Noc4p mutants analysed the interaction with Nop14p and the association with pre-ribosomes were uncoupled.

Accordingly, the C-terminus of Noc4p is important for two kind of interactions, a salt stable one with Nop14p and a salt labile interaction with residual SSU-processome components, each of which can persist independent on the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008370-Milkereit2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008370-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Our results provide evidence that association of Noc4p with pre-ribosomes can occur without the presence of Nop14p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008370-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), but future studies will have to show whether formation of the salt stable Noc4p-Nop14p SSU-processome subcomplex requires the presence of other SSU-processome components. Aminoacids which are conserved in Noc-domains of Noc4p from yeast and human but are diverged in the Noc-domains of Noc1 and Noc3p seem to be important for the establishment of these different kind of interactions. Based on structure prediction algorithms it was suggested that Noc-domains and large parts of Noc-proteins fold in alpha helical repeats similar as seen in HEAT (<underline>H</underline>untington-<underline>e</underline>longation-A_-subunit-<underline>T</underline>OR) repeat proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008370-Dlakic1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

Future studies will have to confirm the existence of HEAT repeat-like folds in Noc4p and to explore their role in mediating the direct protein-protein interactions with Nop14p or possibly other proteinaceous factors and in the regulated association of Noc4p with pre-18S rRNA containing RNPs.</p><p>Interestingly, N-terminal truncated Noc4p variants, like full length Noc4p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008370-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), associate with 22S- and 21S pre-rRNA. Apparently, in growing wildtype yeast cells 21S pre-rRNA and 22S pre-rRNA are very short-lived but nevertheless, they are associated in significant amounts not only with Noc4p but also with other SSU-processome components, e.g. Utp10 and Utp20 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008370-Dez1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> under these conditions.

Accordingly, Dez et al. suggested that the very stable association of Utp10 and Utp20 with 21S and 22S and 23S pre-rRNA containing RNP's might be part of a mechanism that targets these particles to Tramp5 and exosome dependent degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008370-Dez1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

For this, an ITS1 DNA fragment with 5&#x02032; fused T7 promoter sequence was amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA with oligos O441 (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGT GTA TTG AAA CGG TTT TAA TTG TCC3&#x02032;</named-content>) and.

The amplified DNA served as template to produce a digoxigenine labelled RNA probe according to the manufacturer's protocol of the DIG Northern Starter Kit (Roche Diagnostics). For ITS1 detection, blots were hybridized with this probe in 50&#x00025; formamide, 5X SSC, 0,5&#x00025; SDS, 5X Denhards solution at 64&#x000b0;C. Detection of the probe was performed with an anti-Dig antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase, CDP-star chemi-luminescence substrate (Roche Dignostics) and Fuji LAS Reader 3000. U3 snoRNA was detected with <sup>32</sup>P 5&#x02032; end labelled oligonucleotide O202 (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032; CCA ACT TGT CAG ACT GCC ATT 3&#x02032;</named-content>).
