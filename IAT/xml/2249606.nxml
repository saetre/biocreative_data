To investigate the therapeutic potential of retinoids on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the present study evaluates the apoptotic effect of a panel of natural and synthetic retinoids in three human HCC cell lines as well as explores the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Apoptosis was determined by caspase-3 cleavage using western blot, DNA double-strand breaks using TUNEL assay, and phosphatidylserine translocation using flow cytometry analysis. Gene expression of nuclear receptors was assessed by real-time PCR. Transactivation assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were conducted to evaluate the activation of RXR&#x003b1;/RAR&#x003b2; pathway by fenretinide.

Gene expression analysis of nuclear receptors revealed that the basal and inducibility of retinoic acid receptor &#x003b2; (RAR&#x003b2;) expression positively correlate with the susceptibility of HCC cells to fenretinide treatment. Furthermore, fenretinide transactivates the RXR&#x003b1;/RAR&#x003b2;-mediated pathway and directly increases the transcriptional activity of RAR&#x003b2;.

These findings suggest a novel role of RAR&#x003b2; as a tumor suppressor by mediating the signals of certain chemotherapeutic agents.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the primary malignancy of the liver, is the third most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. HCC is highly resistant to available chemotherapy, resulting in a 5-year relative survival rate of less than 7% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Thus, discovery of new and effective therapies against HCC is much needed.</p><p>Retinoids, the natural and synthetic derivates of vitamin A, has a long history in clinical application in addition to its roles as an essential nutrient. Historically, Egyptians used roasted ox liver, which is rich in vitamin A, to treat night blindness. Nowadays, physicians prescribe drugs containing retinoids to treat dermatological disorders and leukemia. Moreover, data from experimental animal models and preclinical, epidemiological, and clinical studies suggest that retinoids may also have chemopreventive and anticancer effect. The best example of retinoid anticancer effect is the retinoic acid (RA) differentiation therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The use of RA has changed the clinical course of APL from a highly lethal to a curable leukemia, therefore establishing the prototype of retinoid-based therapies and the rationale for the use of retinoids in the treatment and prevention of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In addition, retinoids have been used either alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents to treat other types of cancer and precancerous lesions. The anti-proliferative effect of tamoxifen is synergistically enhanced when used in combination with retinoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Retinoids also show promising effects in adjuvant therapy for HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, the therapeutic potentials of retinoids against HCC have not been extensively investigated. In the present study, we initiated a comprehensive screening including most commercially available retinoids on three widely used human HCC cell lines for apoptosis induction. Agree with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], we found that fenretinide (N-[4-hydroxyphenyl] retinamide or 4HPR) induces apoptosis in Hep3B cells. In addition, we found that fenretinide also effectively induces apoptosis in Huh-7 cells. In contrast, HepG2 cells are resistant to fenretinide treatment. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the observed differential susceptibility, gene expression analysis of twelve nuclear receptor genes were assessed by real-time PCR. Our data strongly suggest that the susceptibility of HCC cells to fenretinide treatment is determined by the basal and the induced expression level of RAR&#x003b2;. Furthermore, we showed that fenretinide directly activates RAR&#x003b2; in Huh-7 cells. Finally, the RAR&#x003b2;-deficient Huh-7 cells exhibited marked reduction of fenretinide-induced apoptosis. Based on these findings, we conclude that, in Huh-7 cells, fenretinide directly activates RAR&#x003b2; and induces apoptosis in a RAR&#x003b2;-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>The retinoids used in this study are grouped into three categories: (1) carotenoids including &#x003b2;-carotene, lycopene, and lutein; (2) classic retinoids including all-trans retinol palmitate, retinol acetate, 9-cis retinaldehyde, 13-cis retinol, 13-cis retinaldehyde, 13-cis retinoic acid, and fenretinide; (3) receptor-specific retinoids including all-trans retinoic acid (ligand for RAR), 9-cis retinoic acid (ligand for both RAR and RXR), and TTNPB (4-(E-2-[5,6,7,8-tet-rahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl]-1-propenyl) benzoic acid) (ligand for RAR). &#x003b2;-Carotene, lycopene, all-trans retinol palmitate, 9-cis retinaldehyde, 13-cis retinol, fenretinide, all-trans retinoic acid, 9-cis retinoic acid, and TTNPB were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Lutein was purchased from US Biological (Swampscott, MA). Retinol acetate and 13-cis retinaldehyde were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, Canada). 13-cis retinoic acid was purchased from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Retinoids were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 10 mM as the stock solution and stored at -80&#x000b0;C. Retinoids were diluted with serum-free medium to a 10 &#x003bc;M final concentration immediately before use. The final concentration of DMSO in the culture medium was 0.1% in all treatments. Because retinoids are light sensitive, all retinoid treatments were conducted under dim light.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Huh-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modification of Eagle's Medium and HepG2 and Hep3B cells were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA). The media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FBS) (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA). Cells were cultured at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere with a relative humidity of 95%. Cells were plated with approximately 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells per T-25 flask and cultured overnight. The next morning cells were rinsed with PBS to remove FBS and incubated with individual retinoids (10 &#x003bc;M) in serum-free media for three days or as otherwise indicated. Fresh medium containing individual retinoids was provided every 24 hours. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion counting with a hemocytometer. Every sample was counted in triplicates.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblotting and antibodies</title><p>Detached cells from individual retinoid treatments were collected every 24 hours and combined at the end of the treatment.

Equal amounts of lysates (50 &#x003bc;g total protein) were run on SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The membranes were first incubated with PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk (PBST-milk) for 1 hour at room temperature to block nonspecific binding sites. Immunostaining was performed by incubating the membranes with primary antibodies for caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) or &#x003b2;-actin (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) in PBST-milk overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. After three washes in PBST, membranes were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour in PBST-milk followed by three washes.

To assess the effect of retinoids on HCC cells, we examined cell viability and caspase-3 cleavage induced by individual retinoids in three human HCC cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). As an initial screening, 10 &#x003bc;M was used for all the tested retinoids. This dose might be high for certain retinoids, however, besides apoptosis, no obvious cytotoxicity was noted during the 3-day treatment. In Huh-7 cells, nine out of thirteen retinoids decreased cell viability, with fenretinide being the most effective one (79% decrease in cell number compared with DMSO treatment). Fenretinide also induced the strongest caspase-3 cleavage in detached Huh-7 cells and 9-cis retinoic acid caused a modest induction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In HepG2 cells, although all retinoids examined significantly decreased cell viability, only 9-cis retinoic acid induced weak caspase-3 cleavage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In Hep3B cells, six out of thirteen retinoids decreased cell viability, whereas another three retinoids increased cell number (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). 9-cis retinoic acid, fenretinide, TTNPB, and lutein induced strong caspase-3 cleavage in Hep3B cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).

In Huh-7 cells, caspase-3 cleavage was detected at as early as 24 hours after treatment, and the induction was sustained at 48 and 72 hours. In HepG2 cells, however, even after 72 hours treatment, no obvious caspase-3 cleavage was detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). DNA double-strand breaks, another hallmark of apoptosis, assessed by the TUNEL assay, were detected in Huh-7 cells after treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In contrast, no significant increase in DNA double-strand breaks was detected in HepG2 cells after treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Some background TUNEL staining was detected in HepG2 cells possibly due to the endogenous peroxidase activity. In addition, during apoptosis, membrane lipid phosphatidylserine translocates from the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to the outer leaflet, resulting in loss of cell membrane asymmetry.

The induction fold was calculated by comparing the mRNA level of each nuclear receptor gene between DMSO and fenretinide treatment at each time point. Only those genes that showed marked changes in expression were presented. In Huh-7 cells, fenretinide caused a continuous induction of RAR&#x003b2; mRNA level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). After 48 hours of treatment, mRNA levels of RAR&#x003b1; and &#x003b3; were also highly induced in Huh-7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In contrast, a 9-fold induction of RAR&#x003b2; was detected 6 hours after fenretinide treatment in HepG2 cells, and then the induction dropped down to 3&#x02013;5 fold later on. NOR1 (NR4A3) mRNA was induced 6-fold after 48 hours treatment in HepG2 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Furthermore, by comparing the RAR&#x003b2; mRNA level between Huh-7 and HepG2 cells after fenretinide treatment, our data revealed a dramatic difference in RAR&#x003b2; mRNA level between these two cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>).

Since fenretinide is a synthetic retinoid whether it can directly activate RAR&#x003b2; remains to be tested. So we examined whether fenretinide activates RAR&#x003b2;. We first tested whether fenretinide can activate the RXR&#x003b1;/RAR&#x003b2;-mediated pathway by transactivation assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Fenretinide caused a marked induction of luciferase activity in Huh-7 cells (43-fold) and in CV-1 cells (13-fold) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).

One of the classic RAREs, a 5-bp spaced direct repeat (DR5), was found in the promoter of RAR&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Another well established retinoid target gene is cytochrome P450 26A1 (CYP26A1), an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of retinoic acid to more polar metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Two RAREs have been found in the promoter of CYP26A1, one in the proximal region and the other in the distal region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, the direct binding of RAR&#x003b2; to the RAREs in RAR&#x003b2; and CYP26A1 upon fenretinide treatment was revealed. Fenretinide increased the binding (14-fold) of RAR&#x003b2; to its own promoter compared with DMSO treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). An even higher increase (27-fold) of RAR&#x003b2; binding to the CYP26A1 promoter was also noted (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).

Three siRNAs silenced RAR&#x003b2; gene expression to different extents, the most efficient knockdown being 86% (siRNA #4124) compared with scramble siRNA, followed by 81% (siRNA #3935) and 68% (siRNA #4030) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>).

During the past decade, the knowledge on the mechanisms of retinoids action has been greatly expanded due to the discovery and characterization of retinoid receptors and the consensus RAREs in retinoid target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Retinoid receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors that regulate expression of retinoid target genes upon activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. One retinoid receptor, RAR&#x003b2;, has been speculated as a tumor suppressor in several studies. Decreased RAR&#x003b2; expression was found in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], premalignant oral lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Suppression of RAR&#x003b2; causes resistance to retinoic acid-associated growth arrest in breast and prostate cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and in F9 teratocarcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Induced RAR&#x003b2; expression sensitizes non-small cell lung cancer cells and colorectal cancer cells to the anticancer effects of retinoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, how RAR&#x003b2; exerts its role as a tumor suppressor is largely unknown.</p><p>In the present study, we identified fenretinide from a panel of retinoids and carotenoids as the most effective one in inducing apoptosis in HCC cells. We further identified RAR&#x003b2; as the key nuclear receptor in mediating the effect of fenretinide. Moreover, evidence from this study clearly demonstrates that fenretinide directly activates RAR&#x003b2; and that RAR&#x003b2; is required for fenretinide-induced apoptosis in Huh-7 cells. Thus, the novel finding of the current study is the identification of a positive correlation between RAR&#x003b2; expression and the susceptibility of HCC cells to fenretinide. This finding suggests a role of RAR&#x003b2; in determining the sensitivity of HCC cells to certain chemotherapeutic agents, which may also hold true for other types of tumor cells.</p><p>In fenretinide-resistant HepG2 cells, not only the basal RAR&#x003b2; mRNA level was low, but also the induction of RAR&#x003b2; mRNA by fenretinide was modest and discontinuous. It was known that the promoter of the RAR&#x003b2; gene is frequently hypermethylated in acute myeloid leukemia and cholangiocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Using DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, the basal RAR&#x003b2; mRNA level in HepG2 cells did not increase (unpublished data) suggesting promoter methylation might not account for the suppressed RAR&#x003b2; mRNA expression in HepG2 cells.</p><p>Similar to the expression pattern of RAR&#x003b2; mRNA in HCC cells, the basal expression of Nurr1 is much higher in Huh-7 than in HepG2 cells suggesting Nurr1 might also contribute to the observed differential susceptibility. The basal expression level of Nur77 in Huh-7 and HepG2 cells also correlates with the sensitivity of the cell line to fenretinide-induced apoptosis. Nur77 was shown to enhance RARE activity in transactivation assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, recently studies suggest that Nur77 translocates to mitochondria and interacts with Bcl-2 to promote apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Therefore, the role of Nur77 in fenretinide-induced apoptosis warrants further investigation.</p><p>Another major difference regarding the nuclear receptor basal expression pattern is that HepG2 cells express higher basal levels of CAR and SXR mRNA than Huh-7 cells. It is known that activation of CAR or constitutive activation of SXR induces hepatomegaly in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Whether the high levels of CAR and SXR contribute to the resistance of HepG2 cells to fenretinide-induced apoptosis should be investigated.</p><p>Fenretinide seems to be a rather stable compound. Pharmacokinetics studies have shown that fenretinide has a much longer elimination half-life than all-trans and 13-cis retinoic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In another study, the tissue concentration of fenretinide and its main metabolite N-(4-methoxyphenyl) retinamide (4-MPR) were determined after a 3-day treatment by HPLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The data showed that the concentration of fenretinide was 5-fold higher than that of 4-MPR in various mouse tissues including liver. So it is unlikely that the observed apoptotic effect is mediated through fenretinide metabolites. In addition, in the present study, we used cell culture, in which the metabolism rate might not be as efficient as in the liver. To avoid accumulation of the metabolites of fenretinide during treatment, fresh retinoids were provided every 24 hours. So it is highly likely that the observed apoptotic effect was caused by the parent compound rather than the metabolites of fenretinide.</p><p>During fenretinide treatment, the other two RARs, RAR&#x003b1; and &#x003b3;, were highly induced after 48 hours (25-fold and 17-fold, respectively) in Huh-7 cells implicating the involvement of these two RARs at the late stage of apoptosis in Huh-7 cells. As some studies have shown, RAR&#x003b1; and RAR&#x003b3; may be involved in apoptosis induction in immortalized keratinocytes and leukemia cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In HepG2 cells, however, NOR1 (also known as NR4A3), was induced 6-fold after 48 hours. This induction may contribute to the resistance of HepG2 cells to fenretinide as NOR1 has been suggested to have pro-survival functions in some cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Another novel finding is the direct activation of RAR&#x003b2; by fenretinide. It has been shown that fenretinide induces apoptosis in many types of cancer cells including neuroblastoma cells, breast, lung, head and neck, cervical and ovarian cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Some studies suggest that the effects of fenretinide are mediated through reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspase-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], whereas other studies indicate the involvement of ceramide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Both retinoid receptor dependent and independent mechanisms have been proposed for fenretinide anticancer effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Our results obtained from transactivation assay and ChIP assay clearly demonstrate that fenretinide directly activates RAR&#x003b2; in Huh-7 cells. Knockdown of RAR&#x003b2; mRNA expression by siRNA provides a direct proof that RAR&#x003b2; is required for fenretinide-induced apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report that nuclear receptor RAR&#x003b2; mediates the apoptotic effect of fenretinide in HCC cells. Our findings strongly suggest a potential role of RAR&#x003b2; as a tumor suppressor by mediating the signals of certain chemotherapeutic agents. However, there are still unbridged gaps between RAR&#x003b2; activation and apoptosis execution. Exploration of RAR&#x003b2; target genes will provide helpful insights into these molecular links.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings reveal that endogenous expression of retinoids receptor RAR&#x003b2; gene determines the susceptibility of HCC cells to fenretinide-induced apoptosis.
