Prolonged metaphase arrest due to overexpression of Mad2 has been shown to be deleterious to the ensuing anaphase, leading to the generation of aneuploidies and tumorigenesis. Additionally, some SAC components are essential for correct timing of prometaphase. In meiosis, we and others have shown previously that the Mad2-dependent SAC is functional during the first meiotic division in mouse oocytes. Expression of a dominant-negative form of Mad2 interferes with the SAC in metaphase I, and a knock-down approach using RNA interference accelerates anaphase onset in meiosis I. To prove unambigiously the importance of SAC control for mammalian female meiosis I we analyzed oocyte maturation in Mad2 heterozygote mice, and in oocytes overexpressing a GFP-tagged version of Mad2. In this study we show for the first time that loss of one Mad2 allele, as well as overexpression of Mad2 lead to chromosome missegregation events in meiosis I, and therefore the generation of aneuploid metaphase II oocytes. Furthermore, SAC control is impaired in <italic>mad2&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> oocytes, also leading to the generation of aneuploidies in meiosis I.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromosome missegregation events in mammalian female meiosis have severe consequences, leading to a drop in fertility due to the development of aneuploid embryos followed by spontaneous abortions. In humans, chromosome segregation errors in female meiosis I can lead to the development of trisomies, such as trisomy 21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Hassold1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The SAC has been shown to be required for the fidelity of chromosome segregation in mitosis, verifying the correct attachment of each pair of sister chromatids to the opposite poles of the bipolar spindle via their kinetochores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Musacchio1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The presence of a single erroneously attached kinetochore activates the SAC and leads to a metaphase arrest to permit repair of the attachment. Components of the SAC include the Mad (Mitotic Arrest Deficient) and Bub (Budding Uninhibited by Benomyl) proteins (Mad1-3, Bub1, BubR1, Bub3), as well as Mps1 (Monopolar Spindle 1), CenpE, and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Musacchio1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Most SAC proteins are localized to unattached kinetochores in mitosis. Mad2 has a key role in that it directly inhibits the ubiquitination activity of the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) in association with its activator Cdc20, and therefore anaphase onset. Once the SAC is inactivated, APC/C-Cdc20 ubiquitinates Securin and Cyclin B, targeting both proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome. Securin is a protein inhibitor of a protease named Separase. Degradation of Securin leads to the activation of Separase which removes the cohesin complex holding sister chromatids together by cleaving one of its subunits, Scc1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Nasmyth1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Cdk1-Cyclin B complexes also inhibit Separase function and exit from mitosis, therefore Cyclin B needs to be degraded as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Stemmann1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence inhibition of APC/C-Cdc20 by the SAC prevents sister chromatid separation in mitosis. In addition to its role at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition it has been shown that the SAC components Mad2 and BubR1 are implicated in the correct timing of prometaphase length. Knockdown of either protein leads to accelerated anaphase onset independent of their role in SAC control upon spindle disruption in metaphase, and independent of kinetochore attachment of both proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Meraldi1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In meiosis I, chromosome pairs each consisting of two sister chromatids are separated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Petronczki1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The kinetochores of two sister chromatids are oriented towards the same pole (monopolar attachment). This kind of attachment activates the SAC in mitosis, therefore the question at issue was whether the SAC can recognize a faulty attachment in meiosis I in mammalian oocytes. Chiasmata (sites of recombination) hold pairs of sister chromatids together throughout the first meiotic division, and therefore tension can be generated which should allow the silencing of the SAC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Irniger1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand the existence of proper SAC control has been put into question by studies using XO female mice, which harbor one univalent X chromosome that cannot be properly attached and is segregated at random in meiosis I without causing a metaphase I arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-LeMaireAdkins1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Denuded Germinal Vesicle (GV) stage oocytes arrested in prophase of meiosis I (after chiasmata have been formed and recombination has taken place) are collected from the ovaries of adult female mice. They can be induced to undergo meiosis I in culture in a completely synchronized manner. Cell division in meiosis I is asymmetric, and visible due to the extrusion of a small Polar Body (PB). Upon completion of meiosis I oocytes progress into metaphase of meiosis II where they remain arrested until fertilization occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001165-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Control (littermates) and <italic>mad2&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> oocytes were analyzed by time lapse video microscopy to visualize chromosome movements (DNA was stained with Hoechst) and Polar Body Extrusion (PBE) with Phase Contrast (DIC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001165-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Photon excitation to visualize Hoechst is eventually toxic for oocytes, therefore we also followed meiotic maturation of untreated oocytes by determining the time of PBE through observation with a binocular microscope. Control oocytes of this strain extrude PBs 7.5 to 9.5 hrs after GVBD (Germinal Vesicle Breakdown, corresponds to Nuclear Envelope Breakdown in mitosis), with a peak time average at 8 h50 min (530 min), whereas PBE was significantly accelerated by 33 min on average (8 h17 min&#x02013;497 min) in mad2&#x0002b;/&#x02212; oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001165-g001">Figure 1C, D</xref>). Meiosis I is 6,3&#x00025; shorter in mad2&#x0002b;/&#x02212; oocytes, which is comparable to the 10&#x00025; decrease in the duration of mitosis observed after Mad2 RNAi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Meraldi1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

It is important to take into account that the bipolar spindle self-assembles in mammalian oocytes without centrosomes in a very time consuming manner around condensed chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Brunet2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Schuh1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Stable microtubule-kinetochore interactions are established only 8 hours after GVBD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Brunet2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, therefore activating the APC/C too early may have severe consequences because oocytes may still not have had enough time to establish stable microtubule-kinetochore interactions. We wanted to know whether loss of one allele of Mad2 leads to increased chromosome gain or loss in meiosis I. Chromosome spreads of oocytes before and after they had undergone the first meiotic division in culture were analyzed. The centromere region was stained with CREST serum for easier interpretation of the spreads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001165-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Certain studies have put into question the in vitro culture of denuded Germinal Vesicle (GV) stage oocytes which can lead to meiotic delays and aneuploidies when not performed properly. We show here that control oocytes are euploid before and after meiosis I under our experimental conditions, demonstrating that our culture conditions do not induce aneuploidies per se (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001165-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). <italic>mad2&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> oocytes harbor the correct number of bivalents before metaphase to anaphase transition in meiosis I, meaning that they did not accumulate aneuploidies at significant rates during the premeiotic divisions. Importantly, <italic>mad2&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> oocytes are aneuploid at elevated rates (22,5&#x00025;) in metaphase of meiosis II due to chromosome missegregation in meiosis I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001165-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The presence of more or less than 20 univalents was observed in aneuploid oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001165-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). It is important to note that mitotic Hct-116 <italic>mad2&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> cells become aneuploid at 32 to 50&#x00025; after 25 generations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Michel1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas we observe aneuploidies at more than 20&#x00025; after only one meiosis I division in mouse oocytes.

We conclude that fertility is affected in <italic>mad2&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> mice, and even though we do not have the final proof that this drop in fertility is due to chromosome missegregation events in meiosis I, it is attractive to speculate that increased aneuploidies in <italic>mad2&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> oocytes and the observed drop in fertility are cause and consequence of the same deficiencies in meiosis I.</p><p>We set out to see whether known hallmarks of cell cycle regulation occur at the right time in <italic>mad2&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> oocytes. We established a time lapse video microscopy assay to determine when anaphase onset and PBE take place relative to Cyclin B and Securin degradation in female mouse meiosis I. GFP-Cyclin B and Securin-YFP expressing mRNAs were injected into GV stage oocytes, and their degradation was followed by quantification of the fluorescence signal. As shown previously, overexpression of Cyclin B delays PBE in a dose dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Ledan1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The first acquisition was taken 40 minutes earlier in <italic>mad2&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> oocytes to account for earlier PBE. Chromosomes were stained with Hoechst, and PBE was observed by phase contrast (DIC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001165-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In control oocytes, anaphase onset occurs just before GFP-Cyclin B protein levels are the lowest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001165-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), but always after YFP-Securin has reached its lowest levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001165-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).

Depending on the amount of Securin-YFP or GFP-Cyclin B injected, anaphase onset and PBE are delayed in both, control and <italic>mad2&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> oocytes. It has to be taken into account that the time points are only every 20 minutes (more frequent acquisitions to visualize both, chromosomes and Securin-YFP or GFP-Cyclin B were lethal for the oocytes due to the toxicity of the excitation light), therefore small differences in the degradation profiles may not have been detected.

We decided to explore the possibility that lower Securin levels in <italic>mad2&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> oocytes are responsible for accelerated anaphase onset. No differences in Securin levels between control and <italic>mad2&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> oocytes were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001165-g003">Figure 3E</xref>), therefore we cannot explain the accelerated anaphase I onset in <italic>mad2&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> oocytes with a detectable increase in Securin degradation. We conclude that loss of one Mad2 allele leads to a general acceleration, but not de-regulation of the cell cycle in prometaphase and metaphase of meiosis I, and this acceleration may not leave enough time for proper attachment of kinetochores to the bipolar spindle in meiosis I and may consequently lead to the generation of aneuploidies.</p><p>Loss of one allele of Mad2 is expected to affect SAC control, and this may lead to a premature activation of the APC/C and chromosome missegregations. Therefore, we determined whether SAC control is still functional in <italic>mad2&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> oocytes. As we have shown previously, mouse oocytes maintain a metaphase I arrest upon treatment with low doses of nocodazole for several hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Wassmann1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. But similar to primary tissue culture cells in mitosis, around 40 percent ultimately escape a prolonged nocodazole-induced metaphase I arrest without having correctly attached their chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Wassmann1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. To properly compare SAC function in mad2&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; and mad2&#x0002b;/&#x02212; oocytes (we did not expect a complete loss of SAC control as one allele of Mad2 is still present) without being biased by potential differences in adaptation to nocodazole treatment we performed a nocodazole arrest and release experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001165-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Oocytes were treated with low doses of nocodazole in metaphase I for 2 hours, before release into medium without nocodazole. Metaphase II chromosome spreads with centromere staining of oocytes that extruded a PB showed that control oocytes were able to transiently arrest in metaphase I upon treatment with 200 nM nocodzole and to segregate chromosomes correctly upon nocodazole release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001165-g004">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Treatment with higher doses of nocodazole leads to increased missegregation events upon release also in control oocytes in this strain background (data not shown), therefore 200 nM nocodazole were used to assess the capacity of <italic>mad2&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> oocytes to respond correctly to spindle damage. We show here that <italic>mad2&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> oocytes missegregate their chromosomes at elevated rates after release from nocodazole arrest, indicating that loss of one allele of Mad2 severly perturbs SAC control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001165-g004">Figure 4B and C</xref>). As before, loss or gain of univalents, and the presence of bivalents were observed. Nevertheless, GFP-Cyclin B and Securin-YFP are stabilized in nocodazole treated <italic>mad2&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001165-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), and degraded on time before anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001165-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). We conclude that the SAC is prematurely inactivated in <italic>mad2&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> oocytes, resulting in degradation of APC/C substrates and anaphase onset with chromosome losses. Taken together our results show for the first time a direct connection between SAC loss and incorrect chromosome segregation by mouse genetics in mammalian female meiosis I.</p><fig id="pone-0001165-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001165.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>SAC control is impaired in <italic>mad2&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> oocytes.</title><p>(A) Schematic outline of the experimental procedure.

In Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs), expression of exogenous Mad2 at moderate levels also delays mitosis and has been shown to cause chromosomal instability as cells attempt to bypass the metaphase arrest, probably without completely removing the cohesin complex holding the sister chromatids together <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Sotillo1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Hernando1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

SAC function is affected, and therefore oocytes with unattached kinetochores will eventually progress into meiosis II. Consistent with our observation a correlation between the concentration of transcripts of SAC components, and missegregation events in human oocytes has been described: the authors show that there seems to be an age-dependent decrease in Mad2 and Bub1 transcripts that may potentially underlie the increased incidence of aneuploidies in older women <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Steuerwald1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Upon nocodazole arrest and release, the effects of a malfunctioning SAC become more severe, because more unattached kinetochores need to be properly attached and have to be recognized by the SAC. Overexpression of Mad2 on the other hand leads to SAC activation, but as all kinetochores are attached, mechanisms to inactivate the SAC will be activated at the same time, too. It is attractive to speculate that mechanisms required to inactivate Mad2 are too weak to overcome the entire pool of active Mad2 molecules in the overexpression experiment, but still strong enough to inactivate a fraction of Mad2, therefore allowing partial activation of the APC/C. Separase may only be partially activated, either due to a failure to completely degrade Securin, or a failure to inactivate MPF which may keep a fraction of Separase inactivated by inhibitory Cdk1 binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Gorr1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Gorr2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. As a consequence, not all Cohesin is removed from chromosomes and this leads to the missegregation events observed. Indeed, the same phenotype, namely aneuploidies in metaphase II mouse oocytes, has been observed upon injection of a peptide inhibitor of Separase that probably only incompletely inhibits Separase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Terret1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas complete loss of Separase function in mouse oocytes blocks all separation of bivalent chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Kudo1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In summary, correct metaphase-to-anaphase transition depends on a fine balance between not enough, or too much SAC activity, both having severe consequences on the fidelity of chromosome segregation both in mitosis and meiosis. We show here that the female first meiotic division is much more sensitive to loss of one Mad2 allele than what has been observed in mitotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001165-Michel1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results help to understand how missegregation events in meiosis I can ultimately lead to the generation of trisomies or spontaneous abortions in humans. Future studies using oocyte specific gene invalidation of essential SAC genes will be required to further address the role of the SAC for correct chromosome segregation in meiosis I in mammalian oocytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mouse oocyte culture</title><p>The <italic>mad2</italic> mouse strain has a <italic>C57BL/6J</italic> and <italic>129/Sv</italic> mixed background.
