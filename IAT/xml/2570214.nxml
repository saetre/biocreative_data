The cells bear a germline TSC2 mutation, consisting of a single base-pair change resulting in replacement of lysine 698 with a stop codon (K698X), as well as loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and do not express tuberin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003558-Lesma1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

When grown in culture, these cells appear not to undergo senescence based on morphological, biochemical, and pharmacological data. TSC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>ASM cells require epidermal growth factor (EGF) in the growth medium for proliferation, and its replacement with IGF-I greatly reduces cell growth. IGF-I, however, is important for these cells.

Blockade of the EGF receptor inhibited cell proliferation and S6 and ERK phosphorylation, and caused a rapid reversion of phenotype, as determined by HMB45 reactivity. Rapamycin affected cell growth only when applied at plating time. Through the inhibition of PI3K with specific inhibitors or transient transfection of the cells with siRNA oligomer for Akt1, we show that proliferation of human TSC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>ASM cell is not dependent upon the functionality of PI3K pathway. In contrast, ERK plays a key role in the regulation of growth.

EGFR is an important target of anticancer therapy. The EGFR signalling pathways regulate cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis and apoptosis, all of which become deregulated in cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003558-Vokes1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. One current strategy to block cancer growth involves the use of antibodies against the extracellular domain of EGFR, which compete with ligand for receptor binding, thereby preventing kinase activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003558-Vokes1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. As an example, the antibody used in this study, monoclonal antibody C225, has a high affinity for EGFR and has been shown to be efficacious in several types of cancer, particularly colorectal and head and neck cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003558-Vokes1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Rapamycin specifically inhibits mTOR, while anti-EGFR blocks a complex pathway that involves ERK, RSK1 and tuberin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003558-Harwood1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Rapamycin has been shown to induce apoptosis, decrease proliferation, and reduce tumor size in the Eker rat model and in <italic>TSC2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003558-Kenerson2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003558-Lee1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Since mTOR is directly activated upon loss of hamartin or tuberin, rapamycin has been identified as a potential therapeutic agent for TSC and LAM. It has been recently reported that angiomyolipomas of TSC patients regressed partially during rapamycin treatment, but the volume increased again after the therapy was stopped <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003558-Bissler1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data indicate that anti-EGFR antibody has a greater ability than rapamycin to inhibit proliferation of TSC2<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ASM cells, counteract the phosphorylation of S6 and ERK, and reduce HMB45 reactivity. Furthermore, the anti-EGFR antibody-dependent reduction of the proliferation rate led to the progressive death of human TSC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>ASM cell when added to the medium either at plating time or 3 hours after plating. In contrast, rapamycin reduced significantly cell proliferation only when added prior cell attachment. The delayed application of rapamycin did not affect TSC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> ASM cell proliferation although S6 constitutive phosphorylation is inhibited. This may be explained by the activity of MAPK in these cells. Anti-EGFR antibody and rapamycin, however, were clearly less efficient than <italic>TSC2</italic>-transfection.</p><p>Consistent with the concept that S6K1 activation is PI3K independent in tuberin-deficient cells, Akt1 siRNA did not interfere with S6 phosphorylation, while PTEN phosphorylation in TSC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and TSC2-transfected cells followed the activation pattern of Akt. Exposure to IGF-I enhanced Akt phosphorylation of both TSC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> ASM cells and those virally transfected with TSC2 gene; however, PI3K inhibitors, such as LY294002 and wortmannin, were able to affect this process only in TSC2-transfected cells. Thus, it appears that viral-induced expression of tuberin in TSC2<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ASM cells modifies cellular function and sensitivity to drugs.</p><p>Serum-stimulated phosphorylation of tuberin was observed in embryonic fibroblasts from Akt1/Akt2 double knockout mice, consistent with the hypothesis that another kinase, such as RSK1, phosphorylates tuberin in response to stimuli that activate the Ras/MAPK pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003558-Peng1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Tuberin is a phosphorylation target of Ras-ERK signalling and phosphorylation results in the suppression of its biochemical and biological tumor-suppressive functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003558-Ma1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Viral-driven tuberin expression in TSC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>ASM cells decreased phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK. This effect was also observed with anti-EGFR antibody, whereas rapamycin had a similar effect only when added at plating time. The data are consistent with a regulatory mechanism by which the Ras/MAPK and PI3K pathways converge on tuberin to inhibit its function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003558-Roux1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In human TSC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> ASM cells, the lack of tuberin seems to shift the regulation of cell proliferation to the Ras/MAPK pathway while PI3K cascade appears to activate an independent and different cell signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003558-g008">Figure 8</xref>). This may explain why IGF-I which has a proliferative action in normal smooth muscle cells, fails to promote proliferation in TSC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> ASM cells, and activates survival pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003558-Carelli1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. From our results it may be also inferred a possible modulation of mTOR by the EGF pathway. We may speculate that, in TSC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> ASM cells, Akt is highly phosphorylated because its major substrate, tuberin, is absent while the phosphorilative events are particularly active, expecially mTOR-rictor. In this situation Akt is insensitive to PI3K inhibitors but following <italic>TSC2</italic> transfection the sensitivity is restored.</p><fig id="pone-0003558-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003558.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>ERK- and PI3K-Akt-dependent cascades regulating mTOR signalling.</title><p>A: In wild type cells, activation of either pathways result in the phosphorylation of both RSK1 and Akt that, in turn, are capable of phosphorylating tuberin directly. B: In TSC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> ASM cells, the loss of tuberin may lead to modification of ERK-RSK1 function with direct/indirect regulation of mTOR and p706K. ERK-RSK1 pathway appears to have a more relevant role while the PI3K cascade, may not be properly regulated. This might explain the EGF requirement for proliferation of TSC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> ASM cells.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0003558.g008"/></fig><p>In conclusion, re-expression of tuberin caused a more efficient reversion of phenotypic, proliferative and biochemical characteristics of TSC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>ASM cells compared to the pharmacological approach. EGF-dependent TSC2<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ASM proliferation is related to the lack of tuberin. The anti-EGFR antibody was more efficient than rapamycin in reducing reactivity to HMB45, the proliferation rate, and in controlling ERK activation in human TSC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>ASM cells. Both rapamycin and anti-EGFR were equally affected in inhibiting S6 activation, while ERK phosphorylation was more sensitive to anti-EGFR. In TSC2<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ASM cells, the EGF pathway, involving ERK, may play a more relevant role than a PI3K cascade in cell growth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003558.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Effect of rapamycin (rapa) on TSC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>ASM cell growth.
