One of the earliest manifestations of segmental patterning during vertebrate embryogenesis is the generation of transient, serially repeated structures known as somites. Somites are epithelial blocks of paraxial mesoderm cells that are laid symmetrically on either side of the neural tube from the rostral extremity of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) in an anterior-posterior (AP) manner. Ongoing gastrulation at the posterior part of the PSM ensures embryo growth as new somite pairs arise from the anterior PSM. These structures are periodically formed and the time required to form a somite pair, as well as the total number of somite pairs generated, is extraordinarily constant and species-specific. In the chick embryo a new pair of somites is formed every 90 min, to a total of 52 somite pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In 1997, Palmeirim and collaborators disclosed a molecular clock underlying vertebrate embryo somitogenesis when analysing the expression pattern of the <italic>hairy1 </italic>gene in chick embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This gene is cyclically expressed in PSM cells every 90 min, which corresponds to the time required for a new somite pair to be generated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The number of <italic>hairy1 </italic>oscillations at any given moment is proposed to provide cells with temporal and positional information along both anterior-posterior and medial-lateral PSM axes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Further work performed in our lab showed that a molecular clock is also operating during limb bud development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], suggesting that the segmentation clock is not an exclusive property of PSM tissue, but may be a more general way to count time during vertebrate development, providing positional information to different types of cells.</p><p>Besides participating in the somitogenesis clock in PSM cells, <italic>hairy1 </italic>is continuously expressed in the caudal region of formed somites. Newly formed somites present two distinct compartments, which are the basis for the resegmentation process that later leads to vertebrae formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Somite AP polarity is generated in the anterior PSM by Mesp2 and Delta/Notch signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and the maintenance of rostral and caudal identities in newly formed somites is tightly dependent on <italic>tbx18 </italic>and <italic>uncx4.1 </italic>gene expression, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The regionalized, persistent <italic>hairy1 </italic>expression in the posterior somite region suggests that Hairy1 could participate in somite polarity establishment and/or maintenance, although this has not yet been addressed experimentally.</p><p>Hairy1 belongs to the hairy-enhancer-of-split (Hairy E(Spl)/HES) family of transcriptional repressor proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. All HES members share conserved functional motifs: the basic domain (b) required for DNA-binding, a helix-loop-helix dimerization domain (HLH), an orange domain (OR) which confers specificity among family members and the C-terminal WRPW tetrapeptide required for co-factor binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The evidence to date suggests that HES proteins can be involved in an array of repression mechanisms <italic>via </italic>the recruitment of different protein partners, forming complexes with different specificities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. HES-mediated transcriptional repression has been shown to be an important feature of many embryonic developmental processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Data obtained from mouse and zebrafish embryos have shown that Hairy-related proteins act as transcriptional repressors in somitogenesis: <italic>hes1 </italic>participates in auto-regulatory negative feedback loops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], probably mediated by direct protein interaction with the Notch signalling component RBP-J&#x003ba;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]; <italic>hes7 </italic>represses transcription from N box- and E box-containing promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; <italic>hes7 </italic>represses its own transcription and also <italic>Lfng </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]; Her13.2 interacts with Her1 and represses both <italic>her1 </italic>and <italic>her7 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Although the expression of chick <italic>hairy1 </italic>and its homologues has been demonstrated during somitogenesis in many animal models, it is not clear what the outputs of <italic>hairy1 </italic>expression are, both in the molecular clock and during somite formation and differentiation. Chick Hairy1 is only known to form homo-dimers and hetero-dimers with two other HES family members, Hey 1 and Hey2, through their bHLH-OR protein domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, the mechanisms of Hairy1-mediated transcriptional repression have not yet been addressed in the chick embryo. Aiming at understanding the molecular events triggered by chick Hairy1, we have employed the yeast two-hybrid system to identify Hairy1 protein interaction partners. The yeast two-hybrid system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] is a well established technique used to study protein-protein interactions, which are critical in virtually all cellular processes. Sap18 (Sin3-associated polypeptide, 18 kDa), a component of the Sin3/histone deacetylase (HDAC) transcriptional repressor complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], was found to interact with the C-terminal portion of the Hairy1 protein. Hairy1/Sap18 interaction was independently confirmed by <italic>in vitro </italic>co-immunoprecipitation assays. Whole mount <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization experiments showed that <italic>sap18</italic>, <italic>sin3a </italic>and <italic>hairy1 </italic>mRNA co-localize in the rostral-most part of the chick embryo PSM and in the caudal compartment of already formed somites. Our results indicate that in these tissues chick Hairy1 may mediate gene transcriptional repression by recruiting the Sin3/HDAC complex through a direct interaction with the Sap18 adaptor molecule. Moreover, since <italic>sap18 </italic>and <italic>sin3a </italic>are not expressed in the PSM territory where <italic>hairy1 </italic>presents cyclic expression, our study strongly points to different roles for Hairy1 throughout the PSM and in the prospective somite and caudal region of already formed somites.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Interaction of Hairy1 with Sap18 revealed by yeast two-hybrid analysis</title><p>The yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen proteins that associate with the C-terminal portion of the chick Hairy1 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>; C-Term, amino acids 150&#x02013;291). mRNA was extracted from stage HH20 &#x02013; HH22 chick embryos and a cDNA library was constructed in the pGADT7 plasmid.

We found that Hairy1 has a similar affinity for Sap18 as it has for Hairy1 itself, and that the association between Hairy1 C-terminal portion and Sap18 is almost twice as strong as that for the whole protein (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This is most probably due to the absence of the DNA-binding bHLH domain, leading to a relief of reporter gene repression. Altogether, our yeast two-hybrid results indicate that Hairy1 associates with Sap18 and that Hairy1's C-terminal domain mediates this interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Co-immunoprecipitation of Hairy1 with Sap18</title><p>To independently validate the interaction between chick Hairy1 and Sap18 proteins, <italic>in vitro </italic>co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed.

Our work suggests that upon binding to specific DNA promoter elements, chick Hairy1 is capable of interacting with Sap18, which in turn recruits the Sin3/HDAC repressor complex, repressing Hairy1-target gene transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In fact, the recruitment of the Sin3/HDAC complex through interaction with Sap18 has already been shown for the <italic>Drosophila </italic>GAGA factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and Bicoid genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], as well as for mouse suppressor of fused protein, mSu(fu) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and DNA polymerase, DPE2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>The gene encoding Hairy1 presents cyclic expression in the chick embryo PSM, while in somites <italic>hairy1 </italic>expression ceases to cycle and is persistent in the posterior somitic region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In their recent review on the HES gene family, Kageyama and collaborators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] point out that low levels of <italic>Hes1 </italic>down-regulate cell cycle inhibitors, promoting cellular proliferation. On the other hand, continuous and high levels of <italic>Hes1 </italic>expression inhibit the cell cycle. This highlights another, as yet, unaddressed issue in somitogenesis: Is Hairy1 involved in the same biological functions in the PSM, where it is cyclically expressed in undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, and in the caudal somitic region, where its expression is persistent?</p><p>Our study strongly points to different roles for Hairy1 in the PSM cyclic expression domain and in the rostral-most PSM and caudal region of somites. The expression of both <italic>sap18 </italic>and <italic>sin3a </italic>genes is absent from PSM cells and is up-regulated only in prospective and already-formed somites. This clearly indicates that Hairy1 is only capable of interacting with Sap18, recruiting the Sin3/HDAC complex for transcriptional repression in these tissues and not along the entire PSM, suggesting that this mechanism is not involved in the somitogenesis clock machinery. Instead, we can hypothesize that Hairy1 transcriptional repression through Sap18-mediated Sin3/HDAC complex recruitment may be required for somite formation and/or polarization.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have identified an interaction between the C-terminal domain of the chick protein Hairy1 and the Sin3/HDAC repressor complex adaptor molecule, Sap18. The expression patterns of chick <italic>sap18 </italic>and <italic>sin3a </italic>genes were characterized for the first time and were shown to co-localize with <italic>hairy1 </italic>mRNA in the rostral PSM and caudal region of formed somites. Our results indicate that Hairy1 may be mediating transcriptional repression in these tissues by interacting with Sap18 and recruiting the Sin3/HDAC transcriptional repressor complex to the promoters of its target genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Moreover, since <italic>sap18 </italic>and <italic>sin3a </italic>are not expressed in the PSM territory where <italic>hairy1 </italic>presents cyclic expression, our study strongly points to different roles for Hairy1 throughout the PSM and in the prospective somite and caudal region of already formed somites.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Eggs and embryos</title><p>Fertilised chick (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>) eggs obtained from commercial sources were incubated at 37.2&#x000b0;C in a 49% humidified atmosphere and staged according to the Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Yeast two-hybrid assays</title><p>Chick embryo cDNA library construction and yeast two-hybrid screening were performed using the Matchmaker Library Construction &#x00026; Screening Kit (Clontech, USA). A cDNA library in the pGADT7-Rec (<italic>prey</italic>) vector was constructed using RNA extracted from the forelimbs of chick embryos in stages HH 20 &#x02013; HH22. PCR-generated <italic>hairy1 </italic>fragments were cloned in the pGBKT7 plasmid for preparation of the <italic>bait </italic>vectors.

The haploid AH109 strain was transformed with the generated pGADT7-chick embryo cDNA library. Positive and negative protein interaction controls supplied with the kit were performed with the expected outcomes. Yeast screening for potential interacting proteins with the C-terminal domain of Hairy1 protein was performed by mating Y187 transformed with pGBKT7+C-Term and AH109 transformed with pGADT7-cDNA library. Diploids were plated on SD-Leu/-Trp/-His medium and growing colonies, indicative of a potentially positive interaction between the <italic>bait </italic>(C-Term) and the <italic>prey </italic>(library protein), were re-streaked several times on SD-Leu/-Trp/-His/-Ade plates. Finally, the positive clones were replica-plated on maximally selective SD-Leu/-Trp/-His/-Ade/X-&#x003b1;-gal medium to ensure that colonies contained the correct phenotype. Colony PCR using primers flanking the multiple cloning site of the pGADT7 plasmid was performed on the colonies that successfully passed the reporter tests. Clones presenting an insert over 300 bp were harvested for plasmid isolation and sequencing.</p><p>To confirm Hairy1 interaction with Sap18, yeast Y187 was transformed with <italic>bait </italic>vectors while AH109 was transformed with <italic>prey </italic>plasmids. After mating, the diploid strains were cultured in SD-Leu/-Trp medium and in SD-Leu/-Trp/-His/-Ade/X-&#x003b1;-gal medium. Diploids were suspended in sterile water and three 20-fold serial dilutions were performed, after which a drop of each suspension was placed on each medium. This procedure ensures that the growth observed is not due to feeding on underlying cells, but can clearly be attributed to reporter gene expression. Hairy1/Hairy1 protein interaction was used as a positive control and the empty vectors were employed in the negative controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity</title><p>Quantification of reporter &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity was performed using the Yeast &#x003b2;-Galactosidase Assay Kit (Pierce, USA).
