Exosomes are small vesicles secreted by normal as well as tumor cells. Human tumor-derived exosomes are involved in malignant progression and we evaluated the presence of exosomes in plasma of melanoma patients as a potential tool for cancer screening and follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We designed an in-house sandwich ELISA (Exotest) to capture and quantify exosomes in plasma based on expression of housekeeping proteins (CD63 and Rab-5b) and a tumor-associated marker (caveolin-1). Western blot and flow cytometry analysis of exosomes were used to confirm the Exotest-based findings. The Exotest allowed sensitive detection and quantification of exosomes purified from human tumor cell culture supernatants and plasma from SCID mice engrafted with human melanoma. Plasma levels of exosomes in melanoma-engrafted SCID mice correlated to tumor size. We evaluated the levels of plasma exosomes expressing CD63 and caveolin-1 in melanoma patients (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;90) and healthy donors (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;58). Consistently, plasma exosomes expressing CD63 (504&#x000b1;315) or caveolin-1 (619&#x000b1;310) were significantly increased in melanoma patients as compared to healthy donors (223&#x000b1;125 and 228&#x000b1;102, respectively). While the Exotest for CD63&#x0002b; plasma exosomes had limited sensitivity (43&#x00025;) the Exotest for detection of caveolin-1&#x0002b; plasma exosomes showed a higher sensitivity (68&#x00025;). Moreover, caveolin-1&#x0002b; plasma exosomes were significantly increased with respect to CD63&#x0002b; exosomes in the patients group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>We describe a new non-invasive assay allowing detection and quantification of human exosomes in plasma of melanoma patients. Our results suggest that the Exotest for detection of plasma exosomes carrying tumor-associated antigens may represent a novel tool for clinical management of cancer patients.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Exosomes are small endosome-derived vesicles (50&#x02013;100 nm in size), actively secreted through an exocytosis pathway normally used for receptor discharge and intercellular cross-talk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Thery1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Valenti1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

The aim of our study was thus to provide a method to detect and quantify exosomes from small amount of human plasma, with the final goal of identifying a tool for assessing the role of tumor exosomes as potential tumor marker and prognostic factor. This might be particularly relevant in melanoma patients, in which sensitive and reliable serum markers are unfortunately still limited while serum LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) levels remain the only prognostic serum factor for assessing disease course and prognosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Brochez1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Thompson1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

Culture supernatants of melanoma cells Me501 and MeBS were processed to obtain purified exosomes and data are shown for Me501 cells. The Exotest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005219-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) was able to provide a quantification of the exosomes present in cell culture supernatants, being CD63&#x0002b; exosomes detectable in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005219-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The negative controls, represented by fractions derived from pellet obtained after the 10000 g centrifugation, exosomes purified from cell culture medium alone and by the only secondary antibody resulted in a barely measurable optical density (OD&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.07&#x000b1;0.01). Intra and inter-test variability were calculated on six replicates of the same preparation run on three different plates and were 30&#x00025; and 25&#x00025;, respectively. A patent application has been recently registered for this in-house ELISA (#US 12/321,412; PCT/EE2009/000001) and the Exotest is currently being standardized to reach variability comparable to commercially available kits (HansaBiomed, O.U., Estonia). Western blot and FACS analysis of the same purified exosome preparations confirmed the data obtained by Exotest. In fact, Rab-5b, Lamp-1 and to a lesser extent CD63 proteins were detectable by WB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005219-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and both Rab-5b and CD63 were also detected by FACS on exosomes bound to latex beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005219-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). However, exosomes detection and quantification by Exotest showed a higher sensitivity for the detection of CD63 protein with respect to WB analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005219-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Indeed, while at least 12.5 &#x000b5;g of exosome proteins were needed to properly detect both CD63 and Rab-5b by WB, the Exotest was able to detect exosomes starting from a minimum amount of 3 &#x000b5;g of purified samples.</p><fig id="pone-0005219-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005219.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Detection of exosomes purified from cell culture supernatants of human melanoma cells.</title><p>(A) Schematic representation of the ELISA (Exotest) set up for exosomes detection and quantification.

Linear regression analysis showed a significant correlation between tumor size and levels of exosomes in plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005219-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). This results was confirmed also when Spearman correlation analysis was applied (Spearman coefficient 0.59, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Interestingly, animals with very large tumors (&#x0003e;1000 mm<sup>3</sup>) showed amount of plasma exosomes not as high as expected. This might be due to the low vascularization and/or to the presence of necrotic area in the tumor that might not shed exosomes while increasing its size.

Therefore, we investigated the presence of Cav1 on exosomes obtained from plasma of SCID mice engrafted with melanoma tumors. Cav1 was detected in exosomes preparations derived from plasma of SCID mice engrafted with melanoma tumors by WB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005219-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005219-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) and ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005219-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) while Cav1 was undetectable in plasma-derived exosomes from control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005219-g003">Figure 3B, 3D</xref>).

The cut-off for CD63&#x0002b; exosomes and Cav1&#x0002b; exosomes was set at 2 times the standard deviations above the mean normal exosomes plasma level in the healthy controls, which was 473 and 432 (OD<sub>450</sub>&#x000d7;1000), respectively for CD63&#x0002b; exosomes and Cav1&#x0002b; exosomes. Accordingly, all samples with values above the cut-off were considered positive while samples with values below the cut-off were considered negative. The formulae for calculation of sensitivity and specificity are as follows. Specificity: (number of healthy controls with values below the cut-off / total number of healthy controls)&#x000d7;100. Sensitivity: (number of patients with values above the cut-off / total number of patients)&#x000d7;100. With these cut-off values, the specificity of the Exotest for detection of CD63&#x0002b; plasma exosomes and Cav1&#x0002b; plasma exosomes was 96.5&#x00025; and 96.3&#x00025;, respectively. However, while Exotest for CD63&#x0002b; plasma exosomes showed a low sensitivity (43&#x00025;) the Exotest for Cav1&#x0002b; plasma exosomes had a higher sensitivity (69&#x00025;).</p><p>These results suggest that i) circulating Cav1 may be associated to exosomes in melanoma patients and ii) quantification of plasma exosomes bearing Cav1 may be considered a useful tumor marker. In addition, we found that serum LDH did not correlate with either CD63&#x0002b; or Cav1&#x0002b; plasma exosomes while a significant correlation was observed between CD63&#x0002b; and Cav1&#x0002b; plasma exosomes (Spearman coefficient 0.32, P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.001). Moreover, the Exotest revealed the presence of tumor antigens, such as MART-1 or CEA in the plasma of melanoma patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005219.s002">Figure S2</xref>), suggesting that plasma exosomes recovered from patients plasma are likely derived from tumor cells.</p><p>Most patients included in the analysis (82/90) were affected by advanced disease (stage III&#x02013;IV). Besides six patients with very high serum LDH and poor prognosis, LDH levels at the time of plasma collection for exosome quantification were among the normal range (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005219-t001">table 1</xref>). Nevertheless, a wide distribution of plasma levels of exosomes was detected by Exotest in all disease stages, suggesting that the variability in the amount of exosomes present in peripheral circulation of different patients may reflect diverse levels of tumor aggressiveness and may become a novel independent prognostic factor for melanoma. Other prognostic factors indicated by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), including primary melanoma thickness and ulceration, number of metastatic lymph nodes, and site and number of distant metastases, might also correlate with exosomes serum content, as suggested by the data in mice engrafted with human melanoma, in which exosomes amount was directly associated with tumor burden. However, the relatively limited number of patients enrolled in this study does not allow presently to reach any statistical significance in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Use of whole plasma for exosomes quantification</title><p>The potential applications of Exotest for clinical purposes prompted us to verify whether this assay could be utilized for exosomes detection in unfractioned biological fluids that would allow an easier and more reproducible analysis avoiding the steps of ultracentrifugation. Therefore, we compared the detection and quantification of CD63&#x0002b; exosomes from unfractioned samples (cell culture supernatants from human macrophages and melanoma cells, and human plasma) and exosomes purified from the same samples. In order to increase the sensitivity of the test, for these specific experiments the HRP-conjugated Mab was incubated for 30 minutes instead of 15 minutes.

Exosomes are microvesicles produced by virtually all cells, but their secretion is known to be constitutively exacerbated in tumor cells, and several groups including ours, have reported the presence of exosomes of likely tumor origin in plasma and other biological fluids from cancer patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Valenti2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Huber1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Andre1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Caby1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Although exosomes are implicated in a vast array of cellular functions, and have been considered a cell-free source of tumor antigens when secreted by cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Chaput1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Andre1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, they have been lately hypothesized to foster immunosuppression in tumor-bearing hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Valenti1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Andreola1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Iero1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Huber1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Whiteside1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, it was shown that the ability of serum exosomes from HNC patients to induce T-cell apoptosis correlated with disease activity and the presence of lymph node metastases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Bergmann1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Because of their potential involvement in promoting disease progression through a series of detrimental effects on tumor microenvironment, the possibility of quantifying exosomes in human plasma or serum is recently becoming an important issue. Such an assay would represent a fundamental tool for assessing the potential role of these microvesicles in cancer progression, and as a prognostic factor in the follow-up of cancer patients. Currently used methods for exosomes analysis and studies on their protein content include western blot, flow cytometry and mass spectrometry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Thery1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The quantitative method we describe here is instead based on ELISA-mediated detection of exosomes and represents to our knowledge the first report about an easy and reliable assay for exosome quantification. The proteins that are detected by our Exotest are not exosome-specific but are exclusively shared with cytoplasmic organelles, such as endosomes and lysosomes (Rab-5b and CD63), whose membranes are not recycled as for plasma membrane structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Thery1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>This excludes the possibility of detecting these proteins on plasma microparticles or debris derived from necrotic tumor cells, or in their soluble form. The assay we developed also included a tumor marker (caveolin-1) which allows the preferential detection of tumor-secreted exosomes. A series of comprehensive studies performed by different comparative methods (such as WB and FACS) and in different experimental conditions (supernatants from melanoma <italic>vs</italic> normal cells, and plasma from normal <italic>vs</italic> melanoma-engrafted SCID mice) proved the reliability of the Exotest. Moreover, we found that cell lines of other tumor histotypes (osteosarcoma and CRC) secreted exosomes expressing variable levels of CD63 and Cav1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005219.s002">Figure S2</xref>), in line with the reported cellular expression of Cav1 in these cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Cantiani1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Fine1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Using this assay, we observed that significantly increased amounts of exosomes expressing tumor markers such as caveolin-1 are present in plasma from melanoma patients with respect to healthy individuals. Interestingly, the wide distribution of Cav1&#x0002b; plasma exosomes within the patients' population suggests the potential use of exosomes in plasma as prognostic marker. In fact, plasma levels of Cav1-expressing exosomes were significantly decreased in patients undergoing chemotherapy with respect to patients untreated at time of sampling (data not shown). Since this was a cross-sectional analysis of patients undergoing diverse chemotherapy regimens, longitudinal studies on patients undergoing strictly controlled chemotherapy protocols will better define the importance of this observation. It should be underlined that exosomes are also detected in normal subjects, being secreted also by normal cells of different organs, including blood cells. However, the levels of exosomes quantified in plasma of melanoma patients are significantly above the cut-off level calculated from healthy donors, suggesting a good level of sensitivity and a high specificity of detection. Recently, it has been reported that plasma exosomes of melanoma patients promote the generation of suppressive myeloid cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Valenti2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and the induction of a series of different functional defects in activated T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Andreola1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Huber1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Soderberg1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that tumor cells may use exosomes to damage the immune system without a direct interaction with immune cells. Moreover, it is progressively emerging that these vesicles can be used by tumor cells as a non-cellular tool for microenvironment remodelling, promotion of neo-angiogenesis, and sustainment of their own growth through autocrine loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Valenti1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Iero1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, human prostate cancer cells secreting caveolin-1 induced tumor growth of caveolin-1 negative tumor cells <italic>in vivo</italic> through the release of caveolin-1 associated to lipoprotein particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Bartz1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. The selective and/or preferential expression of caveolin-1 on exosomes from tumor patients may thus represent an important marker of malignant progression and deserves further investigation about its possible application as a screening method in tumor patients. Notably, this is the first evidence that caveolin-1 is expressed on exosomes released by human tumors.</p><p>An alternative and more intriguing hypothesis is that exosomes could be a hallmark of more aggressive tumors, and thus high exosomes plasma levels could identify patients with unfavorable prognosis despite early disease stage. Indeed, the unique biochemical properties of these organelles and the peculiar lipid composition of their membranes may determine their long-term persistence in plasma also in patients whose tumor has been surgically removed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Whiteside1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Because of the lack of a reliable quantitative assay, no study has so far addressed whether the amount of exosomes in plasma may associate with a different disease course in cancer patients. This is an even more important issue in melanoma, which is a rather heterogeneous disease, with subsets of patients undergoing unexpectedly poor prognosis despite the presence of good prognostic factors and vice versa.</p><p>Melanoma is still one of the cancers in which a soluble tumor marker in support of prognosis and treatment evaluation has not yet been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005219-Hauschild1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results suggest that an exosome-specific ELISA may be used for detection and quantification of circulating exosomes in melanoma patients. Moreover, the test offers the possibility of detecting different proteins in plasma exosomes preparations, with the potential application to specific type of tumor patients. We reckon that longitudinal clinical studies on larger cohorts and standardization of the method described are to be performed in order to evaluate whether plasma exosomes quantification and characterization may represent an independent prognostic factor for melanoma patients and possibly for patients carrying other types of cancers. Nevertheless, this assay may help exploring a rather new field in cancer research for the identification of novel prognostic tools for cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>We used two human metastatic melanoma cell lines (Me501 and MeBS) obtained from metastatic melanoma lesions of patients (Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milan, Italy).
