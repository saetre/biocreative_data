Reporter gene analysis revealed that the newly synthesized Egr-1 was biologically active. The signaling cascade connecting thrombin stimulation with Egr-1 gene expression required elevated levels of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the activation of diacylgycerol-dependent protein kinase C isoenzymes, and the activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK). Stimulation of the cells with thrombin triggered the phosphorylation of the transcription factor Elk-1. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Elk-1 completely prevented Egr-1 expression in stimulated 39M1-81 cells, indicating that Elk-1 or related ternary complex factors connect the intracellular signaling cascade elicited by activation of protease-activated receptors with transcription of the Egr-1 gene. Lentiviral-mediated expression of MAP kinase phosphatase-1, a dual-specific phosphatase that dephosphorylates and inactivates ERK in the nucleus, prevented Elk-1 phosphorylation and Egr-1 biosynthesis in thrombin stimulated 39M1-81 cells, confirming the importance of nuclear ERK and Elk-1 for the upregulation of Egr-1 expression in thrombin-stimulated lung fibroblasts. 39M1-81 cells additionally express M<sub>1 </sub>muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.

Thrombin catalyzes fibrin clot formation by converting fibrinogen into fibrin. Moreover, platelets are stimulated by thrombin to aggregation and secretion. In addition, thrombin functions as a mitogen for several cell types, including smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Thrombin binds to seven-transmembrane-spanning G-protein coupled receptors termed protease-activated receptors (PARs). These receptors are activated via proteolysis. Thrombin cleaved off N-terminal amino acids from the extracellular part of the receptor, generating a new N-terminus for the receptor protein that functions as a "tethered ligand" capable of activating the receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Thrombin stimulation has been shown to activate stimulus-responsive transcription factors in different cell types, suggesting that activation of protease-activated receptors results in changes in gene transcription. In fact, activation of c-Fos and c-Jun has been reported upon stimulation with thrombin in CCL39 and NIH3T3 fibroblasts, endothelial and astrocytoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B is activated in thrombin-stimulated microglia cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Expression of Egr-1 is also regulated by thrombin in endothelial cells and keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The activation of Egr-1 is regulated via its biosynthesis, in contrast to other stimulus-induced transcription factors such as NF-&#x003ba;B or CREB that are activated via nuclear translocation or phosphorylation. In unstimulated cells, only low levels of Egr-1 are detectable. Upon stimulation by extracellular signaling molecules including growth factors, hormones, and neurotransmitters, the biosynthesis of Egr-1 is induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Egr-1 couples extracellular signals with long-term responses by altering the gene expression pattern of Egr-1 target genes.</p><p>We have analyzed the signaling cascade leading to enhanced Egr-1 biosynthesis in thrombin-stimulated 39M1-81 lung fibroblasts. These cells are derived from CCL39 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts, a cellular model system that has often been used to elucidate the intracellular signaling cascade following stimulation with thrombin. 39M1-81 cells express &#x02013; in addition to protease-activated receptors &#x02013; type M<sub>1 </sub>muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Thus, we were able to compare two signaling cascades that share the activation of phospholipase C downstream of receptor stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Here, we show that the intracellular signaling cascade connecting protease-activated receptors with Egr-1 gene transcription requires a rise of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>ion concentration, the activation of diacylgycerol-dependent PKC isoenzymes, the activation of ERK and the phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor Elk-1. In contrast to M<sub>1 </sub>muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activation, no transactivation of the EGF receptor was required to connect thrombin stimulation with enhanced Egr-1 gene transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Biosynthesis of Egr-1 in thrombin and carbachol-treated 39M1-81 cells</title><p>39M1-81 lung fibroblasts were serum-starved for 24 hours and then incubated with either thrombin to stimulate protease-activated receptors or carbachol to stimulate M<sub>1 </sub>muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The cells were harvested 1, 3, and 6 hours after stimulation, nuclear extracts were prepared and Egr-1 expression was analyzed via immunoblotting. Egr-1 immunoreactivity was almost undetectable in the absence of stimulation. In contrast, thrombin and carbachol strikingly increased the biosynthesis of Egr-1 with a peak expression occurring 1 hour following stimulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The expression of Sp1 was analyzed as a loading control.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Stimulation of 39M1-81 fibroblasts with either thrombin or carbachol induces the biosynthesis of biologically active Egr-1</bold>.

Thus, elevated Egr-1 protein levels do not automatically indicate an increased transcription of Egr-1 target genes. We determined the transcription of an Egr-1-responsive target gene in thrombin and carbachol-treated 39M1-81 cells using a chromosomally embedded Egr-1-responsive luciferase reporter gene. The reporter gene has been integrated into the genome of the cells via lentiviral gene transfer. A schematic depiction of the integrated provirus is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>. The implanted transcription unit encoded the reporter gene luciferase, controlled by a minimal promoter consisting of four binding sites for Egr-1, derived from the human synapsin I promoter, a TATA box and an initiator element. The infected cells were stimulated with thrombin or carbachol and gene transcription of the integrated reporter was measured. The results show that treatment of 39M1-81 cells with thrombin or carbachol significantly increased the transcription of the Egr-1-responsive reporter gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), indicating that biologically active Egr-1 was synthesized.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ions in thrombin and carbachol-induced Egr-1 biosynthesis in 39M1-81 cells</title><p>Stimulation of protease-activated receptors and M<sub>1 </sub>muscarinic acetylcholine receptors leads to the activation of phospholipase C, the generation of IP<sub>3 </sub>and the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ions into the cytosol via stimulation of ionotropic IP<sub>3 </sub>receptors of the endoplasmic reticulum. Accordingly, thrombin and carbachol increased the free cytosolic Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentration in 39M1-81 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Therefore, we assessed the importance of elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>for the signaling cascade connecting protease-activated and muscarinic M<sub>1 </sub>receptor activation with Egr-1 gene transcription. 39M1-81 cells were preincubated in the presence or absence of the cell-permeable acetoxymethylester of the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+ </sup>chelator BAPTA following stimulation with either thrombin or carbachol. When the thrombin or carbachol-induced elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>was precluded by the preincubation with BAPTA-AM, the stimulus-induced biosynthesis of Egr-1 was almost completely blocked (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).

As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, administration of either thrombin or carbachol induced the phosphorylation, i.e. activation of ERK2 in these cells. Preincubation of the cells for six hours with PD98059, a compound that inhibits phosphorylation of MAP kinase kinase, reduced stimulus-induced ERK2 phosphorylation. Higher levels of ERK2 are expressed in 39M1-81 cells in comparison to ERK1. Phosphorylation of ERK1 was also induced in thrombin and carbachol-stimulated 39M1-81 cells, but to a lesser extent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).

To specifically activate the ERK pathway in 39M1-81 cells in a ligand-independent manner and to confirm the importance of the ERK signaling pathway for thrombin and carbachol-induced upregulation of Egr-1, we generated 39M1-81 cells expressing a &#x00394;Raf-1-estrogen receptor fusion protein, a conditionally active form of Raf-1 protein kinase. The modular structure of Raf-1 and &#x00394;Raf-1:ER is schematically depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>. Raf-1 contains three functional domains (CR1, CR2 and CR3). CR1 is a cysteine-rich region and functions as binding site for activated Ras (Ras-GTP) at the cell membrane. CR2 is rich in serine and threonine residues and negatively regulates the biological activity of the catalytic domain. CR3 encompasses the protein kinase domain. We expressed the catalytic domain of Raf-1 as a fusion protein with the ligand binding domain of the murine estrogen receptor (ER) to keep the protein kinase in an inactive state in the absence of hormone. Addition of hormone leads to an enhancement of Raf-1 kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The use of the estrogen receptor mutant termed ER<sup>Tamoxifen Mutant </sup>allowed us to use the synthetic ligand, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT) for induction. We infected 39M1-81 cells with a recombinant retrovirus encoding &#x00394;Raf-1:ER. As a control, 39M1-81 cells were infected with a recombinant retrovirus encoding puromycin acetyltransferase. The expression of the Raf-1/estrogen receptor fusion protein that occured under control of the murine stem cell virus long terminal repeat was verified using an antibody specific for the estrogen receptor ligand binding domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Next, 39M1-81-&#x00394;Raf-1:ER and 39M1-81pac cells were stimulated with 4OHT for 2 hours.

Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> reveals that prolonged treatment with TPA attenuated the thrombin and carbachol-induced signaling pathway leading to the biosynthesis of Egr-1. EGF is known to trigger an upregulation of Egr-1 in 39M1-81 cells, as depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> (lower panel). However, activation of protein kinase C was not required for EGF-induced upregulation of Egr-1 expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, lower panel). Preincubation of 39M1-81 cells with the PKC inhibitor GF109203X blocked the biosynthesis of Egr-1 in thrombin or carbachol-stimulated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), supporting the conclusion that PKC activation is required to connect stimulation of the cells with enhanced Egr-1 biosynthesis. Downregulation of diacylgycerol-regulated protein kinase C isoforms also impaired thrombin and carbachol-elicited expression of Egr-1 in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>).

Here, we show that Egr-1 expression is strikingly induced in 39M1-81 cells that were stimulated with thrombin. We also demonstrate that the newly synthesized Egr-1 protein was biologically active, using a lentivirus-based technique to implant an Egr-1 responsive reporter gene into the chromatin of 39M1-81 cells.</p><p>Recently, we showed that stimulation of 293 cells expressing P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptors with the ligand BzATP induced a transient expression of Egr-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptors are ionotropic receptors that are permeable for small cations following stimulation. In particular, stimulation of P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptors leads to an influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>ions into the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Experiments using the acetoxymethylester of the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+ </sup>chelator BAPTA revealed that the rise of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentration is essential for induction of Egr-1 biosynthesis following P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor stimulation. Likewise, an increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>is required in carbachol-stimulated neuroblastoma cells and gonadotrophs that express M<sub>3 </sub>muscarinic acetylcholine receptors to induce the biosynthesis of Egr-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In 39M1-81 cells, thrombin stimulation increased the free cytosolic Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and we have shown here that an increase of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentration is essential for the upregulation of Egr-1 gene transcription in thrombin stimulated 39M1-81 cells. Egr-1 is thus a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ion regulated transcription factor &#x02013; similar to CREB, NFAT, NF-&#x003ba;B and others.</p><p>An elevation of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentration may trigger an activation of ERK, either via activation of PKC or via the transactivation of the EGF receptor.

Stimulation of G-protein coupled receptors can induce a transactivation of the EGF receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In human glioma cells, for example, we have shown that stimulation of the G-protein coupled neurokinin receptor-1 by substance P induces the biosynthesis of Egr-1 via the transactivation of the EGF receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Likewise, we have shown that P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor stimulation induces an activation of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase and impairment of this kinase activity interrupts the connection between receptor stimulation and enhanced Egr-1 biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The results presented here show that transactivation of the EGF receptor is necessary in 39M1-81 fibroblasts to connect M<sub>1 </sub>muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activation with transcription of the Egr-1 gene. In contrast, thrombin-induced signaling in 39M1-81 fibroblasts and 1321N1 astrocytoma cells is independent of EGF receptor transactivation and rather requires the activation of PKC to connect the elevation of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentration with an activation of the ERK signaling pathway. These results are in contrast to previously published observation showing that in HaCaT keratinocytes, transactivation of the EGF receptor is an essential event in the thrombin induced signaling cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. These results are in line with previous observations showing that EGF receptor transactivation is not necessary for thrombin-induced phosphorylation of ERK in astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Thus, cell type-specific variations in the thrombin-elicited signaling cascade are obvious. We further showed that the activation of ERK is of major importance for the signaling cascade that connects thrombin and carbachol stimulation with enhanced Egr-1 gene transcription. These data were corroborated with a cell line where Egr-1 expression was induced following activation of &#x00394;Raf-1:ER, a Raf-1/estrogen receptor fusion protein that specifically activated the ERK signaling pathway.</p><p>A major nuclear substrate for ERK is Elk-1, a member of the Ets family of transcription factors. Elk-1 is an essential component of the serum response ternary complex that binds to DNA and to the serum response factor SRF. The transcriptional activity of Elk-1 depends on its phosphorylation-status. Elk-1 is phosphorylated by several protein kinases including ERK, leading to enhanced DNA binding, ternary complex formation and SRE-mediated transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Phosphorylation of Elk-1 connects the ERK signaling cascade with SRE-mediated gene transcription. The human Egr-1 promoter contains five SREs encompassing the consensus sequence CC [A/T]<sub>6</sub>GG, known as the CArG box. The SREs occur in two clusters in the Egr-1 promoter, a distal 5' cluster of 3 SREs and a proximal 3' cluster of 2 SREs. In addition, multiple binding sites for Elk-1 and other ternary complex factors are adjacent to the CArG boxes having the Ets consensus core sequence GGAA/T. Transcriptional activation of Egr-1 is often preceded by an activation of Elk-1, indicating that the SREs within the Egr-1 promoter mediate signal-induced activation of Egr-1 gene transcription. For example, in stimulated glutamatergic corticostriatal neurons a strict spatiotemporal connection between Elk-1 activation and Egr-1 mRNA synthesis has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The analysis of Egr-1 promoter/luciferase reporter genes containing two or five SREs revealed that both SRE clusters connect thrombin stimulation with enhanced Egr-1 gene transcription. These data are in line with an earlier observation that both the distal as well as the proximal SRE clusters couple enhanced ERK activity with transcriptional upregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Similar results were obtained in 4OHT-treated 39M1-81-&#x00394;Raf-1:ER cells that has been infected with lentiviruses expressing the indicated reporter genes. In contrast, in primary human endothelial cells, only the proximal serum response elements are required to increase Egr-1 promoter/luciferase reporter gene transcription after thrombin stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Thus, our data are clearly different from those reported by these authors. The differences may rely on the analysis of different cell types (endothelial cells or fibroblasts). Alternatively, instead of using transient transfection of reporter plasmids, we used a lentivirus-based technique to implant reporter genes into the chromatin of 39M1-81 cells. The transient transfection of promoter/reporter gene containing plasmids has the disadvantage that the structure of these plasmids may be incompletely organized in comparison to cellular chromatin, and may thus resemble a prokaryotic gene organisation including a nonrestrictive transcriptional ground state. In contrast, the chromatin structure in eukaryotes causes a restrictive ground state, occluding proteins such as RNA polymerases and transcriptional regulators from binding to DNA. Hence, promoter/reporter genes should be integrated into the chromatin to investigate transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. This strategy enabled us to analyse gene transcription of reporter genes that are packed into an ordered chromatin structure.</p><p>We have shown that stimulation of 39M1-81 cells with thrombin induces the phosphorylation of Elk-1 at serine residue 383. We then went a step further and performed a loss-of-function experiment to unequivocally prove the key role of ternary complex factor activation for thrombin-induced upregulation of Egr-1 expression. Genetic inactivation of Elk-1 or other ternary complex factors in transgenic mice revealed minimal changes of the phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], suggesting that functional redundancy may exist. Therefore, we have assessed the necessity of ternary complex factor activation for thrombin or carbachol-induced Egr-1 biosynthesis by using a dominant negative version of Elk-1 in loss-of-function experiments. Due to its binding to DNA and SRF, the Elk-1 mutant REST/Elk-1&#x00394;C most likely also inhibits the activity of two other ternary complex factors, SAP-1 and SAP-2. These experiments revealed that expression of REST/Elk-1&#x00394;C almost completely blocked the stimulus-induced biosynthesis of Egr-1. Thus, ternary complex factor activation is a key step in connecting thrombin or carbachol stimulation with enhanced Egr-1 biosynthesis.</p><p>Using chromatin-integrated reporter genes, controlled by the proximal SREs from the Egr-1 promoter, we directly showed that expression of the dominant-negative mutant of Elk-1 impaired reporter gene transcription after stimulation of the cells with either thrombin or carbachol. As a control, we have analyzed the regulation of the 9E3/cCAF gene. Two Elk-1 binding sites were identified between -534 and -483 of the 9E3/cCAF promotor that functions as thrombin response elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Our data show that stimulation of 39M1-81 fibroblasts with either thrombin or carbachol induced transcription of a chromatin-embedded 9E3/cCAF promotor/luciferase reporter gene. This stimulus-induced upregulation of reporter gene expression was impaired in cells that expressed the dominant-negative Elk-1 mutant REST/Elk-1&#x00394;C. These data confirm previous studies showing that Elk-1 is essential for the thrombin-induced expression of the 9E3/cCAF gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. While the Egr-1 promoter contains five SREs and multiple TCF binding sites, the 9E3/cCAF promoter does not contain a SRE. Thus, the ability of Elk-1 to stimulate transcription does not require the presence of SREs. The experiments presented here show that the dominant-negative mutant REST/Elk-1&#x00394;C blocks Elk-1-regulated gene transcription regardless of the presence or absence of SREs in the regulatory region of Elk-1-controlled genes. Finally, we showed that an impairment of Elk-1 phosphorylation by overexpression of MKP-1 also prevented Egr-1 expression in thrombin or carbachol-stimulated 39M1-81 cells. Together, these data indicate that phosphorylation and activation of Elk-1 is required to connect the ERK signaling cascade with transcription of the Egr-1 gene in thrombin or carbachol-stimulated 39M1-81 cells.</p><p>39M1-81 cells express both protease-activated receptors and M<sub>1 </sub>muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The data presented here demonstrate that the signaling cascades induced by either thrombin or carbachol stimulation of 39M1-81 cells are indistinguishable, except that activation of M<sub>1 </sub>muscarinic acetylcholine receptors induces the transactivation of the EGF receptor. Analyzing two different cell lines, 39M1-81 fibroblasts and 1321N1 glioma cells, we show that the thrombin induced signaling cascade is independent of EGF receptor transactivation and rather relies on the activation of PKC to connect the increase of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentration with the ERK signaling cascade.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown that stimulation of protease-activated receptors in 39M1-81 cells promotes the biosynthesis of Egr-1 via a signaling cascade involving elevated levels of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ions, the activation of PKC and ERK, and the phosphorylation and activation of Elk-1. In the nucleus, Elk-1 connects the activation of ERK with the Egr-1 gene via SREs within the Egr-1 5'-upstream region. Overexpression of MKP-1 prevents the phosphorylation of Elk-1 and the subsequent transcription of the Egr-1 gene. The signaling cascade induced by thrombin or carbachol in 39M1-81 cells is summarized in the scheme depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>. This study also shows that the dominant-negative Elk-1 mutant REST/Elk-1&#x00394;C is a valuable tool to study ternary complex factor-regulated gene transcription.</p><fig position="float" id="F12"><label>Figure 12</label><caption><p><bold>Signaling pathway leading to Egr-1 biosynthesis in thrombin or carbachol-stimulated 39M1-81 cells</bold>. Stimulation of protease-activated and M<sub>1 </sub>muscarinic acetylcholine receptors leads to the activation of phospholipase C (PLC), the generation of IP<sub>3 </sub>and the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ions into the cytosol via stimulation of ionotropic IP<sub>3 </sub>receptors of the endoplasmic reticulum. The increase of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentration is prevented by pretreating the cells with BAPTA-AM. Elevation of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentration may induce a transactivation of the EGF receptor or an activation of PKC. Protein kinase C regulates directly or indirectly Raf activity. While preincubation of the cells with AG1478 was used to inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor, PKC activity was either blocked by incubation with the bisindolylmaleimide GF109203X or by prolonged treatment with TPA. Both transactivation of the EGF receptor or activation of PKC stimulated the ERK signaling pathway. The compound PD98059 was used to inhibit the phosphorylation of MAP kinase kinase by Raf, thus blocking the stimulus-induced phosphorylation and activation of ERK. Major nuclear substrates for ERK are ternary complex factors such as Elk-1, essential components of the serum response element ternary complex. The Egr-1 promoter contains five SREs that mediate signal-induced activation of Egr-1 gene transcription. Stimulus-induced Egr-1 biosynthesis was blocked by inhibiting ternary complex factor activity via expressing of a dominant-negative mutant (REST/Elk-1&#x00394;C). Likewise, forced dephosphorylation of ERK by overexpression of MKP-1 blocked the signaling cascade leading to enhanced Egr-1 biosynthesis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-10-40-12"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transient transfections</title><p>39M1-81 cells, a kind gift of Jacques Pouyss&#x000e9;gur, Universit&#x000e9; de Nice, France, are derived from CCL39 cells, an established cell line of Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts, that express protease-activated receptors.
