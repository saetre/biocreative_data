These effects are similar to those caused by ionizing radiation (IR), which is a well-characterized DNA-damaging agent. Activation of the DNA damage responses by CDT is consistent with the functional and structural homology of the CdtB subunit with mammalian DNase I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002254-Elwell1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002254-Nesic1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In adherent cells, CDT intoxication and exposure to IR are associated with the formation of actin stress fibers, via activation of the small GTPase RhoA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002254-Frisan1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. While a large amount of data is available regarding the activation of RhoA upon stimulation of plasma membrane-bound receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002254-EtienneManneville1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, the molecular mechanisms regulating RhoA activation in response to these and other DNA-damaging agents are still unknown. It is noteworthy that, since RhoA activation occurs in the cytosol, the signals that regulate its activation in response to DNA damage must be then transduced from the nucleus.</p><p>Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) are key activators of the small GTPases that regulate the switch between the inactive GDP-bound and the active GTP-bound forms of the GTPase (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002254-Rossman1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>). The vast majority of the known RhoA-specific GEFs exhibit a cytoplasmic localization. One remarkable exception is the RhoA-specific GEF encoded by the neuroepithelioma transforming gene 1 (<italic>Net1</italic>) that is normally found in the nucleus of mammalian cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002254-Rossman1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>). Net1 was originally isolated in a tissue culture screen for transforming genes in NIH 3T3 cell focus formation assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002254-Chan1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The oncogenic form of Net1 isolated from this screen lacked the first 145 amino acids. A deletion mutant of Net1 lacking the first 121 amino acids was shown to be constitutively active and induced: i) formation of actin stress fibers; ii) activation of the <underline>M</underline>itogen-<underline>A</underline>ctivated <underline>P</underline>rotein <underline>K</underline>inase (MAPK) JNK; and iii) activation of the serum response factor (SRF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002254-Alberts1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002254-Schmidt1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The regulation of Net1 activity is poorly understood. PAK1-dependent phosphorylation of Net1 on Ser152 and Ser153 inhibits its GEF activity and abolishes Net1-dependent RhoA activation and stress fiber induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002254-Alberts2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, translocation of Net1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is required for activation of RhoA. The amino-terminus of Net1 contains multiple nuclear localization signals, and deletion of this domain is associated with accumulation of a constitutively active Net1 in the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002254-Schmidt1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together these data suggest that the activation of Net1 requires both changes in the phosphorylation pattern of specific inhibitory sites and shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, but the signals that trigger these events are still unknown.</p><p>In the present study, we have identified DNA damage as a trigger for Net1 activation. We show that inhibition of Net1 prevents RhoA activation and stress fiber formation, and promotes cell death upon intoxication or irradiation. We also demonstrate that the Net1/RhoA dependent signals converges on the activation of p38 MAPK and its downstream target MK2, indicating that RhoA plays an important role in controlling the activation of this MAPK pathway in response to genotoxic agents.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>DNA damage induces Net1 activation</title><p>We have previously shown that exposure to DNA damaging agents induces activation of the small GTPase RhoA, which delays cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002254-Frisan1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In order to investigate how the signal delivered by DNA damage is transduced from the nucleus to the cytosol, we have studied the activation of the RhoA specific GEF Net1 in response to CDT or IR.
