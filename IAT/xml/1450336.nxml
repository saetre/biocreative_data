The common origin, physical linkage and hepatic expression of these four genes predict shared regulatory element(s). However, separation of <italic>hDBP</italic> from the other three genes by 1.5 Mb argues that <italic>hDBP</italic> may be under autonomous control. To test for <italic>hDBP</italic> autonomy, mouse lines were generated with a transgene containing the <italic>hDBP</italic> gene along with extensive flanking sequences. Expression of this transgene was hepatic, robust and proportional to transgene copy number. DNase I hypersensitive site (HS) mapping revealed five liver-specific HS at the <italic>hDBP</italic> locus: HSI and HSIII at &#x02212;2.1 kb and &#x02212;0.13 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site, HSIV and HSV within intron 1 and HSVII located 3&#x02032; to the poly(A) site. A second transgene with minimal flanking sequences confirmed the sufficiency of these gene-proximal determinants for hepatic activation. The hepatic-specific HS aligned with segments of phylogenetically conserved non-coding sequences. These data demonstrate the autonomy of the <italic>hDBP</italic> locus and suggest that this control is mediated by chromatin-based locus control determinants in close proximity to, and within the transcription unit.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The <italic>vitamin D-binding protein</italic> (<italic>DBP</italic>) gene is robustly expressed in the livers of all mammalian species. In humans the hDBP protein (also known as Gc-globulin) is secreted from hepatocytes as a polymorphic glycoprotein that constitutes one of the most abundant serum proteins (232&#x02013;464 &#x000b5;g/ml) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). The major function of serum DBP is the binding and transport of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the major circulating form of vitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the most active vitamin D metabolite. DBP also binds tightly to monomeric G-actin, blocking the formation of F-actin networks that may occlude the vasculature following cellular damage. Several studies suggest that covalent derivatives of DBP have pivotal roles in the innate immune response by serving as a macrophage-activating factor and by enhancing C5a-mediated chemotaxis for macrophages and neutrophils [reviewed in ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>)]. DBP is predominantly produced in hepatocytes, although secondary minor sites of synthesis, such as the kidney, have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Due to its high-level of activity and its wide spectrum of functions, the <italic>DBP</italic> gene represents an important model for the analysis of hepatic gene expression.</p><p>DBP is a member of a family of four robustly expressed liver-specific genes. The conserved intron/exon organizations along with primary and secondary structural conservation of encoded proteins indicate a paralogous relationship of <italic>DBP</italic> to <italic>albumin</italic> (<italic>ALB</italic>), <italic>&#x003b1;-fetoprotein</italic> (<italic>AFP</italic>) and <italic>&#x003b1;-albumin/afamin</italic> (<italic>AFM</italic>). These four genes, formed by local duplications of a common progenitor gene, remain physically linked in the human and rodent genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Structural comparisons among these genes suggest that <italic>DBP</italic> was the oldest and most divergent member in this family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). The developmental profiles of these genes have been described. During rodent embryonic development, expression of <italic>ALB</italic>, <italic>AFP</italic> and <italic>DBP</italic> is induced in yolk sac and is maintained in fetal liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), whereas the hepatic expression of <italic>AFM</italic> is initiated in the perinatal period. <italic>AFP</italic> is selectively silenced at the end of the fetal period, whereas <italic>ALB, AFM</italic> and <italic>DBP</italic> maintain high constitutive levels of expression in adult liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). The molecular mechanisms for the transcriptional activation of these genes in the native hepatic chromatin environment, and for their respective developmental controls, have yet to be determined.</p><p>The close relationship among the four genes in the <italic>DBP-ALB</italic> cluster, and the fact that they are all expressed predominantly in liver, suggests that they may share one or more common <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory determinants. The possibility of shared regulatory control among these genes is supported by the identification of intergenic enhancers located between <italic>ALB</italic> and <italic>AFP</italic> that have the potential to regulate both gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Whether shared transcriptional control elements are more widely involved in this four-gene family has not been explored.</p><p>Models of regulatory elements controlling multi-gene families can be found in the locus control regions (LCRs) for the human and mouse <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> gene clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) and the human <italic>growth hormone</italic> gene cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). In these cases, sets of regulatory elements, located quite distant from target promoters, appear to act in concert to generate &#x02018;open&#x02019; chromatin structures or chromatin &#x02018;hubs&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) conducive to local promoter access and transcription initiation. In some cases, the genomic regions harboring regulatory elements can be located as much as 1 Mb from the target promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Such remote determinants can be located 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; of the target gene and in some cases can reside within the introns of unrelated neighboring gene(s) [reviewed ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>)]. The mechanistic basis for such long-range control is presently under study. Whether the <italic>DBP-ALB</italic> gene family is controlled by a common set of chromatin regulatory elements remains unknown. With the recent clarification of the genomic organization of the <italic>DBP-ALB</italic> multi-gene cluster, these questions can now be directly addressed.</p><p>A recently refined physical and meiotic map of the 4q11&#x02013;q13 region in the human genome reveals the organization of the cluster: centromere-3&#x02032;-<italic>DBP</italic>-5&#x02032;-5&#x02032;-<italic>ALB</italic>-3&#x02032;-5&#x02032;-<italic>AFP</italic>-3&#x02032;-5&#x02032;-<italic>AFM</italic>-3&#x02032;-telomere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Of particular note is the inverse transcriptional orientation and wide (&#x0003e;1.5 Mb) separation of the <italic>DBP</italic> gene from the other three more tightly clustered genes in the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) (GenBanK accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NT_006216">NT_006216</ext-link>). The rat <italic>DBP</italic> (<italic>rDBP</italic>) multi-gene cluster is located at 14p21&#x02013;p22 in chromosome14, a region syntenic to human chromosome 4, and the order and transcriptional orientation of each gene correspond to the human cluster. The distance between the <italic>rDBP</italic> gene and the remaining family members is also quite large (1.0 Mb) in rat (GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NW_047424">NW_047424</ext-link>). These data demonstrate that the organization, transcriptional orientation and expression patterns of the <italic>DBP</italic> multi-gene clusters in rat and human are highly conserved. Whereas the close juxtaposition of <italic>ALB</italic>, <italic>AFP</italic> and <italic>AFM</italic> is consistent with the presence of common transcriptional determinants, the substantial separation of <italic>DBP</italic> from the other members suggests an alternative model of autonomous control.</p><p>In the present report we test for autonomy of the <italic>DBP</italic> locus using two sets of transgenic mouse models. We further begin to explore its mechanistic basis by probing hepatic chromatin by DNase I mapping for sites of potential transfactor interactions. These studies indicate that determinants sufficient for establishment of an autonomous hepatic chromatin environment that supports robust <italic>hDBP</italic> expression <italic>in vivo</italic> are located in close proximity to, and within, the <italic>hDBP</italic> gene itself. In our transgenic setting, these locus control determinants are responsible for copy number dependent, site-of-integration independent, and robust tissue-specific expression of the <italic>hDBP</italic> locus. These data allow us to propose a model in which the <italic>hDBP</italic> gene is independently regulated by a dedicated LCR. It further implies that the <italic>DBP-ALB</italic> gene cluster has evolved into at least two separable chromatin units that maintain common liver specificity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Restriction and modification enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), Life Technologies (Rockville, MD), and Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN).

To optimize the possibility of including all necessary regulatory elements, a large genomic fragment was used as transgene. The <italic>hDBP</italic> gene encompasses 13 exons and spans 42 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Four human genomic PAC clones containing the entire <italic>hDBP</italic> gene were isolated from a PAC-recombinant library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Among them, PAC clone 231M2 carried a 105 kb human genomic fragment encompassing the entire <italic>hDBP</italic> gene along with 37 kb of 5&#x02032;-flanking region and 26 kb of 3&#x02032;-flanking region (<italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> transgene; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This insert was released from the PAC vector, microinjected into fertilized mouse oocytes, and five founders were obtained. Each founder was crossed with a CD1 mate to generate F1 transgenic mice and five <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> lines were established. The integrity of the transgene in each line was determined by extensive Southern blot analysis of F1 or F2 tail DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and data not shown). Transgene copy numbers ranged from 2 to 12 as determined by Southern blot after the transgene signal was normalized to the <italic>hDBP</italic> signal in total human (HeLa) DNA (two copies) and to the endogenous <italic>mouse</italic> &#x003b6;<italic>-globin</italic> signal as a loading control.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of the <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> transgene</title><p>The expression of the <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> transgene was assessed to determine whether the full complement of regulatory elements were included in this large transgene. A rigorous test of locus control was to determine whether these elements were able to establish a chromatin environment that was autonomous and independent of its site-of-insertion in the host genome. As background for these studies, it has been previously demonstrated that the endogenous <italic>rDBP</italic> locus is primarily expressed in the liver with 100- to 1000-fold lower levels observed in kidney, placenta/yolk sac, testis and abdominal fat and trace levels in intestine and spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Northern blot analyses of the <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> transgene detected high levels of human <italic>DBP</italic> mRNA in the liver of all lines, whereas signals of much lower intensity were consistently observed in the kidney (&#x0223c;2&#x02013;10% of liver) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, upper panel and summary table). Even lower levels were detected in the intestines of 3 of 5 lines (&#x0223c;0.6&#x02013;1.0% of liver), and sporadically in testes and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and data not shown). The expression profile of the endogenous mouse <italic>DBP</italic> gene (<italic>mDBP</italic>) was established in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, middle panel). Overall, the expression profile of the <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> transgene was consistent with that of the endogenous <italic>mDBP</italic> gene. These data indicated that the <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> transgene contains regulatory components sufficient to establish native patterns of expression and that the mouse has all the regulatory factors necessary to support the native expression pattern of the <italic>human DBP</italic> gene.</p><p>The ability of the <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> transgene to establish a fully productive and autonomous chromatin domain was further evaluated by determining the relationship between <italic>hDBP</italic> expression levels and <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> transgene copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). If the transgene contains locus control determinants sufficient to establish an autonomous chromatin domain, expression of the transgene at each independent insertion site should be directly related to transgene copy number. This was tested in the case of the <italic>hDBP</italic> transgene at both the levels of mRNA expression and protein production. <italic>hDBP</italic> mRNA levels in the livers of mice from each of the five <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> lines were quantified by northern analyses. Levels of <italic>hDBP</italic> mRNA were normalized to endogenous mouse <italic>ribosomal protein L32</italic> (<italic>mrpL32</italic>) mRNA as a loading control and divided by transgene copy numbers to generate an expression per transgene copy value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, autoradiograph). A tight correlation was observed among values from the five lines, lying within a 2-fold range. The correlation between transgene copy number and levels of gene expression was confirmed by analyses of serum hDBP protein levels. The serum hDBP levels/transgene copy number in adult mice from the five lines fell within a 3-fold range, ranging from 85&#x02013;233 &#x000b5;g/ml/copy. Remarkably, the levels of serum hDBP in these <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> mouse lines, when corrected for transgene copy number, approximated the range of normal human serum DBP levels (116&#x02013;232 &#x000b5;g/ml/copy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, graph). There was no evidence for sexual dimorphism of transgene expression (data not shown). These results demonstrated site-of-integration independent, copy number dependent and tissue-specific expression of the <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> transgene. This was consistent with the establishment of an autonomous chromatin domain by the transgene and furthermore was consistent with the presence of determinants that constitute a LCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Liver-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites (HS) are established at the <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> chromatin locus</title><p>The transgene expression studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>) indicated that determinants sufficient for establishment of a fully productive <italic>hDBP</italic> locus in native hepatic chromatin are encompassed within the <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> transgene. To identify candidate regions that contain the relevant LCR determinants, DNase I mapping was performed on the <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> transgenic liver chromatin. Regulatory sequences involved in such LCR function commonly localize to DNase I HS within the chromatin of expressing tissues [reviewed in ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>)]. With this tissue specificity in mind, chromatin from the brain (negative control) of <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> transgenic mice was also mapped with DNase I. A mapping approach was designed to cover the entire gene and its adjacent flanking regions. A representative analysis of the 26 kb BglI fragment that spans the 5&#x02032; terminus of the gene (from &#x02212;17.4 to +8.6 kb) is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). A probe hybridizing to the 3&#x02032; terminus of this fragment (probe P1) revealed two strong liver-specific DNase I HS and one weak brain-specific HS in the promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Higher resolution analyses of these HS were obtained by probing a 6.7 kb HindIII fragment spanning sequences &#x02212;3.0 to +3.7 kb (probe P2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This study confirmed the presence of the two liver-specific HS (HSI at &#x02212;2.1 kb and HSIII at &#x02212;0.13 kb) as well as the two additional HS specific to the brain (HSII-1 at &#x02212;1.8 kb and HSII-2 at &#x02212;1.5 kb).</p><p>DNase I mapping was extended throughout the <italic>hDBP</italic> gene and its 3&#x02032;-flanking region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and data not shown). These analyses detected four additional HS in liver: HSIV, HSV, HSVI and HSVII. HSIV and HSV are located within intron 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). The broader and stronger HSIV was composed of at least three sub-signals, located at map coordinates +10.3 kb to +10.9 kb. A weaker HSV was located at +12.2 kb. Two additional HS were observed at the 3&#x02032; terminus of the gene; HSVI (+42.7 kb) coincident with the polyA site was present in both liver and brain and hence was not liver-specific. In contrast HSVII (+43.9 kb), located immediately 3&#x02032; to HSVI, was liver-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The full HS mapping strategy and a summary of the results are shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>HSI is located &#x02212;2.1 kb relative to the site of <italic>hDBP</italic> transcriptional initiation. It is of note that the sequences corresponding to HSI as well as HSIII are highly conserved. Comparison of the sequences at HSI demonstrated over 80% identity between human and rodent [GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="L10641">L10641</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="L10642">L10642</ext-link> (human), <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="MW_047424">MW_047424</ext-link> (rat) and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NT_039308">NT_039308</ext-link> (mouse)], (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, upper). Such conservation of non-coding sequences in genomic alignments is a reliable indicator of regulatory determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). The proximity of HSI with HSIII suggested that the two might work in concert to coordinate <italic>hDBP</italic> promoter function. Genomic sequence alignments also revealed a remarkable conservation of non-coding sequences within intron 1. This conserved segment is coincident with the 1.9 kb region bracketed by HSIV and HSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, lower). Sequence comparisons of the human and rodent <italic>DBP</italic> loci demonstrated that HSVI and HSVII in the 3&#x02032; terminus region also correspond to segments with over 70% sequence similarity (data not shown). Thus, a set of liver-specific HS was identified at the <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> transgene locus in hepatic chromatin and these sites are coincident with segments of conserved non-coding sequences in the 5&#x02032;-flanking region, in intron 1, and in the 3&#x02032;-flanking region. This concordance of HS mapping and localized segments of phylogenetically conserved non-coding sequences supports functional roles for these regions in <italic>hDBP</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of <italic>51kb-hDBP</italic> transgenic mouse lines</title><p>Determinants involved in chromatin organization and LCR activity are characteristically located quite distant from a target gene.

To test whether these gene-proximal HS are sufficient for <italic>hDBP</italic> activation, a second set of mouse lines was generated using a transgene with minimal flanking sequences. This 51 kb genomic fragment, excised with NotI and FspI from the 123 kb human genomic PAC clone (<italic>PAC 45P24</italic>), encompassed the entire <italic>hDBP</italic> gene along with only 2.5 kb of 5&#x02032;-flanking and 6.5 kb of 3&#x02032;-flanking region (<italic>51kb-hDBP</italic> transgene; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Four transgenic founders were generated. Transgene integrity and copy numbers were determined for each line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Liver-specific and copy number dependent expression of the <italic>51kb-hDBP</italic> transgene</title><p>High-level <italic>hDBP</italic> mRNA expression was detected in the livers of all four <italic>51kb-hDBP</italic> transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> autoradiograph and data not shown). <italic>hDBP</italic> mRNA was also detected by northern blot analysis at trace levels in the kidneys of two of the four <italic>51kb-hDBP</italic> lines (0.05 and 0.04% of expression levels in livers, respectively); in the remaining two <italic>51kb-hDBP</italic> lines expression in the kidney could not be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> table and data not shown). Serum hDBP levels in the four <italic>51kb-hDBP</italic> lines varied by less than 3-fold (80&#x02013;189 &#x000b5;g/ml/transgene copy), indicating copy number dependent expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These levels were remarkably similar to those observed in the sera of <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> transgenic mice and similarly approximate the levels of expression of the native <italic>hDBP</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These data demonstrated that the <italic>51kb-hDBP</italic> transgene, containing only 2.5 kb of 5&#x02032;-flanking region and 6.5 kb of 3&#x02032;-flanking region, was able to overcome site-of-integration position effects and direct high levels of liver-specific <italic>hDBP</italic> gene expression from multiple random integration sites in transgenic mouse chromatin. In addition, we note a selective loss of <italic>hDBP</italic> transgene expression in the kidneys of the <italic>51kb-hDBP</italic> mice when compared with the <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> transgene, suggesting that expression in the kidney may rely on a distinct set of determinants.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the present report we have tested for autonomous regulation of the <italic>hDBP</italic> gene and have sought sites in the native hepatic chromatin that might encompass relevant regulatory elements. Many transgenes are not consistently or accurately expressed in the mouse due to the exclusion of determinants that are necessary to re-establish the native chromatin environment. Thus these transgenes are sensitive to the major influences, both positive and negative, at the foreign site-of-integration in the host (mouse) genome. An LCR is defined by its ability to re-establish a chromatin environment that is dominant over site-of-integration effects. Thus the LCR action allows the transgene to be expressed at a consistent level when compared among multiple lines, each representing a unique insertion site. The initial approach in our study was to introduce the <italic>hDBP</italic> gene with extensive flanking sequences into the mouse genome and determine whether it could establish an appropriate pattern and level of gene expression. The results clearly demonstrated that this was the case. The pattern of expression of the <italic>hDBP</italic> transgene encompassing 37 kb of 5&#x02032;-flanking sequences and 26 kb of 3&#x02032;-flanking sequences (<italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> transgene) paralleled that of the endogenous <italic>DBP</italic> locus. This result represents the analysis of five independent lines. Not only was the robust expression primarily restricted to the liver, but the major secondary site of <italic>DBP</italic> expression in the kidney was also preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Of particular note, the level of transgene expression, when monitored at the protein level and normalized to transgene copy number, was remarkably consistent and similar to that of DBP levels in human serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, the <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> transgene was expressed in a site-of-insertion independent and copy number dependent manner, at full levels, and with appropriate tissue specificity. From these data we concluded that the determinants sufficient to establish an autonomous and fully active chromatin locus capable of supporting full and accurate <italic>hDBP</italic> expression are within and/or closely linked to the <italic>hDBP</italic> gene. These determinants fulfill the operational definition of an LCR.</p><p>The second phase of the study was to map the determinants involved in the activation of the <italic>hDBP</italic> gene in hepatic chromatin. LCR determinants commonly map to sites of DNase I hypersensitivity (HS) in the chromatin of expressing cells. These HS reflect the localized displacement of histones or perturbation in chromatin structure by trans-acting factors binding at the site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Core elements that have been defined at individual HS are usually composed of arrays of multiple tissue-specific and ubiquitous transcription factor-binding sites [reviewed in ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>)]. With this in mind, the <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> transgene locus was mapped for HS in hepatic tissue as well as in brain, a non-expressing tissue. A set of five liver-specific HS was identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). HSI and HSIII are located at &#x02212;2.1 and &#x02212;0.13 kb relative to the <italic>hDBP</italic> promoter, respectively, whereas HSIV and HSV are closely juxtaposed within a 1.9 kb region of intron 1 (10.3&#x02013;10.9 kb and 12.2 kb, respectively). HSVII maps to a site 1.5 kb 3&#x02032; to the poly(A) addition site. HSVI, although detected in liver, was also present in brain chromatin and thus not tissue-specific. To support the sufficiency of these elements to activate of <italic>hDBP</italic>, we assessed the expression of a second transgene with minimal flanking sequences just long enough to encompass the full set of identified HS. High-level, copy number dependent and liver-specific expression of this shorter <italic>51kb</italic>-<italic>hDBP</italic> transgene was observed in all four <italic>51kb-hDBP</italic> transgenic lines. These results suggested that all determinants necessary for the establishment of a fully functional chromatin locus are present within the <italic>51kb-hDBP</italic> transgene. These data support a model in which the set of determinants identified by the HS mapping constitute a liver-specific <italic>hDBP</italic> LCR and are sufficient for <italic>hDBP</italic> activation in the transgenic setting.</p><p>The exact structure and mode of action of the determinants at each of the HS remains to be established. Our prior assays in cell transfection systems had identified three functional HNF1-binding sites within the proximal 2 kb of the rat <italic>DBP</italic> gene (<italic>rDBP</italic>) 5&#x02032;-flanking region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). The region from &#x02212;65 to &#x02212;41 bp, the &#x02018;A segment&#x02019;, is the most proximal HNF1-binding site. Two more distal HNF1-binding sites, located in segments &#x02018;B&#x02019; and &#x02018;F-2&#x02019; (coordinates at &#x02212;254 to &#x02212;140 bp and &#x02212;1844 to &#x02212;1621 kb, respectively), function as classical enhancer elements. The B and F-2 segments both increase the activity of homologous and heterologous promoters when assayed in transfected HepG2 liver-derived cells. HNF1-&#x003b1; played a predominant role in the observed enhancer function. At the B and F-2 sites the HNF1&#x003b2; protein showed a trans-dominant negative effect on HNF1&#x003b1;-stimulated activity of the <italic>rDBP</italic> promoter suggesting that the relative levels of HNF1&#x003b1; and HNF1&#x003b2; in various tissues might contribute, in part, to tissue-specific expression of <italic>DBP in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). HSIII, detected in the present study, is located between the two HNF1-binding sites corresponding to the A and B binding sites described in the <italic>rDBP</italic> proximal promoter. This suggests that the formation of HSIII reflects local promoter complex assembly. HSIII is co-located to a highly conserved region among human, mouse and rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The detection of HSIII in this region supports the previous conclusion that the two HNF1-binding sites in the proximal promoter are critical elements for <italic>hDBP</italic> activation.</p><p>A comparison of the current studies with previous analyses of <italic>ALB</italic> and <italic>AFP</italic> genes highlights points of potential interest. Consistent with other numerous model systems, transgenic studies at the mouse <italic>ALB</italic> locus have revealed that the promoter region is insufficient for robust and consistent transgene expression. These studies identified a transcriptional enhancer located 10 kb upstream of the transcription start site that is essential for full liver-specific expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). This element co-maps with a strong liver-specific HS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated that this enhancer can trigger the activation of a compacted chromatin template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). Analysis of the mouse <italic>AFP</italic> gene has identified three enhancer elements at &#x02212;2.5, &#x02212;5.0 and &#x02212;6.5 kb relative to the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). All three sites were required to achieve high-level expression of <italic>ALB</italic> in fetal liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). In contrast to these findings for the <italic>ALB</italic> and <italic>AFP</italic> genes, the current report reveals that the <italic>hDBP</italic> transgene is robustly activated <italic>in vivo</italic> in the absence of remote flanking determinants. These data along with the HS mapping raise the possibility that HSIV, possibly in concert with the substantially weaker HSV, mediates enhancer functions comparable to the distal enhancers far upstream of <italic>ALB</italic> or <italic>AFP</italic> promoter. In light of other studies in the literature, the intronic location of HSIV and HSV is fully compatible with their functioning as dominant locus control element(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). The broad and multipartite structure of HSIV is consistent with multiple arrays of transcription factor-binding sites, a composition common among LCR elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its expression in the liver, human and rodent <italic>DBPs</italic> are also expressed at substantially lower levels in several secondary sites. The most prominent and well described of these is in the kidney. The local expression of <italic>DBP</italic> in the kidney may be important in vitamin D recycling via interactions with the renal scavenger protein megalin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>). While the transcriptional initiation site for <italic>hDBP</italic> in the two tissues appears to be identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), it is likely that the complex of determinants driving expression in this secondary site differ from those in the liver. The <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> transgene paralleled the endogenous <italic>mDBP</italic> with respect to kidney expression; <italic>hDBP</italic> expression was observed at considerable levels (&#x0223c;2&#x02013;10% of liver) in the kidneys of all five <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> lines. In contrast, kidney expression of the more truncated <italic>51kb-hDBP</italic> transgene was sporadic while liver expression remained robust and consistent. We have generated a single transgenic mouse line carrying a 123 kb insert of PAC clone <italic>45P24</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This transgene has the same 5&#x02032; terminus as the <italic>51kb-hDBP</italic> at &#x02212;2.5 kb as well as a more extensive 78 kb 3&#x02032;-flanking region. The tissue distribution of <italic>hDBP</italic> expression from this transgene by Northern blots showed robust liver expression and an absence of expression in the kidney (data not shown). These results suggest that one or more important elements for kidney <italic>hDBP</italic> expression are located in the region between +37 kb and +2.5 kb upstream from the transcription start site. Whether these elements will constitute a kidney-specific element of the <italic>hDBP</italic> LCR remains to be determined.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that elements critical to hepatic activation of the <italic>hDBP</italic> gene and establishment of a fully autonomous chromatin domain are located in close proximity to, and within the <italic>hDBP</italic> gene. The combination of transgenic studies, HS mapping and phylogenetic sequence comparisons establish a model in which HSI, HSIII, HSIV, HSV and HSVII constitute components of a liver-specific LCR. How each element contributes to this activity can now be further explored. These data further establish a functional independence of <italic>hDBP</italic> from the other members of its cluster. This suggests that critical elements that trigger the hepatic expression of these genes have duplicated during evolution and are represented at multiple sites within the cluster. It remains possible, that at some higher level of nuclear organization, these elements may interact to facilitate and coordinate their respective developmental profiles.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge funding from the NIH (Grant R01 GM32035 to N.E.C. and S.A.L.), and to thank Dr. Jean Richa and the Transgenic and Chimeric Mouse Core of the University of Pennsylvania (NIH P30 DK50306, P30 DK019525 and P30 CA016520) and the Center for Molecular Studies in Digestive and Liver Diseases for the generation of transgenic lines.

A series of five transgenic mouse lines were obtained. The transgene copy numbers were determined in the F1 generation of each line by Southern blot analysis.

The lower diagram shows the 4.0 kb SacI fragment expected to hybridize to the probe, as well as the location of this cDNA probe. The transgene-specific bands (4.0 kb, indicated by arrow) were quantified by phosphorimaging. Transgene copy numbers were estimated by normalizing these signals to those from human genomic DNA (HeLa cell; two endogenous copies).

The autoradiograph shows a Northern blot surveying a set of tissues from a representative <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> transgenic line (mouse line 6). RNAs from the indicated tissues and control RNA from wild-type mouse liver (WT) were analyzed. The Northern blot was hybridized with an hDBP cDNA fragment and then with a mouse ribosomal protein L32 (mrpL32) cDNA fragment to normalize for RNA loading. The hDBP cDNA probe was specific for the human DBP mRNA and did not cross-hybridize to the mouse DBP mRNA. The blot was stripped then re-hybridized with rat DBP cDNA to detect the cross-hybridizing, endogenous mouse DBP mRNA. The <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> transgene was expressed predominantly in the livers and at lower level in the kidney of each line. The table summarizes the tissue distribution of transgene expression in an adult male mouse of each transgenic line (-; no signal detected).

Northern blots containing liver RNA from the five <italic>105kb-hDBP</italic> transgenic lines were hybridized with <italic>hDBP</italic> cDNA and then <italic>mrpL32</italic> cDNA. Three animals from each line were analyzed and a representative Northern blot is shown. <italic>hDBP</italic> mRNA was quantified for each line and normalized to the <italic>mrpL32</italic> signal to correct for RNA loading. The corrected <italic>hDBP</italic> expression value was divided by transgene copy number and the mean ratio for line 1 was arbitrarily set to 1.0. The ratios from the remaining lines were normalized to line 1 and were plotted on the bar graph (&#x000b1;SD). All quantifications were done by phosphoimager analysis and all were in the linear range of detection (Materials and Methods). There were no statistically significant differences among the lines when hDBP expression was normalized to transgene copy number. A radial immunodiffusion assay was used to quantify levels of serum hDBP in each transgenic line. The serum hDBP levels per transgene copy number were plotted in the bottom panel using a logarithmic scale. The results demonstrated that the liver hDBP mRNA and serum hDBP levels were remarkably consistent from line to line in a copy number dependent fashion.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl174f2"/></fig><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Two liver-specific DNase I HS are present 5&#x02032; to the <italic>hDBP</italic> gene.
