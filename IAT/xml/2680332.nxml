Heterozygous mutations in the cohesin regulator <italic>NIPBL</italic> or cohesin structural components <italic>SMC1A</italic> and <italic>SMC3</italic> result in the multisystem developmental disorder Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS). Genome-wide assessment of transcription in 16 mutant cell lines from severely affected CdLS probands has identified a unique profile of dysregulated gene expression that was validated in an additional 101 samples and correlates with phenotypic severity. This profile could serve as a diagnostic and classification tool. Cohesin binding analysis demonstrates a preference for intergenic regions suggesting a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory function mimicking that of a boundary/insulator interacting protein. However, the binding sites are enriched within the promoter regions of the dysregulated genes and are significantly decreased in CdLS proband, indicating an alternative role of cohesin as a transcription factor.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Appropriate segregation of chromosomes to daughter cells depends upon proper cohesion of sister chromatids during mitosis. The multiprotein cohesin complex and its regulators are key factors in this process. Intriguingly, recent work has shown that the cohesin complex also has other cellular roles, including a role in regulating gene expression. Additionally, mutations in cohesin structural and regulatory components have been linked to human multisystem developmental disorders such as Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), but the role cohesin is playing in the pathogenesis of this disorder is unknown. To define the role that cohesin plays in regulating gene expression in human cells, we analyzed gene expression and genome-wide cohesin binding patterns in cells from normal subjects and from CdLS probands with mutations in the cohesin regulator <italic>NIPBL</italic> or in the cohesin structural component <italic>SMC1A</italic>. We found a strikingly conserved pattern of gene dysregulation in these different cell lines that correlates with disease severity and a significant correlation between gene dysregulation and cohesin binding around misexpressed genes. The observed pattern of binding and misexpression is consistent with cohesin having a putative role as a boundary/insulator interacting protein or transcription factor, the activity of which is disrupted in CdLS probands.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cohesin is an evolutionally conserved multisubunit protein complex consisting of an SMC1A and SMC3 heterodimer, and at least two non-SMC proteins SCC1 (also known as RAD21 or MCD1) and SCC3 (also known as SA or STAG).

To study the effects of disruption of cohesin on gene expression in human cells we have utilized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from individuals with CdLS that harbor known heterozygous mutations in the cohesin regulator NIPBL and cohesin structural component SMC1A and applied a genome-wide approach to analyze gene transcription and cohesin binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Specific Genes Are Differentially Expressed in CdLS Probands with <italic>NIPBL</italic> Mutations</title><p>LCLs from 16 severely affected CdLS probands with <italic>NIPBL</italic> protein-truncating mutations as well as 17 age, gender, and race matched healthy controls were used as training samples for assays on the Affymetrix HG-U133 plus 2.0 expression arrays, six additional individuals including one CdLS proband, one healthy control, two RBS probands (a related cohesinopathy), and two Alagille syndrome (AGS) probands (an unrelated multisystem dominant developmental disorder caused by disruption in the Notch signaling pathway) served as testing samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000119.s005">Table S1A and S1B</xref>). 27,995 probe sets (12,740 nonredundant genes) were considered to be expressed in human LCLs. Unsupervised sample clustering by principle component analysis (PCA) of all the expressed probe sets was able to separate probands from controls in the training set indicating these two groups have different gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000119-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

The top 400 probe sets were selected on each of the 33 rounds that corresponded to an FDR&#x02248;0.01. The left-out samples were successfully classified into two distinct groups using nearest centroid method with the exception of two controls and one proband that were misclassified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000119-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

Nearest centroid classification method was further performed on the six testing samples based on the identified 420 probe sets (FDR&#x0003c;0.01). The one healthy control and two individuals with AGS were classified as controls; one CdLS and two RBS probands were classified as probands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000119-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000119.s008">Table S4</xref>). RBS is due to the mutations in the <italic>ESCO2</italic> gene that also regulates cohesin, whereas AGS is an independent genetic disorder due primarily to mutations in the <italic>JAG1</italic> gene, a member of the Notch signaling pathway. Thus, although limited to only two samples, it appears that RBS shares a similar transcription profile with CdLS, consistent with these two disorders being caused by disruption of the cohesin pathway. It is of interest that whereas the two RBS probands were classified as CdLS, their discriminant scores (DS) were actually midway between the scores of CdLS probands and the controls suggesting RBS might have an intermediate transcription profile to CdLS and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000119-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Specific Gene Expression Is Tightly Associated with Phenotypic Severity among Different Groups of CdLS Probands</title><p>Clustering-based feature selection was carried out on the 339 nonredundant genes (420 probe sets, FDR&#x0003c;0.01) to identify independent pathways or functional groups.

Detailed analysis is described in Text S1. A 23-gene classifier can be used to categorize CdLS probands with <italic>NIPBL</italic> mutations from the rest of the samples including non-CdLS, CdLS probands with <italic>SMC1A</italic> mutations, and CdLS probands without an identifiable gene mutation. This indicates that the expression of these 23 genes is tightly correlated to <italic>NIPBL</italic> function. To improve the generality of the classifier, we randomly selected 15 mild probands with <italic>NIPBL</italic> mutations as a new training group. Expression of ten of the 23 genes was significantly different between this group and the original 17 controls and was also capable of subclassifying all CdLS probands from non-CdLS controls, regardless of the gene mutations or clinical presentations of the probands. This suggests that expression of these ten genes is affected by a CdLS specific disease process. For both classifications, the expression levels of the classifier genes are tightly correlated to disease severity. A clear progression of increasing discriminant scores (DS) can be seen from healthy controls through mild, moderate, and severe CdLS probands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000119-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>).

Because of our inability to identify an effective antibody with high specificity against NIPBL or SMC1A, we chose an antibody against RAD21 (one of the other key components of the cohesin complex) to map genome-wide cohesin binding sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using a polyclonal antibody against human RAD21 was performed and products were hybridized on Affymatrix 2.0 tiling arrays. The score of model-based analysis of tiling-arrays algorithm (MAT) was calculated and probes were mapped to genomic positions. Peaks representing genomic regions bound by hRAD21 were identified with a <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> and FDR&#x0003c;0.01.</p><p>The 54,675 probe sets on Affymetrix HG-U133 plus 2.0 expression array can be unambiguously mapped to 15,162 unique RefSeq mRNAs including 10,378 transcribed and 4,784 nontranscribed genes in LCLs. 78&#x00025; of the 15,162 mapped genes do not harbor intragenic cohesin sites (Here, &#x0201c;intragenic&#x0201d; means genomic region from the transcription start site &#x0005b;TSS&#x0005d; of a gene to the transcription termination site &#x0005b;TTS&#x0005d; of the same gene), and cohesin binds at variable distances outside those genes. 22&#x00025; of the 15,162 mapped genes harbor intragenic cohesin sites, this number is reduced to 19.0&#x00025; in the silent nontranscribed genes (<italic>p</italic>&#x02264;7.2e&#x02212;6) and no change in the disease neutral genes (22.9&#x00025;, <italic>p</italic>&#x02264;0.0864); on the contrary, more of the differentially expressed genes harbor cohesin sites (27.0&#x00025;, <italic>p</italic>&#x02264;7.44e&#x02212;5) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://145.18.230.98/Service/Statistics/Binomial_proportions.html">http://145.18.230.98/Service/Statistics/Binomial_proportions.html</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000119.s014">Table S10</xref>) suggesting a correlation between intragenic cohesin binding and gene expression. For the 22&#x00025; of genes with intragenic cohesin sites, cohesin preferentially binds to a narrowed region surrounding the TSSs or the TTSs with frequency at the TTSs only half of that at the TSSs. The 100-kb regions spanning upstream and downstream of the genes have only background levels of cohesin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000119-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). Among controls, the degree of cohesin binding within &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 1 kb of the TSSs is greatest for those genes that are actively transcribed and especially in those genes that are differentially expressed in the <italic>NIPBL</italic> mutant cell lines, whereas the silent nontranscribed genes have the same, or lower level, of enrichment as the background level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000119-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition, cohesin binding is enriched at the 5&#x02032;-UTRs only for actively transcribed genes, with no binding difference at exons, introns, or 3&#x02032;-UTRs between the actively transcribed and silent genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000119-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Identification of overrepresented cohesin binding near promoters suggests that cohesin may regulate gene expression as a transcription factor. In spite of this, the majority of the expressed genes (78&#x00025;) do not harbor any cohesin binding sites in their intragenic regions, indicating most of the genes in the human genome may be regulated by cohesin independent pathways or cohesin is involved in their expression regulation through an alterative mechanism. We further evaluated 13 genomic loci based on their gene expression alterations to validate their cohesin binding status by the more sensitive method of ChIP-quantitative PCR (qPCR). Out of these 13 loci, two regions are equally bound by cohesin in both healthy and CdLS cells, two regions are not bound by cohesin in either healthy or CdLS cells, and the remaining nine loci demonstrated significant loss of cohesin binding in CdLS cells as compared to control cells. The ChIP-qPCR results are consistent with cohesin binding alterations detected by ChIP array studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000119.s002">Figure S2A and S2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000119.s015">Table S11</xref>).</p><fig id="pbio-1000119-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000119.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Cohesin binding analyzed in 15,162 unique transcripts demonstrates preferential binding to TSSs and TTSs.</title><p>(A) The frequency of cohesin binding has a sharp peak around TSS and falls to the background level upstream of this peak.

In CdLS, only 376 such genes have cohesin sites around their TSSs (376 versus 666, reduced by 43.5&#x00025;), only 53 of the 107 differentially expressed genes still maintain their TSS/cohesin association, whereas the rest have all lost their TSS cohesin binding sites (53 versus 107, reduced by 50.5&#x00025;) in the proband (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000119-t002">Table 2</xref>).

The binding between cohesin and TSSs of expressed genes is highly correlated to the CdLS phenotype.

By quantitative PCR assays, the enrichment of cohesin bound to site 1 was not found to be changed between controls and the probands, which is consistent with the array findings.

Out of the 339 genes with FDR&#x0003c;0.01, 150 genes are documented in cancer, neurological, hematological, skeletal and muscular, and dermatological diseases; 150 genes are identified as major players in embryonic and tissue development, hematological and immune system development and functions; in addition, 153 genes have well established cellular and molecular functions in cell death, cell proliferation, and cell cycle regulation. We have further analyzed the biological functions and canonical pathways mediated by the 23- and 10-gene classifiers and the three biomarkers as validated by target array (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000119.s016">Table S12</xref>). Interestingly, more than 60&#x00025; (15 out of 23) of the identifier genes harbor intragenic cohesin binding sites, which is much higher than the average genome level (22&#x00025;). Moreover, some of these genes have completely lost their cohesin association in CdLS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000119.s016">Table S12</xref>). Both groups of classifier genes are tightly related to pathways of cell death, cellular development, and tissue morphology. 12 out of these 23 genes are involved in 47 known biological functions or disease conditions. Five of these 12 genes are also part of the 10-gene classifier, including two genes, <italic>NFATC2</italic> and <italic>PAPSS2,</italic> which are the identified biomarkers for CdLS. The 23-gene classifier could differentiate CdLS probands with <italic>NIPBL</italic> mutations suggesting the expression of these 23 genes are tightly controlled by NIPBL; whereas the 10-gene classifier is less powerful and only able to identify CdLS probands without the ability to differentiate subgroups of probands with different gene mutations, suggesting that these ten genes are related to terminal events during CdLS pathogenesis. Therefore, the common five genes, <italic>PAPSS2</italic>, <italic>NFATC2</italic>, <italic>MAP3K5</italic>, <italic>LTB</italic>, and <italic>PHF16</italic>, which are involved in multiple reported events by IPA and are shared by the two classifiers, might be involved in cellular functions that are universally affected in CdLS. Presumably mutations in <italic>NIPBL</italic>, <italic>SMC1A</italic>, or <italic>SMC3</italic>, or as of yet unidentified CdLS causing gene mutations, will all result in alterations of the related biological functions controlled by these five genes.

Four genes, <italic>PAPSS2</italic>, <italic>NFATC2</italic>, <italic>MAP3K5</italic>, <italic>ADCY1</italic>, were identified to be involved in 32 canonical pathways by IPA; they also regulate multiple biological functions as mentioned above. <italic>ADCY1</italic> is the single gene out of the above four genes that exists in the 23-gene classifier but is excluded from the 10-gene classifier; thus the specific canonical pathways regulated by <italic>ADCY1</italic> (i.e. B cell receptor signaling, RAR activation, sulfur metabolism, and endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways), could largely depend on normal functions of NIPBL.

We chose to use an easily accessible but a seemingly developmentally irrelevant tissue, LCLs, for these studies. We hypothesized that congenital genetic disorders might arise, in part, through dysregulation of expression of specific genes and that expression differences between affected and unaffected individuals might be present in tissues other than disease presenting tissues. These cells also provide an invaluable resource of naturally occurring mutant cohesin proteins (both structural and regulatory components of cohesin) that can be used to study the cellular processes regulated by this complex and specifically the impact on regulation of gene expression. Surprisingly these cells may also provide valuable insight into human developmental processes as well.</p><p>We have identified specific gene expression profiles for CdLS that are capable of classifying probands and tightly correlate with disease severity. Cohesin preferentially binds to promoter regions of the actively expressed genes suggesting a role as a general transcription factor. These binding sites are significantly reduced in <italic>NIPBL</italic> mutant CdLS samples. This result is likely due to NIPBL's direct role in cohesin loading on chromatin, which in turn affects transcriptional regulation at specific loci and would contribute to the CdLS pathogenesis. Out of the 339 dysregulated genes with FDR&#x0003c;0.01, 202 were upregulated (59.6&#x00025;) and 137 were downregulated (40.4&#x00025;), more genes were reactivated than inhibited with mutations in <italic>NIPBL</italic> (59.6&#x00025; versus 40.4&#x00025;, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3.44e&#x02212;17) suggesting that NIPBL and cohesin can result in both negative (as transcriptional repression) and positive (as transcriptional activation) effects on expression. A similar percentage of upregulated and downregulated genes was also observed among the 1,501 dysregulated genes with FDR&#x0003c;0.05. Moreover, 71 of the above 339 genes (20.9&#x00025;) and 207 of the 1501 genes (13.8&#x00025;) have fold changes larger than 1.5, whereas the highest fold changes are &#x02212;4.2 and &#x0002b;4.6, respectively. Although the majority of expression levels seemed only mildly perturbed, developmental deficits in CdLS are likely due to a cumulative change in multiple genes. Another reason for less remarkable expression differences could be the LCL tissue type used for this study, with bigger fold changes in more genes possibly present in more directly affected tissues of, e.g., brain or limb, and at specific times during embryonic development. However, it is also possible that the transcriptional dysregulation may be directly mediated by <italic>NIPBL</italic> through a yet uncharacterized mechanism and the reduced cohesin binding may be a secondary effect. In our study, a 30&#x00025; reduction in NIPBL message was able to trigger a 29.7&#x00025; (9,530 versus 13,560) reduction in cohesin binding sites in CdLS probands and further affects the transcription of specific genes.</p><p>The central components for sister chromatid cohesion, <italic>RAD21 (SCC1)</italic>, <italic>SMC1A</italic>, <italic>SMC3</italic>, <italic>STAG2</italic>, <italic>ESCO1</italic>, <italic>ESCO2</italic>, and <italic>PDS5A</italic> (also known as <italic>SCC-112</italic>), are all expressed similarly between controls and CdLS probands with <italic>NIPBL</italic> mutations. However, <italic>STAG1</italic>, <italic>PDS5B</italic> (also known as <italic>APRIN</italic>), <italic>MAU2L (KIA0892)</italic>, as well as several other genes with functions related to sister chromatid cohesion were significantly dysregulated in <italic>NIPBL</italic> mutant CdLS probands (FDR&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000119.s017">Table S13</xref>), suggesting that the cohesin pathway itself is affected by mutant NIPBL. <italic>MAU2 (KIAA0892)</italic> is the putative human homolog of <italic>scc4</italic> in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000119-Seitan1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000119-Watrin1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. It forms an essential loading complex with NIPBL that regulates cohesin-chromatin association, sister-chromatid pairing, and mitotic checkpoints in HeLa cells.

This finding indicates a subset of genes regulated by NIPBL are tightly involved in sister chromosome segregation events, but expression alteration may be required to pass a certain threshold in order to induce visible cohesion defects. This observation could explain why cell lines derived from CdLS probands did not demonstrate significant sister chromatid pairing problems. In contrast to CdLS, cohesion defects have been reported in three human developmental disorders: RBS (OMIM 268300) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000119-Vega1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, Rothmund&#x02013;Thomson syndrome (RTS, OMIM 268400) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000119-Mann1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, and &#x003b1;-Thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome, X-linked (ATRX, OMIM 301040) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000119-Ritchie1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.

The fact that both of these genes were also significantly dysregulated (FDR&#x0003c;0.05) in CdLS probands with <italic>NIBPL</italic> mutations indicates that NIPBL may first affect cohesin proteins and subsequently dysregulate cohesin targets. Surprisingly, we did not find that cohesin directly binds to these two genes in the cell line studied, which raises the possibility that cohesin may regulate their expression over long distances. When comparing ChIP-on-chip results for Nipped-B and/or SMC1A binding sites in three different <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000119-Misulovin1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, homologs of 20 differentially expressed human genes in CdLS probands (FDR&#x0003c;0.05) were also found to be bound by NIPBL and cohesin (unpublished data). Eight of these 20 genes are also bound by cohesin in humans suggesting they may be cohesin targets in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and humans. It also suggests that cohesin mediated transcription is a conserved biological event. Moreover, most of the binding sites were lost in CdLS cells indicating dysregulated gene expression correlates with loss of cohesin binding. Among the eight genes, <italic>KMO</italic>, <italic>ELL2</italic>, and <italic>ARHGAP17</italic> have cohesin binding at TSSs; <italic>ROBO1</italic>, <italic>UBE2H</italic>, <italic>MED13L</italic>, <italic>RASA3</italic>, and <italic>PDPK1</italic> had cohesin binding within intronic regions. One of these genes, <italic>ROBO1</italic> (homolog of <italic>lea</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), is of particular interest as it was found to have a fold change of 4.6, which is the largest among all the genes on the array. <italic>ROBO1</italic> has been associated with dyslexia, a neurocognitive disorder of language and graphic processing that could be due to the abnormal migration and maturation of neurons during early development.</p><p>We have identified groups of 23, 10, and 3 genes as CdLS classifiers or biomarkers that are capable of differentiating CdLS from non-CdLS samples. The expression levels of these genes also correlate to the phenotypic severity of this disorder, although it is not clear at this time how the dysregulation of these particular genes might contribute to the phenotypes. More than 60&#x00025; of the identifier genes harbor intragenic cohesin binding sites with some of them lost in CdLS proband. The obvious overrepresentation of genes carrying intragenic cohesin binding sites among the CdLS classifier genes further suggests that expression of the dysregulated genes is tightly related to the availability of cohesin binding. Overall, the majority of genes do not carry known cohesin binding sites, indicating that cohesin may play an upstream role in regulating human genes, or cohesin may enact regulation on some of the genes through distal <italic>cis</italic>- or <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory elements. The potential role for cohesin independent NIPBL regulation can not be excluded.</p><p>Cohesin has recently been found to be physically and functionally associated with the vertebrate insulator protein CTCF. In our study cohesin binds to only &#x0223c;20&#x00025; of genes intragenically. This distribution does not change much between expressed genes and silent genes, and between differentially expressed genes in CdLS and disease neutral genes. Cohesin could be involved in gene regulation, like CTCF, by either binding to promoter elements and having a direct influence on the transcriptional machinery or by binding to intergenic <italic>cis</italic>-elements such as insulators to control gene expression from remote distances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000119-Gombert1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.

Reduced cohesin binding at this locus was further validated in three additional CdLS probands by the more sensitive ChIP-qPCR including probands with either <italic>NIPBL</italic> mutations or cohesin subunit <italic>SMC1A</italic> mutation. However, cohesin does not exactly mimic the function of CTCF, at least in LCLs.

Additional quantitative analysis or ChIP-qPCR to study more genomic loci will delineate a clearer picture of cohesin and CTCF effects on transcriptional regulation.

On the basis of our data and previously reported studies, we propose that NIPBL may be involved in modulating cohesin function through various mechanisms. Besides its canonical role in regulating sister chromatid segregation proposed by Haering et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000119-Haering2">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000119-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), cohesin may also regulate transcription (1) as an insulator protein by acting alone or with CTCF, or (2) as a transcription factor by binding to promoter elements. While regulating transcription, NIPBL may also serve as a cohesin shuttle to chromatin that leads to decreased cohesin binding when NIPBL is mutated. Data from this study are quite consistent with this role. Whether this loading mechanism either partially overlaps with, or is completely independent from NIPBL-mediated sister chromatid cohesion remains unknown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000119-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). NIPBL and cohesin may very well form one protein complex binding to regulatory elements of target genes, with NIPBL mutations affecting the regulatory capacity of this complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000119-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).

Samples are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000119.s005">Table S1A and S1B</xref> with detailed description. For custom array analysis, detailed information of these samples is listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000119.s011">Table S7</xref>. Out of these 101 samples of European descent, the training set included 17 healthy controls and 14 severely affected CdLS probands with <italic>NIPBL</italic> protein-truncating mutations. All 31 samples were also used for the training in Affymatrix array analysis. For the testing set, all new samples were selected, which included four healthy controls, six severely affected probands, 13 moderately affected probands (nine have <italic>NIPBL</italic> mutations and four do not have an identifiable mutation), and 34 mildly affected probands (26 have <italic>NIPBL</italic> mutations and eight do not have an identifiable mutation). We have also included nine CdLS probands with <italic>SMC1A</italic> mutations, as well as four samples with different genetic diagnoses (two AGS, one Roberts syndrome, and one unknown multisystem genetic disorder). As above, samples were processed anonymously and randomly.</p><p>5&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> exponentially growing cells were seeded in 15 ml media in a 75-ml Falcon flask, and fed exactly after 24 h. After an additional 24 h on day 3, 8 ml of the media was removed and cells were pelleted by centrifuge and RNA extraction was performed immediately.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>RNA Isolation and Affymatrix Expression Array Hybridization</title><p>Total RNA from each sample was extracted with the RNeasy Mini-kit (Qiagen), synthesis of double-stranded cDNA was performed using SuperScript Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen), and cleaned up with GeneChip Sample Cleanup module (Affymetrix). The resulting products were then used to synthesize biotin-labeled cRNA with Enzo Bioarray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling kit (Enzo Life Sciences) and further fragmented to 35&#x02013;200-bp oligos. All procedures were done according to manufacturer's instructions. 30 &#x000b5;l fragmented cRNA at the concentration of 500 ng/&#x000b5;l was sent for hybridization in the microarray facility at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Microarray hybridizations were performed by using HG-U133 plus 2.0 GeneChips (Affymetrix). The HG-U133 plus 2.0 contains &#x0223c;54,000 25-mer probe sets that covers approximately 47,000 transcripts and variants out of which 38,500 are well-characterized human genes.

Probe designing, RNA labeling, and hybridization were conducted using the Ziplex workstation (Xceed Molecular, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.xceedmolecular.com/">http://www.xceedmolecular.com/</ext-link>). In brief, concentrations of the isolated RNA were determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. All total RNA samples were of acceptable purity (ratio of the absorbance at 260 nm to 280 nm of 1.75 or greater). The integrity of the total RNA was determined to be acceptable for all samples (RNA Integrity Numbers measured with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 Nano assay were greater than 9.0). A custom Ziplex TipChip microarray containing oligonucleotide probes of between 35 and 50 bp for 32 genes was used to profile differences in gene expression between the LCL samples. Total RNA (500 ng) from 108 independent samples was amplified and biotin labeled with the Illumina Totalprep RNA amplification kit (Ambion). The concentrations of the labeled aRNAs were determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm, and 3 &#x000b5;g was hybridized on the custom TipChip with the Ziplex Automated Workstation protocol (Xceed Molecular). After hybridization, the Ziplex Automated workstation software automatically quantified spot intensities and reported background subtracted expression values. The Ziplex software automatically evaluated attributes of each spot to identify spots that did not conform to quality control criteria and reported the mean value of the duplicate spots of each probe that passed quality control.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>ChIP Microarray Analysis</title><p>Two healthy controls and one severely affected CdLS proband with an <italic>NIPBL</italic> protein-truncating mutation (G5483A) were used.
