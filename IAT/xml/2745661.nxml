The infectious HPV life cycle is closely linked to the differentiation state of the host epithelia, with viral genome amplification, late gene expression and virion production restricted to suprabasal cells. The E6 and E7 proteins provide an environment conducive to DNA synthesis upon differentiation, but little is known concerning the mechanisms that regulate productive viral genome amplification. Using keratinocytes that stably maintain HPV-31 episomes, and chemical inhibitors, we demonstrate that viral proteins activate the ATM DNA damage response in differentiating cells, as indicated by phosphorylation of CHK2, BRCA1 and NBS1. This activation is necessary for viral genome amplification, as well as for formation of viral replication foci. In contrast, inhibition of ATM kinase activity in undifferentiated keratinocytes had no effect on the stable maintenance of viral genomes. Previous studies have shown that HPVs induce low levels of caspase 3/7 activation upon differentiation and that this is important for cleavage of the E1 replication protein and genome amplification. Our studies demonstrate that caspase cleavage is induced upon differentiation of HPV positive cells through the action of the DNA damage protein kinase CHK2, which may be activated as a result of E7 binding to the ATM kinase. These findings identify a major regulatory mechanism responsible for productive HPV replication in differentiating cells. Our results have potential implications for the development of anti-viral therapies to treat HPV infections.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Over 100 types of human papillomavirus (HPV) have been identified, and approximately one-third of these infect epithelial cells of the genital mucosa. A subset of these HPV types are the causative agents of cervical and other anogenital cancers. The infectious life cycle of HPV is dependent on differentiation of the host epithelial cell, with viral genome amplification and virion production restricted to differentiated suprabasal cells. While normal keratinocytes exit the cell cycle upon differentiation, HPV positive suprabasal cells are able to re-enter S-phase to mediate productive replication. The mechanisms regulating the activation of differentiation-dependent viral replication are largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that HPV induces an ATM-dependent DNA damage response that is essential for viral genome amplification in differentiating cells. In addition, we have found that ATM signaling to its downstream target CHK2 is critical for providing an environment that is conducive to HPV productive replication. Our findings identify an important regulatory mechanism by which HPV controls replication during the productive phase of the life cycle and may identify new targets for the development of therapeutics to treat HPV-induced infections.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are the etiological agents of most anogenital cancers and their productive life cycle is dependent upon epithelial differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-zurHausen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Walboomers1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Central to these repair pathways are the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated), and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) kinases, which belong to a structurally related family of serine-threonine kinases that share a PI-3 kinase-like domain, but only phosphorylate proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Harper1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

These proteins can be divided into three pathways that lead to activation of cell cycle checkpoints: a p53/mdm2 pathway, a CHK2 branch, and a NBS1/BRCA1/SMC1 pathway. ATM directly activates p53 by phosphorylation at serine 15, as well as by phosphorylating Mdm2, the ubiquitin ligase that regulates p53 stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Banin1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Canman1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Maya1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

For these studies, we examined undifferentiated, as well as differentiated human keratinocyte cell lines that maintain HPV-31 episomes at approximately 50 copies per cell, and compared effects to a matched set of normal human keratinocytes isolated from foreskin circumcisions (HFKs).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000605-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, the total levels of ATM were similar between HPV-31 positive HFKs (HFK-31) and matched normal HFKs in undifferentiated cultures, as well as after 48 and 96 hours of differentiation in high calcium medium.

CHK2 is an important transducer of the ATM signaling pathway, and its activation is initiated by ATM phosphorylation on threonine 68 (pCHK2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Matsuoka2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Ahn1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

Activation of the ATM pathway can also result in the phosphorylation of NBS1 and BRCA1, both of which play important roles in DNA repair and the regulation of S and G2 checkpoints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Gatei1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Gatei2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Lim1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Xu1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. In HFK-31 cells, BRCA1 was phosphorylated at all states of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000605-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). While we also observed pBRCA1 in undifferentiated normal HFKs, the levels rapidly declined along with total BRCA1 upon differentiation. Phosphorylation of BRCA1 in normal HFKs may be due to either low level activation of ATM, or through the action of ATR, which can also phosphorylate BRCA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Gatei1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, phosphorylation of NBS1 at Ser343 was induced only upon differentiation of HPV positive cells, with low levels observed in undifferentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000605-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, little phosphorylation of NBS1 was observed in either undifferentiated or differentiated normal HFKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000605-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). These results indicate that phosphorylation of NBS1 in HPV positive cells is differentiation-specific, and correlates with the induction of productive viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000605-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, we observed phosphorylation of the ATR substrate CHK1 on Ser317 in undifferentiated HPV positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000605-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that ATR is also active. However, the levels of phosphorylated CHK1, as well as total CHK1, decreased by 48 hours post-differentiation. Similar effects were observed in multiple independently derived HFK-31 cell lines, as well as in CIN612 cells (data not shown). Overall, these results indicate that HPV proteins induce a DNA damage response that is maintained throughout the viral life cycle and characterized by the activation of the ATM substrates CHK2, NBS1 and BRCA1.</p><p>We next wanted to confirm that ATM activity was responsible for CHK2 phosphorylation in HPV positive cells, as CHK2 can also be phosphorylated and activated by the ATR kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Ahn1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Wang1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. HFK-31 cells were treated with a small molecule inhibitor of ATM, KU-55933, that inhibits kinase activity without affecting the total levels of ATM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Hickson1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000605-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Treatment of HFK-31 cells with 5 or 10 uM of the ATM inhibitor resulted in significantly reduced phosphorylation of CHK2, as well as ATM itself in differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000605-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Treatment of HPV-31 cells with this inhibitor also resulted in decreased phosphorylation of NBS1 and BRCA1 (data not shown), while phosphorylation of CHK1 Ser317 was only minimally affected with 10 uM of the inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000605-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Treatment of undifferentiated HPV-31 positive cells also resulted in inhibition of CHK2 phosphorylation without affecting CHK1 phosphorylation (data not shown). These results indicate that ATM activity is necessary for CHK2 phosphorylation in cells maintaining HPV genomes. In addition, our findings indicate that the low level of CHK1 phosphorylation observed in differentiating HPV positive cells is ATM-independent, and may suggest a role for ATR in the non-productive phase of the life cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>HPV does not induce degradation of MRN components</title><p>In response to DNA damage, ATM is recruited to distinct nuclear foci by the MRN complex, which consists of NBS1, MRE11 and RAD50 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Lee2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Falck1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.

In preliminary studies, we have found that E6 can also activate CHK2 (Moody and Laimins, unpublished data), although it is unclear whether E6 utilizes the DNA damage response to induce caspase activation in differentiating cells. Several recent studies have demonstrated a role for CHK2 in DNA damage-induced apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Rogoff1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Stevens1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Jack1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Powers1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. In response to DNA damage, CHK2 phosphorylates E2F1, resulting in its stabilization, transcriptional activation, and induction of p53-dependent or -independent apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Rogoff1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Stevens1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. E2F1 is expressed at high levels in differentiating HPV positive cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Longworth2">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>, and it is possible that CHK2 mediates caspase activation through E2F1. Interestingly, our studies indicate that HPV induces caspase activation only in differentiating cells, while activation of CHK2 is observed in both undifferentiated and differentiated cells. This suggests that while CHK2 activation is necessary for caspase activation, it alone is not sufficient and may require differentiation-specific factors as well as other members of the ATM pathway for this function. Several viruses have been shown to utilize DNA damage response for productive replication, and it is possible that these viruses also utilize low-level caspase activation as part of their life cycle.</p><p>Our studies indicate that in stable cell lines E7 activates CHK2, and that it forms a complex with the phosphorylated form of ATM. Deletion of the LXCXE Rb binding domain in E7 abrogated ATM binding, however binding could occur directly or indirectly through another protein. Preliminary results using Rb-deficient Saos-2 cells indicate that E7 binding to ATM does not require Rb (Moody and Laimins, unpublished data). Previous studies have shown that deletion of the LXCXE binding domain in E7 blocks HPV genome amplification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Longworth1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, and in our studies this motif is important for ATM binding. This is consistent with the idea that E7's interaction with ATM may be necessary for productive replication.</p><p>In addition to E7, the HPV replication protein E1 may also contribute to the ATM response. Upon differentiation, the expression of E1 increases, contributing to enhanced viral replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Klumpp1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. Kadaja et al demonstrated that heterologous high-level expression of E1 initiates replication from integrated HPV origins multiple times in a single S-phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Kadaja1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that E1 may disrupt normal licensing control in differentiating cells, allowing for re-replication of HPV DNA and activation of an ATM response. It is possible that multiple HPV proteins act cooperatively to activate the full ATM response.</p><p>In summary, our studies demonstrate that HPV proteins activate the ATM DNA damage response and that this is necessary for amplification of viral genomes upon differentiation. The formation of HPV replication foci in differentiating cells is dependent upon ATM activity and suggests that DNA repair proteins may participate directly in viral replication. Importantly, we have established a link between caspase activation and the DNA damage response. Caspase 3/7 consensus cleavage motifs are found at conserved locations in E1 proteins of almost all papillomavirus types, and we suspect caspase activation may be necessary for their productive replication. We believe that activation of the ATM pathway will prove to be a common mechanism utilized by HPVs to promote viral replication in differentiating cells. These observations suggest that the ATM pathway may be an effective therapeutic target to block the spread of HPV infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs) were derived from neonatal human foreskin epithelia and maintained in E medium containing mouse epidermal growth factor (EGF) and mitomycin-treated J2 fibroblasts as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000605-Halbert1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>.
