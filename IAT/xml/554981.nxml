Alternative splicing generates a multitude of isoforms that have overlapping but distinct functions during embryonic development and that also contribute to maintaining homeostasis in adult differentiated tissues (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). Alternative splice forms of key proteins in cancer, TP53, MDM2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and c-MYC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], have been shown to play a role in oncogenesis.</p><p>Survivin was originally identified by structural homology to IAPs in human B-cell lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It is composed of a single BIR domain and an extended carboxy-terminal coiled coil domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Transcription from the <italic>Survivin </italic>locus gives rise to alternatively spliced transcripts identified in both human and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. To date, three alternatively spliced isoforms have been described in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Survivin-2B is generated by the insertion of an alternative exon, exon 2B; Survivin-&#x00394; Ex3 arises from the removal of exon 3 resulting in a frameshift and translation of part of the 3'UTR generating a unique carboxy-terminus; Survivin-3B results from the introduction of a novel exon 3B resulting in a frameshift and premature termination of the protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Structural analysis of survivin 2&#x003b1; compared with the other human survivin isoforms. A: The survivin pre-mRNA generates at least five mature mRNA transcripts. Boxes represent exons, with the sizes indicated below. The size of the additional nucleotide sequences for survivin 3B and survivin 2&#x003b1; are shown. In survivin 2&#x003b1;, 197nt of intron 2 are added, of which 195nt are non-coding. Protein domains and motifs are indicated above the diagrams. The black arrow indicates the stop codon; the coiled-coil domain is shown by the dotted line; and the double lines represent the BIR domain. B: Survivin 2&#x003b1; transcript and predicted protein sequence. The sequence for the survivin 2&#x003b1; transcript was obtained by sequencing the insert contained within the IMAGE clone. C: Predicted 3D structural modeling of survivin 2&#x003b1; and survivin. The amino acid sequence of survivin 2&#x003b1; was used with SWISS-MODEL to predict a 3D structure by homology modeling. The resulting PDB file was visualized and manipulated using Swiss PBD-Viewer for the view presented. The 3D structure for survivin was obtained from Swiss-PROT database (PDB entry 1F3H). The yellow arrows indicate regions of differences between survivin 2&#x003b1; and survivin. The red arrows represent the first 2 alpha helices of the BIR domain, and the pink arrow represents the 3<sup>rd </sup>helix, that is absent in survivin 2&#x003b1;. The green arrow points to the C-terminal coiled-coil domain. D: Protein Analysis of survivin 2&#x003b1;. Total HeLa cell lysate was loaded on a 18% SDS-PAGE and transferred into nitrocellulose membrane. The proteins were detected by immunoprobing with a polyclonal survivin antibody. A protein of approximate molecular weight 8.5 kDa, corresponding to the predicted size of survivin 2&#x003b1; is detected in HeLa cell lysates.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1476-4598-4-11-1"/></fig><p>Survivin has 2 main functions; one as a chromosomal passenger protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and the other as an inhibitor of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Survivin 2B has been shown to be a pro-apoptotic protein that sensitizes resistant leukemia cells to chemotherapy in a p53-dependent fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Survivin-&#x00394; Ex3 functions as an anti-apoptotic protein and is upregulated in malignancies (Mahotka et al., 1999).

We surveyed the aligned survivin EST sequences available in the UCSC Human Genome Browser and identified an EST from a human breast tumor cDNA library (I.M.A.G.E. clone 1631662). We sequenced the entire cDNA and designated it Survivin 2&#x003b1;. The complete cDNA sequence is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>. The protein contains the coding sequences from exon 1 and exon 2, and one additional amino acid before termination (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This 74 amino acid protein, with a predicted molecular weight of 8.5 kDa, contains a truncated BIR domain and lacks the carboxy-terminal coiled-coil domain in its entirety (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). There are no defined localization signals in the protein, and PSORTII predicts localization within the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Alignment with the known human survivin isoforms shows that the sequence of Survivin 2&#x003b1; is identical to exons 1 and 2 of the other survivin splice variants, with the exception of the last amino acid. Alignment of Survivin 2&#x003b1; with the three mouse survivin isoforms also reveals some similarity with survivin40, a 40-amino acid mouse splice variant (not shown). The 3D predicted structure of Survivin 2&#x003b1; shows the absence of the alpha-helical coiled-coil domain, present in survivin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). It also shows minor predicted rearrangements in the structure that may occur to stabilize the protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, yellow arrows). These re-arrangements occur within the BIR domain, and could have functional implications for the role of Survivin 2&#x003b1; in apoptosis.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Table of the predicted localization and structural features of survivin and the novel isoform survivin 2&#x003b1;.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Localization</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Survivin</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Survivin 2&#x003b1;</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Cytoplasm</td><td align="center">56.5%</td><td align="center">39.1%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Nucleus</td><td align="center">17.4%</td><td align="center">34.8%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Cytoskeleton</td><td align="center">0%</td><td align="center">4.3%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Golgi Apparatus</td><td align="center">0%</td><td align="center">0%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Plasma membrane</td><td align="center">4.3%</td><td align="center">0%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">ER</td><td align="center">4.3%</td><td align="center">4.3%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Peroxysome</td><td align="center">0%</td><td align="center">0%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Mitochondria</td><td align="center">13.0%</td><td align="center">13.0%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Lysosomes</td><td align="center">4.3%</td><td align="center">4.3%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Features</bold></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">BIR</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">Partial</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Coiled-Coil</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Protein Size</td><td align="center">142 aa</td><td align="center">74 aa</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Predicted Molecular Weight</td><td align="center">16.4 kDa</td><td align="center">8.5 kDa</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The BIR domain has been shown to be important for homodimerization and coordination of the zinc atom co-factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the survivin protein, Histidine 80 (H80) is required for zinc atom coordination and homodimerization. Expression constructs containing mutations at this residue within the Survivin protein have previously been shown to accelerate PCD (Programmed Cell Death) in vitro. Similarly, mutations in Cytosine 84 (C84) enhance PCD, as a result of displacement of the wild type Survivin protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The Survivin 2&#x003b1; protein, truncated at amino acid 74, lacks both of these amino acid residues. Additionally, Survivin 2&#x003b1; lacks the third alpha helix in the BIR domain. As the anti-apoptotic function of Survivin is mediated both by the BIR domain and by the interaction of its C-terminal coiled coil domain with microtubules of the mitotic spindle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], it would be predicted that Survivin 2&#x003b1; might not have anti-apoptotic properties.</p></sec><sec><title>Survivin 2&#x003b1; is highly expressed in tumor cells</title><p>Survivin is critical for global normal embryonic development, as demonstrated by the early embryonic lethality of mice with homozygous deletions in the survivin gene locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Survivin proteins are virtually absent from most normal differentiated tissues, however these proteins are expressed in certain highly proliferative areas within normal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In contrast, survivin is highly expressed in the majority of human malignancies, derived from different cell origins. We evaluated the expression of survivin 2&#x003b1; in 7 different cancer cell lines, 2 non-transformed tissues and 7 primary medulloblastoma tumors by quantitative PCR. We designed primers that will specifically amplify Survivin 2&#x003b1; after selection of polyadenylated RNA. Survivin 2&#x003b1; expression in tumor cells and primary medulloblastoma tumors varied from 2&#x02013;100 fold above non transformed cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The levels of Survivin 2&#x003b1; transcripts are comparable to those of Survivin &#x00394;Exon3 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Like Survivin, Survivin 2&#x003b1; is expressed at increased levels in transformed cells compared to non-transformed cells, and therefore it suggests that it could have a role in tumorigenesis. Additionally, we detected expression of endogenous Survivin 2&#x003b1; protein in HeLa cells, suggesting that the transcript is translated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Survivin 2&#x003b1; expression (relative to normal tissue).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center"><bold>Cell Type</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Relative Increase</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Normal Cerebellum</td><td align="center">1.00</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Normal Breast (MCF10A)</td><td align="center">0.97</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Breast Carcinoma (MCF7)</td><td align="center">8.17</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Osteosarcoma (U2OS)</td><td align="center">39.06</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Lung (A549)</td><td align="center">3.03</td></tr><tr><td align="center">ALL (Jurkat)</td><td align="center">1.84</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Soft Tissue Sarcoma (RH28)</td><td align="center">94.90</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Cervical Carcinoma (HeLa)</td><td align="center">58.22</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Medulloblastoma (Daoy)</td><td align="center">34.23</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>Primary Tumors</bold></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="center">Medulloblastoma #1</td><td align="center">4.68</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Medulloblastoma #2</td><td align="center">154.55</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Medulloblastoma #3</td><td align="center">93.24</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Medulloblastoma #4</td><td align="center">5.69</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Medulloblastoma #5</td><td align="center">8.54</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Medulloblastoma #6</td><td align="center">9.81</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Medulloblastoma#7</td><td align="center">75.10</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap position="float" id="T3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Expression of survivin splice variants in medulloblastoma (relative to survivin)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center"><bold>Tissue</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Survivin 2B</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Survivin &#x00394;Ex3</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Survivin 2&#x003b1;</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Medulloblastoma #3</td><td align="center">37.63</td><td align="center">0.46</td><td align="center">0.36</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Medulloblastoma #4</td><td align="center">43.82</td><td align="center">0.18</td><td align="center">0.18</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Medulloblastoma (Daoy)</td><td align="center">1290.16</td><td align="center">35.10</td><td align="center">0.66</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Functional Properties of Survivin 2&#x003b1;</title><p>To characterize a function for Survivin 2&#x003b1;, we transfected Daoy cells with Survivin 2&#x003b1; and a combination of Survivin 2&#x003b1; and Survivin. To induce apoptosis in the Daoy cells, we treated them with 2 &#x003bc;M of the chemotherapeutic agent vincristine. Vincristine is a vinca alkaloid that binds to tubulin, inhibiting microtubule polymerization. It kills Daoy cells in culture by PCD. We analyzed early apoptotic events in vincristine-treated transfected cells by Annexin V staining. Survivin 2&#x003b1; antagonized the anti-apoptotic effect of Survivin in co-transfection assays with or without a cell death stimulus (not shown and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). As inhibition of apoptosis by Survivin involves activation of the caspase pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], we assayed Survivin 2&#x003b1; transfected cells for caspase 3 activation. Caspase-3 was strongly activated in vector control and Survivin 2&#x003b1; transfected cells in the presence of vincristine. Much lower levels of caspase-3 activation were observed in Survivin-transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In the absence of an apoptotic stimulus we observed a 35% increase of caspase-3 activity in Survivin 2&#x003b1; cells, as well as a 46% increase in early apoptosis, as assessed by Annexin V staining. We also performed electron microscopy analysis of Survivin 2&#x003b1; transfected and non-transfected cells. We sorted transfected cells from non-transfected cells by FACS based on GFP fluorescence, and processed each population for EM analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Overall, there was a 43% increase in incidence of apoptosis in Survivin 2&#x003b1;-expressing cells versus non-expressing cells. Our results suggest that Survivin 2&#x003b1; can attenuate survivin's anti-apoptotic activity and sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy. These findings have important therapeutic implications in the treatment of chemoresistant tumors.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Early apoptosis in tumor cells transfected with survivin and survivin 2&#x003b1;.

Thus, survivin 2&#x003b1; may be useful as a therapeutic tool in sensitizing chemoresistant tumor cells to chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patient samples</title><p>Seven fresh frozen primary medulloblastoma tumor samples were obtained from the Cooperative Human Tumor Network (CHTN), after approval through the Columbus Children's Hospital IRB.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequencing</title><p>IMAGE clone 1631662 (Invitrogen) was sequenced using primers that flanked the multiple-cloning-site.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmids and Cloning</title><p>The cDNA for survivin 2&#x003b1; was amplified from the EST clone (Invitrogen) and cloned into the <italic>Kpn</italic>I-<italic>Bam</italic>HI sites of pcDNA4/TO/myc-HisB (Invitrogen) generating an in-frame fusion with the C-terminal myc-tag, or into the <italic>Kpn</italic>I-<italic>Bam</italic>HI sites of pEGFP-N3 generating an in-frame fusion with the C-terminal GFP tag. The start codon in both constructs corresponds to the naturally occurring start codon in the cDNA transcript.

Poly(A) RNA was purified using Oligotex dT kit (Qiagen). 100 ng of poly(A) purified RNA was used as a template in a reverse transcription reaction using random hexamers and Omniscript Reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) and performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR reactions using Taqman probes (FAM/TAMRA) were run in triplicate on an ABI Prism 7700 Real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems). Control GAPDH reactions (Applied Biosystems) were run to normalize &#x00394;Ct values. Relative change was calculated by the comparative C<sub>T </sub>method, 2<sup>(-&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct)</sup>. The survivin 2&#x003b1; specific primers consist of: Forward 5'GCTTTGTTTTGAACTGAGTTGTCAA; Reverse 5'GCAATGAGGGTGGAAAGCA; and Probe: 6FAM AGATTTGAGTTGCAAAGACACTTAGTATGGGAGGG TAMRA</p></sec><sec><title>Apoptosis Assays</title><p>Two apoptosis assays were performed: Caspase-3 assay and Annexin-V FLUOS. For caspase assays 2,000 cells from each experimental condition were subjected to the caspase-3 assay, Caspase 3/7 GLO (Promega) and analyzed on a Victor3 plate reader (Applied Biosystems). Experiments were performed in triplicate.</p><p>Annexin V/propidium iodide staining was carried out using the Roche Annexin-V-Fluos Staining Kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescein and propidium iodide fluorescence measured with a Coulter EPICS XL flow cytometer. Experiments were performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec><title>Microscopy</title><p>Proliferating HeLa cells, grown on glass coverslips, were transiently transfected with a GFP-tagged survivin 2&#x003b1; expression construct or co-transfected with GFP-tagged survivin 2&#x003b1; and HcRed-tagged survivin. 24 hours post-transfection the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 50 &#x003bc;g/ml Hoechst dye. Cells were analyzed on a Zeiss LSM510 META confocal microscope, using a 63x PlanApochromat objective. For electron microscopy analysis, proliferating HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-tagged survivin 2&#x003b1; construct for 12 hours. The cells were aseptically sorted by FACS based on green fluorescence from GFP-survivin 2&#x003b1; for positive and negative populations. This was done in order to separate an enriched population that consisted of &#x0003e;90% GFP expressing cells. 10<sup>6 </sup>cells for each condition were fixed in 2.5% gluteraldehyde for 24 hours and processed for EM. For cell analysis, 10 to 12 fields containing 8&#x02013;10 cells per field at a magnification of 3500&#x000d7; were used. At least 100 cells were counted for each experimental condition and assigned to categories of healthy or dying based on their morphological appearance, including nuclear integrity. Image collection was performed on a Hitachi H-600 transmission electron microscope equipped with a GATAN image acquisition system.</p></sec><sec><title>Co-Immunoprecipitation</title><p>HeLa cells transfected with Flag-survivin and survivin-2&#x003b1; myc were collected in Cell Lysis Buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.2 &#x003bc;M PMSF) and incubated at 4&#x000b0;C for 30 min. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation and the clarified supernatant dissolved 1:5 in Co-IP buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 15 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1x protease inhibitors cocktail, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF). The equivalent of 400 &#x003bc;g of lysate total protein was incubated with 2 &#x003bc;g of anti-Flag M2 antibody at 4&#x000b0;C for 1 h with constant rotation. As a control the same amount of lysate protein was incubated in the absence of antibody. Fifty microliters of agarose-conjugated protein A (Invitrogen) were added and the mixture incubated for a further hour in the same conditions. The protein-antibody-protein A complexes were pulled down by centrifugation and subjected to 3 washes with co-IP buffer. The proteins were analyzed through electrophoretic separation in a 20% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose and immunoprobed with an antibody against myc-tag. Detection was performed using the ECL kit (Amersham). Protein standards were used for size determination.</p></sec><sec><title>Bioinformatics</title><p>Subcellular localization predicted by PSORTII program.
