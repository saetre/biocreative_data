Genetic alterations of bromodomain genes contributed to the development of many human cancers and other disorders. BRD7 is a recently identified bromodomain gene. It plays a critical role in cellular growth, cell cycle progression, and signal-dependent gene expression. Previous studies showed that BRD7 gene exhibited much higher-level of mRNA expression in normal nasopharyngeal epithelia than in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) biopsies and cell lines. However, little is known about its transcriptional regulation. In this study, we explored the transcriptional regulation of BRD7 gene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>Potential binding sites of transcription factors within the promoter region of BRD7 gene were predicted with MatInspector Professional <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genomatix.de/cgi-bin/matinspector_prof/mat_fam.pl"/>. Mutation construct methods and luciferase assays were performed to define the minimal promoter of BRD7 gene. RT-PCR and western blot assays were used to detect the endogenous expression of transcription factor Sp1, c-Myc and E2F6 in all cell lines used in this study. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were used to detect the direct transcription factors that are responsible for the promoter activity of BRD7 gene. DNA vector-based siRNA technology and cell transfection methods were employed to establish clone pools that stably expresses SiRNA against c-Myc expression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma 5-8F cells.

Knock-down of c-Myc increases the promoter activity and mRNA level of BRD7 gene. The luciferase activity of the mutated promoter constructs showed that Sp1/Myc-Max overlapping site is a positive regulation element of BRD7 promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These studies provide for the first time the evidence that c-Myc is indeed a negative regulator of BRD7 gene.

It is a protein-protein interaction domain and has a specific binding affinity for acetylated lysines on N-terminal tails of histones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Several studies demonstrated that bromodomain is characteristic of proteins that regulate signal-dependent, but not basal, transcription during active proliferation through modulating chromatin remodeling or acetylation of histones, therefore facilitating accession of transcription factors to chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Accummulating evidence showed that the genetic alterations of bromodomain genes contributed to the development of many human cancers and other disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. BRD7 is a bromodomain-containing gene identified from Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells by cDNA Representational Difference Analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Due to the sequence similarity with other bromodomain containing protein, it was suggested that BRD7 may be as components of chromatin remodeling complexes and possess histone acetyltransferase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Together with E1B-AP5, BRD7 functions as an inhibitor of basic transcription in several viral and cellular promoters in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. STAAL et al. demonstrated that BRD7 protein (celtix-1) interacted with interferon regulatory factor 2 in the nucleus and associated with transcriptionally active chromatin in situ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. BP75, the most homologous gene of BRD7, directly interacts with Dvl-1, enhances TCF-dependent gene expression induced by Dvl-1, and induces the nuclear translocation and formation of vesicular structures of beta-catenin with Dvl-1 in a synergistic manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], indicating that BRD7 may play an important role in Wnt signaling. An alternative critical role of BRD7 gene arose from evidence that BRD7 gene exhibited much higher-level of mRNA expression in normal nasopharyngeal epithelia than in NPC biopsies and cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Over-expression of BRD7 gene in NPC cells was effective to inhibit cell growth and cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. But little is known about its transcriptional regulation. Our previous studies located the promoter of BRD7 gene in a 125 bp region (-293&#x02192;-168 bp) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In this report, we defined the minimal promoter of BRD7 gene in a 55-bp region, and explored the role of c-Myc in suppressive regulating of BRD7 expression in NPC cells. These findings will help to further understand and uncover the functions of BRD7 gene in the pathogenesis of NPC, and also provide a molecular model for studying the transcriptional regulation of other bromodomain family genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of BRD7 minimal promoter</title><p>In order to define the minimal promoter of BRD7 gene, six deletion constructs were generated from full-length promoter construct pGL3-404/+46 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Two of the constructs, pGL3-311/+46 and pGL3-404/+46/(del-152/+3), show luciferase activity equally strong with the full length construct, whereas pGL3-168/+46 and pGL3-404/+46/(del-293/-168) display substantially lower luciferase activity (approximately 5.5 &#x000d7; 103 luc/&#x003bc;g protein). Surprisingly, the luciferase activities of pGL3-266/+46 and pGL3-266/-212, are as strong as that of pGL3-404/+46 in COS7 cells, but have almost no activity in 5-8F cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic illustration of deletion constructs of BRD7 promoter</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-9-111-1"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Identificating of BRD7 minimal promoter (-266/-212)</bold>.

No luciferase activity of pGL3-266/-212 was found in HNE1, CNE1, 6-10B, 5-8F, MCF-7 and SW480 cells. Direct GFP fluorescence assay showed similar results (data not shown). These results indicate that the 55-bp promoter fragment -266/-212 of BRD7 gene selectively functions in some cell types.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>BRD7 minimal promoter selectively functions in some cell lines with weak expression of c-Myc</bold>.

As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, three critical putative binding sites including the binding site for MYC-MAX (-260/-246), an E2F6 binding site (-246/-229), and a Sp1/Myc-Max overlapping site (-223/-198) were found. We, therefore, examined the endogenous expression of these transcription factors in all cell lines used in this study. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, Sp1 is ubiquitously expressed in all cell lines whereas E2F6 is expressed in all analyzed cells except COS7 cells. In RT-PCR assay, two different bands were amplified in COS7 cells by using the same primers to detect E2F6 expression in other eight cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). c-Myc was expressed strongly in the cell lines including HNE1, CNE1, 6-10B, 5-8F, MCF-7 and SW480, in which promoter -266/-212 showed almost no activity. Very weakly expressed c-Myc was detected in COS7, HEK293 and U251 cells, in which promoter -266/-212 was active (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). These results indicate that the activity of BRD7 minimal promoter is inversely related to c-Myc expression, suggesting that c-Myc may play a critical role in regulating of BRD7 minimal promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcription factor Sp1 and c-Myc specifically binds to BDR7 minimal promoter</title><p>To identify the direct transcription factors that are responsible for the promoter activity of BRD7 gene, EMSA and supershift assays were performed. As shown in the right panel of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, a strong and a weak DNA-protein complex was formed by using the radiolabeled -223/-198 fragment as a probe. The complex formation was fully suppressed by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of cold wild type -223/-198 fragment (self inhibition), but not by 100-fold molar excess of cold mutated -223/-198 fragment as competitor. Moreover, this complex can be shifted with either anti-Sp1 or anti-c-Myc, but not with irrelevant HA antibody. These results indicate that the Sp1/Myc-Max binding site at -223 to -198 is specific. Both Sp1 and c-Myc are able to bind to the overlapping site of Myc-MAX/Sp1.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>The Sp1/Myc-Max overlapping site is specific in BRD7 minimal promoter</bold>. (A) Top: The sense sequences of oligonucleotides used in electrophoretic mobility-shift assay. Bottom: Identification of specific E2F6 and Sp1/Myc-Max overlapping site in BDR7 minimal promoter. Oligonucleotides -260/-246, -243/-229 and -223/-198 containing a putative MYC-MAX, an E2F-6 binding site and a Sp1/Myc-Max overlapping site were respectively radiolabeled and incubated with 8 &#x003bc;g nuclear extracts of 5-8F cells in EMSA. For competition assay, 100-molar excess of unlabeled wild type or mutated oligonucleotide -260/-246, -243/-229 and -223/-198 were added to the reaction mixture, respectively, before the addition of radiolabeled probes. NP represents nuclear protein. In the supershift experiments, 2 &#x003bc;g antibody of Sp1 (Upstate Biotechnology), c-Myc (Sigma), E2F6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and irrelevant anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the reaction, respectively.

Right panel: equivalent amounts of chromatin were immunoprecipitated in 5-8F/Si-c-Myc cells by antibodies as indicated. PCR was performed using the indicated BRD7 primers or GAPDH primers.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-9-111-4"/></fig><p>The specificity of the E2F6 binding site was analyzed with a probe coding for an E2F6 binding site spanning from -243 to -229 bp. Two DNA-protein bands found. They were totally inhibited by the addition of 100-fold molar excess of cold wild type oligonucleotide, but not by 100-fold molar excess of cold mutated oligonucleotide as competitors (Middle panel of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). These complexes can't be shifted with either anti-E2F6 or anti-HA, indicating that the E2F6 binding site at -243/-229 of BRD7 promoter is a functional binding site, but is not an E2F6-specific site.</p><p>Finally, we examined the specificity of MYC-MAX binding site at -260 to -246 of BRD7 minimal promoter. A strong and a weak DNA-protein complex were formed with -260/-246 as a probe, and both were completely abolished by adding either 100-fold molar excess cold wild type -260/-246 or the cold mutated -260/-246 as competitors. These data implied that the protein-DNA complexes formed at -260 to -246 were nonspecific (Left panel of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).</p><p>To investigate whether transcription factor Sp1, c-Myc or E2F6 interacts with BRD7 minimal promoter through their specific binding sites <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed ChIP assay. Because of the high GC content (more than 80%) in the region from -266 to -212 bp, it is very difficult to design the primers for amplifying of the sequence spanning -266 to -212 bp in ChIP assay. We designed the primers for amplification the sequence spanning -274 to -162 bp. As shown in the left panel of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, with the DNA samples immunoprecipitated in 5-8F cells by polyclonal rabbit antibodies against Sp1 and c-Myc as templates respectively, a 133 bp DNA fragment of BRD7 promoter could be amplified by using the indicated BRD7 primers (upper bands), but none by the primers of unrelated genomic region of GAPDH gene (lower bands). In contrast, no DNA fragment of BRD7 promoter could be amplified by using DNA samples immunoprecipitated by anti-E2F6 as a template. A 133 bp DNA fragment of BRD7 promoter and a 229 bp unrelated genomic region of GAPDH gene were amplified by using the input as templates. When DNA samples immunoprecipitated with irrelevant anti-HA (negative control) were used as templates, no amplification occurred with either BRD7 primers or GAPDH primers. Moreover, we did ChiP assays using nuclear protein isolated from 5-8F/Si-c-Myc cells. As shown in the right panel of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, with the DNA samples immunoprecipitated in 5-8F/Si-c-Myc cells by Sp1 antibodies as templates, a 133 bp DNA fragment of BRD7 promoter could be amplified, whereas no DNA fragment of BRD7 promoter could be amplified by using DNA samples immunoprecipitated in 5-8F/Si-c-Myc cells by anti-c-Myc as templates. Taking together, we concluded that transcription factor Sp1 and c-Myc specifically bind to BRD7 minimal promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of the transcription factor Sp1 in the regulation of BRD7 promoter activity</title><p>To determine the role of Sp1 in regulating BRD7 minimal promoter, different amounts of expressing vector pCMV-HA/Sp1 were co-transfected with promoter construct pGL3/-266,-212 into HNE1 and 5-8F cells, respectively. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, overexpression of Sp1 slightly increases the promoter activity of pGL3-266/-212 in both HNE1 and 5-8F cells. Similar results were observed in CNE1, 6-10B, MCF-7 and SW480 cells (data not shown). Is this due to the invalid Sp1 binding site? To further confirm the Sp1 binding site at position -223 to -198, two mutated promoter constructs were created. Construct Sp1/Myc-Max/SM was generated by site mutation of three key nucleotides (C/A, G/T, G/A) of Sp1/Myc-Max element, whereas Sp1/Myc-Max/DM, was generated by deleting nine nucleotides of Sp1/Myc-Max element (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). After transfection into 5-8F cells, both Sp1/Myc-Max/SM and Sp1/Myc-Max/DM exhibited the same low activity as compared to wild type pGL3/-266,-212. In COS7 cells, wild type pGL3/-266,-212 showed strong promoter activity (approximately 5.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7 </sup>luc/&#x003bc;g protein), but both Sp1/Myc-Max/SM and Sp1/Myc-Max/DM displayed substantially low promoter activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). All these data indicated that the Sp1/Myc-Max element spanning from -223 to -198 bp is a positive regulatory element. Mutating three key nucleotides of Sp1/Myc-Max element was sufficient to abolish Sp1 binding to this region and positively regulating of BRD7 promoter activity.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Transcriptional factor Sp1 slightly increases BRD7 promoter activity in NPC HNE1 and 5-8F cells</bold>.

Previous studies show that EB virus, environmental factors, and genetic susceptibility play important roles in the pathogenesis of NPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. BRD7 is one of the genes identified from Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells by cDNA Representational Difference Analysis (cDNA RDA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It exhibited much higher-level of mRNA expression in normal nasopharyngeal epithelia than in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) biopsies and cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, little is known about its transcriptional regulation.</p><p>In this report, we defined the minimal promoter of BRD7 gene in a 55 bp region, which is the shortest promoter identified so far in the regulatory region of BRD7 gene. Surprisingly, we found that this 55 bp region displayed high promoter activity in COS7, HEK293 and U251 cells, but exhibited extremely low activity in HNE1, CNE1, 6-10B, 5-8F, MCF-7 and SW480 cells as compared to the full-length promoter -404/+46. What causes it? MatInspector analysis revealed a MYC-MAX, an E2F6 and a Sp1/Myc-Max overlapping site in BRD7 minimal promoter, suggesting that transcription factor E2F6, c-Myc and Sp1 may be involved in regulating of BRD7 minimal promoter.</p><p>Sp1 is a well-investigated factor that regulates transcription through specific sequences in G/C-rich promoter regions and is often critical for transcriptional initiation of TATA-less promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. BRD7 gene contains a G/C rich promoter, in which there are several potential Sp1 binding sites and no TATA boxes. EMSA along with ChIP assays confirmed a specific Sp1/Myc-Max overlapping site spanning from -223 to -198 bp in BRD7 minimal promoter. Overexpression of Sp1 slightly increased the activity of BRD7 minimal promoter in NPC HNE1 and 5-8F cells. Is it because of the invalid Sp1 binding site? To end this point, two mutated promoter constructs including Sp1/Myc-Max/SM and Sp1/Myc-Max/DM were generated. The results showed that the Sp1/Myc-Max overlapping site in the region from -223 to -198 bp is a positive regulatory element. Mutating three key nucleotides of Sp1/Myc-Max element was sufficient to abolish its positive regulation of BRD7 promoter activity. These data confirmed the positively regulating role of Sp1/Myc-Max site in BRD7 promoter, on the other hand, inferred the possibility that the weakly positive role of Sp1 may result from the influence of some negatively regulating factors.</p><p>c-Myc is a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor, and over-expressed in most human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. c-Myc executes its multiple activities mostly through transcriptional regulation of the target genes by binding to several hundred genomic loci harboring consensus c-Myc binding sites, termed E-boxes, resulting in transcriptional activation of their adjacent genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Additionally, a large number of genes such as cell cycle/growth arrest genes gas1, p15, p21, p27, and gadd34, -45, and -153 are down-regulated by c-Myc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In our study, c-Myc binds BRD7 minimal promoter, and negatively regulates the promoter activity and endogenous mRNA expression of BRD7 gene. Whereas knock-down of c-Myc increases the promoter activity and mRNA level of BRD7 gene in NPC 5-8F cells. From these findings, we concluded that c-Myc is indeed a negative regulator of BRD7 gene.</p><p>In conclusion, these studies showed several lines of evidences of BRD7 transcriptional mechanisms: (1) c-Myc expression is inversely corresponding to BRD7 promoter activity. (2) Sp1 binds to BRD7 promoter and slightly positively regulates BRD7 promoter activity. (3) c-Myc binds to BRD7 promoter and negatively regulates BRD7 promoter activity and mRNA expression. Together these studies provide a molecular model for c-Myc in suppressive regulation of BRD7 promoter activity and mRNA expression. These results will help to better understand the role of BRD7 gene in signal-dependent transcriptional regulation and uncover the bio-functions of BRD7 involved in the pathogenesis of NPC as well as provide new potential therapeutic target for cancer therapy from the view of overexpression of BRD7 and knock-down of c-Myc gene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and antibodies</title><p>Most of the cell lines used in this study is from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) cell bank.
