In addition to the lymphoid phenotypes, S1PL KO mice (S1PL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) also developed myeloid cell hyperplasia and significant lesions in the lung, heart, urinary tract, and bone, and had a markedly reduced life span. The humanized knock-in mice harboring one allele (S1PL<sup>H/&#x02212;</sup>) or two alleles (S1PL<sup>H/H</sup>) of human S1PL expressed less than 10 and 20&#x00025; of normal S1PL activity, respectively. This partial restoration of S1PL activity was sufficient to fully protect both humanized mouse lines from the lethal non-lymphoid lesions that developed in S1PL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, but failed to restore normal T-cell development and trafficking. Detailed analysis of T-cell compartments indicated that complete absence of S1PL affected both maturation/development and egress of mature T cells from the thymus, whereas low level S1PL activity affected T-cell egress more than differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Significance</title><p>These findings demonstrate that lymphocyte trafficking is particularly sensitive to variations in S1PL activity and suggest that there is a window in which partial inhibition of S1PL could produce therapeutic levels of immunosuppression without causing clinically significant S1P-related lesions in non-lymphoid target organs.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a breakdown product of sphingolipid metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Chalfant1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Saba1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, is present in all mammalian cells and serves as second messenger in signal transduction pathways that regulate cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis -<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Chalfant1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Reiss1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our findings show that effects on the immune system, typically characterized by lymphopenia and alterations in lymphoid tissues, were present in all mice with reduced or absent S1PL activity. These results indicate that the immune system is particularly sensitive to alterations in S1PL activity. In contrast, the storage disease phenotype in knockout mice that was characterized by alveolar proteinosis, cardiomyopathy, osteopetrosis and urothelial vacuolization in KO mice was prevented by restoration of even low level S1PL activity in humanized mice. In summary, our findings suggest that partial inhibition of S1PL activity can produce potentially therapeutic immunosuppression without causing S1P-related storage disease lesions in non-lymphoid target organs.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>S1PL is required for normal development in mice</title><p>S1PL-null mice were derived from an OmniBank <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Zambrowicz1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> embryonic stem cell clone (OST58278) carrying a gene trap mutation within the second intron of the S1PL gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004112-g001">Fig. 1A and B</xref>) Heterozygous mice (S1PL<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>) were viable and fertile and were intercrossed to obtain homozygous progeny.

These lower levels of S1PL activity in S1PL<sup>H/&#x02212;</sup> mice correlated with an additional significant reduction in circulating T lymphocytes compared to S1PL<sup>H/H</sup> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004112-g013">Fig. 13</xref>). Histopathological changes in lymphoid tissues in S1PL<sup>H/&#x02212;</sup> mice were similar in type and severity to those seen in the S1PL<sup>H/H</sup> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004112-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004112-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004112-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). Importantly, the additional reduction of S1PL activity in the S1PL<sup>H/&#x02212;</sup> mice still did not elicit clinically significant lesions in any non-lymphoid tissues of young adult mice. Similarly, aged (58 weeks) S1PL<sup>H/&#x02212;</sup> mice also lacked lesions in lungs or hearts, although small numbers of enlarged osteoclasts at the physis in bones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004112-g010">Fig. 10E</xref>), and multifocal minimal vacuolization and degeneration of urinary bladder urothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004112-g010">Fig. 10F</xref>), were present. Nevertheless, the amounts and distribution of trabecular bone in the metaphysis and diaphysis of long bones were within normal limits in aged S1PL<sup>H/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p><fig id="pone-0004112-g013" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004112.g013</object-id><label>Figure 13</label><caption><title>Lymphopenia correlates proportionally with the extent of S1PL deficiency.</title><p>Blood cell counts were obtained from 75 and 30 mice carrying 2 copies or a single copy of the human knockin allele, respectively.

Inactivation of S1PL resulted in increased levels of S1P in tissues and serum, and the ensuing physiological consequences correlated proportionally with the extent of S1PL deficiency. We found that clinically significant lesions in non-lymphoid tissues developed only in the complete absence of S1PL activity in the S1PL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. In contrast, the immune system was exquisitely sensitive to alterations in S1PL activity even in partial absence of S1PL. Concurrent depletion of T cells from the peripheral blood and sequestration of mature T cells within the thymic medulla and lymph nodes were observed in all three genetic models (S1PL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, S1PL<sup>H/H</sup>, and S1PL<sup>H/&#x02212;</sup> mice). The T-cell content of secondary lymphoid organs was always less affected than would be expected from the severity of lymphopenia in the peripheral blood, even after complete loss of S1PL activity. Such altered redistribution of T lymphocytes is a hallmark of modulation of the S1P-S1P1 receptor axis and can be explained by accumulation of S1P in tissues of our S1PL-deficient genetic models. Our results are consistent with published data showing that RNA interference&#x02013;mediated knockdown of S1PL in hematopoietic cells leads to increased S1P levels and a block in T-cell egress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Schwab2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In the same study, inhibition of S1PL by the food colorant THI produced similar results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Schwab2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Our analysis of genetic models with a wide range of systemic S1PL deficiency extend on these studies and clearly demonstrate that T-cell trafficking is particularly tightly controlled by S1PL activity compared to other physiological processes.</p><p>It appears that several mechanisms may be involved in S1PL-induced inhibition of thymocyte egress and development. It is a novel finding in our genetic models that excessive S1P levels can also disturb thymocyte development in addition to T-cell egress, leading to decreased thymic cellularity and T-cell output. This is most clearly evidenced in S1PL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice by the severe hypocellularity and increased apoptosis of lymphocytes within the thymic cortex, and by the paucity of T-cells in the splenic PALS and paracortical areas of lymph nodes. It is possible that stress-related elevations in glucocorticoid levels could have contributed to lymphocyte apoptosis and hypocellularity in the thymic cortex of S1PL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice; however, the lymphoid hypercellularity in the thymic medulla of these mice is not generally a feature of stress-induced thymic atrophy, suggesting that direct S1PL effects are involved. Direct S1PL effects on lymphocyte development in the thymus are also suggested by the lymphoid hypocellularity and increased apoptosis of lymphocytes we observed in the thymic cortex of clinically normal S1P <sup>H/&#x02212;</sup> mice; these mice retained low level S1PL activity and the cortical lymphoid depletion was unlikely to be stress related. S1P has been shown to both promote and protect against apoptosis in different mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Hait1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Goetzl1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Hung1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Maceyka1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Reiss1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, and the S1P1 receptor-agonist FTY720 affects thymocyte apoptosis in mice and rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Brinkmann1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Isoyama1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to its direct effect on apoptosis, excess tissue concentrations of S1P may also interfere with lympho-stromal interactions. In S1PL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, thymic epithelial cells and stromal cells that are required for T-cell selection and maturation, were highly vacuolated, which might compromise their function. The severe vacuolization of epithelial cells in the thymic cortex was largely reversed by low-level expression of S1PL in the humanized mice, but the thymus of these mice still registered a 60&#x00025; reduction in thymic cellularity. Despite this apparent thymic hypocellularity, no loss of either the progenitor DN T-cell population or the mature T-cell population in the thymus was observed in the humanized mice. This suggests that loss of S1PL activity impedes the intermediary steps of T-cell maturation, which are dependent upon a complex set of lympho-stromal interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Takahama1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, we observed sequestration of lymphocytes in the thymic medulla and lymph nodes of the humanized mice but not in the spleen. These findings are consistent with some published reports that S1P-mediated retention of lymphocytes is prevalent in the thymus and lymph nodes but not in spleen, which further suggests that a tissue-specific stromal component may be involved in the S1P1 receptor-mediated control of lymphocyte trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Sanna1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Mandala1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Takahama1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. It must be noted however that the absence of significant sequestration of lymphocytes in the spleen in our studies is in apparent conflict with other recent reports that provided evidence supporting a role for S1P in egress of both B-cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Kabashima1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> and T-cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Pappu1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref> from the spleen.</p><p>Our finding that S1PL inhibition had a much lesser impact on B-cell homeostasis than its effects on T lymphocytes is consistent with reported differences in the ability of FTY720 or the S1PL inhibitor THI to retain T- versus B-lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Schwab2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Cinamon1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Kabashima1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. We detected B-cell development abnormalities only in the S1PL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow. Similarly, increased myeloid cell numbers in the peripheral blood and infiltration of the peripheral organs was evident only in S1PL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. One explanation for the increased myeloid cell activity may be that the mobilized neutrophils and phagocytes are involved in eliminating apoptotic cells that accumulate in the infiltrated organs. Similar myeloid cell infiltration was observed in the thymus, spleen and LN of <italic>lpr</italic> mice after treatment with FTY720 which induced apoptosis in these organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with this explanation is our finding that neutrophil granulocytes of S1PL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice show a significantly decreased expression of CD62L (our unpublished data), an adhesion molecule which is shed from the cell surface after cell activation, implying that granulocytes are in an activated state in these animals.</p><p>In contrast to the failed rescue of immune system phenotypes in our humanized mice, we found that even minimal S1PL activity was sufficient to prevent the development of significant lesions in non-lymphoid tissues. Among the non-lymphoid tissues, the urothelium appeared to be the most sensitive to reduced S1PL activity. Urothelial lesions could be caused by a direct effect of S1PL deficiency in urothelial cells or by excreted sphingolipid metabolites present in the urine. However, urothelial lesions were entirely absent in young adult humanized mice and were minimal in aged S1PL<sup>H/&#x02212;</sup> and S1PL<sup>H/H</sup> mice. Similarly, lung pathology was not present in either of the genetic models expressing partial S1PL activity. Respiratory distress caused by pulmonary lesions was the most likely cause of reduced viability of S1PL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, as accumulations of proteinaceous exudates lining and partially filling alveoli would impair alveolar gas exchange. It is likely that the extremely elevated levels of extracellular S1P played a direct role in the development of the pulmonary lesions in the complete S1PL knockouts. One of the S1P receptors, S1P3, is expressed on alveolar epithelial cells, and airway administration of S1P has been shown to disrupt epithelial cell tight junctions and induce pulmonary edema <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Gon1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. It is likely that S1P levels are elevated in the alveoli of S1PL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and that activation of alveolar epithelial S1P3 might compromise the integrity of the pulmonary epithelial barrier. In addition, impaired function of the distended alveolar macrophages in lungs of S1PL&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice may also have contributed to the accumulation of proteinaceous alveolar exudates. Mutations that directly impair the development and/or function of alveolar macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Lieschke1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as mutations that inhibit degradation of surfactant within these cells, have been shown to result in alveolar proteinosis and pulmonary dysfunction in both mouse and human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Trapnell1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Surfactant dysregulation has also been proposed as a common pathogenic mechanism of several sphingolipid storage disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Buccoliero1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The increased interstitial cellularity and vacuolation in the myocardium and osteopetrosis seen with the S1PL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also resolved with the minimal enzyme reconstitution in the humanized mouse lines. The myocardial lesions, while not clearly degenerative, suggest that myocardial homeostasis was altered. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the bone phenotype in the S1PL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are unclear at this point since studies have implicated S1P signaling in both osteoclast and osteoblast function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004112-Ryu1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. However, S1PL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had an increased volume of trabecular bone in both sternebra and long bones (osteopetrosis). Bone normally undergoes a constant process of remodeling carried out by osteoclasts which resorb old bone and osteoblasts, generating new bone. The osteopetrosis seen in S1PL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice appears to be the result of dysfunctional osteoclasts. The enlarged osteoclasts in S1PL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were distended by intracellular accumulations of granular eosinophilic material and were generally detached from the bone surfaces, and would therefore be physically unable to form the tight junctions and ruffled borders required for effective bone resorption.</p><p>In summary, we found that loss of S1PL activity in S1PL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice results in severe T-cell depletion in the blood, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes, as well as lesions in the lung, heart, urinary system, and bone, and that the observed reduced viability of S1PL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is most likely due to respiratory failure. Partial restoration of S1PL activity in humanized mice rescued lesions in lung, bone, and urothelium, but failed to restore normal T-cell development and trafficking. Thus, comparative analysis of genetic mouse models having differing levels of S1PL activity suggests that the S1P pathway is more stringently controlled in the immune system than in the non-lymphoid environment. The relatively specific physiological response to partial inhibition of S1PL activity suggests that there is a window within which reduced S1PL activity could produce potentially therapeutic immunosuppression without causing clinically significant S1P-related lesions in non-lymphoid target organs. Immunosuppression induced by inhibiting S1PL activity has potential application in the treatment of a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, and the humanized S1PL mouse line provides an attractive model for studying small molecule inhibitors of the human enzyme.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Experimental Animals</title><p>All mice analyzed were maintained on a mixed genetic background (129S5/SvEvBrd and C57BL/6J) at the ALAAC-accredited animal facility at Lexicon Pharmaceuticals Inc.
