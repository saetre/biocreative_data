TmRNA is a stable and essential component of <italic>trans-</italic>translation, a quality-control process that rescues ribosomes stalled on mRNAs lacking stop codons. During <italic>trans-</italic>translation, ribosomes switch from a defective mRNA (lacking its translation-termination signal) to the MLD of tmRNA. Because a stop codon is provided by the tmRNA, the ribosomes can dissociate and recycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. As an additional advantage, the tandem translation of the two templates generates a tagged polypeptide which is degraded by housekeeping proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>For tagging, tmRNA has to be charged by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Assisted by protein SmpB, the charged tmRNA is delivered to stalled ribosomes as a quaternary complex with EF-Tu and GTP. Binding of tmRNA to ribosomes is facilitated by ribosomal protein S1, which interacts with the MLD and pseudoknots but not with the TLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Recently, cryo-EM revealed the shape of the tmRNA associated with SmpB and EF-Tu in its ribosome-bound form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Despite this significant progress, high-resolution structures as obtained by NMR and X-ray crystallography are unavailable and expected to be difficult to obtain in the foreseeable future due to the relatively large size and flexibility of the tmRNA.</p><p>In the present work we used a stepwise procedure for arriving at high-resolution models for the entire tmRNA molecule. First, 2-D structures were obtained by covariation analysis of a large number of tmRNA sequences. The basepairing information was submitted to the ERNA-3D modeling program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] to build the helical sections. Structural motifs of the loops and turns were identified in SCOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], high-resolution data were extracted from known structures, and these data were incorporated into the models. Overall, significantly improved 3-D models were obtained which will be useful to understand the role of tmRNA in <italic>trans</italic>-translation. The described approach can be adapted to obtain high-resolution models of the members of other RNA families.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of tmRNA sequences</title><p>The tmRNA sequences were identified previously and subjected to comparative sequence analysis (CSA) as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. New tmRNA sequences were obtained from the tmRNA website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], through keyword searches of the literature and GenBank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], or BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and various genome sequencing projects. The new sequences were examined iteratively as described in Materials and Methods to confirm tmRNA identity, remove sequence duplications, and create a meaningful alignment.</p><p>New potential tmRNA sequences were maintained as a preliminary alignment in BioEdit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], separate EMBL-formatted sequence files, and a HTML-formatted phylogenetic list. The sequences were ordered phylogenetically using the information in the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. If the organism name was not listed in the RDP, the sequence was placed next to its closest relative using the NCBI Taxonomy resource [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Selection of tmRNA sequences</title><p>The new sequences were confirmed individually as tmRNAs by comparison with the closest relative using the pairwise alignment feature of BioEdit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. If there was a lack of obvious similarity, the sequence was inspected for evidence of biological features such as the ability to form a TLD and an open reading frame. Furthermore, the possibility of a two-part tmRNA was considered. A sequence suspected to be a new tmRNA was investigated further by CSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] as described in Materials and Methods.</p><p>Potential new sequences of the alpha-Proteobacteria and some Cyanobacteria that were encoded in two separate sections of their genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], were compared to the two-part tmRNA sequence from a closest relative for effective comparison with the one-part tmRNAs. The 3'- and 5'-ends of each section were determined by pairwise alignment to generate a single sequence. Each of the 20 new two-part tmRNAs (14 sequences from alpha-Proteobacteria and six from Cyanobacteria) was subjected to this rearrangement.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparative Sequence Analysis</title><p>Sequences were ordered phylogenetically using the RDP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] as a guide or by alignment with the closest relative. Identical regions were aligned first. Subsequently, similar regions were aligned using invariant positions as signposts. Regions of biological significance, such as the resume and stop codons, were then considered. Finally, common secondary structure features were used to align regions that lacked primary structure similarity or biological features. Supported Watson-Crick basepairs and G-U interactions were indicated in the alignment by uppercase letters. Gaps were introduced to account for differences in sequence length and to avoid the alignment of dissimilar regions.</p><p>Secondary structure was determined using covariation analysis as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] (see also Materials and Methods). The alignment was examined to identify compensatory base changes (CBCs) and other covariations. The numbers of CBCs and mismatches between the alignment columns were counted. CBCs provided positive evidence for the existence of a basepair; mismatches provided negative evidence. If the number of compensatory base changes was two times or greater than the number of mismatches, the basepair was considered supported. If a basepair was invariant, no evidence for or against its existence could be gained from CSA. A basepair was considered specific to a particular phylogenetic group if it was proven only in that group.</p></sec><sec><title>Quality control</title><p>To check for the proper assignment of basepairs, the alignment was sent through an automated pipeline of programs from RNAdbTools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The output was inspected visually and corrections were made manually using the BioEdit program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The revised alignment was resubmitted to RNAdbTools, and the review process was repeated until a satisfactory alignment was produced.</p></sec><sec><title>TmRNA alignment</title><p>The final alignment contained a total of 274 tmRNA sequences in 16 bacterial phylogenetic groups. A complete phylogenetic list is available at the tmRDB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. There was a substantial increase in the number of two-part tmRNAs for a total of 27 sequences: 20 from alpha-Proteobacteria (20 tmRNAs), one mitochondrial tmRNA, and six cyanobacterial tmRNAs. The nine organelle sequences included one from a cyanelle, six from chloroplasts, one from a plastid, and one from the <italic>Reclinomonas americana </italic>mitochondrion. The typical tmRNA was about 350 nucleotides long. The <italic>R. americana </italic>mitochondrion tmRNA contained only 189 nucleotides and, since it appeared to lack an ORF, may not be functional. Excluding this exception and any partial tmRNAs, the tmRNA of <italic>Synechococcus </italic>species PCC7009 was the shortest (250 nucleotides), and the longest was from <italic>Chlamydophila psittaci </italic>(425 nucleotides).

However, the structure of this region is well established by experimental evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Helix 1 contained seven basepairs and was usually continuous with the exception of the <italic>Anabaena </italic>species tmRNA, which contained an insertion in the 3'-portion of helix 1. The first pair (1G-C359 in <italic>E. coli </italic>tmRNA) was conserved with one exception in <italic>Alcaligenes eutrophus </italic>where there was a 1U-C345 mismatch possibly due to a sequencing error. The second (2G-C358,<italic>E. coli </italic>numbering, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and third pair (3G-U357) of helix 1 were invariant and therefore neither supported nor disproved by CSA. The identities of the bases involved in the fourth (4G-C356) and fifth pair varied. The closing pair of helix 1 (7G-C353) was conserved with the exception of a 7U-A388 pair the <italic>Trichodesmium erythraeum </italic>tmRNA. The single-stranded region between helices 1 and 2a ranged from ten in <italic>Dehalococcoides ethenogenes </italic>to 13 nucleotides in one <italic>Clostridium acetobutylicum </italic>sequence. A U-A basepair (U6 in chain A with A88 in chain B) was possible in the <italic>R. americana </italic>mitochondrion tmRNA.</p><p>Helix 2a was equivalent to the anticodon stem of tRNA and contained eight supported basepairs as well as a short variable internal loop in the 5'half of the helix that occurred in a few sequences (e.g. <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">additional file 6</xref>: Ccrescentus2D.pdf). The first position in the helix was a conserved cytosine (C21 in <italic>E. coli</italic>) which formed a weakly-supported basepair with the conserved G333. The partial tmRNA from the chloroplast of <italic>Pavlova lutheri </italic>contained a uracil in the first position, but no information regarding the 3'portion of helix 2a was available.</p><p>The T-loop and helix 12 were highly conserved, although many sequences lacked information about helix 12 due to primer annealing during PCR amplification. Helix 12 contained four strongly supported basepairs and a fifth conserved G-C pair (340G-C348 in <italic>E. coli</italic>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The <italic>Dehalococcoides ethenogenes </italic>tmRNA had the potential to form a sixth basepair in helix 12. Helix 12 was almost always continuous, except for the tmRNA of <italic>Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans </italic>which possessed four basepairs and a mismatched U333 and C347. A 331-GG-332 preceded U333 in <italic>C. hydrogenoformans </italic>and followed the conserved 328-GAC-330. Therefore, U333 was unlikely to pair. In the T-loop, the U341 and U342 (<italic>E. coli </italic>tmRNA) seen in most sequences were replaced by two guanines in the tmRNA from the <italic>R. americana </italic>mitochondrion (G79 and G80 in chainB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In the tmRNA from <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, the nucleotide corresponding to U342 in <italic>E. coli </italic>tmRNA was changed to G62 in chainB (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">additional file 6</xref>: Ccrescentus2D.pdf).</p></sec><sec><title>Helical sections 2b, 2c and 2d</title><p>Overall, sections 2b, 2c, and 2d were well supported. Sections 2a and 2b were separated by a variable loop ranging from one to seven nucleotides in the 5'portion and from one to nine nucleotides in the 3'portion. Sections 2b and 2c had the potential to form a continuously stacked helix (e.g. in <italic>Chlamydophila psittaci </italic>tmRNA). Usually, a bulge of two to six nucleotides separated helical sections 2c and 2d (residues 309&#x02013;311 in <italic>E. coli </italic>tmRNA, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). An asymmetrical loop was present in some sequences (for example, residues 40&#x02013;41 in chainA, and 27&#x02013;31 in chainB of <italic>Caulobacter crescentus </italic>tmRNA, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">additional file 6</xref>: Ccrescentus2D.pdf). Helix 2d was the most conserved of the three helical sections. The G43-U308 basepair (<italic>E. coli </italic>numbering) in helix 2d was only weakly supported, conserved in most phylogenetic groups, but altered in the Thermatogales, Cyanobacteria, alpha-Proteobacteria, and Gram-positive bacteria. A 46A-U334 pair was possible in the <italic>Synechocystis </italic>species PCC6803 tmRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Pseudoknot 1 (helices 3 and 4)</title><p>Pseudoknot 1 (pk1) was well supported. Of the three connecting regions, the two 5'-regions were very short (no or only one residue) while the third was relatively long (one to 11 residues). All pseudoknots in tmRNA followed the same general design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Most sequences contained helices 3 and 4, with the exception of the tmRNA from <italic>Oenococcus oeni </italic>and the partial sequence from the chloroplast of <italic>Pavlova lutheri</italic>, both of which lacked helix 4 and thus did not form a pseudoknot. Helix 3 usually contained five basepairs. However, a sixth pair was possible in some bacteria.</p><p>Helix 4 could be split into helicalsections 4a and 4b by a bulge seen in 46 sequences (position57 in <italic>B. anthracis </italic>tmRNA; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">additional file 5</xref>: Banthracis2D.pdf) or an internal loop seen in 52 tmRNA sequences. The adenine-rich terminal loop between the downstream halves of helices 3 and 4 ranged in length from twoto13 nucleotides.</p></sec><sec><title>The mRNA-like region (MLD)</title><p>The MLD consisted of an open reading frame (ORF) preceding helix 5 and varied from 48 (<italic>Heliobacillus mobilis</italic>) to 126 nucleotides (<italic>Odontella sinensis </italic>chloroplast). The resume codon usually coded for alanine, but for glycine in 30 sequences (e.g. <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic>), aspartic acid in three sequences (e.g. <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>), arginine in two uncultured species (FS1 and LEM2), serine in the uncultured species RCA1, and glutamic acid in <italic>Mycoplasma pulmonis</italic>.</p><p>Although helix 5 was only weakly supported by CBCs, recent site-directed mutagenesis experiments combined with functional studies <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] provide strong evidence for its existence. One to three stop codons were located within the helix 5 loop. A single UAA stop codon was present in 157 sequences. UAG (17 sequences) or UGA (10 sequences) were used less frequently. In 85 sequences there were two in-frame stop codons, where UAA was always the first codon, followed by another UAA (73 sequences), UAG (10 sequences) or UGA (2 sequences). Curiously, two sequences (<italic>Bacillus megaterium </italic>and <italic>Chloroflexus aurantiacu</italic>) were found to contain three tandem in-frame stop codons.</p></sec><sec><title>Pseudoknot 2 (helices 6 and 7)</title><p>Pseudoknot 2 was well supported and similar in overall design to pk1. Helical sections 6b and 6c showed a potential to form a continuous helix in <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic>.

The 90-GCA-92 resume triplet coded for alanine. Two in-frame UAA stop codons (positions 120&#x02013;125) were located within the terminal loop of helix 5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Three basepaired regions (shown boxed) were only weakly supported by CSA. Helixm (residues 87&#x02013;98) was predicted only by energy calculations. A slightly different helix involving residues 88&#x02013;100 has been suggested by footprinting of <italic>E. coli </italic>tmRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The evidence for the 112U-A133 basepair was weak, but was included due to the possibility of extending helix 5 (Materials and Methods). Helical section 5a (residues 108&#x02013;113 and 134&#x02013;137) was enlarged by the weakly supported 108G-C137, 110U-A135 and 111U-G134. The 109C-G136 pair was disproved. In helix 10ab, the basepair between 256G-C275 was only weakly supported. Helix 10ab (residues 248&#x02013;256 and 274&#x02013;283) could be extended by the boxed 257U-G274 pair.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary structure of <italic>Bacillus anthracis </italic>tmRNA</title><p>Overall, the secondary structure of <italic>Bacillus anthracis </italic>tmRNA (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">additional file 5</xref>: Banthracis2D.pdf) was similar to that of <italic>E. coli</italic>.

The resume codon (82-GCG-84 of chainA) coded for alanine and was followed by a UAA stop codon at residues 121&#x02013;123. Helical sectionsm1 and m2 were predicted by energy calculations. There was weak support for 5a (G109-U135 and 111C-G133 in chainA), and the 106U-A138, 107U-A137, 108C-G136, and 110C-G134 in chainA were disproved. The pseudoknots were relatively small. Helix 11 corresponded to the absent pk4 (residues 1&#x02013;18 in chain B).</p></sec><sec><title>Tertiary structure modeling and visualization of tmRNA</title><p>ERNA-3D, a program developed to model RNA in three dimensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], was used on an SGI workstation as described in Materials and Methods. <italic>E. coli </italic>tmRNA was selected because this tmRNA is the subject of extensive research. <italic>B. anthracis </italic>tmRNA was chosen as an example of a tmRNA from a Gram-positive bacterium, and <italic>C. crescentus </italic>tmRNA was selected it represents a two-part tmRNA.</p><p>In order to create the initial models, the sequence and basepairing information were entered into an ERNA-3D input file to automatically generate A-form RNA for the helices sections and specify the single-stranded regions using ERNA-3D's algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Since ERNA-3D avoided an XYZ coordinate system as reference for the user, the manipulation of the model from the viewer's perspective was simple and intuitive. The coordinates of each model were saved in PDB format [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] for compatibility with other molecular modeling programs. Motifs (listed in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> to <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>) were selected to model the loops and turns of a particular tmRNA. ERNA-3D selection files were generated to define clusters and place the motif in 3-D without disturbance to the rest of the model. The 3-D cursor box was used to manipulate a cluster in three-dimensional space, similar to the manipulation of a section of a physical model.</p><p>Numerous high-resolution structures determined by NMR or X-ray crystallography represented a rich source of detailed information for defining biologically meaningful motifs. The SCOR database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] provided a way to find suitabletemplates. In rare cases when a SCOR search for a motif did not result in an acceptable match (e.g. motif 9, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), the nucleotides were positioned manually in ERNA-3D. Otherwise, the coordinates were obtained from the Protein Data Bank PDB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], extracted using the program Swiss-PDBViewer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and imported into ERNA-3D. The source motif and the region to be modeled were selected as separate clusters and aligned in three dimensions using common features (usually a shared basepair). Once superimposed, the coordinates of the residues in the source motif were copied onto the corresponding residues in the model. The template was then deleted, leaving a biologically meaningful structure. The backbone connections between the motif and the rest of the model were inspected visually and, if needed, manual adjustments were made to correct bond lengths and tetrahedral angles involving the phosphorous atom at the joint between the extracted motif and the helical structures generated by ERNA-3D.</p><p>As an example of the motif modeling process, the purine-rich loop in <italic>E. coli </italic>pk3 (positions 204&#x02013;206 and 223&#x02013;225) was constructed using a similar loop in the 30S ribosomal subunit. First, the purine-rich loop was defined as motif 11a (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), and used to search the SCOR database. Positions 780&#x02013;782 and 800&#x02013;802 in the structure of the <italic>Thermus thermophilus </italic>30S ribosomal subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] were found to conform to the motif. The 30S ribosomal subunit coordinates (1J5E.pdb in this case) were downloaded from the PDB and displayed using Swiss-PDBViewer. The coordinates of the loop and the closing basepairs were extracted and inspected to confirm that the structure was compatible. The clustered regions were aligned with the ends of helical sections 8a and 8b at the basepairs 203U-G226 and 207A-U222 of the <italic>E. coli </italic>model and 779C-G803 and 783C-G799 of the template. Template positions 780-AAA-782 and 800-GUA-802 were then copied onto 204-GGA-206 and 223-GAA-225 of the model. The template was deleted and the bond lengths and angles involving the atoms of the phosphates of residuesU203, G222, A206, and U222 were adjusted.</p><p>In some instances, the tmRNA sequence alignment was reinvestigated using ideas derived from the 3-D model. For example, the alignments of pk1 in <italic>Bacillus anthracis </italic>tmRNA and relatives was changed from a two nucleotide bulge (56-AU-57) between helical sections 4a and 4b to a more feasible and equally well supported one-nucleotide bulge (U57, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">additional file 5</xref>: Banthracis2D.pdf). The alignment of helix 10 in pk3 in <italic>B. anthracis </italic>tmRNA and relatives was altered from a 237C-A269 mismatch and an asymmetrical loop (C239 and 266-GU-267) to a single looped-out C269. The alignment of pk3 of <italic>Caulobacter crescentus </italic>and relatives was changed from four basepairs and a weakly supported fifth pair in helix 8 (between 174G-C196 of chainA) to the four basepair structure seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">additional file 6</xref>: Ccrescentus2D.pdf. Information about spatial neighborhoods as obtained from cross-linking, site-directed mutagenesis, and functional testing of <italic>E. coli </italic>tmRNA was introduced and is described in detail below. All models were inspected visually for correct bond angles and distances around the phosphorous atoms at the joints between the extracted motifs and the helical regions generated by ERNA-3D. The coordinates are provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">additional file 7</xref>: Ecoli-closed.pdb, 8: Ecoli-open.pdb, 9: Banthracis-closed.pdb, and 10: Ccrescentus-closed.pdb.</p></sec><sec><title>3-D model of <italic>E. coli </italic>tmRNA</title><p>The model shown as a ribbon diagram in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> consists of a compacted MLD and PKD with the TLD extending from the body of the molecule due to the near-coaxial stacking of the helix 2 sections. The coordinates for the TLD were taken from a previous model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] which is based on two cross-linked sites, one formed between nucleotides U9/U10 near the 5' end and nucleotides C346/U347 in the T loop, the other involving residues at positions 25&#x02013;28 and 326&#x02013;329 within helix 2a (motif 2 in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Important features of the TLD include the non-Watson-Crick base pairs formed by 19-GA-20 and 333-GA-334 which have been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>A very efficient UV-induced cross-link observed between the stop codon loop of helix 5 and pk2 of <italic>E. coli </italic>tmRNA (Wower et al., unpublished) introduced a considerable constraint of helices 5, 6, and 7, and, as has been shown recently, is consistent with the cryo-EM structure of ribosome-bound tmRNA of the initial stage of <italic>trans</italic>-translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Also considered was the previously-discovered covariation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] between C44 and C66 (<italic>E. coli </italic>numbering, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) which determines the orientation of helix 2 in relation to helix 3 and thus the approximate angle by which the TLD protrudes. The 44/66 covariation is strongly supported (26 covariations <italic>versus </italic>four mismatches) in an alignment of 143 representative sequences (not shown). Since this is a non-Watson-Crick covariation, it is difficult to propose a precise structure in this region. More extensive studies will be required to better understand the nature of the 44/66 covariation.</p><p>Overall, the distance between the 3'end and A231 in pk3 was 180 &#x000c5;, and 70 &#x000c5; between the outside edges of pk1 and pk4. Helix 5 and pk2 were positioned in a parallel fashion. The nucleotides in the bulge between helical sections 6a and 6b (motif 9, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) were adjusted manually to allow for a close fit of helix 5 and pk2. This model is supported by the finding that mutations that destroy base pairing in helix 5 substantially decrease tmRNA tagging activity (Wower et al, in press) and abolish the long-distance interaction between helix 5 and pk2 as judged by the absence of a cross-link between the stop codon loop of helix 5 and pk2 (Wower, unpublished data). Evidence for the existence of helix 5 has been provided by the analysis of compensatory mutations which completely restore tagging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Each of the four pseudoknots displayed the previously determined structural properties characterized by extensive helical stacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The MLD and pseudoknots were arranged in a central loop with the resume codon positioned near the junction between helices 2a and 2b (motif 3a, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Our model reflects the finding that the pseudoknots are functionally interchangeable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and thus are likely to retain a considerable level of structural independence. Furthermore, data derived from cross-linking experiments showing that pk2 and pk3 are in close proximity whereas helix 5 and pk4 are further apart (Wower, unpublished data) agree with the presented model.</p></sec><sec><title>3-D model of <italic>B. anthracis </italic>tmRNA</title><p>The 3-D model of the <italic>B. anthracis </italic>tmRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) was similar to the <italic>E. coli </italic>model.

The distance between helix 5 and the 3'end of chainA was 55 &#x000c5;.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We have compared a growing number of tmRNA sequences from all groups of bacteria to produce an alignment from which the secondary structure of any tmRNA could be easily extracted. Most basepairs were supported by phylogenetic evidence, whereas only a few helical sections required energy calculations. Uncertainties in assignment of basepairs, such as the pseudoknot region of chloroplasts and one-piece cyanobacterial tmRNAs, may be eliminated in the future when more sequences will become available.</p><p>The common layout of the secondary structures indicated a similar function in all bacteria. The number and size of the pseudoknots varied, supporting the idea that the pseudoknots may only enhance the essential functions carried by the TLD and the MLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Differences in the secondary structure features were usually not random but occurred between groups of related organisms. For example, helix 6d was present only in the beta- and three close relatives of the gamma-Proteobacteria. Whether these group-specific features are responsible for differences in the <italic>trans</italic>-translation mechanism remains to be determined. However, strategies that exploit these differences, for example for developing new antibiotics targeted at a specific group of bacteria, can now be envisioned.</p><p>In principle, tertiary structure models of any tmRNA in the alignment could be built using the described procedures. Here, we have shown how to generate a biologically more meaningful model of <italic>E. coli </italic>tmRNA which represents a significant progress from a previous model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We also constructed 3-D model of the tmRNAs of <italic>B. anthracis </italic>and <italic>C. crescentus</italic>. Overall, the three models were similar in shape and size confirming that all tmRNAs have the potential to function similarly in <italic>trans</italic>-translation. The TLD mimicked the L-shape of canonical tRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and may be necessary for proper association tmRNA with the EF-Tu, SmpB, and subsequent binding to the ribosomal A-site. The lack of a D-stem has been suggested to confer flexibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], but SmpB may be responsible for stabilizing this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>Differences in the shapes of the three tmRNA models (e.g. the angle between helix 2 and the main body of the molecule) may be due to the difficulty in determining the precise arrangement of the pseudoknots. Considering that the pseudoknots are likely to constitute relatively independent structural units, conformational changes might occur around the connecting single strands, as well as in the MLD and the weakly-supported helix m. TmRNA may become less flexible when bound to proteins such as SmpB and ribosomal protein S1. EF-Tu, however, likely binds to the coaxially-stacked helices 1 and 12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], and therefore appears to have little effect on the conformation of the TLD. Protein SmpB was found to bind near helix 2a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], has two RNA binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], and thus could make additional contacts with other regions. Protein S1 is the largest ribosomal protein, has been shown to be close to numerous sites, and to be required for the binding of tmRNA to the ribosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Since S1 is a flexible, beadlike protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] it may not restrict the conformational potential of the tmRNA molecule. Instead, the protein may instill some constraint to the large central loop formed by the PKD and the MLD. Because S1 is known to melt helices in mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], it is also possible that it unwinds helix m and exposes the resume codon and the preceding nucleotides U85 and A86 for efficient <italic>trans</italic>-translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>The tmRNA models show the resume codon in close proximity to the internal loop formed between helical sections 2a and 2b. This arrangement would allow the ribosome to "jump" a relatively short distance from the end of the broken mRNA onto the ORF of tmRNA. In a recent cryo-EM study of the initial stage of <italic>trans</italic>-translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], the tRNA-like region, SmpB, EF-Tu, and part of pk4 were located in the A-site of the ribosome. We suggest that this more open arrangement is made possible due to the flexibility of tmRNA, the melting of helix m, and/or a change in conformation induced by the binding of tmRNA to the ribosome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The opening of the central loop seems to be accompanied by a rotation of the TLD around the helix 2 axis (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>) and thus might properly align the resume codon with the 3'-end of broken mRNA in the ribosomal decoding centre. At the later stages of the transit of tmRNA across the ribosome even more dramatic conformational changes were shown to disrupt helix 5 and the pseudoknotted regions (Wower et al, in press). These downstream alterations are likely mediated not by protein S1 but by the intrinsic helicase activity of the ribosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] and are required to maintain the ribosomal subunits in close proximity to the unfolded tmRNA in order to monitor <italic>trans</italic>-translation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study significantly advances our understanding of <italic>trans</italic>-translation by providing biologically feasible 3-D models for the entire tmRNA molecule. Although the modeling of only three tmRNAs has been described here, 3-D models of every tmRNA can be extracted from the alignment. The models are characterized by a functionally significant features, including biologically relevant structures for the single-stranded regions and the close proximity between the TLD and the resume codon. Conformational changes induced by binding of tmRNA to SmpB, ribosomal protein S1, and the ribosome suggest a transformation of a free compact tmRNA to a more open ribosome-bound structure. The comparative modeling approach described here for tmRNA is easily adapted for other RNA classes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Comparative sequence analysis</title><p>The tmRNA sequences were arranged in phylogenetic order using information available in the RDP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

Briefly, closely related sequences were aligned first. Then, invariant positions were used as guides to align the dissimilar regions. Next, common secondary structure elements were identified by observing covariations and find support for basepairs, tertiary interactions, or other structural features. Compensatory base changes (CBCs) were observed if a change in one residue of a Watson-Crick or G-U pair was compensated by a second change to maintain basepairing. Two residues were mismatched if they did not form a Watson-Crick or G-U pair. CBCs and mismatches were counted to determine positive and negative evidence in order to prove or disprove the existence of a particular pair. A basepair was considered proven if there was at least twice as much positive than negative evidence. Invariant pairs provided neither positive nor negative evidence.
