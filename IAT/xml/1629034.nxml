HIV infection is associated with profound changes in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism and an increased risk of coronary artery disease. Whereas numerous studies have investigated the role of anti-HIV drugs in lipodystrophy and dyslipidemia, the effects of HIV infection on cellular cholesterol metabolism remain uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrate that HIV-1 impairs ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1)-dependent cholesterol efflux from human macrophages, a condition previously shown to be highly atherogenic. In HIV-1&#x02013;infected cells, this effect was mediated by Nef. Transfection of murine macrophages with <italic>Nef</italic> impaired cholesterol efflux from these cells. At least two mechanisms were found to be responsible for this phenomenon: first, HIV infection and transfection with <italic>Nef</italic> induced post-transcriptional down-regulation of ABCA1; and second, Nef caused redistribution of ABCA1 to the plasma membrane and inhibited internalization of apolipoprotein A-I. Binding of Nef to ABCA1 was required for down-regulation and redistribution of ABCA1. HIV-infected and <italic>Nef</italic>-transfected macrophages accumulated substantial amounts of lipids, thus resembling foam cells. The contribution of HIV-infected macrophages to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis was supported by the presence of HIV-positive foam cells in atherosclerotic plaques of HIV-infected patients. Stimulation of cholesterol efflux from macrophages significantly reduced infectivity of the virions produced by these cells, and this effect correlated with a decreased amount of virion-associated cholesterol, suggesting that impairment of cholesterol efflux is essential to ensure proper cholesterol content in nascent HIV particles. These results reveal a previously unrecognized dysregulation of intracellular lipid metabolism in HIV-infected macrophages and identify Nef and ABCA1 as the key players responsible for this effect. Our findings have implications for pathogenesis of both HIV disease and atherosclerosis, because they reveal the role of cholesterol efflux impairment in HIV infectivity and suggest a possible mechanism by which HIV infection of macrophages may contribute to increased risk of atherosclerosis in HIV-infected patients.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>HIV1-Nef impairs ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux from infected macrophages, promoting the transformation of virally infected macrophages into foam cells (a condition that may put HIV patients at risk for atherosclerosis).</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Mujawar Z, Rose H, Morrow MP, Pushkarsky T, Dubrovsky L, et al.

Depletion of cellular cholesterol markedly and specifically reduces HIV-1 particle production &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;, and cholesterol-sequestering drugs, such as &#x003b2;-cyclodextrin, render the virus incompetent for cell entry &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, regulating cholesterol delivery to nascent virions would be highly beneficial for the virus. Some clues to potential mechanisms that may be employed by HIV to achieve this goal have been provided recently when it was demonstrated that HIV-1 accessory protein Nef binds cholesterol and may deliver it to the site of virion assembly at the plasma membrane &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. However, little is known about the relation of this mechanism to major cellular cholesterol trafficking pathways and about the effect of HIV infection on lipid metabolism in the host cells.</p><p>Increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD) is a recognized clinical problem in HIV-infected patients &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b006">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. A key element of atherosclerotic plaque is formation of foam cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;, the majority of which are macrophages overloaded with cholesterol. Foam cells undergo apoptosis, necrosis, and calcification, and cholesterol released from foam cells forms the lipid-rich core of the plaque. Interestingly, foam cells are less conducive than macrophages to growth of certain pathogens, such as <named-content content-type="genus-species">Chlamydia pneumoniae</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that they may contribute to antibacterial response of the organism. One of the main causes of foam cell formation and accumulation of cholesterol in the vessel wall may be dyslipidemia, especially high levels of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), as well as low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;, and/or impairment of intracellular cholesterol metabolism. Dyslipidemia caused by antiretroviral drugs, in particular protease inhibitors (PIs) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;, is a known risk factor in pathogenesis of CAD in HIV-infected patients. One mechanism of PI treatment&#x02013;dependent dyslipidemia is inhibition of degradation of proteins involved in metabolism of cholesterol and triglycerides, such as apolipoprotein B &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d; or the adipocyte determination- and differentiation-dependent factor 1/sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition to causing dyslipidemia, PIs may contribute to initiation of atherosclerosis by affecting intracellular metabolism of cholesterol via up-regulation of the scavenger receptor CD36 and the subsequent accumulation of sterol in macrophages &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, PIs affect both extra- and intracellular pathways of cholesterol metabolism and are likely an important factor in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in HIV-infected patients. However, a number of clinical reports found a correlation between heart disease and HIV viral load, and detected an increased risk of CAD in patients not treated with PIs or even in drug-naive HIV-infected individuals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.

We show that HIV, via its accessory protein Nef, affects normal function of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and consequently impairs cholesterol efflux from infected macrophages. Previous studies demonstrated the key role of ABCA1 in reverse cholesterol transport and found that functional mutations in ABCA1 cause Tangier disease, which is characterized by severe HDL deficiency, accumulation of sterols in tissue macrophages, and accelerated atherosclerosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. The effect of HIV-1 on ABCA1 is consistent with ABCA1 inhibition described for viral &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d; and bacterial &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; infections; however, the mechanism of impairment is unique for HIV. As a result of ABCA1 inhibition, HIV-infected macrophages accumulate lipids and transform into foam cells, a step that may contribute to the increased risk of atherosclerotic plaque formation. Our results also suggest that cholesterol efflux impairment may be a mechanism that ensures access of nascent virions to intracellular cholesterol, which is critical for HIV infectivity. Therefore, pharmacological stimulation of cholesterol efflux may be considered as a novel anti-HIV therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Impairment of Cholesterol Efflux in HIV-Infected Macrophages</title><p>Cholesterol efflux is a pathway for removing excessive cholesterol from cells to extracellular acceptors.

The level of cholesterol efflux inhibition correlated with the level of virus replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Importantly, at the time of analysis (21 d after infection), 80&#x00025;&#x02013;90&#x00025; of the cells infected with ADA and Yu-2 viruses were p24<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (only 20&#x00025; of the cells infected with 92US660 strain were p24<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> at that time), indicating that reverse transcription (RT) values in these infections reflected the amount of virus produced per cell and that cholesterol efflux impairment depended on the level of virus protein expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Nef Is Critical for Cholesterol Efflux Impairment</title><p>Previous studies demonstrated that the HIV-1 protein Nef can directly bind cholesterol and suggested that in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, Nef may be involved in transporting cholesterol to the sites of HIV assembly at the plasma membrane &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. To test the role of Nef in the observed impairment of cholesterol efflux from macrophages, we infected macrophages with HIV-1 SF2 constructs carrying a mutated or a functional <italic>Nef</italic> gene. To ensure similar levels of infection, the constructs were pseudotyped by the glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G), which targets HIV-1 entry to an endocytic pathway, thus eliminating the requirement for Nef in the early steps of infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Under these one-cycle replication conditions, both viruses infected about 40&#x00025; of cells and produced similar levels of p24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Cholesterol efflux to apoA-I was substantially reduced in the culture infected with the Nef-positive virus (wild type &#x0005b;WT&#x0005d;), whereas in the culture infected with Nef-deficient virus (&#x00394;Nef), it was similar to the level observed in uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). This result indicates that Nef is necessary for HIV-mediated impairment of cholesterol efflux.</p><p>To determine whether Nef is sufficient for the observed effect, we transiently transfected murine macrophages RAW 264.7 with constructs expressing SF2-derived Nef and stimulated ABCA1 expression in these cells by liver X receptor (LXR) agonist TO-901317. Cholesterol efflux to apoA-I from <italic>Nef</italic>-transfected RAW 264.7 macrophages was significantly reduced (by more than 50&#x00025;) compared to cells transfected with an empty vector (mock transfection) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). This result indicates that expression of Nef is sufficient to impair cholesterol efflux from macrophages. Interestingly, Nef mutant Nef.G2A, defective in myristoylation and membrane localization &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;, was not effective in impairing cholesterol efflux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) despite levels of expression being similar to that of WT Nef (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Cholesterol efflux impairment in Nef-transfected RAW cells was less than in HIV-infected macrophages, likely due to differences between these cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Nef Specifically Targets ABCA1-Dependent Cholesterol Efflux</title><p>Specific efflux of cholesterol from cells is mediated by the members of the family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters.

Our finding that Nef inhibits cholesterol efflux to apoA-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g001">Figure 1</xref>) suggests that ABCA1 may be the specific target of Nef. Consistent with this notion, cholesterol efflux to HDL (controlled by ABCG1) from HIV-infected macrophages was not significantly impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Furthermore, phospholipid efflux, which is dependent on ABCA1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;, from <italic>Nef</italic>-transfected RAW 264.7 macrophages was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), similar to the effect of Nef on cholesterol efflux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). In addition, Nef did not affect cholesterol efflux from RAW 264.7 cells in which ABCA1 expression was not stimulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g002">Figure 2</xref>C) and consequently was very low.</p><p>The notion that ABCA1-mediated efflux is the target of Nef was further supported by experiments in HeLa cells, which do not express ABC transporters and have very low background cholesterol efflux to apoA-I &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;.

Importantly, NefLAI, which was expressed to higher levels than NefSF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g002">Figure 2</xref>D), was more effective also in cholesterol efflux impairment. A similar experiment testing the effect of Nef on ABCG1-directed cholesterol efflux showed stimulation of cholesterol efflux to HDL after transfection of HeLa cells with ABCG1, but did not reveal significant inhibition by Nef (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). Therefore, we conclude that Nef specifically targets ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Nef Down-Regulates ABCA1</title><p>Since ABCA1 appears to be the target of Nef, we tested ABCA1 abundance (by Western blotting) and transcription (by real-time RT-PCR) in HIV-infected human macrophages and <italic>Nef</italic>-transfected RAW 264.7 cells. Analysis of ABCA1 in macrophages at the peak of HIV-1 ADA replication showed a substantial decrease of ABCA1 abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Importantly, abundance of two other proteins involved in cholesterol efflux to HDL, ABCG1 and scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1), was not affected by HIV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), consistent with specific targeting of the ABCA1-dependent pathway by the virus. A similar phenomenon was observed in Nef-transfected RAW 264.7 macrophages, although the effect was less pronounced (approximately 50&#x00025; reduction in ABCA1 abundance when assessed by densitometry of the Western blot) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). The Nef.G2A mutant, which was inactive in cholesterol efflux impairment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), was also inactive in depleting ABCA1. RT-PCR analysis revealed a significant increase of ABCA1 mRNA in HIV-infected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g003">Figure 3</xref>C) or Nef-transfected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g003">Figure 3</xref>D) cells, which likely reflects a compensatory response for the loss of ABCA1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. This observation rules out a suppressive effect of Nef on ABCA1 transcription and suggests a post-transcriptional down-regulation of ABCA1 by Nef.

No re-localization of ABCA1 was observed in macrophages transfected with Nef.G2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g004">Figure 4</xref>G).

Some of these effects, including down-regulation of CD4 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d; and MHC I &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;, have been shown to depend on an interaction between Nef and the target protein. We therefore tested whether Nef interacts with ABCA1. HeLa cells were co-transfected with Nef or Nef.G2A and FLAG-tagged ABCA1, ABCA1 was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed for co-precipitation of Nef. This analysis revealed that Nef co-precipitated with ABCA1, whereas Nef.G2A did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, upper panel) despite equally high expression of the two forms of Nef (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g005">Figure 5</xref>A lower panel). We conclude that Nef can interact with ABCA1, and this interaction requires myristoylation of Nef and correlates with the ability of Nef to impair cholesterol efflux. The Nef-specific signal observed in this experiment required high-level expression of participating proteins, likely due to the transitory nature of Nef interaction with ABCA1.</p><p>Interaction between ABCA1 and Nef at the plasma membrane was supported by confocal microscopy, which demonstrated co-localization of Nef and ABCA1 in RAW 264.7 cells transfected with Nef.wt-expressing vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). No co-localization was observed between ABCA1 and Nef.G2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). This visual analysis was reinforced by an analytical quantification presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g005">Figure 5</xref>C. Indeed, both ABCA1 and the WT Nef proteins are found at the cell periphery, and their co-localization is indicated by overlapping green and blue peaks at either end of the graph. Moreover, both colors peak and valley in tandem, suggesting a correlation in subcellular localization of ABCA1 and WT Nef. No such correlation is observed in ABCA1 and Nef.G2A distribution. Taken together, these results suggest that interaction between ABCA1 and Nef occurs at the cell plasma membrane.</p><p>Therefore, both re-localization and down-modulation of ABCA1 depend on its interaction with Nef, which in turn requires myristoylation and membrane localization of Nef.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>HIV-Infected Macrophages Transform into Foam Cells</title><p>To determine whether impairment of cholesterol efflux by HIV-1 infection leads to cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation, we loaded macrophages (uninfected or infected with Nef-expressing or &#x00394;Nef HIV-1) with lipids by incubating with acetylated LDL (AcLDL) in the presence of apoA-I and stained cellular lipids with Oil Red O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

Analysis by transmission electron microscopy revealed more lipid vacuoles (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g006">Figure 6</xref>E) in macrophages infected with Nef-expressing HIV-1 than in uninfected cells or cells infected with &#x00394;Nef HIV-1 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g006">Figure 6</xref>D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g006">6</xref>E, and 6F). Cholesterol loading of RAW 264.7 macrophages transfected with Nef also led to accumulation of significantly larger amounts of lipids when compared to cells transfected with an empty vector (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g006">Figure 6</xref>H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g006">6</xref>I).

Synthesis of triglycerides was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g007">Figure 7</xref>C), indicating that increased cholesteryl ester synthesis and content is a consequence of increased concentration of cholesterol rather than of fatty acids. The increased cholesterol content in Nef-transfected cells was not caused by differences in AcLDL uptake, as the latter was similar between Nef-transfected and mock-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g007">Figure 7</xref>D). To accommodate the increasing amounts of cholesteryl esters, cells would require an additional amount of phospholipids, and, indeed, the efflux of phospholipids was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), whereas phospholipid synthesis was accelerated in Nef-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g007">Figure 7</xref>E).

We hypothesized that if impairment of cholesterol efflux is a specific mechanism to increase HIV replication, then agents counteracting this effect should have anti-HIV activity. LXR agonists up-regulate expression of ABCA1 at a transcriptional level and stimulate cholesterol efflux from various cell types, including human monocyte-derived macrophages (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g009">Figure 9</xref>A). When added to HIV-infected macrophages at day 7 after infection and kept with cells for another 7 d (to allow ABCA1 to accumulate and overcome Nef-mediated inhibition), LXR agonist prevented the impairment of cholesterol efflux by HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g009">Figure 9</xref>A); in fact, cholesterol efflux from TO-901317&#x02013;treated HIV-infected macrophages was similar to efflux from uninfected cells stimulated with the LXR agonist. The lack of HIV-specific reduction of cholesterol efflux is likely due to overproduction of ABCA1, which exceeds production of Nef. Virions were collected from TO-901317&#x02013;treated and untreated cells, adjusted according to p24 content, and analyzed for infectivity using indicator P4-CCR5 cells. This analysis revealed a substantial reduction (by about 80&#x00025;) of infectivity of virions produced from macrophages treated with LXR agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g009">Figure 9</xref>B). Interestingly, protein composition of the virions produced from LXR agonist&#x02013;treated and untreated cells was very similar (unpublished data), whereas virion-associated cholesterol was significantly diminished in virions produced from TO-901317&#x02013;treated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g009">Figure 9</xref>C). These results suggest that stimulation of cellular cholesterol efflux may be an effective approach to suppressing HIV replication.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Results presented in this report demonstrate that HIV-1, via the accessory protein Nef, impairs cholesterol efflux from macrophages. This finding can be interpreted as a virus-mediated switch of cholesterol trafficking from physiological efflux to virus-controlled transport, thus reducing the ability of a cell to export excessive cholesterol. Given that availability of cholesterol is critical for HIV assembly and infectivity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;, it is physiologically sensible for the virus to take over control of intracellular cholesterol metabolism.</p><p>A previous report demonstrated that Nef binds cholesterol and may deliver it to nascent virions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Our study suggests that Nef-mediated impairment of cholesterol efflux is another mechanism ensuring efficient delivery of cholesterol to HIV. Importantly, this mechanism may be a necessary component of the above-mentioned Nef-mediated transport of cholesterol to virions. Indeed, prevention of cholesterol efflux impairment by LXR agonist reduces virion-associated cholesterol without interfering with Nef incorporation into the virions (unpublished data). Reduction of virion-associated cholesterol correlates with lower virion infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g009">Figure 9</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g009">9</xref>C).</p><p>Our results demonstrate that Nef specifically targets ABCA1. Indeed, Nef did not suppress cholesterol efflux in cells lacking ABCA1 (HeLa cells or non-activated RAW 264.7 cells), but did so in ABCA1-expressing cells, such as RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with an LXR agonist, HeLa cells transfected with ABCA1, and differentiated human macrophages. Furthermore, Nef did not suppress cholesterol efflux from ABCG1-transfected HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). These findings and the fact that Nef can interact with ABCA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g005">Figure 5</xref>A) suggest that there is an interplay between Nef and ABCA1 in an HIV-infected cell. The end result of this interplay would depend on relative levels of expression of Nef and ABCA1. Consistent with this suggestion, overexpression of Nef from the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter inhibits ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux stimulated with the LXR agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), whereas levels of Nef expressed from the HIV LTR are insufficient to suppress LXR agonist-stimulated cholesterol efflux in HIV-infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g009">Figure 9</xref>A). As a result, HIV infectivity is reduced in LXR agonist-stimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g009">Figure 9</xref>B). Therefore, drugs stimulating cholesterol efflux may provide a dual benefit to HIV-infected patients by limiting HIV replication and reducing the risk of atherosclerosis.</p><p>Our studies show that cholesterol efflux impairment is a conserved feature of HIV-1 Nef. Indeed, we show this phenomenon using three R5 (ADA, Yu-2, and 92US660) and two X4 (SF2 and LAI) HIV-1 isolates. We demonstrate that HIV-1 Nef impairs cholesterol efflux by at least two mechanisms: it reduces ABCA1 abundance, and it causes intracellular re-distribution of ABCA1. These two mechanisms may be related, as they both depend on interaction between Nef and ABCA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g003">Figures 3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g005">5</xref>). For example, a block to intracellular trafficking of ABCA1 may re-target this protein to a degradation pathway. Alternatively, ABCA1 re-distribution and down-regulation may be two independent effects of Nef, both contributing to impairment of cholesterol efflux. Indeed, several recent reports demonstrated a role of ABCA1 trafficking between late endosomes and the cell surface in cholesterol efflux from endosomal compartment &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;. The effects of Nef on ABCA1 distribution and apoA-I binding and internalization are similar to the effects of cyclosporin A &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d; or deletion of the PEST sequence in ABCA1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;, both of which inhibit efflux of cholesterol from late endosomes. Therefore, both down-regulation of ABCA1 and its intracellular re-distribution can independently contribute to cholesterol efflux impairment observed in HIV-infected cells. Interestingly, Nef alone had less effect on ABCA1 abundance than HIV-1 infection (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g003">3</xref>B), however, it had a more profound effect on the sequestration of ABCA1 at the plasma membrane (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g004">Figure 4</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g004">4</xref>F). Although this result may be due to differences between the cell types in which these analyses were performed (primary human macrophages for HIV infection and murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 for <italic>Nef</italic> transfection), it is also possible that the primary effect of Nef is to sequester ABCA1 at the plasma membrane, and some other HIV protein may cooperate with Nef to stimulate down-regulation of sequestered ABCA1.</p><p>The exact molecular mechanisms responsible for the effect of Nef on intracellular trafficking and abundance of ABCA1 are yet to be fully investigated. Nef is known to regulate expression of several transmembrane proteins, including CD4 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;, MHC I &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;, MHC II &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;, CD28 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;, and DC-SIGN &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;. In most cases, Nef mediates internalization and degradation of the receptor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;, but in some cases (e.g., with DC-SIGN or invariant chain of MHC II), it up-regulates the cell surface expression of the protein. These effects are consistent with our findings showing ABCA1 re-localization and down-regulation, which may involve mechanisms similar to those described for Nef interactions with other proteins. It is worth noting that few of the above-mentioned studies showed co-immunoprecipitation of Nef with a target protein from HIV-infected cells, consistent with our inability to pull down Nef and ABCA1 from HIV-infected macrophages. This may be due to a transitory nature of Nef&#x02013;ABCA1 interaction and low-level expression of these proteins. Analysis of this interaction in cells overexpressing both proteins demonstrated a critical role of Nef myristoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). This fatty acid may either be directly involved in binding of Nef to ABCA1, similar to the role that farnesylation of the yeast pheromone a-factor plays in its interaction with the yeast ABC transporter Ste6 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;, or it may regulate Nef&#x02013;ABCA1 interaction indirectly by targeting Nef to the plasma membrane. Further analysis of the mechanisms by which Nef affects ABCA1 function would require understanding of the molecular events that regulate intracellular trafficking and degradation of ABCA1 in uninfected cells, which is incompletely characterized and is a subject of the ongoing studies.</p><p>The results of this study have potential implications for understanding pathogenesis of CAD in HIV-infected patients. These patients have a mildly elevated risk of CAD &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;, which is sharply raised by treatment with certain PIs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Increased risk of CAD after treatment with PIs led to the assumption that PIs and/or dyslipidemia are the primary source of development of atherosclerosis in HIV patients. Results presented in this report suggest that HIV-induced impairment of cholesterol efflux from macrophages may be another important contributor to the pathogenesis of CAD. Indeed, inactivation of ABCA1 in macrophages of hyperlipidemic mice significantly increased development of atherosclerosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;, and genetic mutation inactivating ABCA1 in humans leads to Tangier disease, one of the characteristic features of which is an increased risk of CAD &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;.

A combination of these effects of HAART and impairment of cholesterol efflux by HIV (which prevents compensatory removal of excessive cholesterol) would result in a greatly enhanced accumulation of cholesterol in HIV-infected macrophages and would potentially further increase the risk of development of atherosclerosis. It should be noted that HIV-infected macrophages, unlike T cells, survive for extended periods of time and are considered long-term reservoirs of HIV-1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b063">63</xref>&#x0005d;. As a result, infected macrophages persist, at least for some time, in HAART-treated patients, when conditions favor development of atherosclerotic plaques. We can speculate that these macrophages may contribute to initiation of atherosclerotic plaque formation, which then proceeds even in the absence of newly infected cells. This mechanism is consistent with the presence of HIV-infected macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques of HAART-treated patients observed in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040365-g008">Figure 8</xref>). However, further in vivo and clinical studies are required to evaluate the contribution of the impairment of reverse cholesterol transport to the risk of atherosclerosis in HIV patients.</p><p>Findings presented in this report provide an example of how viruses may interfere with cellular cholesterol metabolism and may potentially affect the risk of atherosclerosis. This example may be not unique to HIV. Other viruses (such as Herpes virus or CMV) were found in atherosclerotic plaques and were epidemiologically associated with elevated risk of development of atherosclerosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b064">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d;. Future studies will determine whether these viruses cause disturbances in cholesterol metabolism similar to those found in this report. In support of this possibility, several reports demonstrated that bacterial and viral pathogens may modulate macrophage cholesterol efflux by down-regulating ABC transporters via LXR-dependent &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d; and LXR-independent &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040365-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; pathways.
