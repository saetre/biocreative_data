Crosses between diploid and tetraploid individuals of the same genotype can result in F1 lethality, and this dosage-sensitive incompatibility plays a role in polyploid speciation.

The molecular mechanisms underlying this response, however, are not understood. In plants, an example of F1 lethality occurs when progeny from crosses between newly formed polyploid individuals and their diploid progenitors fail during seed development. This lethality arises in the absence of any allelic diversity due to the difference in the dosage of genomes provided by the parents. The strength of this reproductive isolation can vary within species and between individuals of the same species, and has long been known to contribute to speciation. Yet, we understand neither the genetic basis of this barrier nor the source of variation within and between species</p><p>Fertilizations between haploid and diploid gametes can occur in diploid species due to meiotic errors that produce unreduced (2n) gametes.

In species without strong postzygotic lethality in interploidy crosses, polyploid derivatives can be formed via the fusion of a single unreduced gamete with a normal haploid gamete.

In interploidy hybrids, doubling the genome of only one parent upsets this balance and can result in seed lethality. Remarkably, species vary in the combining valence of their genomes such that some interspecies crosses are more successful when individuals of divergent ploidy are crossed. The term endosperm balance number (EBN) was proposed to describe the pattern of dosage-dependent incompatibility intrinsic to each species or accession &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060308-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.

The interploidy barrier is also affected by the direction of the cross, with maternal excess crosses, e.g., 4x &#x000d7; 2x, typically resulting in less postzygotic lethality than paternal excess (2x &#x000d7; 4x) crosses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060308-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.

Such differential contributions could derive from gene expression in the maternal sporophyte, gametophytes (embryo sac or pollen), or endosperm, or from parentally skewed expression in embryo tissue. There is, as of yet, no practical verification of these possibilities as contributors to postzygotic isolation. Nevertheless, genes exhibit parent-dependent effects on seed development by mechanisms other than imprinting. For instance, altering the genotype of the female gametophyte can result in growth and differentiation of the seed coat in the absence of fertilization &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060308-b059">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060308-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;.

Temperatures were set for 18 &#x000b0;C at night to 21 &#x000b0;C during the day, but varied with atmospheric conditions. All other experiments were carried out in controlled chamber conditions under 16:8-h light:dark and 21:18 &#x000b0;C day:night temperatures. Crosses for the RIL, BC1, and TRD experiments were performed by emasculating inflorescences by removing all organs from the outer three whorls with jewelers forceps. Crosses to the STAIRS were done by removing only the stamens and pollinating 2 d after emasculation. STAIRS and control crosses were grown at the University of Bath in a Sanyo controlled environment room with a day length of 16 h, at 23:18 &#x000b0;C day:night temperatures.

Three individuals from each RIL were crossed to 4x Col, and the numbers of plump and shriveled seeds were counted. The frequency of plump seeds for each individual was defined as the trait, and RIL means were computed from at least three replicates.
