Here we have investigated the genetic interactions between RBF/E2F and p53 pathways during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development. Unexpectedly, we find that the pro-apoptotic activities of E2F and p53 are independent of one another when examined in the context of <italic>Drosophila</italic> development: apoptosis induced by the deregulation of dE2F1, or by the overexpression of dE2F1, is unaffected by the elimination of dp53; conversely, dp53-induced phenotypes are unaffected by the elimination of dE2F activity. However, dE2F and dp53 converge in the context of a DNA damage response. Both dE2F1/dDP and dp53 are required for DNA damage-induced cell death, and the analysis of <italic>rbf1</italic> mutant eye discs indicates that dE2F1/dDP and dp53 cooperatively promote cell death in irradiated discs. In this context, the further deregulation in the expression of pro-apoptotic genes generates an additional sensitivity to apoptosis that requires both dE2F/dDP and dp53 activity. This sensitivity differs from DNA damage-induced apoptosis in wild-type discs (and from dE2F/dDP-induced apoptosis in un-irradiated <italic>rbf1</italic> mutant eye discs) by being dependent on both <italic>hid</italic> and <italic>reaper</italic>. These results show that pro-apoptotic activities of dE2F1 and dp53 are surprisingly separable: <italic>dp53</italic> is required for dE2F-dependent apoptosis in the response to DNA damage, but it is not required for dE2F-dependent apoptosis caused simply by the inactivation of <italic>rbf1</italic>.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="pgen-1000153-box001" position="float"><sec id="s1a"><title>Authors Summary</title><p>E2F1 and p53 are both activated in response to DNA damage and promote the expression of pro-apoptotic genes.

Remarkably, within the same disc, the wave of dE2F1/dDP-dependent apoptosis in the MF, that appears in the absence of irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000153-g002">Figure 2</xref>), was unaffected by the mutation of dp53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000153-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). These results show that irradiated <italic>rbf1</italic> mutant eye discs contain two distinct patterns of apoptosis: a developmentally induced wave of apoptosis that is dE2F1/dDP dependent but independent of dp53, and a hypersensitivity to DNA-damage induced apoptosis that depends on both dE2F1/dDP and dp53.

Potentially, dE2F1 and dp53 might regulate different pro-apoptotic genes and these targets could collectively promote cell death. Alternatively, dE2F1 and dp53 might converge on a common target that is critical for DNA damage-induced cell death. Previous studies have suggested that the pro-apoptotic genes <italic>hid</italic> and reaper are likely to be points of convergence between dp53 and dE2F1.

Studies in mammalian cells have led to the conclusion that, in many cellular contexts, E2F1 acts upstream of p53. In the experiments described above we show that while homologs of p53 and E2F1 exist in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> the functional relationship between dp53 and dE2F1 is different from that seen in mammalian cells. Epistasis experiments demonstrate that <italic>de2f1</italic>-induced apoptosis does not require <italic>dp53</italic>, and that <italic>dp53</italic>-induced apoptosis does not require dE2F activity. Consequently, animal phenotypes caused by the over-expression of <italic>de2f1</italic> and attributable to <italic>de2f1</italic>-induced apoptosis are unaffected by mutation of <italic>dp53</italic>. However, we do find that, like in mammals, dE2F1 can cooperate with dp53 to promote DNA damage-induced cell death.</p><p>It is satisfying when homologous genes have conserved functions, but it is perhaps more intriguing when they do not. Why are the genetic interactions between E2F1/dE2F1 and p53/dp53 so different between flies and humans? One general explanation is that <italic>de2f1</italic> and <italic>dp53</italic> are unique genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, whereas <italic>E2f1</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> are members of families of related mammalian genes. p53, p63 and p73 have distinct functions, as do E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3, and the roles of dp53 and dE2F1 may resemble the function of an ancestral protein, rather than the more specialized roles of the individual mammalian family members. A second, and more detailed explanation, is that a key connection between E2F1 and p53 is provided in mammalian cells by p19 (p14)/ARF and Mdm2. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome lacks clear homologs of either of these genes. Hence, a major pathway by which E2F1 induces p53 in mammalian cells is likely to be absent in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000153-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Although it is possible that functional homologues might exist in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the absence of genetic interaction presented in this study argues otherwise. Interestingly, <italic>dp53</italic> also fails to induce expression of <italic>dacapo</italic> (the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of p21<sup>CIP1</sup>) and also appears to be defective for G1/S checkpoint functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000153-Ollmann1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000153-Brodsky2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells arrest primarily at G2/M in response to DNA damage, and there is scant evidence for G1/S damage checkpoint in irradiated discs. Thus, while <italic>dp53</italic> is important for DNA-damage induced apoptosis, its activity appears to be largely uncoupled from some of the key sensors and effectors of mammalian p53 checkpoint pathways.</p><fig id="pgen-1000153-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000153.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>E2F and p53 network between mammals and flies.</title><p>In mammalian cells, the activation of E2F1 is sufficient to activate p53.

In the context of DNA damage, where dE2F1 and dp53 converge on a common set of pro-apoptotic target genes, dE2F1 and dp53 co-operate to promote cell death. While DNA damage is shown to activate E2F1 and p53 pathways in mammals, it remains uncertain whether dE2F1 is similarly activated by DNA damage.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000153.g007"/></fig><p>As seen in mammals, the expression of critical pro-apoptotic genes is regulated by both E2F and p53 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The convergence of dE2F1 and dp53 on common target genes provides a simple molecular explanation for how dE2F1 and dp53 cooperate to promote DNA damage-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000153-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Our result indicates that elevated dE2F1 activity can influence the basal level of <italic>hid</italic> and <italic>reaper</italic> expression while dp53 is essential for the induction of gene expression after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000153-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). This difference in the physiological context in which they function may explain why dE2F1 and dp53 proteins act independently of one another and appear to function in parallel pathways. Interestingly, the levels of <italic>hid</italic> and <italic>reaper</italic> expression before irradiation were unaffected by mutation of <italic>dDP</italic>. This indicates that dE2F1 does not contribute to the basal expression of these pro-apoptotic genes. This is somewhat expected since <italic>hid</italic> and <italic>reaper</italic> are not expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner and are likely to be expressed at a low level in the absence of stress. Moreover, since <italic>hid</italic> and <italic>reaper</italic> are induced at a similar level between control and dDP mutant eye discs after irradiation, there must be other apoptotic genes regulated by dE2F that are responsible for the insensitivity to DNA damage in <italic>dDP</italic> mutant eye discs. Precisely how dE2F1 and dp53 synergize in transcriptional regulation is unclear. The effects of dE2F1 and dp53 on the transcription of these targets may include both direct effects at the promoter and indirect effects on the organization of the larger H99 locus.
