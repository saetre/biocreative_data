Homozygous <italic>Cthrc1</italic> mutant mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratio and grew normally in comparison with their wild-type littermates (data not shown). X-gal staining of heterozygous <italic>Cthrc1</italic> mutant embryos revealed the expression of <italic>Cthrc1</italic> in bone-forming tissues in E12.5 embryos and in bones and periarticular cartilages in E16.5 embryos, which corresponded to the results of <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003174-g001">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003174.s002">Figure S2A</xref>).

However, histological analyses of decalcified adult bone tissues revealed that the number and thickness of trabecular bones were reduced in <italic>Cthrc1</italic>-null mice, compared with their wild-type littermates (data not shown). This result suggested that Cthrc1 may regulate bone remodeling postnatally. To test this hypothesis, we performed bone histomorphometric analyses and microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) analyses of 2-month-old <italic>Cthrc1</italic>-null and wild-type mice. Micro-CT analyses of tibiae showed that the trabecular bone mass in <italic>Cthrc1</italic>-null mice was approximately 70&#x00025; of that in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003174-g002">Figure 2 A and B</xref>). Bone histomorphometric and micro-CT analyses showed a significant decrease in trabecular number (Tb.N) and osteoblast number (Ob.N/BS) in <italic>Cthrc1</italic>-null mice, while trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive osteoclast number (Oc.N/BS) had no change in <italic>Cthrc1</italic>-null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003174-g002">Figure 2C&#x02013;E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003174.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). In addition, the osteoblast surface (Ob.S/BS) in <italic>Cthrc1</italic>-null mice, which represents the proportion of the bone surface covered with osteoblasts, was approximately 40&#x00025; less than that in wild-type mice, and the osteoclast surface (Oc.S/BS), which represents the proportion of the bone surface covered with osteoclasts, showed no significant difference between <italic>Cthrc1</italic>-null and wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003174-g002">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003174.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). To analyze osteoblast proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed BrdU incorporation assays in the calvaria of <italic>Cthrc1</italic>-null and wild-type littermates, and found that the percentage of proliferating cells was decreased by approximately 30&#x00025; in <italic>Cthrc1</italic>-null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003174-g002">Figure 2G</xref>).

In addition, there are discrepancies of phenotypes between <italic>Cthrc1</italic> transgenic mice which we generated in this study and the transgenic mice overexpressing <italic>Cthrc1</italic> previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003174-LeClair1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. First, transgenic mice we generated display a high-bone-mass phenotype, whereas transgenic mice previously reported show an osteopenic phenotype. Second, transgenic mice previously reported are smaller in size and have a higher rate of postnatal mortality, whereas transgenic mice we generated are fertile and normal in appearance and body weight. A possible explanation for these discrepancies is that transgenic mice we generated overexpress <italic>Cthrc1</italic> specifically in osteoblasts under the control of the <italic>Col1a1</italic> 2.3kb osteoblast-specific promoter to focus on the function of Cthrc1 in bones, while transgenic mice previously reported ubiquitously overexpress <italic>Cthrc1</italic> under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter.</p><p>Ovariectomy leads to a deficit in bone mineral densities due to cortical bone modeling and resorption of cancellous bone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003174-Wronski1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003174-Turner1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. This change largely results in severe cancellous osteopenia.

Furthermore, a recent study showed that selective ablation of estrogen receptor &#x003b1; in differentiated osteoclasts induced trabecular bone loss, similar to the osteoporotic bone phenotype, caused by inhibition of osteoclast apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003174-Nakamura1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, ovariectomy-induced bone loss, a model of postmenopausal osteoporosis, results from an acceleration of osteoclastic bone resorption, followed by high bone turnover in which bone resorption exceeds bone formation. <italic>Cthrc1</italic>-null mice exhibit cancellous bone loss, and <italic>Cthrc1</italic> transgenic mice increase cancellous bone with no change in osteoclastic bone resorption. In addition, Cthrc1 stimulates osteoblast proliferation and differentiation and increases bone formation rates, suggesting that Cthrc1 prevents cancellous bone loss in ovariectomized mice by stimulating osteoblastic bone formation. Indeed, bone volume and trabecular number in OVX transgenic mice were higher than those in OVX wild-type mice, and the loss of trabecular thickness by ovariectomy was protected in transgenic mice. Moreover, increased bone formation rates in transgenic mice were maintained after OVX. Considering that Cthrc1 does not affect osteoclastogenesis, enhanced bone formation by overexpression of Cthrc1 may attenuate bone loss caused by enhanced osteoclastic bone resorption induced by OVX.</p><p>It is noteworthy in this article that Cthrc1 may have a potential role in treating osteoporosis, because we observed that osteoblast-specific overexpression of <italic>Cthrc1</italic> in mice attenuates bone loss which is induced by OVX, an accepted preclinical disease model of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The function of Cthrc1 as a stimulator of bone formation without affecting bone resorption is very promising, because most types of drugs which are currently used for the treatment of osteoporosis are antiresorptive in nature and insufficient for restoring bone volume in osteoporotic patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003174-Rodan1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.
