The advantages of the retinal model system arise from the capacity for in vivo and in vitro analyses, the limited number of neurons and glial cell types comprising the mature retina, and the high degree of conservation of many developmental signaling mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donovan and Dyer, 2005</xref>). The retinal cell types are derived in a temporal sequence from a common pool of multipotent progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Young, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cepko et al., 1996</xref>). This conserved birth order is dependent on both intrinsic changes in competence of progenitor cells as well as cellular responses to environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Waid and McLoon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belliveau et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang and Yang, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cayouette et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway is a highly conserved cell extrinsic regulator of progenitor cell proliferation and diversification in many tissues, including the developing CNS and neural retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marti and Bovolenta, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dakubo and Wallace, 2004</xref>). Patched (Ptch) is the transmembrane receptor for Shh and normally antagonizes the activity of the transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo), which is required for the activation of the Gli zinc finger transcription factors. Shh binding to Ptch alleviates the Ptch-mediated repression of Smo, allowing activation of Gli transcription factors and expression of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Villavicencio et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>In the mouse retina, Shh is secreted from postmitotic retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and targets retinal progenitor cells (RPCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). Activation of the Shh pathway increases the proliferation of RPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jensen and Wallace, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levine et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Black et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moshiri and Reh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moshiri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2005</xref>), whereas conditional inactivation of <italic>Shh</italic> results in decreased numbers of progenitor cells, confirming a role for Shh in RPC proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). Genetic ablation of <italic>Shh</italic> in the embryonic mouse retina also results in increased RGC production, revealing a role for Shh signaling in cell fate regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). During later stages of retinal development, loss of Shh signaling results in a reduction of M&#x000fc;ller glial cells and bipolar neurons, which is only restored with Shh pathway activation, indicating a potential instructive role for Shh in specifying cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). Few Gli target genes important for these Shh-induced cellular responses have been identified. Cyclin D1, the major D-type cyclin expressed in the retina, is a reported target of Shh signaling during retinal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Locker et al., 2006</xref>). However, loss of <italic>Cyclin D1</italic> in the retina does not recapitulate the cell fate changes observed with loss of Shh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 1998</xref>), which indicates that other unidentified targets of Shh/Gli signaling are necessary for establishing Shh-dependent effects.</p><p>Hes1 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) repressor and functions as a target of Notch signaling, a pathway that plays a key role in maintaining neural progenitor identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kageyama et al., 2005</xref>). There are several redundant functions of Shh and Hes1 during CNS and retinal development that suggest convergence of these pathways. For example, Hes1 has been implicated in regulating cell cycling in the chick retina and M&#x000fc;ller cell development in the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Furukawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takatsuka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hashimoto et al., 2006</xref>). Also, the retinas of <italic>Hes1</italic> and <italic>Shh</italic> mutants are phenotypically similar, as both are characterized by an increased production of RGCs, precocious cell cycle exit, and depletion of RPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takatsuka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, conditional <italic>Notch1</italic> mouse mutants are characterized by a propensity to develop cone photoreceptors without an increase in RGC development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jadhav et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yaron et al., 2006</xref>). The differing phenotypes resulting from loss of <italic>Notch</italic> and <italic>Hes1</italic> in the retina suggest that Hes1 may have Notch-independent roles in retinal development. Furthermore, preliminary observations indicate that Shh signaling may influence the maintenance of <italic>Hes1</italic> expression in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Here, we establish a novel, Shh-dependent regulatory mechanism for controlling neural progenitor cell behavior. Inhibition of Hes1 activity results in a decrease in RPC proliferation as well as a disruption of neuronal cell development in response to Shh pathway activation. Furthermore, the increased proliferation characterizing <italic>PtchlacZ</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> retinas is rescued in compound <italic>PtchlacZ</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Hes1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> heterozygous mice, which suggests that <italic>Hes1</italic> is epistatic to <italic>Ptch</italic> and is required to potentiate the proliferative response induced by the Shh pathway in vivo. We show that modulation of <italic>Hes1</italic> by Shh requires signaling through the activator Gli2 and is independent of the Notch pathway. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis suggests that <italic>Hes1</italic> is a Shh-dependent, direct transcriptional target of Gli2. Thus, we have identified a novel mechanism linking Shh, Gli2, and Hes1 that is important for controlling neural progenitor cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Hes1 is activated by Shh signaling in a temporally regulated manner</title><p>To investigate the Shh dependence of <italic>Hes</italic> gene expression in RPCs, we used retina organ cultures (explants) derived from postnatal mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>). Key features of normal retinal development, including critical cell fate decisions, are recapitulated in retinal cell explant cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). We have shown previously that Shh induction of target genes is abolished in postnatal mouse retinal explants due to the death of Shh-secreting RGCs because of a lack of trophic support from target tissues in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). We treated retinal explants with a Smo agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frank-Kamenetsky et al., 2002</xref>), which restores Hedgehog (Hh) target gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2005</xref>), and analyzed <italic>Hes</italic> induction by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). Activation of the Shh pathway in retinal explants derived from postnatal mice results in an &#x0223c;20-fold induction of <italic>Hes1</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 b</xref>). Interestingly, Shh signaling in explants cultured from embryonic day 14 (E14) retinas resulted in only a twofold induction of <italic>Hes1</italic> mRNA, which indicates temporal regulation of the magnitude of <italic>Hes1</italic> expression by the Shh pathway. The modest induction of <italic>Hes1</italic> at E14 is not caused by a lack of progenitor cell competence to respond to Shh because the Hh target gene, <italic>Gli1</italic>, is potently activated by Shh in both E14 and postnatal retinal explants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 b</xref>). These data indicate that <italic>Hes1</italic> is inducible by Shh signaling at developmental stages when Shh is regulating both RGC development and RPC proliferation. A similar temporal regulatory pattern was observed for <italic>Hes5</italic> in response to Shh signaling. Shh activation resulted in a fivefold induction of <italic>Hes5</italic> mRNA in postnatal retinal explants, whereas no significant induction was observed in E14 explants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 b</xref>). Shh pathway activation also results in stabilization of Hes1 protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 c</xref>), whereas Hes1 protein was undetectable in untreated explants devoid of Shh ligand, which indicates that an active Hh pathway is necessary for the maintenance of Hes1 in RPCs.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Shh is required to maintain Hes1 protein and mRNA in postnatal retinal explants.</bold> (a) Diagram of the retinal explant culture method.

To address whether Shh induction of <italic>Hes1</italic> and <italic>Hes5</italic> requires Notch signaling, we used a widely used chemical inhibitor of the &#x003b3;-secretase complex, <italic>N</italic>-[<italic>N</italic>-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-<sc>l</sc>-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), to inhibit propagation of the Notch pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geling et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>Hes5</italic>, which is robustly expressed in untreated retinal explants, was used as a read-out for Notch signaling. <italic>Hes5</italic> was down-regulated in DAPT-treated retinal explants, which verifies Notch inactivation with DAPT treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, m and o</xref>) and is consistent with previous reports showing the Notch dependence of <italic>Hes5</italic> expression in RPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nelson et al., 2007</xref>). Activation of the Hh pathway was accomplished using a constitutively active allele of Smo (Smo-M2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xie et al., 1998</xref>). Transfection of RPCs was accomplished using electroporation of transgenes in retinal explants. It has been previously found that transfection efficiency of postmitotic cells in electroporated retinal explants is very low, which indicates that dividing cells are the primary targets for electroporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matsuda and Cepko, 2004</xref>). Retinal explants were coelectroporated with Smo-M2 and pUb-GFP to localize the transfected cells, and simultaneously treated with DAPT for Notch pathway inactivation. In situ hybridization (ISH) for <italic>Gli1</italic> confirmed Shh pathway activation in response to Smo-M2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, f and h</xref>). Induction of Shh signaling with SMO-M2 resulted in a cell-autonomous increase in <italic>Hes1</italic> and <italic>Hes5</italic> mRNA in the presence of DAPT, which indicates that Shh activation of these genes is independent of the NICD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, l and p</xref>). It is also noteworthy that control retinal explants electroporated with pUb-GFP, which do not exhibit Shh signaling, do not have detectable <italic>Hes1</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 i</xref>). Because endogenous <italic>Hes5</italic> expression is lost with DAPT treatment, this suggests that Notch signaling is active in control retinal explants yet insufficient to maintain <italic>Hes1</italic> expression.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Shh activation of <italic>Hes1</italic> and <italic>Hes5</italic> is independent of Notch signaling.</bold> Retinas at P0 were electroporated with SMO-M2 cotransfected with pUB-GFP or pUB-GFP alone and cultured for 3 d with DAPT or DMSO control.

ISH analysis revealed a marked reduction in <italic>RBPJ-&#x003ba;</italic> mRNA in transfected cells, which was also associated with a cell-autonomous reduction of <italic>Hes5</italic> mRNA, which provides additional confirmation of the specificity of the knockdown (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, f and l</xref>).

However, the Shh pathway is unable to induce <italic>Hes5</italic> in cells expressing the shRBPJ-&#x003ba; construct (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 l</xref>).

Also, inhibition of the Notch pathway in chick retinal explants results in a weak reduction of <italic>Hes1</italic> expression and a much more potent reduction in <italic>Hes5</italic> levels, which is further evidence for Notch-independent <italic>Hes1</italic> regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nelson et al., 2007</xref>). Shh treatment of cerebellar granule precursors results in induction of <italic>Hes1</italic>, which suggests a more general role for Shh in the regulation of <italic>Hes1</italic> in CNS development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Solecki et al., 2001</xref>). Here, we show that Gli2 is a novel regulator of <italic>Hes1</italic> expression and that Hes1 is a novel mediator of Shh-mediated proliferation in neural progenitors. Surprisingly, we have observed a differential mechanism for Shh-mediated regulation of <italic>Hes1</italic> and <italic>Hes5</italic>. Induction of <italic>Hes5</italic> is independent of Notch; however, it requires signaling by RBPJ-&#x003ba;, suggesting that RBPJ-&#x003ba; can function independently of Notch downstream of Shh activation. To date, Notch-independent RBPJ-&#x003ba; activity has only been reported in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> mechanoreceptor physiology, mouse pancreas development, and the specification of GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barolo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beres et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hori et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The requirement for both Shh- and Notch-driven regulation of <italic>Hes1</italic> in progenitor cells may be explained by several hypotheses. First, Shh and Notch could be targeting different progenitor populations. A recent study has shown that the activated NICD is heterogeneously expressed in subsets of progenitors in the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nelson et al., 2007</xref>), which implies that not all progenitors are responsive to activated Notch signaling. Second, progenitor cells are sensitive to Hes1 dosage; therefore, Notch and Shh signaling may be required to achieve the spectrum of Hes1 levels needed for cell fate specification and proliferation. For example, <italic>Hes1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> retinas exhibit accelerated rod photoreceptor differentiation without the proliferative or RGC phenotype characterizing <italic>Hes1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takatsuka et al., 2004</xref>). Also, the decision to adopt an RGC fate is dependent on levels of proneuronal bHLHs NGN2 and Math5 as well as Hes1, with high levels of Hes1 antagonizing Math5 expression and function and thereby inhibiting the RGC fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matter-Sadzinski et al., 2005</xref>). Mechanistically, oscillation in Hes1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirata et al., 2002</xref>) could be one way to achieve functionally relevant modulations in Hes1 levels in progenitor cells. Notch-induced Hes1 oscillation is required for the maintenance of neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shimojo et al., 2008</xref>), and it is conceivable that the effects of Hh signaling on Hes1 expression could be mediated by a similar mechanism. Further analysis is necessary to determine the mode of Hes1 expression in the context of Hh pathway activation.</p><p>We have identified a direct interaction of Gli2 and <italic>Hes1</italic> at two Gli consensus sites in the <italic>Hes1</italic> promoter. In these studies, we obtained strong evidence for a direct effect because ChIP analysis using primary RPCs revealed Shh-dependent recruitment of Gli2 to the <italic>Hes1</italic> promoter in vivo. These findings, coupled with our strong genetic evidence linking Shh to <italic>Hes1</italic>, provide the first example of an interaction between Gli2 signaling and <italic>Hes1</italic> expression, and the first example of the importance of this mechanism in the regulation of progenitor cell proliferation. Our findings also raise the possibility that Gli2-dependent regulation of proliferation in other tissues could function with a similar mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matise et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corrales et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Palma and Ruiz i Altaba, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hutchin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to activator Gli1 and Gli2 function, the Gli3 transcription factor is also a mediator of the Shh pathway, and it functions to repress target genes in the absence of Shh signaling.

The induction of <italic>hairy</italic> in response to Hh requires Cubitus interruptus (Ci), the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> homologue of Gli, and dorsal/ventral expression of <italic>hairy</italic> is lost in Smo-deficient clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hays et al., 1999</xref>). Patterning of the retinal field during development of the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> compound eye also reveals Notch-independent regulation of hairy by Hh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu and Baker, 2003</xref>). In this system, both Hh and Notch negatively regulate <italic>hairy</italic> expression to promote a wave of photoreceptor differentiation.</p><p>In this study, we have elucidated a novel mechanism for Shh-controlled progenitor cell behavior. Our observation that Gli2 occupies the <italic>Hes1</italic> promoter is one of the first identified direct relationships between Gli2 and a target gene in neural progenitor cells. This study provides a mechanistic link between Shh-Gli2 signaling and Hes1 in regulating the proliferation of RPCs, thereby shedding light on a new means of manipulating Shh-induced cellular responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Transgenic mice</title><p>Several transgenic mouse lines were used in this study. <italic>PtchlacZ<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goodrich et al., 1997</xref>) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory and maintained on a C57Bl6 background; <italic>Gli1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>Gli2<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice (obtained from A.
