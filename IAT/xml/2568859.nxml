The bHLHZ-like structure of ArntbHLH-C/EBP comprises the Arnt bHLH domain fused to the C/EBP LZ: i.e. swap of the 330 aa PAS domain for the 29 aa LZ. In the yeast one-hybrid assay (Y1H), transcriptional activation from the E-box was strong by ArntbHLH-C/EBP, and undetectable for the truncated ArntbHLH (PAS removed), as detected <italic>via</italic> readout from the <italic>HIS3</italic> and <italic>lacZ</italic> reporters. In contrast, fluorescence anisotropy titrations showed affinities for the E-box with ArntbHLH-C/EBP and ArntbHLH comparable to other transcription factors (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> 148.9 nM and 40.2 nM, respectively), but only under select conditions that maintained folded protein. Although <italic>in vivo</italic> yeast results and <italic>in vitro</italic> spectroscopic studies for ArntbHLH-C/EBP targeting the E-box correlate well, the same does not hold for ArntbHLH. As circular dichroism confirms that ArntbHLH-C/EBP is a much more strongly &#x003b1;-helical structure than ArntbHLH, we conclude that the nonfunctional ArntbHLH in the Y1H must be due to misfolding, leading to the false negative that this protein is incapable of targeting the E-box. Many experiments, including protein design and selections from large libraries, depend on protein domains remaining well-behaved in the nonnative experimental environment, especially small motifs like the bHLH (60&#x02013;70 aa). Interestingly, a short helical LZ can serve as a folding- and/or solubility-enhancing tag, an important device given the focus of current research on exploration of vast networks of biomolecular interactions.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>We utilized our minimalist design strategy to reduce the size and structural complexity of native transcription factors while maximizing retention of DNA-binding function.

Because of the importance of E-box regulation, we applied our minimalist strategy toward design of simplified proteins that target the E-box based on the bZIP, bHLHZ, and bHLH/PAS scaffolds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003514-g001">Fig. 1</xref>): our aim is to generate smaller proteins of simplified structure compared to their native counterparts, while still retaining DNA-binding function. Compared with the native Arnt bHLH/PAS domain at over 400 amino acids (full-length Arnt is almost 1000 aa), our Arnt derivatives comprise 66 or 98 aa, and are therefore accessible by either chemical synthesis or bacterial expression.</p><fig id="pone-0003514-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003514.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic of minimalist design strategy.</title><p>By swapping the PAS domain (330 amino acids, teal) of native bHLH/PAS protein Arnt with the much smaller C/EBP leucine zipper (29 amino acids, green helices), a hybrid of the bHLH/PAS and bZIP families was generated and expected to be bHLHZ-like in structure while retaining native Arnt DNA-binding function. Schematic adapted from PDB data. Because no high-resolution structure of an entire bHLH/PAS domain exists, we connected the bHLH domain and PAS domain from different crystal structures and estimated reasonable linkages between the two domains. A single, monomeric PAS A and PAS B repeat was isolated in the Per PAS domain structure (PDB 1WA9) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003514-Yildiz1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>.

The PAS and bHLH domains are to scale, and we estimated their relative positioning.

The bHLH/PAS is even more complicated: the PAS domain comprises 330 aa, which in conjunction with the HLH, is involved in dimerization, structural stability, specification of heterodimerization partner, and ligand binding in response to environmental stimulus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003514-ChapmanSmith1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003514-Huffman1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

Such hybrids test our minimalist design strategy: we hypothesize that we can reduce the size and structural complexity of certain proteins and still retain DNA-binding function. Minimalist hybrids based on the Arnt homodimer may target the E-box and provide a means to modulate E-box regulation. Small proteins that are facile to produce by chemical synthesis or bacterial expression may serve as the basis for design of protein-based therapeutics targeting the Myc:E-box network.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Three proteins based on Arnt and C/EBP: bHLHZ, bHLH, and bZIP structures</title><p>To begin our study of how removal or modification of the HLH and PAS domains of Arnt affects its DNA-binding function, three hybrids based on the Arnt homodimer were designed to target E-box. We used the mammalian C/EBP leucine zipper, for it is well characterized and forms a strong homodimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003514-ONeil1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. The first protein, ArntbHLH-C/EBP, comprises the Arnt bHLH domain fused to the C/EBP LZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003514-g002">Fig. 2</xref>); swap of the Arnt PAS for the C/EBP LZ is a dramatic change, for the LZ is one-tenth the size of PAS.

This construct maintains alignment of the conserved leucines in the C/EBP LZ (Leu/hydrophobic amino acid every seven residues) with Leu142 and Ala135 in Helix 2 of Arnt that may be involved in the hydrophobic interface: hence, this hybrid was intended to mimic the bHLHZ structure of Max, in particular, the alignment of the hydrophobic dimerization interface. Thus, we expected ArntbHLH-C/EBP to be bHLHZ-like, with a seamless &#x003b1;-helix comprising Helix 2 and the C/EBP LZ as shown in the Max bHLHZ homodimer:E-box crystal structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003514-FerreDAmare1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003514-Brownlie1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0003514-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003514.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Sequences of hybrid proteins.</title><p>Max sequences are highlighted in blue, Arnt sequences in red, and C/EBP leucine zipper in green; different shades of blue or red highlight individual components of Max and Arnt.

We measured CD under several different buffer conditions, including the presence or absence of urea or nonspecific calf thymus DNA (at the same concentrations used in FA titrations), and consistently found ArntbHLH-C/EBP to possess more intrinsic helicity than ArntbHLH, which showed very little helical, folded structure (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003514.s004">Fig. S4</xref> for CD under other conditions). Addition of urea decreased structure somewhat for both proteins, but did not change the observation that ArntbHLH-C/EBP is strongly helical and ArntbHLH lacks intrinsic structure. We considered whether nonspecific DNA might induce helical structure, in particular, as a means for improving the folded structure of a weakly folded protein like ArntbHLH. Addition of nonspecific DNA increased the helical structure of ArntbHLH, so the presence of the DNA ligand may assist folding and stability in this intrinsically unstructured protein, and hence, the low <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value measured for ArntbHLH binding to the E-box. We might surmise that genomic DNA in the yeast cell would also serve the same purpose, but no activation from the E-box by ArntbHLH was detected in the Y1H.

We often also expect that these shorter, seemingly well-folded structures, such as the &#x003b1;-helical transcription factors examined here, will be folded and stable without assistance from chaperones or heat-shock proteins and in an artifically chosen environment, whether <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic>. As demonstrated here, such long-held assumptions about protein structure and function may lead to a false conclusion, where in fact, the negative observation can be attributed simply to a nonfunctional protein structure under particular experimental conditions.</p><p>Perhaps it is easy to view a high-resolution crystal structure, for instance, as <italic>the</italic> protein structure, as we do not actually know how dynamic the protein is, how varied the different conformations are, and how much of the time the protein structure is as the high-resolution picture depicts. Even the seemingly straightforward bZIP structure has proven too dynamic for high-resolution <italic>solution</italic> studies. The GCN4 bZIP basic region is disordered until binding to DNA: both NMR and CD demonstrate that while the leucine zipper is intrinsically stable and helical, the basic region remains only loosely helical until binding to DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003514-Saudek1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003514-Hollenbeck1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. In NMR studies on the GCN4 bZIP:AP-1 complex, Palmer and coworkers found that although the GCN4 basic region is substantially helical, it is highly dynamic in the DNA major groove <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003514-Bracken1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. The only high-resolution structures of the bZIP:DNA complex have, therefore, been obtained by crystallography; we note that the same holds true for bHLH and bHLHZ proteins, as well, likely due to the basic region these motifs share in common. Thus, we conclude that some transcription factor families are highly dynamic, even when bound to the DNA ligand, and their structures cannot be captured by high-resolution solution techniques.</p><p>In a recent historical perspective, Alan Fersht emphasized that as much as 40&#x00025; of proteins in the human proteome are estimated to be intrinsically disordered and may become more or fully folded upon binding their specific cellular ligand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003514-Fersht1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>: hence, the highly dynamic nature of protein structure. The possibility of Nature using unstable protein structures as a means for performing a wide variety of functions in the cell is not only intriguing, but also highlights the unpredictability inherent in protein research, whether <italic>de novo</italic> protein design or searching libraries of proteins or protein fragments. Given these challenges, Fersht notes that the most effective protein design strategies incorporate what Nature has already devised, but even so, we demonstrate that our design, which is based on native structures, behaved very differently when assayed by various techniques.</p><p>As demonstrated here, the discrepancy between <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> measurements could be clearly ascribed to misfolding of the protein under question; other researchers also reported similar problems with folding and solubility in their Max and Arnt derivatives. Quite often, solubility-enhancing tags are fused to proteins, whether they are being screened <italic>in vivo</italic> or overexpressed for large-scale <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, and these tags can be large. The only difference between ArntbHLH and ArntbHLH-C/EBP is the 29 aa C/EBP LZ, whether expressed in the Y1H or produced by bacterial expression for quantitative examination. Thus, even a small &#x003b1;-helix can enhance protein folding and stability; we used a leucine zipper in these studies, and likely a more hydrophilic, yet well folded, &#x003b1;-helix would serve as a better folding- and solubility-enhancing tag.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Construction of the <italic>HIS3</italic> Reporter Strain YM4271&#x0005b;pHisi-1/E-box&#x0005d;</title><p>100 ng of each of the two complementary 30 bp oligonucleotides, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-AATT<underline>C CACGTG CACGTG CACGTG CACGTG T</underline>-3&#x02032;</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-CTAG<underline>A CACGTG CACGTG CACGTG CACGTG G</underline>-3&#x02032;</named-content> with 26 bp overlap underlined, were annealed by heating at 70&#x000b0;C for 5 min (in 50 mM NaCl, 10 &#x000b5;L reaction volume) and slowly cooled to room temperature.

Traces above show protein after the first purification by immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography with TALON (Clontech), which significantly purifies the proteins. The second purification is with HPLC. In the above preparative traces, only the major peak is collected, so the shoulders are removed. ESI-MS confirms the identity of the major peak as being either (A) ArntbHLH or (B) ArntbHLH-C/EBP, both monitored at 220 nm. Thus, a high level of purity of proteins is used in the FA assays. Each protein was purified by HPLC (Beckman System Gold) on a semipreparative reversed-phase C4 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) with a gradient of acetonitrile-water plus 0.05&#x00025; trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) at flow rate 4 mL/min; the gradient started at 10&#x02013;25&#x00025; acetonitrile over 15 min, followed by 25&#x02013;55&#x00025; acetonitrile over 60 min.</p><p>(1.13 MB
