It is hypothesized that pre-existing proteins evolved to bind and use guide RNA during evolution. However, the capacity of modern proteins to adopt new RNA guides has never been demonstrated. Here we show that Rnt1p, the yeast orthologue of the bacterial dsRNA-specific RNase III, can bind short RNA transcripts and use them as guides for sequence-specific cleavage. Target cleavage occurred at a constant distance from the Rnt1p binding site, leaving the guide RNA intact for subsequent cleavage. Our results indicate that RNase III may trigger sequence-specific RNA degradation independent of the RNAi machinery, and they open the road for a new generation of precise RNA silencing tools that do not trigger a dsRNA-mediated immune response.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The capacity of short RNA duplexes to direct sequence-specific RNA degradation provides an almost universal tool for design-based gene silencing.

In order to determine the minimum length of the RNA duplex required for Rnt1p cleavage, we generated a series of RNA transcripts with a fixed tetraloop sequence but with different single and double-stranded RNA lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The sequence of the first three substrates was based on the Rnt1p cleavage signals found at the 3&#x02032;-end of U2 snRNA because it was previously shown that this RNA could be cleaved even when the cleavage site is unpaired<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-AbouElela1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The cleavage efficiencies of the different substrates were compared under single (trace RNA amount) and multiple (1:8 protein excess) turnover conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). As expected, the U2 3&#x02032;-end model substrate (U2C) was cleaved by Rnt1p in all conditions at the expected fixed distance 14 and 16 nucleotides from the terminal tetraloop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Deletion of the nucleotides in the stem at the 3&#x02032;-end of the tetraloop (U2LE), which leaves an eleven base-pair stem linked to an 18 nucleotide-5&#x02032; extension, was cleaved by Rnt1p once at 14 nts from the terminal tetraloop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Similarly, the deletion of the 5&#x02032;-end (U2RI) did not inhibit the cleavage at the 3&#x02032;-end extension. The cleavage kinetics of these different substrates indicate that reducing the duplex length reduces Rnt1p's turnover but increases catalytic efficiency (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000472-t001">Table 1</xref>). These data confirm that Rnt1p can cleave single-stranded RNA and suggests that long RNA duplexes are not required for cleavage.</p><p>RNA footprinting, chemical interference, and binding assays indicate that a minimum of a 5 bp stem capped with a NGNN tetraloop is required for Rnt1p binding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Ghazal2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Lamontagne4">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it is not clear whether the binding of this 5 bp short stem reflects the natural mechanism of substrate selection or arises from a non-specific or unproductive mode of binding. To differentiate between these two possibilities, we synthesized RNA substrates derived from a cleavage site with a known tertiary structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Lebars1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Chanfreau2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Interestingly, Rnt1p only cleaved substrates with two single-stranded RNA extensions (EL18-18 and EL18-15). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Additional assays using a variety of substrates indicated that a minimal 9 and 11 nucleotide extensions at the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-ends respectively are required for cleavage (data not shown). This indicates that RNA helices longer than 11 bp are not required for cleavage by Rnt1p.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Directing Rnt1p cleavage using an RNA guide</title><p>The capacity of Rnt1p to form a stable complex with short RNA hairpins underscores the capacity of this enzyme to form RNP complexes under certain conditions. Rnt1p/RNA complexes are catalytically active since they mediate cleavage when attached to single-stranded RNA extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This is reminiscent of known RNP complexes like the snoRNP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Kiss1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and the RISC complexes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Hammond1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> that use RNA as a guide to modify or cleave an independent RNA molecule <italic>in trans</italic>. Therefore, Rnt1p cleavage may also be guided by short RNA transcripts. To test this possibility, we generated RNA transcripts that contain an Rnt1p binding signal (5 bp stem) fused to RNA extensions complementary to the sequence of an independently transcribed single-stranded RNA fragment. One guide had long extensions (EL18-15) to allow cleavage in both guide and target RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) while the other had short extensions (EL9-11) to allow cleavage only in the target RNA (TL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). As expected, a gel shift assay indicated that both guides bound their 72 nts long RNA substrate (TL) with similar efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g002">Figures 2C and D</xref>). The short guide EL9-11 readily formed a complex with its targeted RNA, while the long guide EL18-15 formed complexes only when the RNA mixture was pre-heated. This suggests that 20 nt long complementarities between the guide (EL9-11) and its target RNA are sufficient for complex formation. On the other hand, additional extensions in the guide sequence may increase the chance of intramolecular secondary structure, which may occlude target identification.</p><p>The ability of both guides to direct Rnt1p cleavage was tested by incubating them with 5&#x02032;-end labeled target RNA (TL) and recombinant Rnt1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g002">Figures 2E and F</xref>). As shown, Rnt1p cleaved the substrate 14 nt from the guide tetraloop releasing a 33 nt product. However, no cleavage in the substrate was detected at the second predicted cleavage site 16 nt from the guide tetraloop (54 nt product). The inability of Rnt1p to cleave the second predicted cleavage site is not surprising since Rnt1p is known to bind to its substrate asymmetrically and is only tolerant of structural variations in one side of the tetraloop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Lamontagne2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Ghazal2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Lamontagne4">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. It is interesting to note that the uncleavable RNA guide (EL9-11) was more efficient in directing cleavage than the long cleavable RNA guide since uncleavable guide may be recycled to induce more than one round of target cleavage. We conclude that Rnt1p may use an RNA guide to cleave an independent RNA target.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>The guide RNA supports standard cleavage kinetics</title><p>The biological significance of the guide/Rnt1p complex and its potential as an effective tool for gene silencing depends on the cleavage efficiency of this complex. To evaluate the efficiency of the guide driven cleavage, we compared it to that generated using standard Rnt1p substrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Lamontagne3">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Binding and cleavage parameters were monitored using the EL9-11 guide, a shorter version that pairs with the target using only one 3&#x02032;-end extension (EL3&#x02032;-11), or a long 3&#x02032;-Branch based substrate allowing classical Rnt1p cleavage <italic>in cis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The RNA/protein complexes were resolved using a standard gel mobility shift assay, and complex formation was quantified and plotted as a factor of protein concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The classical substrate (3&#x02032;-Branch) and the guide RNA with two extensions (EL9-11) bound to Rnt1p with a similar apparent dissociation constant (K'<sub>d</sub>) of about 0.80 &#x000b5;M, while the guide RNA with only one single target complementary extension bound less efficiently with a K'<sub>d</sub> of 1.9 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000472-t001">Table 1</xref>). This data suggest that decreasing the single-stranded RNA extension length decreases the affinity to Rnt1p perhaps by inhibiting interactions fostered by deleted sequences.</p><p>The cleavage efficiencies of the different substrates were tested by incubating each of them with Rnt1p and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. The target RNA was labeled at the 5&#x02032;-end to track the product generation under low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) and physiological salt concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Rnt1p cleaved all three substrates at the predicted site 14 nts from the tetraloop with efficiency close to that of previously tested natural cleavage sites (regardless of the salt conditions)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Lamontagne1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Lamontagne3">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Lamontagne4">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The guide's ability to direct Rnt1p cleavage was dependent on the presence of the conserved NGNN tetraloop (data not shown). The cleavage kinetics induced by the EL3&#x02032;-11 were compared to that generated <italic>in cis</italic> within the 3&#x02032;-Branch RNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000472-t002">Table 2</xref>). Surprisingly, the guide-based cleavage exhibited about a 3-times higher K'<sub>M</sub> and a faster k<sub>cat</sub> than <italic>cis</italic> cleavage, while its specificity constant (k<sub>cat</sub>/K'<sub>M</sub>) was slightly reduced. We conclude that guide-mediated and classical Rnt1p substrates observe similar kinetic parameters.</p><p>Guide-induced RNA cleavage may be a unique feature of Rnt1p or it may be shared by other members of the RNase III family. We examined the guide's capacity to induce target cleavage by RNase IIIs from bacteria (RNase III), fission yeast (Pac 1) and human (Dicer) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g003">Figures 3C and D</xref>). As expected, all enzymes cleaved their natural substrates suggesting that all enzymes are active (data not shown). Interestingly, the different enzymes were capable of cleaving the 3&#x02032;-Branch at both salt concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g003">Figure 3C and D</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;5) albeit with different efficiencies. This suggests that most RNase IIIs can tolerate a three-way junction and may cleave substrates with less than 16 consecutive base pairs. However, only Rnt1p was able to cleave the 3&#x02032;-Branch substrate at a fixed distance from the NGNN tetraloop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g003">Figures 3C and D</xref>, lane 2 and data not shown). The guide RNA that forms 19 bp with the target sequence (EL9-11) induced cleavage by Rnt1p, bacterial RNase III, and Pac1 in both low and high salt concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g003">Figures 3C and D</xref>, lanes 7&#x02013;10). RNase III and Pac1 cleavages were not nucleotide or loop specific and the cleavage sites were different in different salt conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000472.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Surprisingly, at low salt concentration all enzymes cleaved the target RNA in the presence of EL3&#x02032;-11 that forms only 11 base pairs with the target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, lanes 12&#x02013;15). At high salt concentration, very little EL3&#x02032;-11 dependent cleavage was detected except when Rnt1p was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, lanes 12&#x02013;15). These data indicate that with the exception of Rnt1p, most RNase IIIs require a duplex longer than one turn of a helix to support intermolecular RNA cleavage.</p><p>To evaluate the potential of guide RNA <italic>in vivo</italic>, we tested its capacity to identify a given sequence in a natural mixture of yeast total RNA. The Rnt1p cleavage signal at the 3&#x02032;-end of pre-U2 snRNA was replaced by a sequence complementary to the EL3&#x02032;-11 guide and the new U2/target construct was expressed <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g003">Figure 3E</xref>).

Total RNA was extracted from yeast expressing the U2/target transcript and incubated <italic>in vitro</italic> with the guide EL3&#x02032;-11 and Rnt1p, bacterial RNase III, Pac1, or Dicer. The cleavage site in each case was visualized either by northern blot (data not shown) or by primer extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). The U2/target RNA was cleaved by Rnt1p producing a single nucleotide cleavage 14 nucleotides from the guide tetraloop as predicted. The failure of Pac1, bacterial RNase III, and Dicer to cleave the U2/target could be explained by problems in target accessibility or competition with other imperfect duplexes in the yeast transcriptome. We conclude that guide RNAs may specifically select Rnt1p targets in a complex mix of natural RNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>The guide RNA restores cleavage of mutated Rnt1p substrate <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Guide RNA's potential to regulate gene expression was evaluated by examining their capacity to restore cleavage to mutated Rnt1p cleavage site in both cell extract and in total RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The guide EL9-11 with 2 single stranded extensions did not cleave the U2/target in cell extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 3) and only induced very weak cleavage in total RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 7). In contrast, EL3&#x02032;-11 with 1 single-stranded extension induced strong cleavage in total RNA extracted from yeast (lane 8) but not in cell extract (lane 4). We reasoned that the weak activity in cell extracts was due to the guide instability. Indeed, labeled EL3&#x02032;-11 is readily degraded in cell extract (data not shown).

Moreover, Northern blot analysis indicated that as little as 1 nmol of EL3&#x02032;-11dT could induce the cleavage of up to 50&#x00025; of the U2/target in 20 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>In order to assay the guide activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, we had to establish a method for RNA transfection.

We monitored the generation of mature U2 snRNA from a transcript that depends on the guide EL3&#x02032;-11dT for cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). As expected, mainly mature U2 was detected in wild type cells (lane 2). In contrast, cells expressing U2/target accumulated unprocessed U2 and no mature 3&#x02032;-end was detected (lane 3). Electroporation of different concentrations of guide induced cleavage in the target sequence decreasing the amount of the U2/target precursors (top panel). A product cleaved at the primary cleavage site of Rnt1p<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-AbouElela1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> was detected in a guide-dependent manner (e.g. lanes 4&#x02013;8). However, only a small amount of mature 3&#x02032;-end was observed after the guide electroporation even after 2 hours (lanes 8&#x02013;10). Since the reduction in RNA precursors does not lead to corresponding accumulation of mature U2, we conclude that most of the guide-dependent cleavage events do not generate stable RNA. This data clearly demonstrate that the processing efficiency of non-coding RNA depends on the nature and timing of the endonucleolytic cleavage initiating the maturation process.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Guide-specific cleavage of natural RNAs</title><p>To evaluate the guide cleavage strategy as a tool for gene silencing, we designed and tested a series of guide RNAs targeting the branch site of U2 snRNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Ares1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g005">Figures 5A and B</xref>). Guides with different stem lengths and loop structures were used to demonstrate cleavage specificity (EU2dT, EU2&#x0002b;2bp and EU2&#x0002b;4bp). As expected, a guide RNA with a 5 bp stem and 11 nt complementary to the targeted U2 branch site (EU2dT) induced a substantial cleavage when incubated with total RNA and recombinant Rnt1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, lane 2). Increasing EU2dT stem length by two base pairs (EU2&#x0002b;2 bp) shifted cleavage by 2 nt (lane 3). Insertion of an additional 2 bp (EU2&#x0002b;4 bp) shifted cleavage further by two nucleotides, while strongly reducing cleavage efficiency (lane 4). The guide EU2&#x0002b;4 bp is long enough to be directly cleaved by Rnt1p <italic>in cis</italic> independent of the target, which explains the reduced efficiency of target cleavage. These results indicate that RNA guides may act as helical scales marking the distance to the cleavage site. As expected, guide RNA with a mutation in the conserved second base of the Rnt1p tetraloop (EU2dT/ACUC) blocked cleavage (lane 5). Mutations altering the guide homing sequence complementary to the target site (EU2dT/2M and EU2dT/4M) also blocked cleavage (lanes 6 and 7) confirming the cleavage specificity.</p><p>EU2dT was chosen for subsequent assays in cell extract and <italic>in vivo</italic> based on its performance in the <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage assay. Incubation of EU2dT with total RNA and recombinant Rnt1p or cell extract introduces a single cleavage site at the predicted distance from the loop within the U2 branch site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) indicating that this guide is both specific and stable even in the presence of total yeast RNA, proteins and ribonucleases. To accurately evaluate the value and efficiency of the guide RNA-mediated cleavage, we wanted to compare it to another enzymatic activity that targets sequence specific endonucleolytic cleavage <italic>in trans</italic>. RNase H DNA-mediated cleavage of RNA has been exploited as a tool for gene silencing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Vickers1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and is routinely used to cleave RNA <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Wintersberger1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we chose RNase H as a benchmark for evaluating the utility of Rnt1p. We directly compared the performance of Rnt1p/EU2dT to an RNase H/DNA oligonucleotide (EU2-DNA) targeting the same sequence in total RNA and cell extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Both oligonucleotides induced cleavage of the targeted U2 snRNA when present in total RNA (lanes 5 and 7). However, unlike with Rnt1p, the scissile bond of RNase H cleavage was difficult to predict. In cell extract, EU2dT induced the cleavage of a single phosphodiester bond (lane 10), while the EU2-DNA induced a heterogeneous cleavage pattern (lane 11). The comparatively higher precision of Rnt1p was confirmed by other experiments using guides and DNA oligonucleotides targeting a variety of RNA transcripts (data not shown). At high salt concentrations the Rnt1p guide may support structure sensitive cleavage like RNase H where only single-stranded RNA is cleaved, and thus it may be used as a probe for RNA structure (data not shown). However, unlike RNase H, Rnt1p guide may also act as an RNA restriction enzyme allowing structure independent cleavage at low salt concentration (data not shown) increasing its utility as gene silencer. We conclude that Rnt1p provides an effective alternative to RNase H as a probe for RNA structure and as an RNA restriction enzyme.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Inhibition of gene expression using guide RNAs</title><p>To examine the potential of Rnt1p guides as regulators of gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic>, we electroporated EU2dT guide into yeast cells and monitored both the transfection efficiency and the degradation of U2 snRNA. After electroporation, equal cellular distribution of 5&#x02032;-fluorescein labeled EU2dT (EU2dT-Fl) was observed in 53&#x000b1;8&#x00025; of the cells (data not shown). Therefore, the maximum expected inhibition level of the targeted RNA by any electroporated guide is about 50&#x00025;. Induction of U2 snRNA cleavage by EU2dT <italic>in vivo</italic> was monitored by primer extension. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g006">figure 6a</xref>, electroporation of EU2dT generated cleavage product after a 10 minute incubation. Increasing the incubation period resulted in the degradation of the cleavage product (lanes 3 to 7). Consistent with the estimated half-life of the guide RNA, the amount of intact U2 in treated cells was restored to pre-treatment levels after 2 hours of incubation. Mutations altering the Rnt1p binding site (EU2dT/ACUC) or the sequence complementary to U2 (EU2dT/2M and EU2dT/4M) blocked cleavage (lanes 10&#x02013;15) confirming the reaction specificity. Northern blot quantification demonstrated that more than 40&#x00025; of U2 RNA in electroporated cells was degraded after 10 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Increasing the incubation time beyond 30 minutes gradually restored U2 expression presumably due to the degradation of the guide. Moreover, transfection of mutated guide RNA left the level of U2 snRNA unchanged (data not shown). The capacity to degrade nearly half of the highly expressed U2 snRNA (200&#x02013;500 molecules per haploid cell<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Riedel1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>) in 10 minutes is a clear indication of the efficiency of the guide as a tool for gene regulation. We conclude that Rnt1p guides are efficient tools for nuclear site-directed RNA degradation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>RNAi and RNA turnover are often treated as two distinct mechanisms of gene regulation despite the fact that RNAi is in essence a process of targeted RNA degradation. The sequence specificity of RNAi-based gene silencing and its induction by small RNA <italic>in trans</italic> makes it appear quite different from the largely non-specific ribonuclease-based RNA degradation. In this study, we have shown that a classical endoribonuclease may use small RNA guides for sequence specific cleavage in analogy to the RNAi degradation mechanism. Rnt1p, a member of the RNase III family, was shown to form an RNP complex with a specific RNA hairpin and uses it to guide the cleavage of targeted RNA <italic>in trans</italic>. This feature allowed us to transform Rnt1p from a structure-based enzyme into a sequence-specific RNP, supporting evolutionary models explaining the origin of RNA guided protein complexes. The capacity of short and largely single-stranded RNA to guide RNase III cleavage demonstrates the flexibility and tremendous potential of these enzymes as regulators of gene expression.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Evolution of an RNA-protein complex</title><p>The debate about the evolutionary origin of RNA-protein complexes started soon after the discovery of the first catalytic RNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Davies1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The protein dominance of modern enzymatic activity led to the belief that RNAs are ancient relics of catalysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Cech1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. It was proposed that ancient RNA enzymes were taken over by gradually evolving proteins creating in the process several intermediates incorporating both RNA and proteins moieties<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Jeffares1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Poole1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. In this &#x0201c;RNA first&#x0201d; model of RNP, an RNA molecule with an established function would recruit a protein to enhance activity. However, the recent explosion in the discovery of small RNAs that guide protein functions ranging from rRNA modification to translation repression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Mattick1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> started to paint a different story. It is now argued that many guide RNAs including C/D and H/ACA box snoRNAs evolved from pre-existing RNA that acquired affinity for ancient proteins and used it to target their function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Lafontaine1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The &#x0201c;protein first&#x0201d; model of RNP argues that proteins with established functions scavenged non-functional or duplicated RNA transcripts for better or modified substrate specificity. The protein first model could be easily extended to components of the RNAi machinery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Tijsterman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> that includes classical ribonucleases like RNase III<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Lamontagne1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and small RNAs. Many small RNAs discarded from introns could guide sequence specific cleavage <italic>in trans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Lin1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. The ability of small RNA to guide cleavage by Rnt1p, the yeast orthologue of RNase III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000472-g002">Figure 2</xref>), directly supports the basic notion of the protein first model of RNP. Indeed, the work presented in this study shows that modern catalytically independent proteins like Rnt1p could easily be adapted for an RNP-like function. The kinetics of Rnt1p-guided cleavages indicated that the enzyme recycles to cleave several guide/target complexes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000472-t002">Table 2</xref>). This suggests that the artificial Rnt1p/guide complex is not as stable as known natural RNP complexes like snoRNPs for example. Therefore, if natural Rnt1p/guide complexes exist in yeast, they are probably stabilized by other protein chaperones or through RNA features that stabilizes the RNP complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Lafontaine1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it is not clear how established proteins would acquire the affinity for these novel RNAs. We propose that the maturation product that is normally wasted (e.g. hairpins generated as processing by-products) may be recycled into protein binding sites leading to the evolution of stable RNP complexes. Indeed, Rnt1p natural cleavage products possess the features necessary to function as guide RNAs. They contain intact Rnt1p binding sites and single stranded extensions that may function as homing devices<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-AbouElela1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Lamontagne3">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Lebars1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. To function, Rnt1p cleavage products only need protection from exonucleases and a target sequence to cleave. Indeed, vertebrate pri-miRNAs, which are essentially stem-loop structures similar to Rnt1p substrates, are processed by paralogues of RNase III, to mature into effective guides for RNA degradation and translation repression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Murchison1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Yeast transfection: New applications for an old model</title><p>Yeast is the most studied eukaryotic model mainly because of the powerful genetic and molecular biology tools available for both gene and genome analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Bartlett1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Madeo1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we present a method by which small RNA molecules could be transiently introduced into yeast and the effect on RNA could be monitored independent of any effects or limitations that often come with transformation based methods. In some cases, it is very difficult to express small RNA (100 nt or less) in yeast as RNA expression from a Pol II promoter often leads to transcript polyadenylation, transport to the cytoplasm and rapid degradation. Pol III based strategies are more successful but RNA with single-stranded ends are also rapidly degraded and require the addition of a special structure that may alter the anticipated RNA activity. Direct RNA electroporation circumvents most of these problems and may be used to identify new chemistry for oligonucleotide-based gene silencing or to study the kinetics of RNA degradation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Chemically modified RNA like the 2&#x02032;-O-methylribonucleotide form that is very popular for gene silencing in mammalian cells may now be successfully introduced using electroporation and could be tested for the first time in yeast.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>RNase IIIs tools for gene silencing</title><p>Currently, RNAi is the most successful method for design-based gene silencing. In vertebrates and many eukaryotes the introduction of short RNA duplex with sequence specific to any target genes of choice has various success rates. However, the main problem with this approach is target specificity and secondary effects triggered by the introduction of dsRNA or by the induction of the RNAi mechanism. In contrast, targeting RNA for cleavage using guide RNA uses a largely single-stranded RNA and introduces a single cleavage site that leads to RNA degradation using the normal degradation machinery (e.g. exosome). Thus, this method should reduce secondary effects associated with RNAi. In yeast, this method is restricted to nuclear RNA since Rnt1p is localized in the nucleus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Catala1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. The nuclear specificity of this approach distinguishes it from other available approaches that appear to be active in more than one cellular compartment. Similar nuclear degradation strategies in mammalian cells may also be envisioned. It is established that Drosha, the mammalian paralogue of Rnt1p, cleaves a stem-loop structure analogous to that of Rnt1p. Thus, it is possible to imagine a similar strategy using the Drosha recognition signal to direct cleavage in independent RNA species.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>Yeast was grown and manipulated according to standard procedures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Guthrie1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000472-Rose1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.
