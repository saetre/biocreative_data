An extracellular gelsolin isoform, plasma gelsolin circulates in the blood of healthy individuals at a concentration of 200 &#x000b1; 50 mg/L and has been suggested to be a key component of an extracellular actin-scavenging system during tissue damage. Levels of plasma gelsolin decrease during acute injury and inflammation, and administration of recombinant plasma gelsolin to animals improves outcomes following sepsis or burn injuries.

Differentially processed mRNA transcripts present in various cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and originating from a gene on chromosome 9 program the synthesis of intracellular gelsolin (cGSN) and of its secreted counterpart. The two isoforms are structurally and functionally identical except for 25 additional amino acids at the N terminus of pGSN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. pGSN circulates in the plasma of healthy humans and other mammals at average levels of 200 &#x000b1; 50 mg/L. In every acute tissue injury setting examined, including toxic, hyperoxic, and idiopathic lung injury, adult respiratory distress syndrome, acute liver injury, myonecrosis, pancreatitis, trauma, burns, and bacterial and protozoal sepsis, pGSN levels are subnormal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The unifying explanation for low pGSN concentrations in acute inflammatory conditions is the exposure by injury to plasma of the GSN-binding ligand, actin, a major cellular constituent ordinarily separated from the extracellular environment by intact plasma membranes. In some but not all such cases of pGSN depletion, GSN-actin complexes are detectable in the circulation. pGSN together with Gc-globulin, another extracellular actin-binding protein, is proposed to function as an 'extracellular actin scavenger system' responsible for the removal of actin released during tissue injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Actin exposed to the extracellular environment polymerizes into filaments (F-actin) that stimulate downstream inflammatory reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. pGSN has the capacity to sever and depolymerize F-actin into monomeric subunits (G-actin) that are then sequestered by Gc-globulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and cleared in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Administration of pGSN to animals subjected to systemic inflammation can prolong survival and prevent complications of acute injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The beneficial effect of pGSN in these settings is unclear but may reside in its binding and/or inactivation of inflammatory mediators such as lysophosphatidic acid, amyloid &#x003b2; protein, diadenosine 5',5"'-P1,P3-triphosphate, endotoxin, and platelet-activating factor) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. These findings suggest that pGSN is a broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory buffer and that local pGSN depletion by a shift of binding toward actin during actin exposure following injury allows mediators to promote appropriate defense and repair functions. Catastrophic or prolonged pGSN depletion, however, hypothetically accommodates dysfunctional and destructive actions of the mediators, leading to secondary organ damage and even death.</p><p>This set of events is theoretically also applicable to chronic inflammatory conditions in which cellular damage and mediator release occur, but no studies have hitherto examined pGSN levels in such states. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease of unknown etiology that most prominently affects the synovial lining, resulting in a persistent and progressive diarthrodial joint inflammation and destruction. We report here that pGSN levels are diminished in the blood of RA patients and that analysis of synovial fluids (SFs) suggests that pGSN is consumed in the inflamed joint. Our findings suggest that the reason for the decreased pGSN levels is local exposure of actin to the extracellular environment in these joints.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Plasma and SF samples were collected from RA patients attending the rheumatology clinics at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg for acute joint effusion. Altogether, samples were obtained from 81 patients. Three of the patients donated SF only. RA was diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Clinical and demographic data of the RA patient population are presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. At the time of SF and blood sampling, all of the patients received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were administered to 45 patients, including methotrexate (MTX) (33 patients), sulfasalazine (5 patients), leflunomide (1 patient), parenteral or oral gold salt compounds (4 patients), cyclosporine A (5 patients: 2 in combination with MTX, 1 in combination with leflunomide, 1 in combination with azathioprine, and 1 with sulfasalazine), and azathioprine (2 patients). Nine patients received a combination of DMARD (8 patients received MTX and 1 patient received azathioprine + cyclosporine A) and inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (5 patients received infliximab and 4 patients etanercept). One patient received MTX in combination with a soluble interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor agonist (anakinra). The remaining 33 patients had no DMARD treatment at the time of blood and SF sampling. Thirty-one patients used oral glucocorticosteroids (mean dose of 6.85 mg/day). Patients receiving monotherapy with glucocorticosteroids (n = 12) were considered as having no DMARD treatment. Recent radiographs of the hands and feet were obtained for all patients. The presence of bone erosions defined as the loss of cortical definition of the proximal interphalangeal, metacarpophalangeal, carpal, interphalangeal, and metatarsophalangeal joints was documented: a single erosion was defined as erosive disease. The presence of rheumatoid factor of any of the immunoglobulin isotypes tested (IgM, IgA, and IgG) was considered as positive. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Gothenburg. Informed consent was obtained from all patients and volunteers enrolled in this study in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Control blood samples (n = 62) were obtained from volunteers donating blood at the Blood Transfusion Unit of Sahlgrenska University Hospital and matching the RA patients for age and gender.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Clinical characteristics of patients with rheumatoid arthritis</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Clinical characteristic</td><td align="center">Erosive RA (n = 47)</td><td align="center">Non-erosive RA (n = 31)</td><td align="center"><italic>P </italic>value<sup>a</sup></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Gender, female/male</td><td align="center">35/12</td><td align="center">24/7</td><td align="center">NS</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Age, years</td><td align="center">61.2 &#x000b1; 14.1</td><td align="center">54.2 &#x000b1; 7.4</td><td align="center">NS</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Rheumatoid factor, +/-</td><td align="center">35/12</td><td align="center">12/19</td><td align="center">0.008</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Disease duration, years</td><td align="center">12.1 &#x000b1; 9.2</td><td align="center">7.7 &#x000b1; 7.4</td><td align="center">0.005</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Treated with DMARDs</td><td align="center">32</td><td align="center">13</td><td align="center">&#x0003c;0.03</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Methotrexate</td><td align="center">24 (51%)</td><td align="center">9 (29%)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Other<sup>b</sup></td><td align="center">8 (17%)</td><td align="center">4 (13%)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Non-treated</td><td align="center">15 (32%)</td><td align="center">18 (58%)</td><td align="center">&#x0003c;0.05</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">CRP, mg/L</td><td align="center">42 &#x000b1; 56.6</td><td align="center">38 &#x000b1; 39.6</td><td align="center">NS</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Systemic inflammation, CRP &#x0003e;20 mg/L</td><td align="center">28 (60%)</td><td align="center">18 (58%)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">White blood cell count, &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Blood</td><td align="center">8.2 &#x000b1; 2.8</td><td align="center">7.34 &#x000b1; 1.1</td><td align="center">NS</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Synovial fluid</td><td align="center">10.6 &#x000b1; 17.7</td><td align="center">13.0 &#x000b1; 14.1</td><td align="center">NS</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are mean &#x000b1; standard deviation except where otherwise indicated. <sup>a</sup>Erosive versus non-erosive. <sup>b</sup>Sulfasalazine 5, gold salts 4, leflunomide 1, cyclosporine A 5 (in combination with methotrexate 2, with azathioprine 1, with leflunomide 1, and with sulfasalazine 1), and azathioprine 2.

The assay is based on the principle that calcium-activated pGSN binds pyrene-labeled actin monomers to form a nucleus from which actin polymerizes in the pointed (slowest-growing) end direction. Pyrene-labeled actin fluoresces with higher intensity as a polymer than as a monomer. Pyrene actin was prepared by derivatizing actin with <italic>N</italic>-pyrenyliodoacetamide (Molecular Probes, now part of Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using the procedure of Kouyama and Mihashi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], exchanging CaCl<sub>2 </sub>for MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Before use, pyrene actin was diluted in depolymerization buffer (buffer A: 0.5 mM ATP, 0.5 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM Tris, 0.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4) to 20 &#x003bc;M, stored 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C to reach monomer equilibrium, and centrifuged at 250,000 <italic>g </italic>and 4&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes in an Optima&#x02122; TL Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA) to pellet any remnant F-actin. The supernatant was withdrawn and stored in an ice water bath until use. Plasma or SF to be analyzed was diluted 1:5 in polymerization buffer (buffer B: 0.1 M KCl, 0.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM ATP, 10 mM Tris, 0.5 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4). Pyrene-actin fluorescence was recorded using a spectrofluorometer (FluoroMax-2<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; JobinYvon-Spex Instruments S.A., Inc, now HORIBA Jobin Yvon Inc, Edison, NJ, USA). Excitation and emission wavelengths were 366 and 386 nm, respectively. Pyrene actin was added to a final concentration of 1 &#x003bc;M in 280 &#x003bc;L of buffer B containing 0.4 &#x003bc;M phallacidin and 5 &#x003bc;L of diluted sample in 6 &#x000d7; 50 mm borosilicate glass culture tubes (Kimble, Glass Inc, Vineland, NJ, USA). Nucleation was monitored for 240 seconds in the fluorometer following a fast vortex. The linear slope of the fluorescence increase was calculated between 100 and 200 seconds. All of the samples were run in duplicates. Polymerization rate in each sample was converted to pGSN concentration by use of a standard curve of recombinant human pGSN (rhpGSN).</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements of interleukin-6 levels in synovial fluid</title><p>The levels of IL-6 in SF were determined by a bioassay with a cell clone B13.29, subclone B9, which is dependent on IL-6 for growth, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

Samples (10 &#x003bc;L for GSN isoform and 20 &#x003bc;L for GSN fragments) were run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels in a modified Laemmli system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and transferred to Immobilon P membranes (polyvinylidene difluoride [PVDF]) (0.45 &#x003bc;m) (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA). Platelet lysate (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup>/mL, 5 &#x003bc;L) and rhpGSN served as negative and positive controls for pGSN, respectively. For determination of GSN isoform, a polyclonal antibody recognizing an epitope in the plasma extension of human pGSN was used (1:2,000, 2 hours, 22&#x000b0;C). The antibody was designed using a peptide from the plasma extension sequence and produced by Invitrogen Corporation in rabbit using a KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) carrier. The antibody titer was checked at 4, 8, and 10 weeks, and the antibody was affinity-purified. For total GSN, the mouse monoclonal anti-GSN antibody 2c4 was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] (1:2,500, 2 hours, 22&#x000b0;C).

Chemiluminescence detection was done using SuperSignal<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate for detection of HRP (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). HyBlot CL autoradiography film (Denville Scientific Inc., Metuchen, NJ, USA) was exposed to the membrane for 1 minute (isoform detection) or overnight (matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]-cleavage product detection).

The decrease is inversely related to the intensity of systemic inflammation, determined by an inverse correlation with levels of acute-phase protein (CRP). In contrast, local inflammation measured by IL-6 levels in SF has no direct correlation with pGSN levels. The finding that circulating pGSN levels decrease during chronic joint inflammation is consistent with observations of acute inflammatory disease states, such as sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome, in which a drop in pGSN concentration precedes more severe injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and the beneficial action of pGSN during re-administration in traumatized animals suggests that it has a protective role in inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The mechanism behind this demonstrated protective effect during acute inflammation is unclear but may reside in its binding and inactivation of inflammatory mediators) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>pGSN was present in SFs of RA patients at a concentration of approximately 95 mg/L. Plasma origin is supported by immunoblotting and a correlation between pGSN levels in plasma and SF in the matched pair of samples. Mechanistically, pGSN may be consumed locally through trapping at the joint space or other affected organs in order to maintain a steady-state concentration at the site of inflammation. pGSN has the potential to interact with several macromolecules present at sites of inflammatory injury. In addition to its high affinity for actin, a prime candidate for its localization at an inflamed site containing damaged cells, pGSN binds to fibronectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and fibrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], which are present at higher-than-normal concentrations in the inflamed joint space during RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. We detected actin in 77 of the 81 SF samples and the presence of GSN-actin complexes suggests that one function of pGSN in the inflamed joint space is to sever F-actin exposed on damaged cells during tissue injury. Hypothetically, pGSN from blood would get trapped in the exposed actin networks, leading to a decrease in circulating pGSN. A fraction of the actin-bound pGSN would be expected to come loose from the network during the severing process and be detected as free-floating pGSN-actin complexes in SF. Such complexes would be interpreted as pGSN in the nucleation assay and contribute to the total pGSN concentration measured in the patient sample. pGSN stuck in the damaged tissue would not be detected. Gc-globulin, another component of the extracellular actin-scavenging system, has also been shown to be present in SF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], suggesting a system for extracellular actin removal in the inflamed joint. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> describes this hypothesis of events. Since pGSN has previously been shown to bind to various inflammatory mediators such as platelet-activating factor, lysophosphatidic acid, and endotoxin, some of which are present at higher-than-normal levels in the inflamed synovial joint of RA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], further studies should be conducted to understand how this local consumption due to compartmental actin binding affects cell activation induced by these mediators. While distribution into the SF and/or local trapping is likely to contribute to the decrease in circulating pGSN, pGSN may also be bound to a secondary yet unidentified plasma factor (for example, CRP) that may cause it to remain undetected by our functional assay.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Proposed model of plasma gelsolin (pGSN) function in clearing actin from synovial joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients with acute joint effusion. (1) pGSN and other proteins from blood enter the inflamed synovial joint space freely due to increased permeability. (2) Actin is exposed to the extracellular environment of the joint because of tissue cell damage. pGSN gets soaked up in the exposed actin networks because of its high affinity for actin. (3) Actin filaments (F-actin) are severed by pGSN and GSN-F-actin complexes released to the synovial fluid (SF). (4) pGSN caps the barbed ends of the filaments, preventing polymerization from the fast-growing ends. Due to the presence of Gc-globulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], the pool of free actin monomers in SF is likely to be low, favoring depolymerization from the pointed (slow-growing) ends of the actin filaments.

It is possible that pGSN is cleaved by MMPs <italic>in vivo </italic>during RA and that this cleavage contributes to lower levels being detected. This is further supported by observations of MMP-mediated cleavage of 68-kDa secreted peptides from mutant (D187Y/N) pGSN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. MMP-induced pGSN cleavage would most likely be interpreted as a decrease in pGSN concentration in our functional assay since the nucleating activity of pGSN cut in half is weaker than for the full-length protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Although we did not detect proteolytic pGSN fragments by immunoblotting, it is possible that they are further degraded or rapidly cleared from the circulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have documented a decrease in levels of circulating pGSN in RA, the first example of such depletion during chronic inflammation. pGSN levels are even lower intra-articularly in affected joints. Although the cause of the decrease is unclear and enzymatic degradation or decreased production cannot be definitively ruled out, the capacity of pGSN to bind several factors present in the inflamed joint space and the lack of detection of proteolyic fragments suggest a local consumption. The proportion of pGSN levels in SF versus plasma, in combination with the observations that actin is exposed to the extracellular environment during RA and that GSN-actin complexes are present in SF, supports this hypothesis. However, the lack of a direct relation between the degree of local inflammation as measured by IL-6 and pGSN levels suggests that the regulation of pGSN in RA is complex. Further studies on the involvement of pGSN in RA might help in understanding the pathogenesis and possibly aid in diagnosis and future treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>cGSN: cytoplasmic gelsolin; cMMP-3: catalytic domain of matrix metalloproteinase-3; CRP: C-reactive protein; DMARD: disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug; F-actin: filamentous actin; GSN: gelsolin; HRP: horseradish peroxidase; IL-6: interleukin-6; MMP: matrix metalloproteinase; MTX: methotrexate; pGSN: plasma gelsolin; PVDF: polyvinylidene difluoride; RA: rheumatoid arthritis; rhpGSN: recombinant human plasma gelsolin; SB: sample buffer; SF: synovial fluid.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors' institutions, Brigham &#x00026; Women's Hospital and The University of Gothenburg, have filed a patent application on which TMO, TPS, and AT are designated as inventors.
