The microtubule-binding domain of tau is known to be involved in its interaction with actin. Here, we address the question of whether the other domains of tau also interact with actin.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Several tau truncation and deletion mutants were constructed, namely N-terminal region (tauN), proline-rich domain (tauPRD), microtubule binding domain (tauMTBD) and C-terminal region (tauC) truncation mutants, and microtubule binding domain (tau&#x00394;MTBD) and proline-rich domain/microtubule binding domain (tau&#x00394;PRD&#x00026;MTBD) deletion mutants. The proline-rich domain truncation mutant (tauPRD) and the microtubule binding domain deletion mutant (tau&#x00394;MTBD) promoted the formation of actin filaments. However, actin assembly was not observed in the presence of the N-terminal and C-terminal truncation mutants. These results indicate that the proline-rich domain is involved in the association of tau with G-actin. Furthermore, results from co-sedimentation, solid phase assays and electron microscopy showed that the proline-rich domain is also capable of binding to F-actin and inducing F-actin bundles. Using solid phase assays to analyze apparent dissociation constants for the binding of tau and its mutants to F-actin resulted in a sequence of affinity for F-actin: tau &#x0003e;&#x0003e; microtubule binding domain &#x0003e; proline-rich domain.

The protein is recognized as a multifunctional molecule that interacts with actin in addition to microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and is involved in the organization of the cytoskeletal network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Actin monomers (G-actin) were found to form gels in the presence of tau [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. According to Farias and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], the association of tau with tubulin immobilized on a solid phase support system is inhibited by actin monomers, and a higher inhibition can be attained with preassembled actin filaments. Interestingly, tau can interact with F-actin, resulting in bundles of F-actin. MacLean-Fletcher and Pollard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] have observed that tau dramatically induces an increase in the viscosity of actin filaments. Using electron microscopy tau has been shown to be capable of bundling microfilaments. Examination of morphological aspects of microtubules and actin filaments which coexist <italic>in vitro </italic>revealed associations between both cytoskeletal filaments, and in some cases, the presence of fine filamentous structures bridging these polymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Several reports have demonstrated that tau interacts with actin <italic>in vivo</italic>. Sub-portions of tau co-immunoprecipitated with actin filaments have been found in various cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. As described by Yu and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], under NGF stimulation, tau is distributed at the ends of cellular extensions, where it associates with actin in a microtubule-independent manner in PC12 cells. Moreover, Fluga and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] have provided evidence that tau induces changes in the organization and stability of neuronal actin filaments, which in turn contributes to Alzheimer's-like neurodegeneration in <italic>Drosophila </italic>and mouse model systems. This further demonstrates the physiological importance of interactions between tau and actin.</p><p>According to Buee and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], tau consists of four parts: the N-terminal region, the proline-rich domain (PRD), the microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) and the C-terminal region. The microtubule binding domain has been reported to bind to actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], but no data is available for the other regions bound to actin. It has been proposed that the proline-rich domain of tau participates in interactions with microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Interactions between tau and DNA have been studied in our laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and PRD and MTBD were found to associate cooperatively with the minor groove in DNA double strands. These results intrigued and led us to investigate whether the proline-rich domain of tau also participates in interactions with actin.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Tau binds to G-actin and F-actin from skeletal muscle and platelets</title><p>Human actin has three subtypes, alpha actin being found primarily in muscle, and beta and gamma actin in other tissues. The interaction of tau with alpha actin has been well studied, however, little attention has been given to beta and gamma actin. Since tau mainly exists in neurons, beta and gamma actin are the subtypes of actin that tau can encounter. In this work we mainly used skeletal muscle actin. Platelet actin (a mixture of beta and gamma actin) was also employed to test whether subtypes of actin differ in their interactions with tau.</p><p>Here, solid phase assays were used to study interactions between tau and actin. Human tau23 (352 aa) was employed in our experiments. G-actin and F-actin from skeletal muscle and platelets were immobilized in 96-well plates, and increasing concentrations of tau were added. Levels of bound tau were monitored by using an anti-tau monoclonal antibody. As illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, absorbance increased with increasing tau concentration, indicating a positive correlation between added tau and bound tau. BSA used as a negative control showed no interaction with G-actin or F-actin (data not shown). These results suggest that tau is capable of binding to G-actin and F-actin.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Binding of tau to actin detected by solid phase assay</bold>.

Low speed centrifugation (25,000 g) can only pellet F-actin bundles, while high speed centrifugation (100,000 g) can pellet all F-actin filaments. Under our experimental conditions, tau could co-sediment with actin by low speed centrifugation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; panel a, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This result indicated that tau can both induce polymerization of G-actin to F-actin and to F-actin bundles. To investigate the roles of the four regions of tau in interactions with actin, we designed a group of primers (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) and constructed a series of tau truncation and deletion mutants: mutants in which the N-terminal region (tauN), proline-rich domain (tauPRD), microtubule-binding domain (tauMTBD), C-terminal region (tauC) were separated, and mutants in which the MTBD (tau&#x00394;MTBD), and both the MTBD and PRD domains (tau&#x00394;PRD&#x00026;MTBD) were deleted (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Low speed co-sedimentation assay of G-actin in the presence of tau and tau mutants</bold>.

Under our experimental conditions, the tauN, tauC and tau&#x00394;PRD&#x00026;MTBD (panel b, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) mutants exhibited no association with actin in co-sedimentation assays, indicating that the proline-rich domain may be an essential domain involved in the association of tau with actin. Incubation of the tauPRD mutant with G-actin gave rise to a positive result in co-sedimentation assays, and tauPRD, tauMTBD, tau and BSA alone used as negative controls did not show any deposits in co-sedimentation assays (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). To judge the efficiency of bundling during the reaction, both the pellet and supernatant fraction were loaded in gels (panel a, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The result showed that most of the G-actin was in the pellet fraction under the experimental conditions, presenting the formation of F-actin bundles. Taken together, these results suggest that the proline-rich domain is involved in the association of tau with G-actin.</p><p>Platelet actin was also used in low speed co-sedimentation assays. Results were similar to those obtained for skeletal muscle actin (panel b, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Under the same conditions, tauPRD bound to skeletal muscle and platelet actin without discrimination, i.e. tauPRD was capable of binding to alpha-, beta- and gamma-actin. These results again indicate that in addition to the microtubule-binding domain, the proline-rich domain played an important role in the association of tau with actin.</p><p>Atomic force microscopy was used to observe the morphology of actin-tauPRD complexes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

When tauN, tauC and BSA were incubated separately with G-actin, no filaments were observed (data not shown). G-actin and tau were observed as globular particles in the absence of actin. This demonstrates again that tauPRD is a functional domain involved in the association of tau with actin and in the promotion of G-actin assembly.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Interactions of tauPRD with G-actin observed by atomic force microscopy</bold>.

The diameter of the actin bundles (39.00 &#x000b1; 5.86 nm) was similar to those present in the absence of NaCl (38.60 &#x000b1; 7.28 nm). When NaCl concentration was increased to 300 mM, bundles and some filaments were observed to co-exist in the same visual field. As shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>, the diameter of the bundles was 30.97 &#x000b1; 8.43 nm and that of the filaments was 8.33 &#x000b1; 1.29 nm, similar to those present in the absence of NaCl (8.40 &#x000b1; 1.65 nm). Even when the salt concentration was as high as 500 mM, bundles of F-actin (30.46 &#x000b1; 6.30 nm diameter) could still be seen in the presence of tauPRD. That is to say that tauPRD was able to promote the assembly of F-actin into bundles at high concentrations of NaCl, but that the diameter of these bundles was somewhat lower than that of those formed in the absence of NaCl. Under our experimental conditions, similar results were obtained for tau and tauMTBD, as indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>.</p><fig id="F12" position="float"><label>Figure 12</label><caption><p><bold>Electron microscopy images of F-actin incubated with tauPRD in the presence of NaCl at different concentrations</bold>.

On the other hand, some actin globules were observed when the NaCl concentration was increased to 500 mM, suggesting that actin filaments started to collapse at these high salt concentrations. Tau, tauPRD or tauMTBD appeared as particles without any filaments or bundles in the absence of actin under these experimental conditions (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Studies on the interaction of tau with actin have generally focussed on the relationship between MTBD and alpha-actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Here we show that the proline-rich domain of tau is also capable of binding to actin, promoting G-actin assembly and F-actin bundling. Our results indicate that: (1) tau is still able to interact with actin after the microtubule binding domain has been deleted (mutant tau&#x00394;MTBD); (2) the isolated proline-rich domain alone was able to associate with actin; (3) the tauN, tauC truncation mutants, and the &#x00394;PBD&#x00026;MTBD deletion mutant showed no interaction with actin; and (4) the isolated proline-rich domain was still able to induce F-actin bundling.</p><p>Compared to the microtubule binding domain, the proline-rich domain of tau is a relatively less-well characterized domain. However, evidence has shown that this domain is functionally important and participates in multiple biological processes. PRD has been demonstrated to be an indispensable domain for tau's stabilization of microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Further work has shown that PRD may interact with the N-terminal region from another tau molecule to form dimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Tau was reported to associate with the SH3 domain of fyn and src via its proline-rich domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Here we show another function of proline-rich domain. As shown in the results above, PRD binds to actin with a lower affinity than native tau (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The value of Kapp for the complete protein is much lower than that for either tauPRD or tauMTBD. This suggests again that both PRD and MTBD are involved in interactions with actin.</p><p>To investigate whether tau or its mutants binds with actin under physiological ionic strength, as suggested by Roger and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], we observed the interaction of tau with actin at different concentrations of NaCl. Our results showed that the interaction between tau and actin decreased significantly with increasing ionic strength. However, high ionic strength could not eliminate the interaction completely. At physiological ionic strength, a relatively weak interaction was still observed using high speed co-sedimentation and electron microscopy. We consider high-speed co-sedimentation and electron microscopy are more sensitive and accurate methods than low-speed co-sedimentation. Our results indicate that interactions between F-actin and tau, tauPRD and tauMTBD persist at physiological ionic strength.</p><p>Tau and MAP2c are two major microtubule binding proteins that are considered to be potential cross-linkers between microtubules and actin microfilaments. However, the interaction of MAP2c with actin may be different in nature. Konati and colleagues found that tau and MAP2c have different behaviour when studying their effect on actin filament viscosity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Compared with MAP2c, the binding of tau to F-actin was relatively weak at physiological ionic strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. According to Yamauchi and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], phosphatidyl-inositol completely disrupts MAP2c-induced bundles. However, tau-induced actin bundles are unaffected by phosphatidyl-inositol. These reports indicate that tau and MAP2c behave differently in their interactions with cytoskeletal components.</p><p>Tang and coworkers have proposed the polyelectrolyte theory for F-actin bundling similar to DNA condensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The general behaviour is dictated by the polyelectrolyte nature of F-actin, which causes a class of nonspecific binding by ligands that carry several net positive charges including divalent metal ions and basic polypeptides. Such bundling is induced by electrostatic force, and usually does not require a specific binding site. Tau is a positively charged protein, with a PI of 9.39 (predicted with Lasergene). Moraga and co-workers proposed that electrostatic forces are involved in the interaction between actin and a tau fragment containing a repetitive sequence from the MTBD domain, because selective carbamoylation resulted in a complete loss of the peptide induction of actin bundles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We have shown that the interaction of tau with F-actin is influenced strongly by ionic strength.</p><p>These reports provide evidence that tau may act like polycations to induce F-actin to form bundles. The charge distribution in tau is depicted in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref> which shows that MTBD and PRD are both highly positively charged, while the N-terminal and C-terminal regions are neutral or negatively charged according to Wang and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We hypothesize that electrostatic force is the basis of the interaction between tauPRD and actin. The relatively weak and nonspecific nature of the electrostatic forces between tau and F-actin does not necessarily mean that the interaction is of no relevance <italic>in vivo</italic>. Filament concentration could be higher than we can achieve <italic>in vitro</italic>. Besides, several reports have confirmed the physiological importance of this interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this work, using co-sedimentation assays and solid phase assays we have shown that the proline-rich domain (PRD) of tau binds with G-actin and F-actin. The PRD domain induced G-actin to form filamentous actin and promoted F-actin to form bundles as observed under both atomic force microscopy and electron microscopy. The promotion of actin bundles in the presence of PRD was also observed in the presence of NaCl under physiological conditions. According to the results presented here and other reports in the literature on MTBD associations with actin, it is suggested that both PRD and MTBD are involved in the association of tau with actin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Construction of mutants</title><p>Constructs of tau mutants (tauN, tauPRD, tauMTBD, tauC, tau&#x00394;MTBD and tau&#x00394;PRD&#x00026;MTBD) were prepared by PCR or megaprimer PCR amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] using human tau23 clones as templates.

Human platelet G-actin (a mixture of 85% beta and 15% gamma isoforms) was obtained from Cytoskeleton Inc. and was resuspended in buffer A (2 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.2 mM ATP, 0.5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.005% NaN<sub>3</sub>).
