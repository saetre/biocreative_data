Interleukin (IL) 17&#x02013;producing Th17 cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases, and in protection from bacterial or fungal infection. However, the role of Th17 cells in persistent viral infection remains unknown. We report that Th17 cells preferentially develop in vitro and in vivo in an IL-6&#x02013;dependent manner after Theiler&#x02019;s murine encephalomyelitis virus infection. Th17 cells promote persistent viral infection and induce the pathogenesis of chronic demyelinating disease. IL-17 up-regulates antiapoptotic molecules and, consequently, increases persistent infection by enhancing the survival of virus-infected cells and blocking target cell destruction by cytotoxic T cells. Neutralization of IL-17 augments virus clearance by eliminating virus-infected cells and boosting lytic function by cytotoxic T cells, leading to the prevention of disease development. Thus, these results indicate a novel pathogenic role of Th17 cells via IL-17 in persistent viral infection and its associated chronic inflammatory diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>When an immune response is triggered by microbial pathogens, the innate immune system directs T lymphocytes to achieve appropriate effector function from diverse pathways to protect the host against destructive invasion. However, in some cases, inappropriate T effector cells that are unable to control microbial infections are induced and expanded, thereby allowing pathogens to persist in the host. For example, the balance between Th1 and Th2 responses to an infectious agent may determine the outcome of immunoprotection versus immunopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). IL-17&#x02013;producing Th17 cells, which are a distinct subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, comprise another T effector cell type that is apparently involved in inflammatory tissue damage, leading to the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Furthermore, Th17 also appears to play a role in protection against extracellular bacterial or fungal diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). The production of IL-17 has been reported during HIV infection in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), and herpes simplex virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>) and respiratory syncytial virus infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>) in rodents. However, the induction of Th17 cells during persistent viral infection, and their potential roles in the establishment of viral persistence and the pathogenesis of chronic viral infection&#x02013;associated diseases remain undefined.</p><p>During viral infection, most CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from the virus target organ belong to the Th1 type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Th1 cytokines, such as IFN-&#x003b3;, display strong antiviral function and antagonize the development of Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). For example, in simian immunodeficiency virus&#x02013;infected rhesus macaques, Th17 cells are markedly depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). The induction of type I IFNs and their downstream signaling pathways in response to viral infection may constrain Th17 development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). In opposition to this protective strategy, a virus may be able to evade antiviral types I and II IFN responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), facilitating its persistence in the host by inducing elevated levels of IL-17&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>+</sup> and/or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). However, the potential role of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of virus-induced chronic inflammatory diseases is virtually unknown. Th17 cells, via their cytokine IL-17, play a pivotal role in mediating different types of tissue inflammation and destruction in chronic toxoplasmic encephalitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>) and psoriasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Therefore, it is conceivable that persistent chronic viral infection might be associated with a polarized Th17 response that may further exert a positive or negative feedback loop on viral persistence and the pathogenesis of virus-induced chronic diseases.</p><p>In this study, we used the Theiler&#x02019;s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)&#x02013;induced demyelinating disease model system, which displays immune parameters and histopathology similar to those of chronic progressive multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). TMEV is a natural mouse pathogen belonging to the piconavirus family, which includes many important pathogens of humans and animals; e.g., poliovirus causes paralytic disease in humans, and coxsackievirus results in mild to severe myocarditis, encephalitis, and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). We investigated the effects of viral infection on Th17 development in vitro and in vivo, the effects of IL-17 neutralization on viral persistence in the virus target, the central nervous system (CNS), and the subsequent development of chronic demyelinating disease. In addition, we assessed the role of IL-17 in viral infection/replication and antiviral T cell cytotoxic function. Our results show that viral infection preferentially induces the development of Th17 cells, and in turn, these cells uniquely promote viral persistence via IL-17 by inhibiting apoptosis of infected cells as well as by desensitizing target cell killing by T effector cells, leading to the pathogenesis of associated chronic demyelinating disease.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Preferential induction of Th17 development by virus-infected DCs in vitro</title><p>To examine whether virus-infected antigen-presenting cells preferentially drive a Th17 response, purified CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from OT-II TCR transgenic mice specific for OVA peptide 323&#x02013;339 (OVA<sub>323-339</sub>) were stimulated for 4 d with TMEV-infected BM-derived DCs (BMDCs) in the presence of the cognate peptide. Th1/Th17 cell differentiations evoked by mock- and virus-infected DCs were compared using intracellular staining of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). The results indicate that Th17 cell development is preferentially increased after stimulation with virus-infected DCs in an infection-dose&#x02013;dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Interestingly, paraformaldehyde-fixed virus-infected DCs failed to induce polarized Th17 development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), suggesting that the skewed Th17 development is dependent on soluble factors from virus-infected DCs. To identify cytokines involved in enhanced Th17 development, key Th1/Th17 cell differentiation&#x02013;associated cytokines (IL-6, IL-12, and IL-23) produced in the supernatants of virus-infected DCs were assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Notably, virus-infected DCs produced higher levels of IL-6 and IL-12p40 compared with mock-infected DCs, suggesting their possible role in elevated Th17 cell differentiation. Addition of IL-6 to the co-cultures of uninfected DCs and OT-II T cells in the presence of cognate peptide promoted Th17 development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>), confirming the potential role of IL-6 in Th17 elevation. In addition, treatment of the co-cultures consisting of OT-II T cells and virus-infected DCs with neutralizing antibodies to IL-6 completely abrogated Th17 development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). These results collectively indicate that IL-6 produced by virus-infected DCs likely drives Th17 cell differentiation. To directly address the effect of viral infection on virus-specific Th17 development, we used TCR transgenic SJL/J (SJL) mice (backcross generation N14) that recognize TMEV capsid protein 2 epitope (VP2<sub>74-86</sub>) (unpublished data). Naive VP2-TCR transgenic T cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD44<sup>low</sup>) sorted on a MoFlo cytometer (see Materials and methods) were used to assess the development of Th17 cells. Again, virus-infected SJL BMDCs preferentially supported the differentiation of Th17 cells, producing signature cytokines (IL-17 and IL-22) and an inflammatory cytokine (TNF-&#x003b1;), whereas those stimulated by BMDCs loaded with VP2<sub>74-86</sub>&#x02013; or UV light&#x02013;inactivated TMEV (UV-TMEV) failed to generate Th17 cells despite the vigorous development of Th1 cells producing IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Thus, our data clearly demonstrate that viral infection drives antigen-presenting cells to preferentially induce Th17 development in vitro.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Virus-infected DCs promote Th17 development in vitro.</bold> (A) Flow cytometry of OT-II T cells cultured for 4 d with B6 BMDCs infected with varying MOIs in the presence of OVA<sub>323-339</sub>.

IL-17 production by CNS-resident microglia and infiltrated macrophages, DCs, granulocytes, B cells, and cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from both mouse strains was either undetectable or negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). However, low but detectable levels of IL-17&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were found in virus-infected SJL but not B6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and C</xref>). To confirm these flow cytometry results, we assessed mRNA levels of IL-17 and the Th17 lineage&#x02013;specific transcription factor ROR&#x003b3;t in sorted CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>, and CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CNS-infiltrating mononuclear cells from TMEV-infected SJL and B6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Both IL-17 and ROR&#x003b3;t mRNAs were primarily expressed by the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell fraction of SJL mice compared with other SJL cellular fractions (P &#x0003c; 0.001) or CNS-infiltrating cells from B6 mice (P &#x0003c; 0.001). These results clearly indicate that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are the predominant source of IL-17 in the CNS of virus-infected susceptible SJL mice. Th17 cell numbers in the CNS of SJL mice were as much as 100-fold greater than those of B6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, bottom). In contrast, no difference in the overall number of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells between these strains was found as a result of elevated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration to the CNS in SJL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, bottom), although the proportion of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was lower in TMEV-infected SJL mice in comparison to B6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, top). Th17 cells in infected SJL mice appear to be viral antigen specific, because similar levels of IL-17&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were found after in vitro stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 versus UV-TMEV (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082030/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082030/DC1</ext-link>). Upon restimulation of CNS-infiltrating cells with UV-TMEV ex vivo, significantly higher levels of IL-17 and lower levels of IFN-&#x003b3; were detected from SJL versus B6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). This discrepancy between IFN-&#x003b3; levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>) and IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>) may reflect differences in cytokine levels produced per cell by SJL and B6 mice. It is interesting to note that IL-6 is detectable only in the CNS (both brains and spinal cords) of SJL mice during viral infection, but not in B6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>), strongly suggesting that this cytokine plays a key role in Th17 development and expansion. Collectively, these observations indicate that viral infection in susceptible SJL mice results in the preferential development of Th17 responses, along with low levels of Th1 responses as compared with resistant B6 mice.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Th17 development is elevated in virus-infected susceptible SJL mice.</bold> (A) Intracellular IL-17 analysis of CNS mononuclear cells from virus-infected SJL and B6 mice (<italic>n</italic> = 3) after stimulation with PMA plus ionomycin.

Intraperitoneal injection of LPS, concomitant with intracerebral TMEV infection in resistant B6 mice, resulted in persistent infection as well as clinical symptoms, whereas no detectable disease development and low viral persistence were observed in control PBS-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). The number of IL-17&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the CNS of LPS-treated mice was increased &#x0003e;300-fold compared with that of control PBS-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). In contrast, similar proportions and numbers of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were observed between LPS- and PBS-treated mice. LPS-treated mice exhibited significantly higher levels of IL-6 in particular, as well as CXCL1/KC and CCL2/MCP-1 in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). These cytokines and chemokines are known to be associated with IL-17 signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). These results are consistent with in vitro observations that the treatment of BMDCs with LPS significantly enhances the induction of Th17 cells as compared with treatment with PBS (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082030/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082030/DC1</ext-link>). Thus, LPS treatment appears to be a prerequisite for Th17 elevation to the pathogenic threshold in TMEV-infected resistant B6 mice, in contrast to TMEV-infected susceptible SJL mice that generate a high level of Th17 cells. Th17 cells found in LPS-treated mice appear to represent virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, because IL-17 production by peripheral splenocytes was observed in response to MHC class II&#x02013;restricted viral epitopes or UV-TMEV, but not MHC class I&#x02013;restricted epitopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). In contrast, levels of viral antigen&#x02013;specific IFN-&#x003b3; responses were similar in both the virus-infected PBS- and LPS-treated groups. Because it was previously reported that Th1 responses antagonize Th17 development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>), finding similar levels of Th1 cells in both groups of TMEV-infected mice was unexpected. To further determine the role of IL-6 in the increased generation of Th17 cells in virus-infected mice, we compared levels of Th17 cells in virus-infected LPS-treated WT and IL-6 KO B6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, F and G</xref>). Although similar levels of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were observed in the CNS of virus-infected WT and IL-6 KO mice, the development of Th17 cells in the CNS was abrogated in IL-6 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>). In addition, viral titers in the CNS of LPS-treated IL-6 KO mice were significantly lower at days 8 and 21 after TMEV infection compared with those of LPS-treated WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 G</xref>). Collectively, these results clearly demonstrate that both viral persistence and the development of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease in LPS-treated B6 mice strongly correlate with elevated Th17 cell levels in the CNS in an IL-6&#x02013;dependent manner.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Virus infection in conjunction with bacterial endotoxin administration promotes Th17 development in resistant B6 mice via elevated IL-6.</bold> (A) B6 mice were infected with TMEV in conjunction with intraperitoneal injection of PBS (<italic>n</italic> = 10) or LPS (<italic>n</italic> = 10), and the development of demyelinating disease was monitored.

Treatment with anti&#x02013;IL-17 antibody reduced serum IL-17 to nearly undetectable levels during acute viral infection (8 d after infection) compared with treatment with isotype antibody, indicating the effectiveness of neutralizing antibodies (Fig. S3 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082030/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082030/DC1</ext-link>).

However, cellular infiltration (CD45<sup>hi</sup> leukocytes and CD45<sup>hi</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophages) to the CNS was decreased by more than twofold at day 8 after infection.

Despite low levels of leukocyte infiltration in anti&#x02013;IL-17 antibody&#x02013;treated mice, IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 production by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>) and IFN-&#x003b3; production by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Fig. S3 B) in the CNS were uncompromised. We further analyzed whether TMEV persists and induces chronic demyelinating disease in these antibody-treated mice. Viral persistence in the CNS was significantly lower at days 8 and 21 after infection in the anti&#x02013;IL-17&#x02013;treated group versus the control antibody&#x02013;treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref> and Fig. S4 C). Furthermore, drastic reductions (P &#x0003c; 0.01) in the incidence and severity of demyelinating disease were observed in the anti&#x02013;IL-17&#x02013;treated group compared with control groups of LPS-treated B6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>) and susceptible SJL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 G</xref>). Histological examinations of these anti&#x02013;IL-17 antibody&#x02013;treated groups displayed very little cellular infiltration and demyelination in spinal cords, in contrast to extensive demyelination and cellular infiltration in isotype control groups (Fig. S4, A and B). Thus, the elimination of IL-17 function from virus-infected mice appears to prevent the development of demyelinating disease. These results clearly indicate that IL-17 plays a critical pathogenic role in the establishment of viral persistence and pathogenesis of chronic demyelinating disease in both temporarily converted genetically resistant B6 mice that have become susceptible after LPS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>) and genetically susceptible SJL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 G</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Treatment of mice with anti&#x02013;IL-17 antibody inhibits viral persistence and the development of demyelinating disease.</bold> (A) Splenocytes from B6 mice treated with PBS alone, LPS and isotype control antibody (TMEV/LPS/Isotype Abs), or anti&#x02013;IL-17 antibody (TMEV/LPS/&#x003b1;IL-17 Abs) 8 d after mock or TMEV infection were restimulated with mixed CD4 epitopes, UV-TMEV, or mixed CD8 epitopes.

However, viral infection/replication levels were similar in IL-17&#x02013;pretreated and untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and C</xref>). Despite similar levels of viral replication in IL-17&#x02013;pretreated and untreated cultures, the production of IL-6, KC, and MCP-1, but not IL-12p40, was markedly increased in both IL-17&#x02013;treated DCs and astrocytes after TMEV infection as compared with control PBS-treated cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, B and D</xref>). Thus, these increases in cytokines and chemokines likely participate in further augmenting Th17 development and selective cellular infiltration in the virus target organ, as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Furthermore, IL-17 treatment significantly inhibited virus-induced apoptosis of BM cells and primary astrocytes but not differentiated BMDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). Consequently, this IL-17&#x02013;mediated protection against apoptosis likely promotes viral persistence in the CNS of virus-infected mice, as shown with an increase in virus yield by inhibiting apoptosis of virus-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). The failure of IL-17 treatment to protect BMDCs from apoptosis was not caused by the lack of IL-17R expression (Fig. S5 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082030/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082030/DC1</ext-link>), suggesting the involvement of other factors in this protection. Interestingly, IL-17&#x02013;mediated protection of BM cells appears to be restricted to certain inducers, as apoptosis induced by dexamethasone and anti-Fas mAb using the caspase 8 pathway, but not C2-ceramide and UV irradiation using alternative pathways, was inhibited (Fig. S5 B).

Because treatment of mice with anti&#x02013;IL-17 antibodies enhances viral clearance from the CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>), we explored the possibility that IL-17 compromises the cytotoxic function of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which are the key host defense immune mechanism against viral infections. Splenocytes from virus-infected B6 mice at the peak of acute infection were pretreated for 24 h or treated simultaneously with IL-17 and then assessed for cytolytic function with a typical short-term (6-h) cytotoxicity assay using VP2<sub>121-130</sub>&#x02013;loaded EL-4 target cells. Although the specific lytic activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was slightly lower (not statistically significant) after pretreatment with IL-17 for 24 h, it remained unchanged after simultaneous treatment with IL-17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). Similarly, IL-17 treatment did not significantly alter levels of granzyme B and IFN-&#x003b3; on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). In contrast, IL-17, but not IL-17F, which has a high degree of homology with IL-17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>), abrogated the slow (60-h) lytic reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>) that is prominently mediated by the Fas&#x02013;FasL pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). This lytic reaction was similarly inhibited with IL-17 pretreatment of target cells but not effector cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>), indicating that IL-17 treatment impedes cytolytic function of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells through signaling on target cells. To determine whether IL-17 inhibits cytotoxic function by blocking apoptosis of target cells during long-term cytolytic reactions, levels of apoptotic cells were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). The results showed that target cells are completely protected from CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell&#x02013;mediated apoptosis in the presence of IL-17, whereas effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells remain unaltered. We further assessed the effects of an inhibitor of Fas&#x02013;FasL interaction using human Fas:Fc (Fas&#x02013;IgG Fc fusion protein) on IL-17&#x02013;mediated inhibition of cytotoxic function to confirm the involvement of the Fas-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref>). The addition of Fas:Fc protein dramatically inhibited slow CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell&#x02013;mediated lysis in the absence of IL-17 but not in the presence of IL-17, strongly suggesting that IL-17 interferes with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell cytotoxic function via blocking the Fas&#x02013;FasL pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref>), consistent with the inhibition of anti-Fas antibody&#x02013;induced apoptosis by IL-17 (Fig. S5).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>IL-17 inhibits antiviral cytotoxic T cell function.</bold> (A) Splenocytes from B6 mice at 8 d after infection were pretreated for 24 h or were simultaneously treated with IL-17 (IL-17 Pre or IL-17 Sim, respectively), and were then subjected to a <sup>51</sup>Cr-release assay using VP2<sub>121-130</sub>&#x02013;loaded EL-4 target cells.

These results indicate that virus-permissive cells from anti&#x02013;IL-17 antibody&#x02013;treated mice became more susceptible to apoptosis. If this is the case, anti&#x02013;IL-17 antibody&#x02013;treated mice would be expected to develop low numbers of virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells corresponding to their limited viral load.

During acute viral infection, Th17 cytokine IL-17 promotes virus-induced inflammatory mediators in permissive cells to form a pathogenic inflammatory milieu, as well as to protect cells from both virus- and effector T cell&#x02013;induced apoptosis, resulting in chronic viral persistence and demyelinating disease. By interfering with cytolytic T cell function, IL-17 blocks vigorous and efficient antiviral immunity, thereby permitting sustained viral infection. This IL-17&#x02013;mediated feedback loop during viral infection favors viral escape from powerful antiviral effector T cells. These properties of Th17 cells represent a previously unknown mechanism of viral persistence leading to the pathogenesis of virus-induced chronic diseases.</p><p>Our data show that TMEV-infected DCs promote the development of Th17 cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). These results strongly suggest that virus infection harnesses the ability of DCs to polarize CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells toward Th17 cells. In particular, IL-6 produced by DCs after viral infection appears to steer this skewed Th17 cell development. It is interesting to note that higher levels of Th17 cells are found in TMEV-infected SJL mice than in B6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). This difference between resistant B6 and susceptible SJL mice may reflect the differential level of Th17 cell generation induced by DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A vs. E</xref>; and Fig. S2). LPS treatment likely enhances virus-infected DCs to induce Th17 development to the pathogenic threshold of Th17 response in resistant B6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), as shown in vitro (Fig. S2). This difference in Th17 cell levels in the CNS of virus-infected mice correlates with IL-6 levels produced both in the CNS of TMEV-infected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>) and by in vitro&#x02013;infected antigen-presenting cells, including DCs and microglia from susceptible SJL versus resistant B6 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). An elevated level of IL-6 appears to be necessary for this skewing of Th17 cell differentiation by virus-infected DCs in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>), as well as in virus-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). It is conceivable that the cellular sources of IL-6 during virus infection may also include many different CNS-resident cells such as microglia and astrocytes, which serve as major potential viral reservoirs, and infiltrating cells, including DCs and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). Moreover, preferential expression of TGF-&#x003b2; was found in the CNS of TMEV-infected SJL mice but not in B6 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>), suggesting that TGF-&#x003b2; may also participate in the development of Th17 cells in the CNS, because the differentiation of Th17 cells requires TGF-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Thus, innate inflammatory responses to TMEV infection in DCs and other antigen-presenting cells would most likely affect the development of Th17 cells, leading to a critical modulation of adaptive immune responses involved in virus&#x02013;host interactions.</p><p>In contrast to resistant B6 mice that display rapid viral clearance and the absence of demyelinating disease development after TMEV infection, susceptible SJL mice exhibit chronic viral persistence and disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Active viral replication is a critical determinant for persistent infection and the development of chronic demyelinating disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). In addition, virally induced inflammatory mediators may also contribute to this harmful process. Although IL-17 does not directly enhance TMEV infection/replication in permissive cells, this cytokine significantly increases the production of virus-induced inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, KC, and MCP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). This suggests that IL-17&#x02013;mediated signals amplify virus-induced innate responses involved in CNS inflammation, which leads to chronic demyelination. Consistent with our findings, a recent report indicated that IL-17 synergistically enhances human rhinovirus-16&#x02013;induced epithelial production of the inflammatory mediator IL-8, a human homologue for mouse KC protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>).</p><p>Previously, the pathogenic role of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had been proposed based on delayed disease development after treatment with anti&#x02013;MHC class II antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). The protective role of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells has also been noted, as virus-infected CD4 or MHC class II KO mice succumb to TMEV-induced demyelinating diseases. However, these studies are difficult to interpret partly because of the lack of protective Th1 as well as reduced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the absence of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell help. It is interesting to note that immunization with CD4 epitope before viral infection protects mice from disease development, whereas such immunization after viral infection exacerbates disease progression, suggesting that expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after infection may be pathogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). Although the protective roles of Th1 and its hallmark cytokine, IFN-&#x003b3;, have been previously documented, the roles of Th17 and IL-17 in viral infection&#x02013;induced inflammatory disease remain undefined. This cell linage plays a critical role in the protection against extracellular bacterial or fungal infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). In contrast, virus-specific Th17 cells are detectable during early HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), suggesting that Th17 cells may be associated with viral replication. Interestingly, mice lacking both of the transcription factors T-bet and eomesodermin develop high levels of IL-17&#x02013;producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells; these mice develop a progressive inflammatory and wasting syndrome after lymphocytic choriomeningitis viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Our results clearly demonstrate that Th17 cells and their cytokine IL-17 play a critical role in the pathogenesis of TMEV-induced chronic demyelinating disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>), similar to that shown with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and perhaps also human multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Therefore, it is most likely that the pathogenic function of infection-induced Th17 cells observed with the TMEV model system is also applicable to other persistent viral infections, although this has yet to be determined. Furthermore, our data indicate that the pathogenic role of Th17 cells is not mouse strain specific. Both genetically resistant B6 mice in conjunction with LPS treatment and susceptible SJL mice induce elevated Th17 responses and chronic viral infection leading to the development of demyelinating disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). In particular, demyelinating disease development in genetically resistant B6 mice in conjunction with LPS treatment suggests that a cytokine milieu induced by opportunistic infections of bacterial agents promotes Th17 responses during viral infection, leading to viral persistence and chronic infection&#x02013;associated diseases. Such an enhanced development of pathogenic Th17 responses may result in clinical episodes in which the timing of infection strongly coincides with the exacerbation of severe clinical symptoms in human multiple sclerosis, as well as in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>).</p><p>One intriguing finding in this study is that IL-17 impairs antiviral cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). This regulatory role of IL-17 on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell function had not previously been identified. In our system, TMEV infection in susceptible mice promotes the generation of Th17 cells that compromise antiviral cytotoxic T cell function via IL-17 production. Previous findings that IL-17 promotes tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>) may also reflect the inhibitory effect of IL-17 on cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T function against target tumor cells. It is well established that cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells confer protective immunity to viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>) by secreting antiviral cytokines or inducing the cytolysis of infected cells via the granule exocytosis and/or Fas&#x02013;FasL pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>). In addition, similar cytolysis of virus-infected cells is observed by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in an MHC class II&#x02013;restricted manner during virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>). Our results indicate that IL-17 interferes with the Fas&#x02013;FasL pathway of cytotoxic effector CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by protecting target cells against apoptosis, possibly through the up-regulation of their prosurvival proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). Because an IL-17 receptor&#x02013;like gene has recently been identified as a novel antiapoptotic gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>), it is conceivable that the IL-17 receptor may have such an antiapoptotic property. Furthermore, Th17 cytokines other than IL-17 may be able to modulate protective antiviral T cell responses. For example, IL-21, an essential cytokine for the induction and maintenance of Th17 cells, has the potential to suppress the production of IFN-&#x003b3; by T lymphocytes and to drive cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>). In addition, a TMEV susceptibility locus, <italic>Tmevp3</italic>, coincides with the IL-22 gene, which encodes IL-22, a Th17 cytokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>), suggesting a potential role of this T cell population in the development of demyelinating disease. More studies with these cytokines would be helpful in clarifying the role of Th17 cells in the establishment of viral persistence and the consequent pathogenesis of virus-induced chronic inflammatory diseases.</p><p>In summary, viral infection in antigen-presenting cells in vitro as well as in susceptible mice in vivo induces elevated IL-6 production that subsequently promotes the development of pathogenic Th17 cells. Th17 cells and their cytokine IL-17 are potent promoters of viral persistence and the development of virally induced chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease. IL-17 inhibits virus-induced cell apoptosis; this protection of virus-infected cells serves as a powerful means for viral evasion of the immune system. The inhibition of apoptosis prolongs the life of infected cells on the one hand, and desensitizes killing by cytotoxic T cells on the other, resulting in enhanced viral replication and persistence. The virus&#x02013;host interaction via Th17 cells and/or their cytokine IL-17 results in the establishment of persistent viral infection and harmful immune responses, leading to the pathogenesis of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease. Conversely, interference with this interaction by neutralizing IL-17 activity reduces lymphocyte infiltration to the CNS and inhibits disease development. This particular interaction may also potentially operate in other chronic diseases associated with a variety of viral infections and could be a target for therapeutic intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice.</title><p>Female SJL/J (SJL) and C57BL/6 (B6) mice were purchased from Harlan Sprague Dawley.
