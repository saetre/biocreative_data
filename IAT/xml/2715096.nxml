Here, we demonstrate a key immunological mechanism, linked epitope suppression, associated with this therapeutic effect. Treatment with selected epitopes from a single allergen resulted in suppression of responses to other (&#x0201c;linked&#x0201d;) epitopes within the same molecule. This phenomenon was induced after peptide immunotherapy in human asthmatic subjects and in a novel HLA-DR1 transgenic mouse model of asthma. Tracking of allergen-specific T cells using DR1 tetramers determined that suppression was associated with the induction of interleukin (IL)-10<sup>+</sup> T cells that were more abundant than T cells specific for the single-treatment peptide and was reversed by anti&#x02013;IL-10 receptor administration. Resolution of airway pathophysiology in this model was associated with reduced recruitment, proliferation, and effector function of allergen-specific Th2 cells. Our results provide, for the first time, in vivo evidence of linked epitope suppression and IL-10 induction in both human allergic disease and a mouse model designed to closely mimic peptide therapy in humans.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>In previous clinical studies, intradermal (i.d.) injection of allergen-derived peptides resulted in modulation of surrogate markers of disease in allergic asthma; early- and late-phase skin responses to allergen were reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oldfield et al., 2002</xref>), along with nasal symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2005a</xref>) and airway hyperreactivity (AHR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexander et al., 2005b</xref>). Peptide treatment suppressed allergen-specific T cell proliferation and production of IL-4, IL-13, and IFN-&#x003b3;, whereas IL-10 production was enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oldfield et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oldfield et al., 2002</xref>). The immunological mechanisms responsible have yet to be defined, but may include clonal deletion, induction of anergy (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schwartz 2003</xref>), and/or active regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sundstedt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Apostolou and Von Boehmer, 2004</xref>). We recently demonstrated induction of functional allergen-specific regulatory T cells after peptide therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Verhoef et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Our clinical studies have focused on peripheral blood responses to allergen before and after therapy. A limitation of studying asthmatic human subjects is that it is not possible to directly examine local allergen-specific T cell responses within lung tissue. To address this issue, we have developed a model of Fel d 1 (the major allergen of the domestic cat, <italic>Felis domesticus</italic>)&#x02013;induced allergic lung inflammation in a mouse transgenic for the human MHC class II molecule (HLA-DR1; DRA/DRB1*0101) and lacking endogenous mouse MHC class II (H2-A&#x003b2;<sup>o</sup>). We were thus able to investigate mechanisms of peptide therapy&#x02013;induced immunomodulation using the same peptides and route of treatment as that used in human therapy. Low-dose (1 &#x000b5;g) peptide therapy was used, reflecting our current clinical practice, and was substantially lower than previously used in mouse models. Immunological mechanisms were investigated by analyzing T cell responses to treatment peptides and nontreatment peptides from the same allergen molecule and using MHC class II (HLA-DR1) tetramers.</p><p>Here, we provide evidence for the induction of linked epitope suppression in both human and mouse responses, together with substantial induction of IL-10 in T cells of mice, which was not limited to cells specific for the treatment peptide. In mice, reduced Th2 cell recruitment to the lung and suppressed effector cell function resulted in IL-10&#x02013;dependent resolution of allergic lung inflammation, directly demonstrating treatment efficacy of peptide therapy in this model. The common responses to cat peptide therapy in humans and mice, as well as clear reduction in allergic inflammation in the mouse model, provide evidence that peptide therapy suppresses allergic asthma via induction of IL-10 and linked epitope suppression.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Peptide immunotherapy induces linked epitope suppression of antigen-specific responses in allergic asthmatic subjects</title><p>To determine the effect of Fel d 1 peptide therapy on responses to Fel d 1 peptides not included in the therapeutic cocktail, we examined ex vivo peptide-specific proliferative responses and cytokine production from PBMCs of peptide-treated allergic asthmatics. PBMC proliferative responses to each of 16 Fel d 1 peptides (12 peptides from a therapeutic peptide vaccine; &#x0201c;treatment peptides,&#x0201d; and 4 Fel d 1 peptides not included in the vaccine; &#x0201c;non-treatment peptides&#x0201d;) were assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 24 cat-allergic asthmatic subjects. Clinical outcomes are reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oldfield et al., 2002</xref>). Responses to all 12 treatment peptides were significantly reduced in the 16 subjects receiving active treatment, but not in the 8 subjects receiving placebo. Strikingly, responses to the four nontreatment peptides were significantly reduced in the active treatment group only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>). Cytokine secretion followed a similar pattern. IL-4 production to all peptides (treatment and nontreatment) was significantly reduced in the active treatment, but not the placebo group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>). IL-13 responses were more variable, with those to 6/12 treatment peptides significantly reduced, together with all nontreatment peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 c</xref>). IFN-&#x003b3; responses were generally low but variable, with those to 9/12 treatment peptides significantly reduced, together with all nontreatment peptides (unpublished data). No significant changes in proliferative or cytokine responses to the control recall antigen (in a routinely vaccinated population) purified protein derivative of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> were observed.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Peptide immunotherapy in cat allergic asthmatic subjects induces linked epitope suppression.</bold> PBMCs were isolated before and after a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of peptide immunotherapy and frozen.

We generated mice transgenic for human HLA DR1, but deficient in mouse MHC class II, thus MHC class II&#x02013;mediated antigen presentation in the DR1-tg/A&#x003b2;<sup>o</sup> model was restricted to HLA-DR1&#x02013;binding peptides. We chose a dosing schedule that was similar to that used in our human study and used a single peptide (residues 29&#x02013;45 of chain 1 of the cat allergen Fel d 1, referred to here as Feld1<sup>[29&#x02013;45],</sup> which was also a component of the clinical vaccine) to induce tolerance in allergen-primed animals to subsequent inhaled challenge with an aqueous extract containing Fel d 1 and other cat proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>; sensitization and treatment protocol). We have previously shown that peptide immunotherapy in allergic asthmatic subjects improves surrogate clinical markers of airway inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexander et al., 2005b</xref>). Therefore, we determined whether the peptide immunotherapy schedule had a similar effect on lung inflammation and function in our mouse model. Mice that were sham sensitized but challenged with allergen did not exhibit any pulmonary inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 a</xref>). Animals treated with the control HA<sup>(306&#x02013;318)</sup> (residues 306&#x02013;318 of influenza hemagglutinin) peptide showed extensive peribronchial and perivascular eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrates comparable to those seen in mice sensitized and challenged with cat allergen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 b</xref> and not depicted). In contrast, mice treated with Feld1<sup>(29&#x02013;45)</sup> had substantially reduced airway inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 c</xref>) compared with HA<sup>(306&#x02013;318)</sup>-treated animals. Importantly, we could assess airway inflammation in both the lumen (by lavage) and lung tissue in the mouse model. Compared with unsensitized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 d</xref>), exposure to cat allergen in sensitized mice was marked by goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus hypersecretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 e</xref>). This was reduced after treatment with Feld1<sup>(29&#x02013;45)</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 f</xref>). The effect of Feld1<sup>(29&#x02013;45)</sup> treatment was reflected in relative levels of leukocytes in the lung lumen. Eosinophils made up &#x0003e;60% of the BAL inflammatory infiltrate, the remaining cells being macrophages, lymphocytes, and a few neutrophils. Total BAL leukocytes and eosinophils were significantly reduced in Feld1<sup>(29&#x02013;45)</sup> versus HA<sup>(306&#x02013;318)</sup>-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 g</xref>). Both total leukocytes and eosinophils were also significantly reduced in digested lung tissue after Feld1<sup>(29&#x02013;45)</sup> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 h</xref>). Thus, a single therapeutic i.d. administration of Feld1<sup>(29&#x02013;45)</sup> was able to significantly reduce allergic lung inflammation in both airway lumen and tissue after allergen rechallenge weeks later.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic protocol flow chart for cat allergen-induced airway disease and therapeutic treatment with Fel d 1 peptide.</bold> Airway inflammation was induced in DR1-tg/A&#x003b2;<sup>o</sup> mice sensitized with 10 &#x000b5;g recombinant Fel d 1 in alum (days 0 and 14) and challenged i.n. with 250 &#x000b5;g cat allergen extract (days 22, 23, and 24).

Because we were using DR1tg mice we could use an HLA-DR tetramer incorporating the treatment peptide (DR1<sub>Feld1[29&#x02013;45]</sub>tetramer) to track allergen-specific cells in the lung and to study specific responses to allergen. The number of tetramer<sup>+</sup> cells in the lungs was small. Therefore, to generate a detectable amount of cells, samples within each group were pooled and restimulated with recombinant Fel d 1 (rFel d 1) protein in vitro.

Treatment with Feld1<sup>(29&#x02013;45)</sup> decreased numbers of DR1<sub>Feld1(29&#x02013;45)</sub>tetramer<sup>+</sup> cells and DR1<sub>Feld1(29&#x02013;45)</sub>tetramer<sup>neg</sup> cells proliferating to other DR1-restricted epitopes of Fel d 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 c</xref>). No staining of cells was observed with control tetramer (DR1<sub>A2</sub>tetramer, which contained a DR1-binding peptide from HLA-A2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 c</xref>, top) or in unsensitized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 c</xref>, left). Staining of cells with DR1<sub>Feld1(29&#x02013;45)</sub>tetramer demonstrated that a proportion of proliferating cells in control peptide-treated mice were specific for Feld1<sup>(29&#x02013;45)</sup>. Their numbers were unaffected by control peptide treatment. After treatment with Feld1<sup>(29&#x02013;45)</sup>, the number of DR1<sub>Feld1(29&#x02013;45)</sub>tetramer<sup>+</sup> cells was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 c</xref>, bottom right versus middle). Furthermore, the proliferative response of DR1<sub>Feld1(29&#x02013;45)</sub>tetramer<sup>neg</sup> cells was also reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 c</xref>, bottom). This is indicative of active regulation through the induction of linked suppression (intramolecular tolerance) because treatment targeting T cells specific for one epitope of a molecule down-regulated the response to other epitopes.</p><p>Another important observation from this experiment is that no increase in DR1<sub>Feld1(29&#x02013;45)</sub>tetramer<sup>+</sup> noncycling cells was observed, suggesting that induction of anergy in airway T cells was not a contributing mechanism in this model.

Therefore, we assessed the effect of peptide treatment on Th2 function and recruitment. Peptide immunotherapy was associated with significantly decreased recruitment of Th2 cells in BAL and digested lung tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>), although recruitment to draining lymph nodes was unaffected. Numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells synthesizing IL-4 or IL-5 were significantly reduced in lung tissue digest cells after therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). Interestingly, no recruitment of these cells was seen in draining lymph nodes after allergen sensitization and challenge. We measured Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) and the Th1 cytokine IFN-&#x003b3; in BAL and in digested lung homogenates of unsensitized and sensitized mice treated with HA<sup>(306&#x02013;318)</sup> or Feld1<sup>(29&#x02013;45)</sup> before inhaled allergen rechallenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Allergen sensitization resulted in significant elevation of Th2 cytokines. Levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 were elevated in sensitized/HA<sup>(306&#x02013;318)</sup>-treated mice. Feld1<sup>(29&#x02013;45)</sup> administration substantially reduced Th2 cytokine levels in the BAL with more modest reductions in lung tissue homogenates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9, a and b</xref>). IFN-&#x003b3; levels were only marginally elevated in this model and not significantly modulated by Feld1<sup>(29&#x02013;45)</sup> treatment. The chemokines CCL11/eotaxin, CCL17/TARC and CCL22/MDC are produced chiefly by epithelial cells and attract CCR3 (receptor for CCL11) and CCR4 (receptor for CCL17 and 22) expressing eosinophils and Th2 cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daugherty et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sallusto et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lloyd et al., 2000</xref>).

In vivo administration of anti-IL-10 receptor (R) antibody effectively reversed peptide-induced tolerance.

Improved understanding of mechanisms is likely to significantly improve efficacy. In our clinical studies, Fel d 1 peptides were delivered i.d., at low dose, to redirect allergen-specific responses, decrease symptoms, and reduce inflammation. Systemic doses of peptide as low as 5 &#x000b5;g reduced skin allergen sensitivity and proinflammatory PBMC responses to allergen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oldfield et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oldfield et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexander et al., 2005b</xref>). Reduced proliferative responses to allergen were associated with increased IL-10 production from PBMC and induction of functional CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Verhoef et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>To define the immunological mechanisms underlying the effects of peptide immunotherapy, we performed a detailed analysis of peptide-specific responses in allergic asthmatic subjects treated with a therapeutic peptide vaccine or with placebo. Peptide treatment reduced proliferative and cytokine responses to both treatment and nontreatment peptides, which is indicative of linked epitope suppression, a process through which cells rendered tolerant to one epitope suppress the function of cells specific for other epitopes within the same molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holan and Mitchison, 1983</xref>). To determine the functional effects of peptide immunotherapy on T cells from the lung parenchyma and airways, which are more relevant to clinical asthma but cannot be studied in human volunteers, we generated a novel mouse model of peptide immunotherapy. The model was specifically designed to closely mimic our human experience. Mice were treated with a single Fel d 1 peptide, which forms part of the therapeutic clinical vaccine used in human studies. Presentation of the peptide to T cells was restricted by the only MHC class II molecule expressed by the mice, the product of a human HLA-DR1 transgene. Using this novel model we were able for the first time to directly track T cell responses to the treatment peptide using HLA-DR1 tetramer reagents. Tetramer analysis revealed reduced antigen-specific proliferative responses of both DR1<sub>Feld1(29&#x02013;45)</sub>tetramer<sup>+</sup> cells and tetramer<sup>neg</sup> cells supporting the observation of linked epitope suppression in the clinical study. Given the marked reduction in lung inflammation and decreases in Th2 responses after peptide treatment in the mouse model, it is clear that the peptide-specific T cell population was capable of down-regulating an established inflammatory response driven by multiple T cell epitopes. Indeed, in this model, targeting of a relatively rare population of peptide-specific T cells was associated with the production of IL-10 by a much larger proportion of the T cell pool. Similar induction of IL-10&#x02013;producing &#x0201c;bystander&#x0201d; T cells was recently reported in a related model after transfer of antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kearley et al., 2005</xref>). &#x0201c;Infectious&#x0201d; expansion of IL-10&#x02013;producing T cell populations has been described previously in other disease scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qin et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>Peptide therapy markedly increased BAL levels of IL-10 and numbers of IL-10<sup>+</sup> T cells in lung tissue, the latter increasing threefold. Lung digest T cells cultured for 7 d with recombinant allergen showed lower levels of proliferation after Fel d 1 peptide treatment compared with control peptide. This may have been caused by suppressive effects of increased numbers of IL-10<sup>+</sup> T cells, and/or caused by a reduction in the numbers of allergen-specific T cells through clonal deletion.</p><p>PBMCs from allergen peptide-treated subjects, and heat shock protein peptide-treated subjects with type I diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, demonstrated enhanced levels of antigen-stimulated IL-10 production in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akdis and Blaser, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Raz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oldfield et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Prakken et al., 2004</xref>).

Adoptive transfer of IL-10&#x02013;secreting cells has been shown to ameliorate allergic airway inflammation. We have shown that transfer of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells suppresses allergic lung inflammation by an IL-10&#x02013;dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kearley et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, IL-10&#x02013;transduced dendritic cells down-regulate allergic airway inflammation in mice by induction of IL-10&#x02013;expressing T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henry et al., 2008</xref>), and OVA-specific T cells engineered to express IL-10 also inhibit Th2-induced AHR and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oh et al., 2002</xref>). In this study, neutralization of IL-10 activity via blockade of IL-10R reversed peptide-induced tolerance, as shown by lung function analysis, elevation of lung and systemic Th2 responses, and reversal of peptide treatment effects on proliferation of Feld1<sup>(29&#x02013;45)</sup>-specific T cells. These results specifically demonstrate the IL-10 dependence of peptide therapy in this model, which does not rely on the transfer of manipulated cells.</p><p>We did not observe an increase in the number of DR1<sub>Feld1(29&#x02013;45)</sub>tetramer<sup>+</sup> nondividing cells which would have been expected had they been anergized. Thus, we further conclude that peptide therapy does not result in the induction of anergy in the target T cell population, a possibility we have been thus far unable to exclude in clinical studies.</p><p>Resolution of allergic airway disease in our mouse model was achieved with administration of only a single peptide. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chai et al.

By directly targeting dendritic cells with an influenza peptide integrated into an antibody to DEC-205, Kretschmer et al. generated antigen-specific regulatory T cells with the equivalent of 500 pg of epitope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kretschmer et al., 2005</xref>). Here we report the induction of antigen-specific tolerance and resolution of inflammation after the single administration of 1 &#x000b5;g of peptide without adjuvant or cell-targeting strategy. Thus, ultra low-dose delivery of CD4 T cell epitopes can induce T cells with regulatory function that are capable of reversing existing pathology.</p><p>Using lavage and whole lung tissue, we demonstrated a marked reduction in airway and tissue eosinophilia and reduced in situ Th2 inflammation. BAL and lung tissue IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 cytokine production was reduced. Local IFN-&#x003b3; production was not elevated after Feld1<sup>(29&#x02013;45)</sup> treatment, suggesting that peptide therapy did not result in deviation from a Th2 to a Th1 response. Levels of the Th2-associated chemokines CCL11, CCL17, and CCL22 were also significantly decreased. Possibly as a direct result of this, we observed fewer CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing IL-4 and IL-5 and reduced recruitment of Th2 cells to lung tissue and BAL after peptide treatment.</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2; has been implicated in T cell regulation of immune responses through conversion of naive CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells to regulatory CD25<sup>+</sup> cells through induction of Foxp3 expression and reduction of T cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Apostolou and Von Boehmer, 2004</xref>). However, in this study, we found no change in levels of active TGF-&#x003b2;1 in BAL or lung tissue homogenates after peptide challenge. This implies that TGF-&#x003b2; does not have a significant role in suppression of pulmonary pathophysiology in this model. We have described similar findings in another lung model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kearley et al., 2005</xref>). Because Foxp3 expression is thought to be a marker for CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hori et al., 2003</xref>) we measured intracellular Foxp3 expression in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from BAL, lung tissue, and peribronchial lymph nodes. Peptide treatment did not result in increased numbers of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells in any of these tissues. These data may discount a role for CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells in peptide-directed resolution of pathophysiology, in agreement with our published clinical findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2004</xref>), but importantly they highlight a role for IL-10&#x02013;secreting regulatory cells.</p><p>In summary, our data indicate that peptide immunotherapy ameliorates allergic inflammation in a mouse model via an IL-10&#x02013;dependent mechanism and substantially reduces clinical surrogate markers of allergy in human cat allergic asthmatics through a process involving linked epitope suppression associated with induction of IL-10. No evidence for the induction of clonal T cell anergy was obtained. Treatment of mice was associated with reduced eosinophilia and mucus production, improved lung function, reduced Th2 cytokine and chemokine levels, lower total and specific IgE, and reduced numbers of Th2 cells infiltrating the lung tissue and BAL. Moreover, we demonstrate, for the first time, the direct effect of peptide administration on functional responses of lung parenchymal T cells specific for the treatment peptide using MHC class II tetramers. The percentage of IL-10&#x02013;producing T cells was markedly enhanced in the lung after peptide therapy and was substantially greater than the percentage of cells specific for the treatment peptide, an observation that is reminiscent of infectious tolerance. Finally, tolerance induction in the mouse model appeared to be independent of TGF-&#x003b2; and Foxp3 expression. These studies further our understanding of mechanisms of peptide-induced tolerance in allergic asthma. These results will inform the design and evaluation of peptide interventions to ameliorate chronic allergic and autoimmune diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of peptide immunotherapy in allergic asthma</title><p>The protocol and clinical outcomes of this trial have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oldfield et al., 2002</xref>). The study was approved by the Royal Brompton and Harefield National Health Service Trust Ethics Committee. All subjects gave written informed consent. For this study, peripheral blood samples were obtained before and after therapy. PBMCs were isolated and cryopreserved.
