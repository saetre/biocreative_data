This problem has particular importance because mutations in ROR2 are associated with two human skeletal dysmorphology syndromes, recessive Robinow Syndrome (RS) and dominant acting Brachydactyly type B (BDB). Here we show, using a constitutive dimerisation approach, that ROR2 exhibits dimerisation-induced tyrosine kinase activity and the ROR2 C-terminal domain, which is deleted in BDB, is required for recruitment and activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src. Native ROR2 phosphorylation is induced by the ligand Wnt5a and is blocked by pharmacological inhibition of Src kinase activity. Eight sites of Src-mediated ROR2 phosphorylation have been identified by mass spectrometry. Activation via tyrosine phosphorylation of ROR2 receptor leads to its internalisation into Rab5 positive endosomes. These findings show that BDB mutant receptors are defective in kinase activation as a result of failure to recruit Src.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human ROR2 is one of two related ROR proteins, identified by sequence similarity to TRK receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001873-Masiakowski1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, whose mechanism of action remains enigmatic. From structural predictions ROR receptors contain an extra cellular immunoglobulin-like domain; a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that resembles the Wnt binding domain of Frizzled (Fz) receptors; a Kringle motif and single pass transmembrane domain.

We also show that activation of ROR2 kinase requires the C terminal domain that is deleted in BDB and that this domain is also required for recruitment of the non receptor kinase Src. Native ROR2 is a target for Src mediated phosphorylation and pharmacological inhibition of Src suppresses ROR2 activation. Collectively these findings reveal that the BDB mutant ROR2 receptors are defective in kinase activation via failure to recruit Src.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>ROR2 Exhibits Intrinsic Kinase Activity</title><p>To evaluate the intrinsic kinase activity potential of ROR2, the cytoplasmic domain of ROR2 was fused to the dimeric Fc portion of human IgG to create Fc-ROR2 &#x02018;wild type&#x02019; (WT), Fc-ROR2 &#x02018;Kinase dead&#x02019; and an Fc-ROR2 truncation mutant (Y<sup>755</sup>X) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001873-Oishi2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001873-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> shows a schematic detailing these constructs as well as the original full length, myc-tagged ROR2 constructs.

The consequence of these combined actions is prominent phosphorylation of the receptor on tyrosine residues.</p><p>We next sought to identify the substrates for Src-mediated phosphorylation in ROR2. Full length ROR2-myc WT was co-expressed with Src A, immunoprecipitated and tryptic peptides subjected to CID MS/MS (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001873.s001">Fig. S1</xref> and Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001873.s002">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001873.s003">S2</xref>).

If Wnt5a activation of ROR2 phosphorylation yields a productive signalling response it is predicted that internalisation of ROR2 into Rab5 positive vesicles would occur. ROR2-myc WT or KD transfected cells were stimulated with either 0.1&#x00025; BSA carrier or Wnt5a and the sub-cellular localisation of ROR2 and Rab5A were examined by immunofluorescence. Clearly ROR2-myc WT co-localisation with Rab5A was increased after 5 min but not after 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001873-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, upper and middle panels, respectively) of Wnt5a stimulation. These findings show that activation of ROR2 phosphorylation via Wnt5a results in rapid receptor internalisation into Rab5 positive sorting endosomes. It also provides a functional readout for ROR2 signalling although, given ignorance of the downstream signalling pathways employed by ROR2, this could indicate either attenuation or sustained signalling. Given the prominent role for Src in ROR2 kinase activation described above we evaluated the role of Src kinase activity in the Wnt-induced localisation into Rab5 endosomes. ROR2-myc WT transfected chondrocytes were incubated with a Src family kinase inhibitor (SU6656) prior to stimulation with 0.1&#x00025; BSA carrier or Wnt5a for 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001873-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, lower panel) and the effect on sub-cellular localisation of ROR2 was detected by immunofluorescence. ROR2 showed little co-localisation with Rab5 when Src was pharmacologically inhibited. Collectively, these results show that Src activity is a requirement for ROR2 trafficking into the Rab5 positive endosomal compartment following activation by Wnt5a. Interestingly, despite the &#x02018;latent&#x02019; phosphorylation of Fc-ROR2 KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001873-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), only marginal co-localisation with Rab5A was observed after 5 min of Wnt5a stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001873-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, upper panel) and no co-localisation after either 30 min or 5 min following treatment with SU6656 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001873-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, middle and lower panels, respectively).

This jointly explains the apparently weak kinase activity, the requirement for an intact ATP binding site, the requirement of functional Src kinase and the key role of the BDB domain in ROR2 function. Our findings indicate that ROR2 represents a second non-canonical pathway for Wnt signalling which is an unorthodox example of classical RTK mediated signalling which proceeds by ligand-mediated receptor homo-dimerisation followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of receptor substrate residues and propagation of the signal. In support of this model we show that dimerisation is sufficient to induce ROR2 activation and that Wnt5a induces ROR2 phosphorylation.

Our results show that the region deleted in BDB mutants is required for efficient ROR2 phosphorylation. This region also contains potential binding sites for Src and target sites for phosphorylation and recruitment of potential downstream effectors. Thus deletion of this region, as found in BDB mutants, yields a receptor which is competent to bind Wnt ligand but unable to produce a productive tyrosine phosphorylation signalling response. In classical RTK signalling receptors this type of mutant would, depending upon gene dosage, be predicted to exhibit dominant negative properties which diminish the signalling functions of endogenous native receptors in the presence of ligand. This would suggest that heterozygous BDB mutations (if expressed at appropriate levels) would resemble loss of function homozygous RS mutants. This is clearly not the case as the phenotypes of the two syndromes are quite distinct. The alternative explanation is that BDB mutations represent a gain of function phenotype whereby ablation of the ROR2 tyrosine kinase pathway results in the activation (or relief of repression) of signalling pathways in the limb which leads to digit truncation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001873-Stricker1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Candidate pathways would include those repressed by Src kinase activity and limited to digit primordia and not other regions of ROR2 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001873-Stricker1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Cell Culture and Transfection</title><p>T/C-28a2 human chondrocytes (a generous gift of Dr. Goldring, Saint Louis University, USA) were cultured at 37&#x000b0;C, 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> for up to six months in a mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium and Ham's F12 (1&#x02236;1, v/v) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine (Invitrogen), 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, 0.2 U/mL penicillin, 4.5 g/L glucose (Sigma) and 10&#x00025; fetal calf serum (v/v) (Labtech International).

The mass spectrometer alternated between a full FT-MS scan (m/z 395-1600), subsequent CID MS/MS scans of the five most abundant ions, and, if a neutral loss of 98 Da from the precursor ion was observed in the CID mass spectrum, an MS<sup>3</sup> scan of the neutral loss ion. Survey scans were acquired in the ICR cell with a resolution of 100,000 at m/z 400. Precursor ions were isolated and subjected to CID in the linear ion trap. Isolation width was 3 Th. Only multiply-charged precursor ions were selected MS/MS. CID was performed with helium gas at normalized collision energy of 35&#x00025;. Precursor ions were activated for 30 ms. Data acquisition was controlled by Xcalibur 2.0 software. Data were searched against the Swissprot database using the SEQUEST (Thermo Electron) and Mascot algorithms (Matrix Sciences, UK). Phosphorylation site localisation was assessed using the A-score algorithm (26), with manual validation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001873.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>The annotated mass spectra of phosphorylation sites in the mouse ROR2 cytoplasmic regions.
