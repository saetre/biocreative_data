From our cDNA microarray experiments, we determined that a variety of nucleotide synthesis-related genes, including TS, were downregulated with lapatinib, and this was apparent in HER2-amplified cells. Targeted and pharmacologic inhibition assays confirmed that the dual inhibition of EGFR and HER2 is required for the more effective reduction of TS as compared to what was observed with gefitinib or trasutuzumab alone. Additionally, we determined that co-transfected EGFR and HER2 activate the TS gene promoter more profoundly than do either EGFR or HER2 alone.

However, another possible explanation for this observed synergistic effect would be that lapatinib may enhance sensitivity to capecitabine. In this regard, several lines of inquiry have demonstrated that EGFR-TKIs inhibited the expression of the transcription factor E2F-1, thereby inducing the downregulation of TS expression and activity, and mediating the synergistic interaction with 5-FU <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005933-Magne1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005933-Okabe1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the downregulation of TS remains to be clearly elucidated. Fluoropyrimidines such as 5-FU are extensively utilized in the treatment of colorectal, breast, and aerodigestive tract cancers, and are intracellularly converted to 5-fluoro- deoxyuridine-monophosphate (FdUMP), thus forming a stable tertiary complex and inhibiting TS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005933-Chu1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005933-vanderWilt1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the nuclear importation of EGFR and HER2 has been also demonstrated, although its biological significance remains unclear. EGFR has been detected in the nuclei of cancer cells and in primary tumor specimens of various origins, as well as in those of other highly proliferative tissues. While localized in the nucleus, EGFR may operate as a transcriptional regulator. It has been previously reported that nuclear EGFR regulates the expression of cyclin D1, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and B-MYB genes via transactivational activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005933-Lo1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005933-Hanada1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

We determined that EGFR and HER2 existed within the nucleus, and that nuclear EGFR and HER2 bind to and activate the TS gene promoter. We further noted that lapatinib inhibits the nuclear translocation of EGFR and HER2, thereby induing a reduced association with the TS promoter. The lapatinib-mediated downregulation of TS was apparent in HER2-amplified cells; however, it was also noticeable in the wild-type cells. It is also important to note that the dual inhibition of EGFR and HER2 is the most effective method for achieving maximal TS downregulation. Taken together, these data show that lapatinib, a dual inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 TS, may prove useful not only as a targeted therapy, but also as a chemosensitizer of cytotoxic anticancer drugs in a specific subset of tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Lapatinib downregulates fluoropyrimidine-target genes including TS</title><p>Recently, we reported that lapatinib evidences significant growth inhibitory activity in HER2-amplified gastric cancer (GC) cells and, in combination with 5-FU, results in a synergistic growth-inhibitory effect <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005933-Kim2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

Accordingly, we have speculated that lapatinib may be superior to EGFR TKI from the standpoint of chemosensitization to fluoropyrimidine. In order to address these issues and investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we first conducted a set of oligonucleotide microarray experiments to compare the effects of gefitinib with lapatinib from the perspective of the chemosensitization to fluoropyrimidine. We utilized three different GC cell lines, SNU216 (EGFR<sup>WT</sup>, HER2<sup>Amp</sup>), which is sensitive to lapatinib (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.02 &#x000b5;M), or gefitinib (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.1 &#x000b5;M), SNU484 (EGFR<sup>WT</sup>, HER2<sup>WT</sup>) which is moderately sensitive to lapatinib (IC<sub>50</sub> m1 &#x000b5;M) and resistant to gefitnib (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x0003e;10 &#x000b5;M), or SNU668 (EGFR<sup>WT</sup>, HER2<sup>WT</sup>, K-ras<sup>MT</sup>) which is resistant to both (lapatinib IC<sub>50</sub>&#x0003e;10 &#x000b5;M, gefitnib IC<sub>50</sub>&#x0003e;10 &#x000b5;M; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005933-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). The expressions of representative nucleotide synthesis-related genes &#x0005b;E2F-1, TS, TK1 (thymidine kinase 1), DHFR(dihydrofolate reductase), RRM2 (ribonucleotide reductase M2 polypeptide), DUT (DUTP pyrophosphatase), NME1 (nuclear diphosphate kinase 1)&#x0005d; were reduced as the result of gefitinib or lapatinib treatment in TKI-sensitive cells. Fold reductions were decreased in proportion with drug sensitivity in these cases. For example, lapatinib downregulated gene expression in lapatinib-sensitive SNU216 and SNU484 cells, but did not affect gene expression in the lapatinib-resistant SNU668. As compared to gefitinib, lapatinib treatment induced higher fold reductions of all of the downregulated genes in SNU216 and SNU 484 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005933-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). Thus, it is probable that the inhibition of both EGFR and HER2 appears to be more effective from the perspective of gene regulation. It is also crucial to note that lapatinib modestly downregulates gene expression in HER2 wild-type SNU484 cells, as well as in HER2-amplified cells. The transcription factor E2F-1 downregulates nucleotide synthesis-associated genes, including TS, and the change in E2F-1 as the result of lapatinib treatment was apparent in SNU216 and SNU484 cells, but was not noted in the SNU668 cells. All these data were confirmed via RT-PCR and Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005933-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Lapatinib downregulated TS mRNA and protein in a dose-dependent manner in the SNU216 and SNU484 cells, but not in the SNU668 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005933-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). In HER2-amplified SNU216 cells that were sensitive to both, lapatinib suppressed gene expression more potently than gefitinib. These findings were confirmed in different HER2-amplified N87 and SKBr3 cells following treatment with either gefitinib or lapatinib. As is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005933-g002">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005933.s001">Fig. S1</xref>, lapatinib consistently induced a profound reduction of TS, TK1, DHFR, or RRM2 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner as compared to gefitinib. Lapatinib effectively inactivated phosphorylated-EGFR and -HER2 at the same doses as used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005933-g002">Fig. 2C</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005933-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Together, these results revealed that lapatinib downregulates a variety of nucleotide synthesis-related genes, including E2F-1 and TS. Moreover, the gene modulation effect of the dual inhibitor is superior to that of EGFR TKI, which is more apparent in HER2-amplified cells. Considering that these nucleotide synthesis-related genes are major determinants of fluoropyrimidine sensitivity, the dual inhibition of EGFR and HER2 TK by lapatinib appears to represent a promising strategy for the sensitization of cancer cells to fluoropyrimidines in a subset of tumors.</p><fig id="pone-0005933-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005933.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Lapatinib downregulates fluoropyrimidine-target genes.</title><p><italic>A</italic>, Downregulated fluoropyrimidine-sensitivity genes by oligonucleotide microarray based on analysis comparing DMSO/lapatinib-treatment versus DMSO/gefitinib-treatment samples at 24 hours of each treatment in SNU216, SNU484, or SNU668 cells. <italic>B</italic>, The indicated cells were treated with lapatinib (0.1, 1, 1 &#x000b5;mol/L) for 24 hours. mRNA levels of E2F1 and TS were assessed via RT-PCR (<italic>upper</italic>). &#x003b2;-Actin was utilized as a loading control.

First, we compared TS promoter activity according to the transfection of EGFR and HER2 nuclear localization signal (NLS) WT or MT in both EGFR and HER2-negative CHO cells. Following transient transfection with EGFR-NLS WT, HER2-NLS WT or both, we noted that TS promoter activity was increased to a greater degree by forced HER2 expression than by forced EGFR expression, and was activated more profoundly by dual-expression than by single-expression. By way of contrast, after transfection with EGFR-NLS MT, HER2-NLS MT, or both, TS promoter activation was lower than the effects of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005933-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Consistently, the knockdown of EGFR and/or HER2 and lapatinib treatment significantly reduced the ability of the TS promoter in response to EGF in SKBr3 cells, as compared to what was observed with gefitinib or trastuzumab alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005933-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). CHIP demonstrated that EGF-induced nuclear EGFR and HER2 bind to the TS promoter in SNU216 and SKBr3 cells, and that their association was abolished by lapatinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005933-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). Collectively, these results reveal that nuclear EGFR and HER2 activate TS gene transcription via binding to the TS promoter, and that the TS promoter-bound EGFR and HER2 are inhibited by lapatinib, ultimately resulting in the downregulation of TS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have demonstrated that lapatinib, a dual inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 TK, effectively downregulates a variety of nucleotide synthesis-related genes, including TS, and exhibits activity superior to that of gefitinib not only in HER2-amplified cells, but also in wild-type cells. As a mechanism, we have determined, for the first time, that nuclear EGFR and HER2 activate TS gene transcription, and that EGFR and HER2-bound TS promoter activities are inhibited by lapatinib treatment.</p><p>Traditionally, EGFR and HER2, once activated, form a homo- or heterodimer and transduce the mitogenic signal into the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005933-Lo1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it has also been demonstrated that ligand-activated EGFR or overexpressed HER2 can form a homo- or heterodimer, and that these are also translocated into the nucleus. Therefore, nuclear EGFR and/or HER2 can operate as transcription factors, activating a variety of genes, including iNOS, B-MYB, and COX-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005933-Lo1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005933-Wang1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Considering that nuclear EGFR and HER2 can function as transcription factors, it can be plausibly surmised that other genes involved in cell proliferation might also be regulated by nuclear EGFR and HER2. In the current study, we demonstrated that TS is activated by nuclear EGFR and HER2. In the context of TS activation, it appears that EGFR and HER2 may perform a pivotal role, as the dual inhibitor, lapatinib, or the double knockdown of EGFR and HER2, evidenced the maximal TS inhibitory effects. It is also worth noting that lapatinib is superior to gefitinib with regard to gene regulation, which also emphasizing the significance of the dual inhibition of EGFR and HER2.</p><p>In SNU216 cells evidencing HER2 overexpression, we determined that nuclear EGFR and HER2 are induced in a ligand-dependent and -independent fasion, respectively. The nuclear translocation of EGFR upon ligand stimulation is noticeable in these cells and is inhibited by lapatinib, which implies that the inhibition of EGFR is also required in HER2-amplified cells. It is also conceivable that nuclear EGFR and HER2 may form a homo- and heterodimer, which would bind to the promoters of target genes such as TS. We have previously determined that lapatinib inhibits the heterodimer of EGFR and HER2 in cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005933-Kim1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Because lapatinib reduced the levels of nuclear EGFR and HER2, we speculated that lapatinib might also destabilize the levels of hetero- or homodimers of EGFR and HER2 in the nucleus. In HER2 wild-type cells, lapatinib exerted modest gene downregulation effects, as is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005933-g002">Figs. 2A and 2B</xref>. Therefore, it appears that lapatinib can be tested for the purpose of gene modulation, regardless of the HER2 status.</p><p>Collectively, the data provided in this study demonstrate the molecular mechanisms underlying the synergy between lapatinib and fluoropyrimidine. In the future, lapatinib should be investigated as a chemosensitizing agent that enhances cytotoxicity or circumvents resistance against anticancer drugs, not only in HER2-amplified, but also in HER2 wild-type tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents</title><p>Gefitinib was kindly provided by AstraZeneca, and lapatinib was generously provided by GlaxoSmithKline.
