Using hair bud morphogenesis as a paradigm, we employed mutant mouse models and cultured keratinocytes to dissect the contributions of multiple extracellular cues in orchestrating adhesion dynamics and proliferation to shape the cluster of cells involved. We found that transforming growth factor &#x003b2;2 signaling is necessary to transiently induce the transcription factor Snail and activate the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in the bud. In the epidermis, <italic>Snail</italic> misexpression leads to hyperproliferation and a reduction in intercellular adhesion. When <italic>E-cadherin</italic> is transcriptionally down-regulated, associated adhesion proteins with dual functions in signaling are released from cell-cell contacts, a process which we demonstrate leads to Ras-MAPK activation. These studies provide insights into how multipotent cells within a sheet are stimulated to undergo transcriptional changes that result in proliferation, junctional remodeling, and bud formation. This novel signaling pathway further weaves together the web of different morphogens and downstream transcriptional events that guide hair bud formation within the developing skin.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The study of hair follicle morphogenesis provides insights into how cells within a sheet can be triggered to proliferate, remodel, and form buds - a recurring theme in development</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian development involves the morphogenesis of complex three-dimensional structures from seemingly uniform sheets or masses of cells. A simple bud-like structure initiates the formation of many organs, including lungs, spinal cord, mammary glands, and hair follicles &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b01">1</xref>&#x0005d;. The multipotent, adhering epithelial cells are typically attached to an underlying basal lamina that polarizes the epithelial sheet and separates it from surrounding mesenchyme. Budding morphogenesis is guided by a reciprocal exchange of signals between epithelium and mesenchyme to specify the identity of the organ that will form and to govern its growth.</p><p>At the helm of these molecular communication pathways are Wnts, bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), transforming growth factor &#x003b2;s (TGF-&#x003b2;s), and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). Through activation of cell surface transmembrane receptors, these external signaling molecules trigger distinct cascades of intracellular events that culminate in changes in gene expression, growth, and differentiation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b02">2</xref>&#x0005d;. How this constellation of signals collaborates in tailoring each budding process so that it executes a distinct morphogenetic program has yet to be comprehensively defined. However, the process appears to be patterned at the initial stages of bud formation, since the relative importance of these pathways and their downstream effectors differ as buds begin to develop and cell fates are specified.</p><p>The development of a bud requires a number of coordinated changes in the behavior of the targeted cells within an epithelial sheet. The process must be accompanied by alterations in the proliferation, polarity, shape, and adhesiveness of selected cells, as well as by modifications in their underlying basal lamina. Thus, extracellular epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk must be intricately orchestrated to couple the determination of distinct cell fates with the contemporaneous remodeling of the physical and structural properties of the cell.</p><p>Among the few dispensable organs, hair follicles offer an excellent model system to study epithelial bud formation. Mammalian skin epithelium begins as a single sheet of multipotent ectodermal cells. During development, specialized mesenchymal cells populate the skin in a spatially defined pattern to initiate the complex epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk that will specify the bud &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b03">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Once committed, a small cluster of epithelial cells, the placode, instructs a group of underlying mesenchymal cells to condense and form the nascent dermal papilla, which will be a permanent fixture of the hair follicle. Subsequent exchanges between the placode and nascent dermal papilla result in further growth of the follicle into the underlying dermis, or down-growth, and eventual differentiation into the six concentric layers of the mature follicle.</p><p>Previously, we delineated how two respective epithelial and mesenchymal signals, Wnts and the BMP-inhibitory factor noggin, function in concert to induce lymphoid enhancer factor-1/&#x003b2;-catenin (LEF-1/&#x003b2;-catenin)-mediated gene transcription within the follicle placode &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04">4</xref>&#x0005d;. The downstream changes elicited through convergence of these two early signaling pathways include down-regulation of the gene encoding E-cadherin, the prototypical epithelial cadherin that forms the transmembrane core of intercellular adherens junctions (AJs) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b05">5</xref>&#x0005d;. We subsequently showed that when E-cadherin is transgenically elevated in mouse skin, hair follicle morphogenesis is blocked, suggesting that E-cadherin down-regulation is a critical event in governing the adhesion dynamics necessary for budding morphogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Like LEF-1, E-cadherin also binds to &#x003b2;-catenin. At sites of cell-cell contact, however, E-cadherin-&#x003b2;-catenin complexes recruit &#x003b1;-catenin, which in turn coordinates the associated actin polymerization dynamics necessary to stabilize nascent AJs and integrate the cytoskeleton across an epithelial sheet &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b08">8</xref>&#x0005d;. &#x003b1;-Catenin also binds to the class III Lin-1, Isl-1, Mec-3 (LIM) protein Ajuba (a member of the zyxin family of proteins), which appears to function dually in both adhesion and in activation of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b10">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Through these links, AJs appear able to couple adhesion with cytoskeletal dynamics as well as with nuclear and cytoplasmic signaling. This provides a framework for conceptualizing why E-cadherin levels appear to impact upon a plethora of developmental processes (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b11">11</xref>&#x0005d;).</p><p>As we probed more deeply into the underlying mechanisms governing <italic>E-cadherin</italic> promoter activity, we were intrigued by the close proximity of the LEF-1/&#x003b2;-catenin binding site to a site known to bind the Snail/Slug family of zinc finger transcriptional repressor proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b15">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Both activity of Snail and down-regulation of E-cadherin play pivotal roles in epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMTs), typified by the transformation of polarized, adhering epithelial cells into motile mesenchymal cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b17">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Bud formation differs from an EMT in that E-cadherin activity needs to be down-regulated but not prevented, so that adhesive junctions are remodeled rather than quantitatively impaired. Supportive of an underlying ability to fine-tune cadherin expression at the transcriptional level, Snail seems to have an additive effect with LEF-1/&#x003b2;-catenin in negatively modulating <italic>E-cadherin</italic> promoter activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04">4</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In the present study, we discovered that Snail is expressed briefly at an early stage of hair bud formation, when E-cadherin down-regulation and activation of proliferation take place. Thereafter, Snail disappears and remains absent during subsequent follicle down-growth and maturation. This exquisite pattern appears to be functionally relevant since altering it in vivo correspondingly affects features associated with hair bud formation, including down-regulation of E-cadherin, increased proliferation, and repressed terminal differentiation. Although the temporal spike of Snail in the hair bud is reflected at the mRNA level and seems to follow Wnt signaling and BMP inhibition, LEF-1/&#x003b2;-catenin activation does not appear to induce <italic>Snail</italic> gene expression in embryonic skin keratinocytes. In contrast, we provide in vitro, transgenic (Tg), and gene targeting evidence to show that TGF-&#x003b2;2 and small phenotype&#x02013; and mothers against decapentaplegic&#x02013;related protein 2 (SMAD2) signaling are upstream inducers of <italic>Snail</italic> gene expression in skin epithelium. In the absence of TGF-&#x003b2;2 signaling and <italic>Snail</italic> gene expression, hair placodes can form, but further follicle down-growth is blocked. Our studies point to the view that Snail likely functions downstream of cell fate specification, at a stage where the bud begins to exhibit enhanced proliferation and migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>Snail</italic> mRNA and Protein Are Expressed Transiently at the Hair Bud Stage of Follicle Morphogenesis</title><p>Although Snail family members are most frequently associated with EMTs, they also participate in many malignant processes involving a down-regulation but not a quantitative abrogation of intercellular junctions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d;. The range of developmental processes in which Snail family members have been implicated thus includes the type of epithelial remodeling that is observed in hair follicle bud formation. Given our prior observation that exogenously added Snail can participate with LEF-1/&#x003b2;-catenin in down-regulating <italic>E-cadherin</italic> expression in keratinocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04">4</xref>&#x0005d;, coupled with the established requirement for LEF-1/&#x003b2;-catenin in hair follicle morphogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b19">19</xref>&#x0005d;, we turned to addressing whether Snail/Slug family members might also participate in the process.</p><p>PCR analyses identified transient <italic>Snail</italic> mRNA expression during a period of skin embryogenesis when waves of hair follicles are forming (unpublished data).To pinpoint specifically where <italic>Snail</italic> mRNA is expressed in the developing skin, we conducted in situ hybridization using a cRNA probe unique to the <italic>Snail</italic> 3&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR). Embryonic day 17.5 (E17.5) was chosen, since the multiple waves of follicle morphogenesis occurring at this time enabled us to evaluate Snail expression at different stages of the process. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, specific hybridization was detected within the epithelium of nascent hair buds. By contrast, as follicles progressed further through their development (e.g., germ and peg stages), they exhibited no signs of hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The transient nature of <italic>Snail</italic> mRNA expression during follicle development was most apparent in hybridized skin sections containing follicles from two different waves of morphogenesis (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Hybridizing hair buds from a later wave appeared juxtaposed with nonhybridizing follicles from an earlier wave.</p><p>To determine whether this transient nature of <italic>Snail</italic> mRNA expression is reflected at the protein level, we generated an antibody against the N-terminal sequence that resides upstream of the more conserved zinc finger domains. As judged by Western blot analysis, the antibody did not detect endogenous proteins from cultured keratinocytes, but it did yield a band of the expected size from keratinocytes transiently expressing a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Snail protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The antibody also recognized a band corresponding to the size of endogenous Snail (approximately 28 kDa) in lysates from embryonic mouse skin, the temporal appearance of which corresponded to the waves of hair follicle morphogenesis from E15.5 to newborn when over 90&#x00025; of the hair on the mouse is formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Consistent with the Western blot data, immunohistochemical analysis did not detect Snail in single-layered E13.5 epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) nor in the placode, which is the earliest morphological sign of the commitment of multipotent cells of the embryonic ectoderm to a hair cell fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Consistent with the in situ hybridization results, anti-Snail antibody labeled only hair buds and not follicles at more mature stages of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). Taken together, the anti-Snail antibody appeared to be specific for its target protein. It did not detect other Snail family members known to be expressed in keratinocytes and/or skin (unpublished data). Furthermore, the immunohistochemical data paralleled our <italic>Snail</italic> in situ hybridization data revealing transient <italic>Snail</italic> expression at the hair bud stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><p>As judged by immunohistochemistry, Snail protein was localized to the nuclei of the hair bud cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). This feature was consistent with Snail's known function as a transcriptional repressor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b13">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Additionally, anti-Snail labeling was detected in only three of the four major waves of follicle morphogenesis. Snail was not found in the buds of guard hairs that are the earliest of all hairs to form (at E13.5), and which constitute less than 5&#x00025; of the mouse coat (unpublished data).</p><p>As judged by immunofluorescence with antibodies against the proliferating nuclear antigen Ki67, the timing of Snail expression coincided with the stage at which the developing follicle enhanced its proliferation and down-growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001">Figure 1</xref>F). Immunohistochemistry with antibodies against the active (phosphorylated) form of MAPK (pMAPK) marked a subset of the proliferating (Ki67-positive) cells, and pMAPK-positive cells were enriched in the hair bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001">Figure 1</xref>G). The timing of Snail induction and Ki67 and pMAPK enrichment in the hair bud appeared to follow closely the induction of LEF-1/&#x003b2;-catenin activity, known to initiate in the hair placode stage &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b20">20</xref>&#x0005d;. However, like placodes, hair buds exhibited down-regulation in E-cadherin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001">Figure 1</xref>H; see also &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04">4</xref>&#x0005d;).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Sustained Expression of Snail Results in Epidermal Hyperproliferation and Differentiation Defects in Tg Mouse Skin</title><p>The striking spike of Snail expression coincident with hair bud formation and enhanced proliferation prompted us to examine the consequences of ectopically expressing Snail elsewhere in mouse skin epidermis. To distinguish Tg from endogenous Snail, we used the HA-epitope, shown previously not to alter Snail's transcriptional activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b12">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Of 20 <italic>K14-Snail&#x0005b;HA&#x0005d;</italic> Tg animals generated, three expressed the transgene and all exhibited analogous phenotypes. Mice that integrated the transgene at the single-cell stage died at or shortly after birth. The three surviving full-Tg founder mice harbored transgene integrations that gave stable transmission of mosaic <italic>Snail</italic> gene expression through the germline. Progressively poor health necessitated our sacrificing most offspring from these lines within a year of birth.</p><p>As <italic>Snail</italic> Tg animals grew, they became distinguished by their small size, short tails, and flaky skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Histological analyses of 3-d old (P3) mice revealed mosaic patches marked by epidermal thickening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The mosaic morphology was reflected at the level of Tg Snail protein, with only the hyperthickened regions expressing nuclear HA-tagged Snail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). These hyperthickened areas were marked by excessive proliferation, as revealed by antibodies against the proliferating nuclear antigen Ki67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002">2</xref>E). Activated, pMAPK-positive cells were also prevalent in these areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002">Figure 2</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002">2</xref>G), as were cells expressing keratin 6, a keratin induced in the suprabasal layers of hyperproliferative skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002">Figure 2</xref>H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002">2</xref>I).</p><p>Expression of the <italic>Snail</italic> transgene did not block terminal differentiation in the hyperproliferative epidermis, but it distorted it markedly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g003">Figure 3</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g003">3</xref>H). Typical of most hyperproliferating conditions, Snail expression led to a large expansion in layers with spinous and granular morphology. Additionally, however, was a marked and variable expansion of keratin 5 (K5), normally restricted to the innermost basal layer (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Although the failure of <italic>Snail</italic>-null mice to develop past gastrulation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b21">21</xref>&#x0005d; precluded our ability to study the loss of Snail function in skin development, a good correlation emerged between the expression of Snail protein and the extension of K5, Ki67, and pMAPK suprabasally (compare data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g003">3</xref>).</p><p>The changes in hyperproliferation and differentiation were not initially accompanied by gross signs of epithelial invaginations. With age, however, epidermal folds and undulations developed in areas where Snail was expressed, and proliferative markers persisted in these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g003">Figure 3</xref>I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g003">3</xref>J; anti-cyclin D staining). The undulations were accompanied by partial dissolution of the underlying basement membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g003">Figure 3</xref>K and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g003">3</xref>L). Aberrant staining was also observed with antibodies against components of the hemidesmosomes, which provide strong adhesion of basal epidermal cells to the underlying basal lamina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g003">Figure 3</xref>M and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g003">3</xref>N). Interestingly, similar types of alterations occur in the basement membrane in the hair bud of embryonic and newborn mice when Snail is normally expressed. The fact that the basement membrane separating the epidermis from the dermis is altered only in the adult Tg animals suggests the involvement of intermediary factors not as readily available in the epidermis as they are in the follicle.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Possible Links between Epidermal Hyperproliferation and Down-regulation of AJ Proteins in <italic>Snail</italic> Tg Mice</title><p>Given that the <italic>E-cadherin</italic> promoter is a direct target for Snail-mediated repression in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b13">13</xref>&#x0005d;, and that E-cadherin was down-regulated in Snail-expressing hair buds, we examined the status of E-cadherin and other AJ proteins within regions of hyperproliferative epidermis where Tg Snail was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). In these regions, immunofluorescence staining of E-cadherin and &#x003b1;-catenin were markedly diminished. In contrast, the intensity of antibody staining for two other AJ proteins, &#x003b2;-catenin and Ajuba, was still strong. Interestingly, however, despite appreciable immunofluorescence, localization of &#x003b2;-catenin and Ajuba appeared to be largely cytoplasmic rather than at cell-cell borders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g004">Figure 4</xref>A insets).</p><p>Architectural differences in the epidermis made Western blot analyses somewhat difficult to gauge. However, in regions such as ear skin, where the highest levels of Snail protein were expressed, the effects were accentuated. In both back skin and ear skin, overall levels of E-cadherin and &#x003b1;-catenin were reduced, under conditions where &#x003b2;-catenin and Ajuba levels remained unchanged relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Taken together, these data were consistent with our results obtained from immunofluorescence microscopy.</p><p>A priori, the decrease in &#x003b1;-catenin levels could be due to either direct transcriptional repression by Snail or perturbations in AJ formation caused by the decrease in <italic>E-cadherin</italic> gene expression. To distinguish between these possibilities, we tested whether &#x003b1;-catenin levels could be restored by exogenous expression of <italic>E-cadherin</italic> in Snail-expressing keratinocytes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, transiently transfected keratinocytes expressing HA-tagged Snail displayed a loss of E-cadherin and &#x003b1;-catenin at cell-cell borders.

The ability to restore &#x003b1;-catenin expression and localization under these conditions argues against the notion that Snail transcriptionally represses <italic>&#x003b1;-catenin.</italic> Rather, the findings are consistent with a previous report that E-cadherin is required for the translation of <italic>&#x003b1;-catenin</italic> mRNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Despite the reductions in AJ markers, Tg skin still displayed sealed membranes and intercellular junctions that were largely intact, as judged by ultrastructural analyses (unpublished data).

Given the increase in pMAPK staining in <italic>Snail</italic> Tg epidermis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002">Figure 2</xref>G), we used pMAPK levels as our assay to test whether the loss of E-cadherin contributed to the Snail-mediated increase in proliferation. Consistent with our in vivo observations, transfected keratinocytes expressing Snail exhibited a substantial increase in pMAPK levels relative to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). Coexpression of E-cadherin with Snail appeared to abrogate this effect. Together, these findings raised the possibility that an AJ-associated protein that is normally sequestered at the plasma membrane may participate in a proliferation signaling pathway when AJs are deconstructed.</p><p>Numerous studies have correlated a down-regulation of E-cadherin with a translocation of &#x003b2;-catenin to the nucleus and a transactivation of genes that are regulated by the LEF-1/T cell factor (TCF) family of DNA binding proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b25">25</xref>&#x0005d;. The presence of nuclear cyclin D in hyperproliferative <italic>Snail</italic> Tg epidermis was particularly intriguing since prior studies have reported <italic>cyclin D</italic> gene as a direct target of TCF/&#x003b2;-catenin transcription &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b26">26</xref>&#x0005d;.

In addition to its documented ability to bind &#x003b1;-catenin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b10">10</xref>&#x0005d;, Ajuba can also associate with growth factor receptor-bound protein-2 (Grb-2)/son of sevenless (Sos), the nucleotide exchange factor for Ras, which is upstream from activation of MAPK &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b09">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Given the increase in pMAPK staining in Tg skin, we examined the possibility that Ajuba might have changed its binding partner in Snail-expressing epidermis. Interestingly, Ajuba was readily detected in anti-Grb-2 immunoprecipitates of protein lysates from skins of <italic>Snail</italic> Tg mice but not from the corresponding wild-type (WT) animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g004">Figure 4</xref>E). When these experiments were repeated with <italic>&#x003b1;-catenin</italic>-null epidermis, a similar Grb-2-Ajuba association was detected, and again, this interaction was not detected in the protein extracts from control littermate skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g004">Figure 4</xref>E). Together, these data demonstrate that the reduction in &#x003b1;-catenin levels, either by Snail-mediated down-regulation of <italic>E-cadherin</italic> or by <italic>&#x003b1;-catenin</italic> conditional targeting, allows Ajuba to interact with Grb-2/Sos.</p><p>If the competition between Grb-2/Sos and &#x003b1;-catenin for Ajuba is functionally relevant to the hyperproliferative state of a keratinocyte, then overexpression of Ajuba would be expected to bypass the competition and promote activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway in WT keratinocytes. Indeed, when serum-starved keratinocytes were transiently transfected with an Ajuba expression vector, the levels of pMAPK were not only elevated but also comparable to those transfected with the <italic>K14-HASnail</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g004">Figure 4</xref>F). This activation was abolished when cells were treated with a small peptide inhibitor that specifically interrupts the Grb-2/Sos interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g004">Figure 4</xref>F; see lanes marked &#x0201c;inh&#x0201d;) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b27">27</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Ajuba's pre-LIM domain is the segment that associates with Grb-2's Src-homology 3 domain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b09">9</xref>&#x0005d;. When this domain was overexpressed in serum-starved keratinocytes, a comparable elevation in pMAPK was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g004">Figure 4</xref>F). As expected, the small peptide inhibitor that interrupts the Grb-2/Sos association blocked the effects. These data suggested that by elevating cytosolic Ajuba levels, Ajuba's pre-LIM domain may associate with Grb-2/Sos in a manner that stimulates its nucleotide exchange activity and leads to activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway. Although this pathway provides one mechanism by which Snail expression and proliferation may be coupled in skin epithelium, proliferative circuitries involving AJs are known to be complex and often interwoven. Future studies will be needed to systematically dissect these putative intricacies at a molecular level.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Probing the Regulation of <italic>Snail</italic> Gene Expression Reveals an Essential Link to TGF-&#x003b2;2 Signaling in the Developing Hair Bud</title><p>The temporal spike of <italic>Snail</italic> mRNA expression in the hair bud prompted us to consider what factor(s) may be regulating the <italic>Snail</italic> gene.

Thus, we turned towards addressing whether TGF-&#x003b2;2 might be involved in regulating <italic>Snail</italic> expression in keratinocytes isolated from the basal layer of the epidermis.

Following this treatment, Snail protein was detected within 30 min, peaked at 2 h, and then declined thereafter. The induction of Snail appeared to be specific for the active form of the growth factor, as pretreatment of TGF-&#x003b2;2 for 10 min at 100 &#x000b0;C obliterated the response &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, lanes marked (&#x02013;)&#x0005d;. By contrast, although TGF-&#x003b2; receptor activation remained elevated during the duration of the experiment (as measured by the sustained phosphorylation of the downstream effector SMAD2) <italic>Snail</italic> expression could not be maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Thus, although <italic>Snail</italic> expression correlated with phosphorylated SMAD2 (pSMAD2) induction, its decline seemed to rely on secondary downstream events.</p><p>The rapid kinetics of Snail expression were reflected at the mRNA level, suggesting that <italic>Snail</italic> promoter activity in keratinocytes might be sensitive to TGF-&#x003b2;2 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). To test this possibility, we engineered a transgene driving the &#x003b2;-galactosidase reporter under the control of approximately 2.2 kb of promoter sequence located 5&#x02032; from the transcription initiation site of the mouse <italic>Snail</italic> gene. At 2 d after transient transfection, keratinocytes were treated with TGF-&#x003b2;2 (t = 0) and then assayed for transgene activity over the same time course in which we had observed Snail protein induction. The results of this experiment are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g005">Figure 5</xref>D.</p><p>Within 0.5 h of TGF-&#x003b2;2 treatment, <italic>Snail</italic> promoter activity had increased 3-fold, and by 2 h, it peaked to approximately 10-fold over control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). Thereafter, <italic>Snail</italic> promoter activity rapidly returned to the basal levels seen in unstimulated keratinocytes. The kinetics of <italic>Snail</italic> promoter activity closely paralleled those observed for Snail protein induction. Moreover, the stimulatory effects appeared to be specific to TGF-&#x003b2;2, since they were abrogated either by heat inactivation of the TGF-&#x003b2;2 protein or by mutation of a putative SMAD binding element located about 1.8 kb 5&#x02032; from the <italic>Snail</italic> transcription start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). Taken together, these results suggested that in keratinocytes, TGF-&#x003b2;2 signaling results in a pSMAD2-dependent transient activation of the <italic>Snail</italic> gene, and that maintenance of Snail protein relies, in part, upon sustained promoter activity.</p><p>The brevity of <italic>Snail</italic> gene and protein induction in TGF-&#x003b2;2 treated cultured keratinocytes resembled the temporal appearance of <italic>Snail</italic> mRNA and protein at the initiation of hair follicle morphogenesis in embryonic mouse skin. To test whether TGF-&#x003b2;2 might be required for <italic>Snail</italic> induction in hair bud formation in vivo, we first analyzed whether TGF-&#x003b2;2 was expressed in or around the hair bud. Consistent with previous observations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b33">33</xref>&#x0005d;, an anti-TGF-&#x003b2;2 antibody labeled developing hair buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g006">Figure 6</xref>A).

Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence that TGF-&#x003b2;2 is functionally important for inducing <italic>Snail</italic> gene expression in a pSMAD-dependent manner in developing hair buds.

Thus, although the pathway mediated by TGF-&#x003b2;2 signaling impacts the earliest step of epithelial invagination, it does not appear to be essential for bud morphogenesis. Consistent with this notion, basement membrane remodeling still took place in the <italic>TGF-&#x003b2;2</italic>-null buds, as judged by immunofluorescence with antibodies against &#x003b2;4 integrin, an integral component of keratinocyte-mediated adhesion to its underlying basement membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g006">Figure 6</xref>F). In contrast, TGF-&#x003b2;2 signaling appeared to be an important factor for the early proliferation that occurs in the developing hair buds, as judged by anti-Ki67 and anti-pMAPK immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g006">Figure 6</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g006">6</xref>G).</p><p>If TGF-&#x003b2;2 stimulates <italic>Snail</italic> expression in developing buds, loss of this morphogen would be expected to affect the expression of genes that are typically repressed by Snail.

How E-cadherin is regulated in guard hairs remains to be determined.

This said, based upon pSMAD2 immunohistochemistry, the immediate steps of downstream signaling appeared to be intact.

Moreover, our in vitro studies indicate that even sustained TGF-&#x003b2;2 exposure may cause only a transient induction of Snail, offering a possible explanation as to why Snail is so briefly expressed during hair follicle morphogenesis. An additional point worth mentioning is that prolonged expression of Tg <italic>Snail</italic> in postnatal skin resulted in morphological and biochemical signs of epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (unpublished data), underscoring why transient Snail expression may be so important during normal hair follicle morphogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>At first glance, the sparsity in hair coat of K14-<italic>Snail</italic> Tg mice seemed indicative of a defect in follicle formation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Closer inspection, however, revealed that not all hairs penetrated the hyperthickened Tg epidermis. Several factors may contribute to the seemingly normal follicle development in these mice. One obvious factor is the K14 promoter, which is elevated in the basal layer of the epidermis and the outer root sheath (ORS) of the hair follicle, but is markedly down-regulated in developing embryonic hair buds as well as in the postnatal hair progenitor cells. The K14 promoter is also less active in the ORS than epidermis and hence this might also account for the lack of apparent response of the ORS to ectopic Snail. Additional contributing factors could be the multiplicity of Snail family members and their differential expression, the saturation, and/or diversity of regulatory mechanisms that govern AJ formation, migration, and proliferation in the follicle ORS. Distinguishing between these possibilities must await the generation of mice harboring skin-specific loss-of-function <italic>Snail</italic> mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Links between Signaling, Transcriptional Cascades, Epithelial Remodeling, and Proliferation in the Hair Bud</title><p>Previously, we discovered that early during hair follicle morphogenesis, <italic>E-cadherin</italic> gene expression is down-regulated concomitantly with the invagination of developing bud cells into the skin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Because the timing of this event correlated with the activation of a LEF-1/&#x003b2;-catenin transcription factor complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b20">20</xref>&#x0005d;, we were intrigued by the presence of a putative LEF-1/TCF binding site in the <italic>E-cadherin</italic> promoter. This prompted an investigation that subsequently led to our discovery that LEF-1/&#x003b2;-catenin can contribute to repression of <italic>E-cadherin</italic> gene expression in skin keratinocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04">4</xref>&#x0005d;. In the course of these studies, we also noted that Snail can also contribute to this process in keratinocytes in vitro, and our present studies revealed that Snail is expressed at the right place and time to be physiologically relevant in the process.</p><p>In <italic>noggin</italic>-null embryonic skin, LEF-1 expression and subsequent activation of the LEF-1/&#x003b2;-catenin reporter gene is abrogated in the developing placodes. The corresponding failure of <italic>E-cadherin</italic> down-regulation underscores the importance of Wnt/noggin signaling in regulating this event in follicle morphogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Conditional gene targeting studies will be necessary to establish whether Snail family members also contribute to the down-regulation in <italic>E-cadherin</italic> gene expression that occurs during follicle formation. However, it is intriguing that <italic>K14-Snail</italic> Tg epidermis displayed a marked down-regulation in E-cadherin expression, thereby demonstrating its potential to do so in skin. Our prior findings showed that by elevating E-cadherin levels or by conditionally ablating <italic>&#x003b1;-catenin,</italic> hair follicle morphogenesis can be impaired &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b07">7</xref>&#x0005d;. The marked epidermal hyperproliferation seen in the <italic>K14-Snail</italic> Tg skin, coupled with the converse suppression of proliferation and Snail in <italic>TGF-&#x003b2;2</italic>-null hair buds led us to wonder whether the down-regulation of E-cadherin during follicle morphogenesis might have a direct impact on elevating the proliferative state of these cells.</p><p>Our Tg studies suggested that, at least in part through its regulation of <italic>E-cadherin</italic>, Snail is able to influence the subcellular localization of a variety of AJ-associated proteins. One of these appears to be Ajuba, which was previously shown to have the dual capacity to bind Grb-2 as well as &#x003b1;-catenin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b10">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Our studies revealed that in skin keratinocytes that either harbor a conditional null mutation in <italic>&#x003b1;-catenin</italic> or that overexpress Snail, Ajuba develops an interaction with Grb-2 that is otherwise not observed in WT keratinocytes. The corresponding abilities of either <italic>Snail</italic>-transfected or <italic>Ajuba</italic>-transfected keratinocytes to exhibit elevated activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway suggest that the Grb-2 association of Ajuba under conditions of reduced levels of AJ proteins may be directly relevant to the parallel in hyperproliferation.</p><p>In stable epithelial (i.e., Madin-Darby canine kidney, or MDCK) cell lines, Snail has been shown to block cell cycle progression and promote motility and shape changes for invasion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b47">47</xref>&#x0005d;. While our in vivo studies are consistent with a role for Snail in motility and epithelial remodeling, they differ with respect to Snail's apparent proliferative effects. A priori, this could be simply due to variations in the response of different cell types to Snail expression. Alternatively, these differences may be relevant to the benefit of using mouse models to reveal functions not always recapitulated in stable cell line models. Future studies should highlight the underlying reasons for these opposing results.</p><p>Irrespective of these differences, our in vivo studies do not stand alone, as there are many situations in which a down-regulation in AJ proteins correlate with enhanced proliferation. In fact, a myriad of diverse mechanisms have been implicated in activating epithelial proliferation upon down-regulation of AJ proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b48">48</xref>&#x0005d;. Sifting through these converging pathways is likely to be a difficult and painstaking process. This said, by identifying the status of different players involved in specific cell types and at specific stages in development, our mechanistic understanding of how intercellular remodeling is linked to proliferation in epithelial morphogenesis should begin to surface in the future. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms through which these networks converge is also a prerequisite for understanding how these processes go awry during tumorigenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Primary antibodies used were against: E-cadherin (M.

(C) E13.5 skin with a single layered epidermis (epi) shows no Snail expression. (D) The first morphological sign that cells have adopted a hair follicle fate is a cluster of cells called a placode in E16.5 skin. Snail is not expressed at this stage of development. (E) Snail is expressed in the hair bud of E17.5 skin but not in later stages of development such as the germ or peg.</p><p>(F) Immunofluorescence with anti-Ki67 (green) identifies the proliferating cells of the skin, restricted to the basal layer of the epidermis and developing hair follicles. Anti-&#x003b2;4 int labeling reveals the presence of the hemidesmosomal integrin &#x003b2;4, restricted to the base of cells adhering to the underlying basement membrane.

Insets denote magnified tail segments, which displayed a mosaic, flaky appearance in Tg mice. Size differences appeared with age, and are likely due to K14-promoter activity in the tongue and oral epithelium, resulting in progressive defects and reduced food intake.

Anti-keratin 5 indicates K5, normally restricted to the basal layer of the epidermis; anti-keratin 6 detects keratin 6, expressed in postnatal epidermis under conditions such as wounding, in which hyperproliferation occurs. All other antibodies are as in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002">Figure 2</xref>. Comparison of D and E provide representative examples that illustrate that pMAPK is found in only a subset of all proliferating (Ki67-positive) cells.

Shown are affected areas of Tg skin; in areas where Snail protein was not expressed, stainings were normal. Sections were labeled with antibodies as indicated and color-coded on each frame. Antibodies are against markers of normal epidermal differentiation, and include K5 (a basally expressed keratin), K1 (a suprabasal keratin, expressed in spinous layer cells), involucrin (Inv; a suprabasally expressed cornified envelope protein found in upper spinous and granular layer cells), loricrin (Lor; a cornified envelope protein expressed in the granular layer), and filaggrin (Fil; a protein that bundles keratin filaments in the granular layer and stratum corneum).

Note that with age, affected areas of the Tg epidermis became increasingly undulating, often exhibiting papilloma-like invaginations (J). Insets in I and J are magnified views of the boxed areas, illustrating the absence (Wt) or presence (Tg) of nuclear anti-cyclin D staining. With age, affected areas of the Tg epidermis also displayed perturbations within the basement membrane, as judged by antibody labeling against either basement membrane (K and L) or hemidesmosomal (M and N) components. Double arrows in L demarcate mosaic zones, revealing that perturbations were restricted to hyperthickened, i.e., Snail-positive zones (to left of double arrows).

Shown are affected areas of Tg skin; in areas where Snail protein was not expressed, stainings were normal. Antibodies used are against AJ proteins and include E-cadherin (E-cad), the transmembrane core protein; &#x003b2;-catenin (&#x003b2;-cat), which binds E-cadherin at AJs and which can also participate as a transcription cofactor when associated with LEF-1/TCF proteins in the nucleus; &#x003b1;-catenin (&#x003b1;-cat) which binds to both &#x003b2;-catenin and Ajuba, a close relative of zyxin; and Ajuba, which can associate with proteins that bind to the actin cytoskeleton, as well as with Grb-2, a mediator of the GTP nucleotide-exchange protein Sos, involved in activation of the Ras-MAPK signaling cascade. In Snail-expressing Tg regions, there was a reduced staining with anti-E-cad and anti-&#x003b1;-cat and a more diffuse staining with anti-Ajuba.

Antibodies are as in (A) except anti-P-cad, which detects P-cadherin, whose expression in the hair follicle was not affected, and anti-tubulin, which detects tubulin, a control for equal protein loadings. Note that the reductions seen in E-cadherin and &#x003b1;-catenin are likely to be underestimates of the actual differences in affected regions, since the Tg skin expressed Snail mosaically.</p><p>(C) In the presence of elevated Snail, &#x003b1;-catenin levels can be restored by overexpression of E-cadherin. Keratinocytes were transfected with either HA-tagged Snail (Snail&#x0005b;HA&#x0005d;; images on the left) or Snail(HA) and Ecad(HA) (images on the right). 2 d after transfection, cells were switched from low-calcium growth medium to high-calcium medium for 6 h to induce AJ formation.

Primary newborn mouse keratinocytes were transfected with either the empty K14 expression vector (K14), or the expression vector driving Snail, full length Ajuba, or the pre-LIM domain of Ajuba in the absence or presence of a peptide inhibitor (inh) that disrupts the interaction between Grb-2 and Sos. 48 h posttransfection, protein extracts were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses with antibodies against pMAPK, total MAPK, Ajuba (also recognizing the smaller, pre-LIM domain), and Snail.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0030011.g004"/></fig><fig id="pbio-0030011-g005" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>TGF-&#x003b2;2, but Not Wnt/noggin, Transiently Induces Snail Expression In Vitro</title><p>(A) Failure of Wnt and noggin signaling to induce Snail in cultured keratinocytes.
