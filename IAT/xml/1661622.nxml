Published data about the relationship between <italic>TLR4</italic> mutations and atopy/asthma are not consistent. This study was performed to detect two commonly reported Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms in <italic>TLR4</italic> gene in Singaporean Chinese and their possible association with atopy-related phenotypes. A total of 117 unrelated Singapore residents were randomly selected for this study. Among them, atopy was evident in 66 subjects while 61 had allergic rhinitis. Twenty-one patients had concomitant asthma and 17 were atopic. In all subjects, neither the Asp299Gly nor Thr399Ile polymorphism was found by DNA sequencing. This discrepant result could be due to the ethnic variation of allelic distribution in <italic>TLR4</italic> gene. Although it is still debatable whether there is any role of <italic>TLR4</italic> polymorphisms on atopy-related phenotypes, one needs to develop an appropriate model to investigate the interactions between genetic variations and environmental factors that contribute to the complex traits in allergic diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>TLR4</italic> polymorphisms</kwd><kwd>Singaporean Chinese</kwd><kwd>atopy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is one of the principal receptors for bacterial endotoxin recognition and an important intracellular signal pathway of the innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Aderem et al 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Lien et al 2000</xref>). Recently, there is evidence that endotoxin exposure during early life is protective against the development of atopy and asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Strachn 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Liu 2002</xref>). <italic>TLR4</italic> is therefore reasonably suspected as a candidate gene for studying interaction between genetic variation and environmental factors for the development of atopic diseases.</p><p>Human <italic>TLR4</italic> gene is located at chromosome 9q32-33 and comprises three exons spanning about 10 kb (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/>; AF177765). Twelve rare amino acid variants of <italic>TLR4</italic> were reported in 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Smirnova et al 2001</xref>). Raby and colleagues have identified an additional 29 polymorphisms of this gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Raby et al 2002</xref>). However, most association studies have concentrated on two positions: an A to G polymorphism at nucleotide 896 from the start codon of the human <italic>TLR4</italic> gene resulting in an aspartic acid to glycine substitution at position 299 of the amino acid sequence (Asp299Gly); and a C to T polymorphism at nucleotide position 1196 resulting in a threonine to isoleucine substitution at position 399 of the amino acid sequence (Thr399Ile). Many studies have reported an association between polymorphisms at <italic>TLR4</italic> Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile with clinical diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Lorenz et al 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Michel et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Werner et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Yang et al 2004</xref>). In 2000, Arbour and colleagues first reported that <italic>TLR4</italic> mutation were associated with endotoxin hyporesponsiveness in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Arbour et al 2000</xref>). Using an in vitro cultured cell approach, the same group reported that Asp299Gly mutation interrupted TLR4-mediated lipopolysaccaride (LPS) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Schwartz 2001b</xref>). The study provides genetic evidence that human <italic>TLR4</italic> Asp299Gly mutation could be associated with differences in LPS responsiveness and, consequently, could alter the ability of the host to respond to environmental stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Schwartz 2001b</xref>).</p><p>Recently, polymorphisms of <italic>TLR4</italic> were reported to be associated with the severity of atopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Yang et al 2004</xref>) and with a modified response to endotoxin in asthmatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Werner et al 2003</xref>). However, some studies were unable to confirm these two common polymorphisms on human <italic>TLR4</italic> gene or its associated atopy-related phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Raby et al 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Noguchi et al 2004</xref>). This study is therefore designed to screen the existence of these two common <italic>TLR4</italic> poly-morphisms (Asp299 Gly and Thr399Ile) and the association with atopy-related phenotypes in a Singaporean Chinese population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>A total of 117 unrelated Singapore Chinese residents, aged from 9 to 72 years with a mean age of 31.7 &#x000b1; 11.7 years, were investigated. Among them, atopy was evident in 66 subjects, and 51 were non-atopic. In atopic subjects, 61 experienced allergic rhinitis. Twenty-one patients had concomitant asthma and 17 of them were atopic. They were randomly called during a national rhinitis survey study to attend a rhinologic examination in the ENT outpatient clinic of the National University Hospital of Singapore. All subjects were carefully interviewed by an attending physician for their medical and family history, and a thorough inspection of the nose was performed. Peripheral blood samples were taken for allergy screening tests and for DNA extraction. All study subjects gave their informed consent prior to the study. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National University of Singapore and funded by the Academic Research Fund from the same university.</p><p>Diagnosis of atopy and its related diseases were made according to the following criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bousquet et al 2001</xref>):</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Atopy: a positive serum specific IgE (equal or more than 0.35 U/mL) to at least one of the inhalant allergens (house dust mites) tested.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Rhinitis: the occurrence of two or more symptoms (nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itchy nose) on most days during the past year.

The polymorphism of <italic>TLR4</italic> was identified by sequence analysis in 117 subjects. PCR was carried out in a volume of 25 &#x003bc;L containing 30 ng genomic DNA, 10 &#x000d7; buffer, 0.2 mmol/L dNTPs, and 1 unit Taq polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).

PCR were optimized using denaturing for 2 min at 94 &#x000b0;C. The PCR cycle was set at 94 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, 54 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, and 72 &#x000b0;C for 40 s totally for 35 cycles, followed by 72 &#x000b0;C for 5 min. The sizes of the generated PCR products were 496 bp. Before sequencing, the PCR products were purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Sequencing reactions were performed using the BIG Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The sequenced products were purified by ethanol precipitation, following which the DNA pellet was dissolved in 4 &#x003bc;L of loading dye (Deionized formamide, PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and analyzed on an Applied Biosystems Genetic Analyser 3100 (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in the Department of Pediatrics, National University of Singapore.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>In all 117 subjects, we were unable to identify polymorphisms either at <italic>TLR4</italic> Asp299Gly or Thr399Ile.

This study indicated that all sequenced samples had Asp at amino acid 299 and Thr at amino acid 399 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

considerable attention as a potential risk factor for the development of asthma and atopic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Schwartz 2001a</xref>). As a receptor for LPS, <italic>TLR4</italic> is one of the most commonly investigated candidate genes for studying interaction between genetic variation and environmental factors for the development of atopic or atopy-related diseases. Although associations between polymorphisms of Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile at <italic>TLR4</italic> gene and atopic diseases have been reported by some studies, they may not be the key players in the development of atopic phenotypes. Otherwise, one could expect to confirm these polymorphisms in a different population since allergic disease is a common disease worldwide.</p><p><italic>TLR4</italic> is a candidate gene for atopic diseases because of its important biologic characteristics. It is possible that polymorphisms at other positions of <italic>TLR4</italic> might play an important role in atopy-related phenotypes and that is in combination with the environmental exposure of bacterial endotoxin. Alternatively, it is also possible that genetic susceptibility to asthma and atopic-related phenotypes might be different in various populations. This notion was supported by the recent genome-wide studies for identifying the asthma susceptibility loci in ethnically diverse populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Xu et al 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Hakonarson et al 2002</xref>). In view of the conflicting evidence, future studies are needed to identify the key genes for atopic phenotypes and to investigate the interactions between genetic and environmental factors influencing the complex trait of allergic diseases.</p><p>In summary, we were unable to detect the polymorphisms at Asp299Gly or Thr399Ile of <italic>TLR4</italic> in Singaporean Chinese. Our results suggest that these two polymorphisms in <italic>TLR4</italic> could not be the key player in Singaporean Chinese with atopy or atopic-related
