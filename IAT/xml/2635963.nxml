In adipose tissue, adipocytes account for two-thirds of the total cell number. The remaining cells include blood and endothelial cells, along with adipocyte precursors (adipose MPs). Obesity is defined as an excess of body fat that frequently results in a significant impairment of health. The ob/ob mice bear a mutation in the ob gene that causes a deficiency in the hormone leptin and hence obesity. Here, we present evidence that ob/ob mice have a dramatic decrease in the resident MP pool of several tissues, including squeletal muscle, heart, lung and adipose tissue. Moreover, we show that that there is a migration of MP cells from distant organs, as well as homing of these cells to the adipose tissue mass of the ob/ob mice. We call this process adipotaxis. Once in the adipose tissue, migrant MPs undergoe adipose differentiation, giving rise to new differentiated adipocytes within the adipose mass. Finally, we provide evidence that adipotaxis is largely explained by the production of high levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) within the ob/ob adipose tissue. The therapeutic implications for human obesity as well as for regenerative medicine are further discussed in this paper.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent advances have implicated the adipocyte in many physiologic and pathologic processes, such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and muscular disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004444-Desprs1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Adipose tissue is also a major secretory and endocrine active organ producing a variety of bioactive proteins that may regulate energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity as well as the behaviour of the different surrounded cell types. Multipotent stem cells possess a great capacity for differentiation into the different tissues as well as tissue regeneration, but the limiting step is always that suficient numbers of reconstituting cells reach the damaged area. The success of regenerative medicine will depend on identify the mechanisms or molecules implicated in the attraction and localization of these precursors. Also the control of obesity and diabetes has proven to be difficult as long as the exact mechanism for generation and maintenance of the disease remains unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>In order to assess the MP status in obesity, wild type C57 (wt) or ob/ob mice (leptin ko) explants (from muscle, heart, lung and adipose mass), containing organ specific MPs were taken after surgery.

Wt and ob/ob mice derived MPs were cultured in the presence of DMEM&#x0002b;10&#x00025; FBS. As shown, MPs isolated from wt mice have a slightly faster growing rate (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004444.s001">Figure S1</xref>). These cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and were Sca-1&#x0002b;, CD31&#x0002b;, CD34&#x0002b; CD44&#x0002b;, CD45&#x02212; and had a multipontential differentiation profile (data not shown) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004444-Wagner1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We then explored the likelihood that the absence of MPs in ob/ob mice could be explained by the general migration of mesenchymal stem cells from distant organs (muscle, lungs, etc.) to the adipose tissue, followed by their differentiation into mature adipocytes. This alone would explain the absence of MPs in organ tissues, including the adipose tissue. In addition, it would imply that MPs in the adipose tissue will irreversibly lose their pluripotential phenotype after undergoing adipose differentiation. To investigate this hypothesis, we injected MPs from wt males into the tail vein of wt or ob/ob females. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004444-g002">Figure 2a</xref>, in the control mice, a variable number of injected cells could be detected in different tissues after 6 h. However, in ob/ob mice, injected MPs were almost exclusively concentrated in the adipose abdominal mass (see arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004444-g002">Figure 2a and Figure 2b</xref>). Cells were also injected intra-muscularly (im). 6 hours after im injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004444-g002">Figure 2a, left panel</xref>), most of the cells remained within the muscle area in both groups of mice but, again, after such short period, we could already visualize some MPs only into the adipose mass of ob/ob mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004444-g002">Figure 2c</xref>). This MPs recruitment in the adipose mass did not take place in wt mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004444.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We then did a follow-up analysis of those mice two months after the injections. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004444-g002">figure 2a (right panel)</xref>, no male cells were detected in the adipose mass of C57 female mice. In the female ob/ob mice, however, male cells were still abundantly present in the adipose mass two months after both intra-venous (iv) and im injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004444-g002">Figure 2a and 2b</xref>). Images of muscles and adipose tissue from injected control mice are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004444.s002">Figure S2</xref>. Moreover, these cells, independently of the tissue of origin (fat, muscle or lung) had undergone differentiation into mature adipocytes (positive for laminin, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004444-g002">Figure 2b</xref>), thus contributing to the total adipose mass. As an additional measure of adipocyte differentiation, we assessed the expression levels of the differentiation gene marker PPAR-gamma. In agreement with the histochemistry results, positive male cells expressed the PPAR-gamma gene 15 days after the injection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004444.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004444-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004444.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Migration and engraftment of MPs into adipose tissue.</title><p>A.

In this assay, we transplanted adipose mass from female ob/ob mice into male SCID mice. Three weeks after transplantation, mice were sacrificed and tissues collected. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004444.s005">Figure S5</xref>, male cells (Y-chrom) migrate specifically into the transplanted adipose mass and could be detected by immunofluorescence. Moreover, migrated male cells were positive for red oil staining, indicating a partial or total differentiation into adipocytes (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004444.s005">Figure S5</xref>). We, therefore, conclude that MPs have the ability to migrate towards the adipose mass independently of their localization.</p><p>In order to understand the migration mechanism of these cells, we studied their properties <italic>in vitro</italic>. In a transwell assay, MPs were attracted by the media conditioned by adipocyte or macrophage cultures.

Further evidence for the role of, at least, TNF-&#x003b1; was found by blocking its activity with inhibitory antibodies. Indeed, anti- TNF-&#x003b1; antibodies strongly reduced the number of MPs that migrated across the filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004444-g003">Figure 3a and 3b</xref>). These findings were confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic>, as MPs do not migrate to the adipose abdominal area after systemically inhibiting TNF activity with anti-TNF-&#x003b1; antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004444-g003">Figure 3c and 3d</xref>).

Our results show that in the ob/ob background, however, systemically injected multi-organ derived MP preferentially migrate to the adipose tissue. We hypothesize that the obese adipose tissue (at least in ob/ob mice) could behave as a surrogate injured tissue. In fact, inflammation is a hallmark of acute and chronic tissue injury, and inflammatory changes in adipose tissue are also notorious in the context of obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004444-Kathryn1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

This report also raise several, as yet, unanswered questions regarding the extent to which adipotaxis (and therefore MP systemic depletion) is present in other animal models of obesity (including human obesity) as well as whether it explains by itself our observation of the absence of resident MPs in several solid tissues of ob/ob mice. We have already made the observation that isolation of MPs from acute obese human patients is less effective than from control patients (data not shown).</p><p>In recent years, MPs have been increasingly given a role in tissue repair and regeneration. In different models of tissue damage, MPs improve the recovery of injured tissues, at least, through two proven mechanisms: by releasing soluble factors with anti-inflammatory activity and by promoting and potentiating local regenerative processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004444-Gupta1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. It is thus possible that, by sequestering MPs in the adipose tissue, obese patients could have tissue or organ repair impediments and that treatment with anti-adipotaxis agents (like anti-TNF antibodies) could prove a valuable therapeutic approach to improve repair mechanisms in organs like muscle, lung, skin, kidney, etc. Indeed, obese patients (specially those with diabetes) have impaired wound healing regardless of the degree of glucose control and insulin therapy. Moreover, in ob/ob mice, systemic anti-TNFalpha treatment restores impaired skin repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004444-Goren1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether our findings represent a general phenomenon of impairment of tissue repair associated with obesity remain to be proven in different situations involving tissue damage and regeneration in obese patients (ictus, myocardial infarction, chronic ulcers, etc.). In summary, we believe that the findings in this report could be of paramount importance in the search for new treatments for human obesity and its associated ailings, as well as to deal with tissue damage and repair in obese patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 and ob/ob mice were obtained from Charles and River, Co and maintained and used in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Cell isolation and growing conditions</title><p>Three isolation methods were used.
