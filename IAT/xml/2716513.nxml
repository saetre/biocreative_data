VWF is a large glycoprotein secreted by vascular endothelial cells as multimers. At a region of vascular injury, the multimeric form of VWF initiates the clotting process by adhering to platelets. A reduction or elimination of the protease activity of ADAMTS13 results in the VWF multimers remaining uncleaved in the circulating blood stream, which ultimately leads to intravascular thrombosis and an associated disorder known as Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006506-Furlan1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006506-Furlan2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

The ADAMTS family of proteins are secreted metalloproteases characterized by multiple domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006506-Porter1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The domain structure of ADAMTS13 contains a signal peptide, propeptide, a metalloprotease, disintegrin, a thrombospondin type 1 domain (TSP1), a cystein rich domain, a spacer domain, seven TSP1 repeats and two C-terminal CUB (C1r/C1s, Urinary EGFand Bone morphogenetic protein) domains. Although all ADAMTS proteins have characteristic multi domains, the ADAMTS13 is unique in having two additional C-Terminal CUB domains and an unusually short propeptide. Moreover, unlike other ADAMTS members, ADAMTS13 is catalytically active prior to secretion from the cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006506-Majerus1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

It is thus evident that the ADAMTS13-VWF interaction is complex; several domains of the protein are involved in the regulation of VWF cleavage.</p><p>Antibodies sensitive to the conformation of a protein have been successfully used to understand the structural organization of proteins, distinguish their functional and non-functional forms, elucidate molecular mechanisms, and establish the role of different domains of multidomain proteins.

Antibodies sensitive to different conformations could thus be potentially useful to understand the regulation and mechanism of ADAMTS13-mediated catalysis. In this report, we studied and defined new conformation-sensitive antibodies to ADAMTS13. We examined the monoclonal antibodies Wh2-11-1 and Wh2-22-1A, which are specific to the TSP1-4 and Disintegrin domains, respectively, and the polyclonal antibody BL154G that is specific to the metalloprotease domain of ADAMTS13, for their sensitivity to conformation. Here we show their ability to detect conformation changes in the ADAMTS13 protein under various conditions in which the protein normally undergoes changes in conformation such as changes due to temperature, and in the presence of its substrate. We use flow cytometry to measure the affinities and reactivity of these antibodies. We demonstrate that both the reactivity and the apparent affinity (concentration required for half-maximal binding) of these antibodies is altered by the addition of substrate (VWF). This change is observed mainly at 37&#x000b0;C but not at 4&#x000b0;C and occurs in the wild-type protein but not in a catalytically inactive mutant. These results indicate that the ADAMTS13 antibodies are conformation-sensitive.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Using antibodies against ADAMTS13 in flow cytometric assays</title><p>Monitoring the antigen-antibody interaction of a protein in an intact cell using flow cytometry has the significant advantage that the antibody can explore the tertiary structure of a functional protein in its native environment. In addition, it is plausible that some antibodies bind to epitopes which are sensitive to the conformation of the protein which may have functional or diagnostic importance. Soejima and coworkers have characterized antibodies that recognize several distinct domains of ADAMTS13; nonetheless the antibodies were raised by inoculating mice with the intact protein and not peptide fragments (Soejima, personal communication). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006506-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> we demonstrate that the antibodies Wh2-22-1A (that recognizes the disintegrin-like domain) and Wh-2-11-1 (that recognizes the thrombospondin type 1&#x02013;4 domains) bind to intracellular ADAMTS13. Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were transiently transfected with ADAMTS13 plasmid DNA as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and methods</xref> and expression of ADAMTS13 in this system has previously been shown to be equivalent to that in human stellate liver cells, which are known to express ADAMTS13 at high levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006506-Uemura1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. The cells were permeabilized and incubated with the anti ADAMTS13 antibodies and washed to remove excess antibody that did not react with the antigen. The cells were then incubated with a secondary antibody tagged with Alexa Flour 488 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and methods</xref> for details). The control cells were incubated with the isotype IgG2a antibody followed by incubation with the secondary antibody. The fluorescence associated with the Alexa Flour 488 was measured in a flow cytometer and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006506-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> shows the distribution of fluorescence intensity in a population of 10,000 cells following the different treatments. Cells treated with the IgG2a control antibody show low levels of fluorescence that establishes the baseline for nonspecific interactions and interactions with the secondary antibody alone. However, when the cells were treated with Wh2-11-1 or Wh2-22-1A antibodies prior to addition of the secondary antibody there is a dramatic increase in the fluorescence from a median fluorescence value of 23.5 to 165.48 or 67.32. It is thus clear that these antibodies which have previously been shown to recognize ADAMTS13 in an immunoblot assay also bind to intracellular recombinant ADAMTS13 and flow cytometry can be used to characterize this interaction (Geetha S <italic>et al</italic> unpublished results).</p><fig id="pone-0006506-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006506.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Flow cytometry based assay to detect intracellular ADAMTS13.</title><p>(A) HEK293 cells transiently transfected with ADAMTS13 plasmid DNA were permeabilized and incubated with the anti ADAMTS13 antibodies Wh2-22-1A or Wh2-11-1 and an isotypic control antibody Anti-mouse IgG2a.

The fluorescence associated with the Alexa Flour 488 was measured in a flow cytometer and histograms showing the distribution of fluorescence intensity in a population of 10,000 cells following the different treatments are depicted.

These experiments demonstrate that by permeabilizing cells it is possible for anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies to access the interior of cells as well as bind to the intracellular ADAMTS13. Thus this technique can potentially be used to study the dose-dependent saturating binding of the ADAMTS13-specific monoclonal antibodies. We therefore used the flow cytometry-based assay to estimate the concentration required for half-maximal binding of the monoclonal antibodies Wh2-11-1 and Wh2-22-1A to ADAMTS13 which is a measure of the apparent affinity of the antibody for the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006506-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Our results show that although both antibodies bind specifically to ADAMTS13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006506-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) the concentration of antibodies required for half-maximal binding as well as the V<sub>max</sub> are very different. This is not surprising as these antibodies recognize different epitopes on ADAMTS13. Moreover, the importance of estimating the reactivity of antibodies that may be sensitive to the conformation of the protein is that such antibodies would bind with increased or decreased efficiency when the conformation of the epitope is altered.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>The mAb Wh2-11-1 shows increased reactivity to ADAMTS13 in the presence of substrate (VWF)</title><p>Enzymes undergo conformational changes during the catalytic process and conformation sensitive antibodies offer a means of monitoring these changes. The substrate for ADAMTS13 is a large, multimeric glycoprotein VWF (the monomeric unit is 260 kDa, and the multimer is greater than 10,000 kDa) and it would be useful to establish whether the binding of VWF affects the kinetic parameters (apparent K<sub>d</sub> or V<sub>max</sub>) associated with the binding of the monoclonal antibodies to intracellular ADAMTS13. Such a measurement assumes that there is no interaction between the anti-ADAMTS13 antibody and VWF. As this is an important control we tested antibodies raised against ADAMTS13 as well as against VWF in an ELISA assay using VWF bound to collagen coated wells. Our results show that none of the anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies tested interacts with the VWF; on the other hand three different anti-VWF antibodies (which provide a positive control) show a strong signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006506-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Secondly the fact that VWF is a large multimeric protein raises the concern that VWF may not enter cells, even those that have been permeabilized. We used a flow cytometric assay similar to that described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006506-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> to monitor VWF which is added to permeabilized cells and incubated for 10 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006506-g002">Fig. 2B</xref> shows that HEK293 cells transiently transfected with VWF show a higher fluorescence signal (associated with the binding of the anti-VWF monoclonal antibody AXL205) than the untransfected cells. However addition of extrinsic VWF to the untransfected control cells results in the intracellular accumulation of VWF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006506-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) as evidenced by the fact that the fluorescence signal following incubation with the anti-VWF antibody is at a level comparable to that observed in cells transfected with VWF. However, when the same experiment was performed with unpermeabilized cells, the histograms with the secondary antibody alone and the anti-VWF monoclonal antibody AXL205 could not be distinguished (Data not given), suggesting that we are detecting VWF that has entered the cell and not merely adsorbed on the cell surface. Taken together, these results clearly show: (i) Permeabliziation of cells permit the entry of large molecules such as antibodies and VWF. (ii) Anti-ADAMTS13 and anti-VWF antibodies can be used (in conjugation with the appropriate fluorescence tagged secondary antibody) to detect intracellular levels of the two proteins. (iii) Flow cyotmetry offers a means of quantifying intracellular levels of ADAMTS13 and VWF. Our experimental system can, therefore, be used to study the effect of VWF binding to ADAMTS13 as estimated by changes in the dose-dependent binding of conformation sensitive antibodies to ADAMTS13.</p><fig id="pone-0006506-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006506.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Identification of intracellular VWF.</title><p>(A) ELISA assay showing reactivity of different antibodies to VWF.

Incubation of VWF with ADAMTS13 at 37&#x000b0;C, resulted in a &#x0003e;10-fold increase in the reactivity of Wh2-11-1 (P&#x0003c;0.001). Moreover, this increase in reactivity is accompanied by a &#x0223c;5.5-fold decrease in the apparent affinity of the mAb for ADAMTS13 (concentration required for half-maximal binding increases from 9.7 &#x000b5;g/ml to 50.6 &#x000b5;g/ml; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006506-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). These results indicate that binding of VWF alters the conformation of the ADAMTS13 epitope resulting in a decreased apparent affinity of the mAb Wh2-11-1. The presence of the substrate may be expected to protect some binding sites on ADAMTS13 and if this were the case, one may expect a decrease in the reactivity of the mAb. However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006506-g003">Fig. 3B</xref> shows that the increased reactivity of the mAb Wh2-11-1 in the presence of VWF is concentration dependent and saturable. The fact that there is a large increase in the reactivity of the antibody strongly indicates that the mAb is sensitive to conformational changes in ADAMTS13. Furthermore, we have shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006506-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) that all three tested ADAMTS13 antibodies do not bind to VWF and therefore the increase in binding in the presence of VWF results only from specific binding to ADAMTS13. We also demonstrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006506-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>) that while the mAb Wh-2-11-1 shows an increase in reactivity on the binding of substrate (VWF) in cells transfected with rADAMTS13, an antibody to the V5 tag on rADAMTS13 (which is not sensitive to the conformation of the epitope) shows negligible change.</p><fig id="pone-0006506-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006506.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>VWF increases the immunoreactivity of anti-ADAMTS13 antibody Wh2-11-1.</title><p>(A) Serial dilutions of the mAb Wh2-11-1 were allowed to bind to ADAMTS13 from human embryonic cells (HEK293 cells) in the absence (&#x025aa;) or presence (&#x02022;) of 100-500 &#x000b5;l from VWF stock.

They estimated the activity based on the accumulation of monomers and rate of reduction in multimeric level as identified by sodium dodecyl sulphate-agarose gel electrophoresis. Using the more quantitative FRET based assay for ADAMTS13 activity described in the previous section we confirmed these results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006506-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>). Our results show a clear decrease in the rate of FRET-VWF73 cleavage in mutant enzyme compared to the wild type. Even more significant is our observation that the change in conformation of ADAMTS13 on binding of VWF reported by the antibody BL154G does not occur in the mutant protein. We show that incubation of wild-type ADAMTS13 with VWF followed by addition of the antibody BL154G results in an increase in the median fluorescence in a flow cytometry assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006506-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>, bars II &#x00026; II).

Similar results were obtained with the mAb Wh-2-11-1, where the fluorescence intensity increased 3.5 fold for the wild-type ADANTS13, but only 1.9 fold for the mutant (data not given). Considering that the wild-type and mutant express at equivalent levels (see above) and that the wild-type and mutant proteases show different reactivity to the antibodies suggests different conformations for these forms. Also, while addition of VWF to wild-type ADAMTS13 results in increased reactivity of both the mAb and the pAb, a similar increase in the reactivity of the mAb and the polyclonal Ab is not observed in the mutant ADAMTS13.

We found that several of these are sensitive to changes in the conformation of ADAMTS13. Here we characterize in detail three antibodies (the monoclonal antibodies Wh2-11-1 and Wh2-22-1A as well as the polyclonal antibody BL154G). We have used flow cytometry to study the interactions between the antibody and ADAMTS13 so that the native conformation of the ADAMTS13 protein could be preserved. The apparent affinities of all three antibodies were altered in the presence of the substrate (VWF). These antibodies also showed different reactivity to ADAMTS13 in the presence of VWF, but only at 37&#x000b0;C and not at 4&#x000b0;C. Furthermore if the antibodies were added to the ADAMTS13 prior to the addition of VWF there was no change in the reactivity. Addition of VWF to intracellular ADAMTS13 required the permeabilization of cells, however the procedure had no effect on ADAMTS13 activity. These results suggested that these antibodies (and particularly Wh2-11-1) may be useful as conformation-sensitive antibodies to understand the mechanism of ADAMTS13.</p><p>Earlier work has shown that Wh2-11-1 recognizes an epitope that corresponds to the TSP1-4 motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006506-Soejima2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> which do not directly interact with the substrate (VWF), but was shown under shear stress to take part in the recognition of the substrate. Consistent with this view is our observation that VWF does not inhibit binding of Wh2-11-1 to ADAMTS13. In this study we show concentration-dependent reactivity of Wh2-11-1 to ADAMTS13 and demonstrate that the addition of VWF results in a dramatic increase in reactivity and a smaller decrease in the apparent affinity of the antibody for ADAMTS13. As there is an approximately 8-fold increase in the immunoreactivity, it is unlikely that the change in reactivity is a consequence of competition between VWF and Wh2-11-1. We also show in this study that the VWF-induced increase in the reactivity of the antibody occurs at 37&#x000b0;C but not at 4&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006506-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Also significant is the fact that pre-treatment of ADAMTS13 with Wh2-11-1 prior to addition of VWF does not result in an increase in the immunoreactivity. Taken together, these results suggest that although the TSP1-4 domains may not interact directly with the VWF, the consequence of VWF binding is a conformation change (possibly transient) that results in a greater exposure of the Wh2-11-1 epitope, which might mimic shear stress conditions. In addition, the fact that Wh2-11-1 binds to its epitope with different affinities in the presence and absence of VWF suggests that the conformation of this epitope is altered, which might occur in these circumstances. This hypothesis is moreover supported by the fact that the conformational change is energetically driven (i.e. does not occur at 4&#x000b0;C). These results suggest that Wh2-11-1 preferentially binds to a transient conformation during the enzymatic hydrolysis of VWF.</p><p>Conformational transitions almost always accompany enzymatic activity, protein-protein interactions or transport mediated by membrane proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006506-Fersht1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. The ability to track these transitions experimentally has often proved useful in understanding molecular mechanisms.

Secondly, it is extremely difficult to localize probes in the functional domain of the protein. Here again, a common experimental technique involves the replacement of native cysteines in the protein of interest and introduction of cysteines at desired positions followed by chemical cross-linking using thiol-reactive probes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006506-Lakowicz1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006506-Hubbell1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Such an approach involves the use of mutants as well as chemical cross-linking. A relatively non-invasive means of following functional transitions, on the other hand, is the use of conformation-sensitive antibodies. There are several examples in the literature of the usefulness of this approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006506-Pfund1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006506-Mechetner1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006506-Leonard1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Extensive characterization of the ADAMTS13 antibody Wh2-11-1 demonstrates that the immunoreactivity of this antibody is sensitive to the conformation of ADAMTS13. Our results also show that the reactivity of this antibody is sensitive to the binding of VWF (which is the substrate of ADAMTS13 for proteolytic degradation). Thus we demonstrate that the interaction of VWF with ADAMTS13 brings about changes in conformation at the TSP1-4 domains (where no direct interactions have been shown to occur). This view is supported by emerging concepts about the role of the ADAMTS13 domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006506-Zhang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006506-Shida1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. We also show that a conformation-sensitive antibody can distinguish between the wild-type ADAMTS13 and the mutant P475S. This mutant has been shown previously to have reduced enzymatic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006506-Kokame2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> and we have confirmed in this study that the mutant has decreased hydrolytic activity for FRET-VWF73 (a fluorogenic substrate of ADAMTS13). Finally, the large (&#x0223c;8-fold) increase in the reactivity of Wh2-11-1 in the presence of VWF is not observed in the mutant ADAMTS13. This observation suggests that the conformational change reported by Wh2-11-1 is not an artifact but represents a reaction intermediate during the ADAMTS13-mediated proteolysis of VWF. A significant underlying assumption of these proposals is that the intracellular and secreted ADAMTS13 (which is physiologically relevant) both exhibit proteolytic activities. A previous study concluded that this was indeed so <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006506-Majerus1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, we confirm this observation in our system in the current study using a more quantitative assay than was used previously. We suggest that the reactivity of the antibodies Wh2-11-1, BL154G and Wh2-22-1A (particularly Wh2-11-1) can be used as a sensitive assay to distinguish functional and non-functional ADAMTS13 as well as to analyze conformational transitions associated with function.

Other cells were incubated with the substrate (the same concentrations) before incubation with the primary antibody, and the rest of the cells were incubated with VWF without a primary antibody and only received a secondary antibody, thus serving as controls for non-specific binding in the absence or presence of VWF. In addition, we employed isotopic antibody control (Anti-mouse IgG2a, Invitrogen) to ensure the specificity of the ADAMTS13 antibodies. The concentrations of the primary and secondary antibodies were kept constant through all the treatments. Several dilutions from stock of 1 mg/ml of the monoclonal Wh2-11-1, monoclonal Wh2-22-1A and polyclonal BL154G (Bethyl) antibodies or 1&#x02236;100 dilution from 1 mg/ml anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) were added to cells and cells were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes. In some cases, cells were pre-incubated with VWF substrate for 10 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C. Alexa-488 Goat anti-Mouse IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen) at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes was used for anti-V5, Wh2-11-1 and Wh2-22-1A antibodies while Rabbit anti-Goat IgG (Bethyl) was used for the primary ADAMTS13 antibody BL154G. Certain amounts of VWF were added again to each tube following the addition of the respective specific secondary antibodies. Between adding the primary antibody and the secondary and after adding the secondary antibody, cells were washed with PBS (Invitrogen) 0.1&#x00025; bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) for 5 minutes and the supernatant was aspirated. The cells were then analyzed using the Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur. Median values were calculated using the &#x0201c;stat&#x0201d; program of CellQuest by Becton Dickinson and were then plotted in Excel. We have recently reported the development and validation of the assay to detect intracellular ADAMTS13 by flow cytometry as well as the detailed protocols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006506-Geetha1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Preparation of cell lysate and concentrated medium</title><p>All experiments were performed on endogenous and recombinant ADAMTS13-expressing cells. We used HEK293 cells, ADAMTS13-HEK293 transduced cells and LX2 stellate liver cells. Twenty-four hours after the transfection, media was collected and concentrated 24&#x02013;fold using 30 kDa cut-off Centriprep concentrating vials (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The concentrated media was then kept at -20&#x000b0;C. The cells were washed with 5 ml of chilled PBS (Invitrogen) lysed with lysis buffer (1 M Tris-HCl, 5 M NaCl, 100&#x00025; Triton X-100, Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, PMSF) and then stored at -20&#x000b0;C. A Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, New York, NY) was used to determine the total protein concentration for these lysates and concentrated media samples according to the manufacture's protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>The samples were boiled with SDSPAGE running buffer for 5 minutes, sonicated for 10 minutes and electrophoresed on 3&#x02013;8&#x00025; NUPAGE Tris-Acetate SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen). The proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at constant current. The ADAMTS13 protein was detected using the Wh2-11-1 monoclonal primary antibody and anti-mouse HRP secondary antibody (Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>FRET-VWF73 assay</title><p>FRET-VWF73 (Peptides International, Louisville, KY, USA) is a flourogenic substrate developed to test the activity of ADAMTS13 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006506-Kokame1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. The activity of the protein was tested using a GeminiMax plate reader. Readings were taken every 5 minutes for one hour at a 340 nm excitation and 450 nm emission. The FRET-VWF73 peptide was prepared as a stock concentration of 100 &#x000b5;M according to the manufacturer's instructions and was stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C. The stock was diluted 25 fold in reaction buffer containing 5 mM Tris-HCl, 25 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.005&#x00025; Tween-20 (Sigma) at pH 6. The test sample was prepared in a 1&#x02236;3 dilution with reaction buffer and 3&#x00025; NaCitrate solution (Sigma). The FRET-VWF73 and sample dilutions were combined just prior to the kinetic assay. Analysis of the results revealed the rate of ADAMTS13 activity as change in fluorescence per unit protein per minute.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A two-tailed unpaired T-test was used to compare the sample means of immunostaining results at the same concentration levels of antibody.
