Therefore, characterization of mammalian mitochondrial transcription termination factor (mTERF) functionality and regulation is of fundamental biological interest in order to understand the regulation of mitochondrial transcription. Here we report that mTERF is the first protein having a role in mammalian mitochondrial gene expression that appears to be controlled by phosphorylation. Recombinant mature rat mTERF protein has specific DNA-binding capacity for the sequence required for transcrip tion termination. Furthermore, unlike recombinant human mTERF, the rat protein bound to its mitochondrial DNA binding site promotes the termination of transcription initiated with heterologous RNA polymerase. Interestingly, mTERF is a phosphoprotein with four phosphate groups, and while the DNA-binding activity of mTERF is unaffected by the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation state, only the phosphorylated form of the protein is active for termination activity. Moreover, natural human mTERF is also a phosphoprotein and its termination activity is inhibited by dephosphorylation. These data suggest that mTERF functioning <italic>in vivo</italic> is regulated by phosphorylation.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x8da1950.0x99ccda8" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession no.

In mammalian cells, each organelle contains several copies of the mitochondrial genome, which is represented as a closed circular DNA of &#x0223c;16.6 kb. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes 37 genes: 22 tRNA, 2 rRNA and 13 polypeptides that are components of the OXPHOS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c1">1</xref>). However, most of the subunit components of the aforementioned system, and all the proteins necessary for mitochondrial replication, transcription and translation, are encoded by nuclear genes. These proteins are synthesized by cytoplasmic ribosomes as precursors and then imported into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c2">2</xref>).</p><p>Expression of mammalian mtDNA is initiated from a regulatory site in the molecule called the D-loop region that contains an origin of replication (O<sub>H</sub>) and the transcription promoters. In this mtDNA there are two major transcription initiation sites (I<sub>H1</sub> and I<sub>L</sub>); I<sub>H1</sub> is located in the H-strand promoter (HSP) and I<sub>L</sub> in the L-strand promoter (LSP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c3">3</xref>). A second initiation site for H-strand transcription (I<sub>H2</sub>) is located in the tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> gene, immediately adjacent to the gene for 12S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c5">5</xref>). According to this dual H-strand transcription model, transcription starting at I<sub>H2</sub> is less frequent and results in polycistronic molecules corresponding to almost the entire H-strand, yielding 12 mRNAs and 12 tRNAs. However, transcription starts relatively frequently at I<sub>H1</sub> and then terminates at the downstream end of the 16S rRNA gene, directing the synthesis of the 2 rRNAs (16S and 12S) and 2 tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c6">6</xref>). The difference, then, in the synthesis rate of rRNA and mRNA, besides being regulated at the level of transcription initiation, is explained by an attenuation event at the border of the 16S rRNA and tRNA<sup>Leu(UUR)</sup> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c8">8</xref>). The factor mediating termination of transcription is the mitochondrial transcription termination factor (mTERF), a DNA-binding protein that protects a 28 bp region within the tRNA<sup>Leu(UUR)</sup> gene at a position immediately adjacent to the downstream end of the 16S rRNA gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c9">9</xref>). Cloning of human mTERF has provided evidence for a novel DNA-binding motif, in which three leucine zippers form an intramolecular three-stranded coiled-coil that brings two widely separated basic domains into close register with the mTERF target DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c10">10</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, rat mTERF cDNA has been cloned, sequenced and expressed <italic>in vitro</italic> and in bacteria. The recombinant protein has been imported into isolated mitochondria and processed to the mature form. The mature recombinant protein exhibits the expected specific DNA-binding capacity to the corresponding termination site in rat mtDNA and it promotes <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription termination. Furthermore, the capability of rat mTERF to terminate transcription is modulated by multiple phosphorylations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning and sequence of rat mTERF cDNA</title><p>Using the sequence of human mTERF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c10">10</xref>), primers were designed to perform the RACE protocols, in order to obtain the entire cDNA sequence from rat liver poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>The r-mTERF plasmid used to produce rat mTERF precursor by <italic>in vitro</italic> translation was constructed by inserting a EcoRI&#x02013;HindIII fragment that contains the entire open reading frame (ORF) of rat mTERF into the pSPUTK vector (Stratagene). The sequence encoding the mature protein was PCR amplified using primers that produce a substitution of amino acids FSVE(&#x0002b;4) with MGAQ (R1, <underline>GGG CCC</underline> AAT GTA ACA GTA AAG ACG G-385; R3, <underline>CTG CAG</underline> CTA CCC ACT TAA TCT CTT C-1352). The PCR fragment vector was digested with ApaI and PstI and ligated to pSPUTK to give the r-mTERFm plasmid. The pLEX-His vector &#x0005b;which contains the sequence that encodes the histidine tag and the polylinker from pBlueBacHis2B vector (Invitrogen)&#x0005d; was used to express the mature protein in bacteria with a 14 amino acid histidine tag (MPRGSHHHHHHGMA) at the N-terminus. The pLEX-His-mTERF plasmid was constructed by PCR amplification of an appropriate fragment using primers R2 (<underline>GCT AGC</underline> GTG GAA TGT AAC AGT AAA G-381) and R3. The PCR product was digested with NheI and PstI, cloned into pLEX-His and transformed into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> GI724 (Invitrogen). The correct nucleotide sequence of all constructs was verified.</p><p>For construction of the pGTER plasmid used in the transcription termination experiment, the rat mtDNA region between nucleotide positions 2542 and 2761 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c11">11</xref>) was PCR amplified and cloned into pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega). The mTERF-binding sequence was placed in direct polarity with respect to the SP6 promoter and in reverse polarity with respect to the T7 promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f4">4</xref>A). The pGHLT plasmid was obtained by inserting an AflIII&#x02013;SalI human mtDNA fragment into pGTER. The chimeric fragment of 171 bp comprising nucleotides 360&#x02013;520 of human mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c12">12</xref>) was PCR amplified using one primer with an AflIII site (360-A ACA <underline>GTC GAC</underline> CCT AAC ACC AGC CTA AC) and another with a SalI site (520-G GAG <underline>ACA TGT</underline> GTG TGT GCT GGG TAG). This fragment contains the human L-strand promoter with the initiation site (I<sub>L</sub>). In this way, the human L-strand promoter replaced the SP6 promoter of pGTER.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of rat mTERF</title><p><italic>In vitro expression.</italic> The proteins (rat mTERF and rat mTERFm) were expressed in the TNT-coupled transcription&#x02013;translation system (Promega), which uses a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, following the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocols. &#x0005b;<sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;methionine (1000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham) was used to label proteins and the incorporation of radioactive label and the amount of protein synthesized were calculated.

The expression was induced at 37&#x000b0;C for 4 h by the addition of 100 &#x000b5;g/ml tryptophan. The purification of rat his-mTERF was carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c14">14</xref>).

The rat mTERF precursor was synthesized <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of &#x0005b;<sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;methionine and reticulocyte lysate was then added to 12.5&#x00025; (v/v) to samples of the mitochondrial suspension. Induction medium (1 mg/ml BSA, 2 mM sodium succinate, 1 mM ATP and 1 mM methionine, included to avoid labeling of newly synthesized proteins) was added to the reaction mixtures and these were then incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h. The mitochondria were washed twice with ice-chilled incubation medium and the final pellets were lysed with 1 vol of twice concentrated gel sample buffer. In some experiments, trypsin was added to the incubation mixture at 50 &#x000b5;g/ml after the import/processing reaction and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 min before washing and lysis of the mitochondria. In a control experiment in which, beside trypsin (50 &#x000b5;g/ml), Triton X-100 was added to the reaction mixture to 1&#x00025; (v/v), the washing of mitochondria was omitted.

The structure of the rat mTERF sequence conserves the modular organization observed in the human ortholog (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f1">1</xref>): two separated basic regions (B1 and B2), involved in directly binding the protein to its target sequence, and three leucine zipper motifs (Lz1a/b, Lz2 and Lz3), required to bring the two basic domains into close register with the target DNA sequence. It contains a putative mitochondrial targeting sequence of 37 amino acids, with the potential cleavage site placed between P(&#x02013;1) and F(&#x0002b;1) according to the &#x02018;R(&#x02013;2) rule&#x02019;. Based on this assignment the mature rat mTERF should be 337 amino acids long and have a calculated molecular mass of &#x0223c;38.3 kDa and a pI of 9.20. The deduced amino acid sequence of rat mTERF reveals 90, 75 and 72&#x00025; overall sequence identity and 96, 89 and 88&#x00025; overall sequence similarity to those of mouse (accession no.

The marked sequence homology among human, mouse, pig and rat cDNA suggests that mTERF is a highly conserved protein in mammals. However, rat mTERF displays only 18 and 15&#x00025; amino acid identity with <italic>Paracentrotus lividus</italic> mitochondrial transcription termination factor (mtDBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c17">17</xref>) and the recently cloned <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> mitochondrial transcription termination factor (DmTTF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c18">18</xref>), respectively (data not shown). These data indicate that mitochondrial transcription termination factors are not highly conserved between mammals and non-mammals.</p><p>In order to obtain direct evidence of the mitochondrial localization of rat mTERF, <italic>in vitro</italic> import/processing assays were carried out (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f2">2</xref>A). A construct containing the entire ORF and another having a deletion of the fragment that codifies the putative mitochondrial target sequence were expressed <italic>in vitro</italic> in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate to give the precursor rat mTERF and the mature protein rat mTERFm, respectively. The rat mTERF was labeled with &#x0005b;<sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;methionine and then incubated with isolated mitochondria (lane 1). After incubation in the presence of ATP, rat mTERF yielded a second, shorter band where the mitochondrial leader peptide had been cleaved off (lane 2). This band had the same electrophoretic mobility as observed for rat mTERFm (lane 5). Protein internalization into mitochondria was then assayed by exposure to trypsin. The processed product (mature protein), in contrast to the precursor, was resistant to trypsin treatment (lane 3), but became protease sensitive after solubilization of the membranes with Triton X-100 (lane 4). This result demonstrates that the mature protein was internalized within the inner mitochondrial compartment, which is impermeable to trypsin. Furthermore, import was inhibited by the uncoupler CCCP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f2">2</xref>A, lane 7), as expected from the requirement for a membrane potential for mitochondrial import. All these properties are characteristic of a typical mitochondrial import reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c19">19</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Functional analysis of rat mTERF</title><p>In order to investigate the functional capacity of the recombinant rat mTERF, its DNA-binding properties and its transcription termination-promoting activity in an <italic>in vitro</italic> system were analyzed. The binding capacity of rat mTERFm was determined by gel shift assays using a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled probe that contained the putative rat mTERF binding site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f2">2</xref>B). The recombinant mature protein was able to bind the probe producing a single retarded band. Increasing the amount of the protein resulted in an increase in the intensity of the retarded band, without the appearance of any more slowly moving secondary band. The amount of rabbit reticulocyte lysate was kept constant even in the absence of rat mTERFm. Finally, the equilibrium constant of binding (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) to DNA of recombinant rat mTERFm was estimated to be &#x0223c;10 nM.</p><p>A full-length rat mTERF for the mature protein was expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> as a histidine N-terminal tagged fusion protein and this recombinant his-mTERF protein was purified by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> affinity chromatography (data not shown). In order to analyze the his-mTERF functional capacity, the DNA-binding activity was determined by gel shift assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f2">2</xref>C) and the equilibrium binding constant calculated. A value of <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> &#x0223c;240 nM was obtained.</p><p>Termination activity of the recombinant rat mTERFm and his-mTERF proteins was characterized using a human mtS100 lysate as a source of mtRNA polymerase activity and using a chimeric template (pGHLT plasmid) containing the human L-strand promoter (I<sub>L</sub>) and the rat mTERF binding site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f3">3</xref>A). The recombinant proteins were able to support transcription termination activity when added to the system, producing a transcript of &#x0223c;188 nt which was not present in the absence of the protein. When rat mTERFm was present in the reaction, a high percentage (&#x0223c;65&#x00025;) of transcripts was stopped at the termination site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f3">3</xref>B), while only &#x0223c;10&#x00025; of termination was produced in the presence of his-mTERF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f3">3</xref>C). In order to investigate the ability of rat mTERF to interfere with RNA chain elongation catalyzed by bacteriophage RNA polymerases, another template (pGTER plasmid) carrying the rat mTERF binding site in either orientation relative to the bacteriophage promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f4">4</xref>A) was linearized downstream of the selected promoter and then transcribed with the proper bacteriophage RNA polymerase, in the absence and presence of rat mTERF. When the termination activity was tested with SP6 RNA polymerase and pGTER(NcoI) template, two classes of transcripts were generated in the presence of rat mTERFm: a longer run-off transcript and a shorter truncated transcript which corresponds to transcription termination (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f4">4</xref>B). With a protein concentration of 2.6 nM a 50&#x00025; level of termination was obtained. Transcription with T7 RNA polymerase and pGTER(SalI) template yielded a 40&#x00025; level of termination (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f4">4</xref>C). Finally, transcription with bacteriophage RNA polymerase generated terminated transcripts in the presence of his-mTERF when the termination site was placed either in the forward orientation with respect to the SP6 promoter or in the reverse orientation with respect to the T7 promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f4">4</xref>D). Thus, the recombinant rat mTERF expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> is able to bind to the termination site and produce termination of transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Rat mTERF is phosphorylated at multiple sites</title><p>The activity of rat mTERF could be regulated by post-transcriptional modification, and phosphorylation is one of the major mechanisms for regulating protein function in eukaryotic cells. As a first step to address this issue, the migration of &#x0005b;<sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;methionine-labeled rat mTERFm was analyzed by 2D gel electrophoresis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f5">5</xref>A). In the first dimension (isoelectrofocusing), the proteins were separated by charge, whereas in the second dimension (SDS&#x02013;PAGE) the proteins were separated by size. On 2D gels, two populations were observed with different pI values. After treatment with CIAP, only the population of the unmodified protein with a theoretical pI of 9.2 remained. The other population, with a calculated pI of 8.28, corresponded to the protein with four phosphate groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f5">5</xref>A, right panel). Another similar experiment carried out with h-mtS100 lysate and revealed with a polyclonal antibody anti-mTERF indicated that natural human mTERF also has four phosphates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f5">5</xref>B). Taken together, these results provide convincing evidence that rat mTERF is susceptible to being phosphorylated on four amino acid residues. In order to investigate if rat his-mTERF was also phosphorylated, the protein was expressed in bacteria, purified and resolved by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and the phosphoamino acid content was determined by immunoblot analysis. For this purpose antibodies specifically detecting phosphotyrosine (anti-P-Y), phosphoserine (anti-P-S) and phosphothreonine (anti-P-T) were used. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f5">5</xref>C, the three antibodies recognize a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa that represents the phosphorylated form of rat his-mTERF.</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of transcription termination activity by dephosphorylation of his-mTERF</title><p>As a first step to find out whether phosphorylation may regulate mTERF termination activity, rat his-mTERF expressed in bacteria and then purified was treated with agarose-coupled CIAP and used in transcription termination assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f6">6</xref>A). When untreated protein was added to the assay (lane 2), a clear termination band appeared, which was not present in the absence of the protein (lane 1). Most significantly, CIAP treatment produced a total inhibition of his-mTERF transcription termination activity (lane 3) and no termination band was present. This inhibitory effect was produced by dephosphorylation and not by the interference effect of agarose (lane 4). A low abundance RNA species shorter than the run-off transcripts was present regardless of the presence of mTERF and this was probably the result of either degradation of the run-off transcripts or mTERF-independent pausing or termination. The reduced overall transcription observed in lanes 2&#x02013;4 seems to be due to an inhibition of T7 RNA polymerase by his-mTERF. To test whether the DNA-binding activity of rat his-mTERF is also controlled by phosphorylation, recombinant and CIAP-treated protein was subjected to band shift assays using <sup>32</sup>P-labeled termination probe. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f6">6</xref>B, the protein produced a single retarded band (lane2), which remained unaffected after dephosphorylation (lane 4 versus lane 3). The reduction in transcription termination activity (lane 4) and the lower signal of retarded bands in lanes 3 and 4 with respect to the control (lanes 2) were due to the partial loss of protein after agarose treatment. These results provide direct evidence that dephosphorylation inhibits the transcription termination activity of rat mTERF, but that it does not affect its DNA-binding capacity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f7">7</xref>). More conclusive evidence concerning termination activity regulation by phosphorylation was obtained using purified natural human mTERF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f6">6</xref>C). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f6">6</xref>C shows the results of termination assays carried out with equivalent amounts of natural human mTERF proteins, both CIAP-treated and untreated. It is clear that the CIAP-treated protein almost completely lacks transcription termination-promoting activity, the remaining termination activity being due to endogenous mTERF present in h-mtS100.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The amino acid sequence of rat mTERF conserved the modular organization previously observed in human mTERF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c10">10</xref>), with two widely separated basic regions and three leucine zipper motifs; the same organization is also conserved in the mouse and pig orthologs. This feature supports the hypothesis that the four proteins share the same 3-dimensional structure. mtDBP from the sea urchin <italic>P.lividus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c17">17</xref>) and <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c20">20</xref>) also presents a modular organization with two leucine zipper motifs and two DNA-binding domains.</p><p>The recombinant mature protein expressed <italic>in vitro</italic> (rat mTERFm) or expressed in a bacterial system (his-mTERF) conserves the specific DNA-binding capacity to the termination region, with <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values of 10 and 240 nM, respectively. This difference could be due to the presence of a large percentage of inactive or misfolded molecules of rat his-mTERF from bacterial expression or to possible differences of post-translational modification between the two expression systems. It could also be an effect of the polyhistidine tag on the N-terminus of his-mTERF, because the importance of this region in the binding activity of human mTERF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c10">10</xref>) and mtDBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c17">17</xref>) has been demonstrated.</p><p>The most important point concerning termination-promoting activity was the capacity of both recombinant mature proteins (rat mTERFm and his-mTERF) to support transcription termination, differently from recombinant human mTERF, which lacks termination activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c10">10</xref>). The lack of termination activity of human mTERF was explained by the absence of a secondary modification of the primary translation product or another additional factor(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c10">10</xref>). In the case of rat mTERF, the protein expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> and purified (his-mTERF) was active for mitochondrial transcription termination. This observation rules out the need for an additional factor(s) and points to a secondary modification being required for termination activity.</p><p>Furthermore, the recombinant rat mTERF was able to terminate transcription when initiated by human mtRNA polymerase, SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase. This behavior is similar to that shown by human mTERF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c21">21</xref>) and mtDBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c22">22</xref>). Therefore, rat mTERF, like human mTERF and mtDBP, is not RNA polymerase-specific.</p><p>Both recombinant proteins, rat mTERFm synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and rat his-mTERF expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic>, are phosphorylated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f5">5</xref>A and C). The origin of the phosphorylation in these two different systems, one prokaryotic and the other eukaryotic, is presently under investigation in our laboratory.</p><p>The most important result presented in this study is the demonstration that the transcription termination activity of rat mTERF is regulated by phosphorylation while the DNA-binding activity of the protein is not. Rat mTERFm resolved into two clear bands in a 2D gel, with the band of lower pI being a phosphorylated form of the protein with four phosphate groups. The data also provide novel evidence that natural human mTERF is mostly phosphorylated at four sites, although the phosphorylation is more heterogeneous. This observation indicates that mTERF is phosphorylated physiologically by mitochondrial kinases. Evidence for mitochondrial protein phosphorylation in various cell types has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c24">24</xref>). Both recombinant rat mTERF and natural human mTERF are active in promoting transcription termination and both are phosphorylated. Furthermore, the non-phosphorylated forms of mTERFs were transcriptionally inactive for termination (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f6">6</xref>A and C). These results demonstrate that the termination activity of mTERF is regulated by phosphorylation and suggest that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation may be an important physiological regulatory mechanism for the activity of this protein. However, whereas transcription termination activity is inhibited by dephosphorylation, the DNA-binding activity of mTERF remains unaffected. Furthermore, phosphatase treatment of human mTERF does not affect the DNA-binding activity of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c9">9</xref>). Therefore, both activities are separable and the binding of mTERF to DNA is necessary but not sufficient to terminate transcription, as was previously shown with recombinant human mTERF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c10">10</xref>). Phos phorylation is, by any criterion, the most widely used regulatory mechanism for modulating enzyme activity in eukaryotic cells. There are countless examples in which the reversible addition of a phosphate moiety serves as a key switch to activate or inactivate enzyme activity. Thus, phosphorylation of yeast mitochondrial transcription factor A (Sc-mtTFA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c25">25</xref>) and mouse transcription termination factor I (TTF-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c26">26</xref>) regulates binding of the protein to DNA. Moreover, the protein RNA polymerase I and transcript release factor (PTRF), which interacts with RNA polymerase I, TTF-1 and the 3&#x02032;-end of pre-rRNA, is phosphorylated at multiple sites and fractionates into transcriptionally active and inactive forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c27">27</xref>). Likewise, the phosphorylated human La antigen (a RNA-binding protein that facilitates transcriptional termination and reinitiation by RNA polymerase III) binds RNA efficiently but does not support efficient transcription and the phosphoprotein can be reactivated for transcription by dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c28">28</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, mTERF is the first protein having a role in mammalian mitochondrial gene expression that appears to be controlled by phosphorylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh528f7">7</xref>). Furthermore, mTERF phosphorylation may modulate the mitochondrial synthesis ratio mRNA:rRNA in response to intra-mitochondrial signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c29">29</xref>).</p><p>Recently, a new model of mTERF regulation by oligomerization has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh528c30">30</xref>). In this model, the activity of the protein is modulated by the transition between an active monomer and an inactive trimer, which has no DNA-binding activity.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh528f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Sequence alignment of mTERFs.
