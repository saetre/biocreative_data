In particular, postnatal expression of neurotrophins has not been well documented in the neostriatum and in general neurotrophins or their receptor mRNA's are normally reported, but not protein expression. In the present study, immunocytochemical expression of BDNF, NT-3 and NT-4/5 was characterized in striatal tissue of C57BL/6 mice at postnatal days 10<sup>th </sup>(P10), 21<sup>st</sup> (P21), 42<sup>nd</sup> (P42) and 80<sup>th</sup> (P80).</p><p>We found that the expression of BDNF diminished along the postnatal time course we evaluated, while staining for NT-4 increased up to age P42 and remained constant, thereafter in the cell's soma. In contrast, NT-3 was first expressed in the neostriatal bundles and later on, in neostriatal cell somas. These results provide information about differences in the spatial and temporal expression of each neurotrophin in the neostriatum during the first 80<sup>th</sup> postnatal days.</p><p>RT-PCR procedures were also carried out to further determine whether protein levels of neurotrophins observed in the neostriatum were under control of gene expression. All neurotrophin mRNAs were expressed and only mRNA<sup>BDNF</sup> was reduced during the postnatal evaluated days.</p><p>Differences in temporal expression of neurotrophins may be related to the heterochronic development of neostriatal cell populations, but also with the specificity of each neurotrophin modulating different neuronal targets.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>neurotrophins</kwd><kwd>postnatal</kwd><kwd>BDNF</kwd><kwd>NT-3</kwd><kwd>NT4/5</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurotrophins are a family of trophic factors involved in differentiation and survival of neural cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>. Neural Growth Factor (NGF), Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Neurotrophin 3 (NT-3) and Neurotrophin 4/5 (NT-4/5) are active in different neuronal groups throughout the embryonic period but sometimes their roles are restricted to a specific developmental stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>.</p><p>Neurotrophin distribution is not homogeneous throughout the nervous system and its expression is low during postnatal period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>. In mice striatum, neurotrophin expression is important for the establishment of neuronal connections as well as its correct cell functions. Previous studies have established messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of NGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, BDNF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, NT-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref> and NT-4/5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref> in neostriatal tissue, although these molecules have not always been detected by Northern blot in fetal or postnatal brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>. In addition to the presence of neurotrophin mRNA, expression of neurotrophin receptors have been documented during the early development of the striatum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>. Nonetheless, the time-course of postnatal expression of neurotrophins, has not been well recognized in the striatum. Neurodegenerative disorders affecting the central nervous system are characterized by cell death of specific neuronal populations. Some degenerative diseases afflicting neural system have clear genetic origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>; however most of them are sporadic, suggesting that other mechanisms are influencing this outcome. Striatal neurons are particularly sensitive to excitotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref> and metabolic insults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>; additionally, trophic factors can supply deficits during the first two postnatal weeks that may worsen cellular harm. As neurodegenerative diseases may be a consequence of abnormal levels of neurotrophins during the first stages of development, a clear description of their expression patterns during the two postnatal months in the normal brain is important to address before evaluating them in striatal dysfunction.</p><p>We aim to describe postnatal expression of neurotrophin proteins visualized with immunostaining techniques at P10, P21, P42, and P80 in C57BL/6 mice. To further verify whether neurotrophin protein expression is determined by gene expression, we examined the mRNA levels of each neurotrophin at P10, P21 and P42 in mice striatum.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Male C57BL/6 mice (Harlan, M&#x000e9;xico) of 10<sup>th</sup>, 21<sup>st</sup>, 42<sup>nd</sup>, and 80<sup>th</sup> postnatal days were euthanized with pentobarbital (45mg/kg of body weight) and heart perfused with saline solution (NaCl 0.15 M) followed by phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.1M, pH 7.4) with paraformaldehyde (4%). Brains were dissected and post-fixed in the same fixative for two hours at room temperature, and then transferred to a sucrose solution (30%) until they sank for cryoprotection. The brains were frozen in cold 2-methylbutane. Cryostat coronal sections (30 &#x003bc;m) containing dorsal striatum were cut and collected sequentially into 24-well dishes filled with blocking solution for immunocytochemistry (3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% triton X-100 and 0.025% sodium azide in PBS).</p><p>All animal procedures were carried out with the approval of the animal care committee of the National Autonomous University of M&#x000e9;xico and in agreement with the NIH.</p><sec><title>Immunocytochemistry (IHC)</title><p>Tissue sections were incubated in blocking serum overnight at 4&#x000b0; C.

Three washes were done with blocking solution (every 15 min), then tissue slices were incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature with the corresponding biotinylated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) diluted (1:500) in blocking solution. After three washes with PB, slices were incubated with the avidin-peroxidase kit as recommended by the supplier (ABC kit; Vector). Peroxidase activity was revealed and intensified by using 3, 3'-diamobenzidine as a chromogen and nickel chloride according to the protocol provided by the supplier (Peroxidase staining kit; Vector). Finally, the staining was stopped after ~5 minutes by washing the slices with PB. For control IHC staining, the primary antibody was omitted and the tissue sections were processed with the same procedure as described before. Slices were mounted on gelatin-coated slides and cover slipped with Permount (Fisher, Inc).</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative assessment of neurotrophins expression in the striatum</title><p>Images of immunostained sections of dorsal neostriatum, from animals of 10 (n=10), 21 (n=10), 42 (n=10), 80 (n=10) days old were captured and quantified using an imaging analyses system (Image J system, NIH). For each mouse, six striatal slices (30 &#x003bc;m thick) spaced at intervals of 180 &#x003bc;m were taken and processed for immunocytochemistry. Afterwards, positive cells of four selected fields (252 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>, area) were counted in digitized images taken at the level of dorsal striatum. Each image slice was digitized using a computer assisted system consisting of a Nikon Optiphot microscope and a digital camera connected to a Pentium computer equipped with the morphometric software analysis. Contrast and area values were kept constant and intensity threshold was established to eliminate background staining.

Previous studies have revealed low levels of neurotrophin mRNAs in the striatum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>. These earlier findings prompted us to elucidate neurotrophin protein temporal expression in normal striatal tissue, in attempts to better understand striatal abnormalities in which the lack of trophic factors during development may underlie degenerative diseases like Parkinson or Huntington diseases. In the present study we show that in mice dorsal neostriatum, temporal neurotrophin IHC expression at postnatal days 10<sup>th</sup>, 21<sup>st</sup>, 42<sup>nd</sup> and 80<sup>th</sup> is differential. We observed that when BDNF was already expressed in the neostriatum, NT-3 was expressed in the corticostriatal bundles and NT-4/5 staining was absent. With neurotrophin relative RT-PCR analysis, we observed that temporal expression of BDNF was different in comparison with NGF, NT-3 and NT-4/5.</p><sec><title>Temporal and spatial IHC expression of neurotrophins at the postnatal striatum</title><p>Under our experimental conditions, BDNF was the only neurotrophin IHC expressed at P10 and declined with increasing postnatal age. BDNF is highly expressed during embryonic period and its expression changes during brain development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>. Our results for BDNF protein expression correlate well with the presence of its neurotrophin receptor mRNA<sup>TrkB</sup> in the neostriatum, which is highly expressed during embryonic development and declines at postnatal ages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>. It has been demonstrated that neurons as well as glial cells in the striatum exhibit BDNF immunoreactivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref> therefore, BDNF positive cells in our IHC experiments can be either type of cell.</p><p>NT-3 displayed expression in striatal bundles at P10 and P21 and in striatal cells at P42, sustaining its level of ICH expression up to P80. This is the first report in mice striatal tissue documenting differences in spatial expression of NT-3 at P10 and P21, where it was circumscribed to neuronal bundles. It has been recognized that, NT-3 is anterogradely transported from the cortex similar to BDNF, consequently, NT-3 expression in the neostriatal bundles at P10 and P21 may represent anterograde transport of NT-3 from the cortex as it has been suggested to occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>. In an earlier report, it was demonstrated that NT-3 mRNA is highly expressed in developing neurons in the cingulate cortex. That expression was transient during early stages of development and later the expression was seen in the hippocampus, supporting the notion that NT-3 promotes the development of cells that are anatomically connected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>. NT-3 influence on striatal function may be related to different neuronal populations than those affected by BDNF. Its temporal expression also suggests that, NT-3 is not necessary as a differentiation or survival factor for striatal cells. In addition NT-3 activates a different type of neurotrophin receptors, the TrkC receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>. Alternatively, NT-3 may influence the same population BDNF affects during another developmental time as a result of different developmental strategies and developmental speed.</p><p>NT-4/5 is expressed in the neostriatum, when BDNF is declining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). NT- 4/5 should arrive to the neostriatum between postnatal day 10<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup>, however, it is not known where the NT-4/5 is coming from, or if it is produced inside of the nucleus by neostriatal cells. Nevertheless, differences in temporal expression between BNDF and NT-4/5 are important to note, because both neurotrophins activate the same TrkB receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>. It is possible that the actions of both neurotrophins are not the same, or NT-4/5 actions may substitute for BDNF actions on striatal cells. Alternatively, each neurotrophin may affect distinct neuronal populations at different developmental stages. Other studies have documented that NT-4/5 is not necessary for early postnatal development of the neostriatum, still this neurotrophin is found all over the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>.</p><p>The developmental differences in neurotrophins temporal expression in the mice striatum may reflect the requirements of diverse group of cells for specific trophic factors at different postnatal stages, or it may suggest that every cellular group depends upon the presence of different neurotrophins at several stages of the postnatal development.</p></sec><sec><title>Neurotrophins mRNA expression in postnatal striatum</title><p>To establish whether the expression of neurotrophins detected by IHC procedure was a consequence of gene expression, the mRNA levels of NGF, BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4/5, were evaluated at P10, P21 and P42. P80 was omitted from this analysis because there were no differences in neurotrophins expression between P42 and p80 in IHC experiments. Although &#x003b2;-actin was used as internal standard; we included NGF as a positive control because it is recognized that NGF mRNA levels are high between P2 and P30 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>.</p><p>mRNA<sup>NGF</sup> was high and remained high at all ages evaluated as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>.This result was important to show that RNA was not degraded and PCR was working correctly.</p><p>BDNF presence in the neostriatum has been controversial due to the lack of specific antibodies; nevertheless it has been detected by the ELISA technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>. In our experiments, mRNA<sup>BDNF </sup>levels were evaluated at P10, P21, and P45. mRNA<sup>BDNF</sup> expression was low and reduced with time in agreement with our IHC results. In another study mRNA <sup>BDNF</sup> showed its maximal level by the third postnatal week (~P21) when the PCR was carried out with the RNAse protection technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, hence discrepancies in the expression level obtained in the present study may due to differences in the experimental procedure, still our data are in consonance with those reporting that BDNF presence in the striatal tissue declines with time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>.</p><p>NT-3 expression level of its mRNA is regulated differentially in comparison to BDNF, and has been reported that mRNA<sup>NT-3</sup> levels are constant during postnatal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>. In our experimental conditions after normalizing to the housekeeping gene, mRNA<sup>NT-3</sup> expression at P10, P21, and P42 did not exhibit any statistical change, which agrees with previous experimental reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>. In light of our IHC experiments, we believe that part of the mRNA<sup>NT-3 </sup>expression comes from mRNA of corticostriatal fibers, although we can not ruled out changes due to sample processing or biological changes (see below).</p><p>We did not observe significant changes in the mRNA<sup>NT-4/5 </sup>level expression in the postnatal days evaluated. Although with IHC procedure there was no expression of NT- 4/5 at P10. It has been reported that NT-4/5 is expressed in low amounts by postnatal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref> and increases in adult rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>; therefore, differences between mRNA and IHC expression of NT-4/5 may be due to insufficient levels of mRNA for protein translation (see below).</p><p>Comparing our mRNA results <italic>vs.</italic> our IHC data, mRNA<sup>BDNF</sup> levels followed the same expression pattern than those obtained with IHC procedures. However, NT-3 showed high expression levels at P10 and P21 with the RT-PCR technique but not with IHC. mRNA<sup>NT-4/5</sup> expression level was also observed at P10 but not in the tissue processed with the IHC protocol. It is known that expression levels of mRNA and protein may vary in the cells, this could be due to multiple factors, e.g. low levels of protein expression, technological sensitivities, sample processing, anatomical origin of tissue and biological differences between transcript and protein abundance. A previous study showed that protein expression does not always correlate with expression levels of mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>. There are several possible explanations for these discrepancies like post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications; in addition, proteins may have different half-lives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>. Gene expression analysis is more sensitive than immunocytochemical procedures; therefore it is possible that genes expressed in our study are at levels not high enough for translated protein expression detected by IHC. Satisfactory immunostaining requires preservation of protein tertiary structure in the region of the relevant epitopes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref> and it may be that some of neurotrophins antibodies are less immunoreactive than others.</p><p>It is hoped that continued improvements in commercially available antibodies, could further elucidate the relationship between mRNA levels and corresponding protein expression. In addition to the comparison of IHC and mRNA levels by RT-PCR, there will be the need for further evaluation utilizing techniques such as in situ hybridization, western blotting, microarray and proteomic analysis, to have a better idea about neurotrophins expression through all development.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional implications of neurotrophins in the postnatal striatum</title><p>Changes in neurotrophic factors during postnatal development may reveal differential nourishment requirements for cell populations in the neostriatum. BDNF is transported from the cortex to the neostriatum along the corticostriatal pathway where it has a trophic effect on medium spiny neurons (MSN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>, besides its function in cell survival, BDNF induces neuronal differentiation in neurons positive to calbindin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref> and DARPP-32 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>, specific markers for MSN. Actually, there is a reduction in calbindin and DARPP-32 positive neurons in BDNF knock out mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>. In addition, there is an increase in apoptotic death during development in animals that do not express TrkB receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref> which are those targeted by BDNF. However, its expression in postnatal and adult tissue may be linked to other functions that require low amounts of BDNF such as modulation of synaptic transmission.</p><p>The presence of NT-3 in striatal tissue is not surprising, because this neurotrophin exhibits neurotrophic effects on striatal, cortical, and nigral neurons and increases the number of GABAergic and calbindin positive neurons similar to BDNF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>. This neurotrophin also promotes survival and differentiation of DARPP-32 positive neurons, increases their neurites and somatic area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>. Notably, NT-3 can be found in glial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>, as well as in white matter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>. In our studies, NT-3 was expressed in the neostriatal bundles at P10 and P21; we do not know if NT-3 is synthesized in glial cells, nonetheless, the presence of this neurotrophin in corticostriatal bundles suggest that, NT-3 may arrive to the striatum by anterograde transport from cortex and perhaps there is an interaction between neuronal fibers and glial cells at the neostriatum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>.</p><p>NT-4/5 temporal expression at P21, P42 and P80, suggests a possible use of this neurotrophin in therapeutic manipulations because, it has been demonstrated that NT-4/5 increases the survival of GABA, calbindin and calretinin positive neurons in the neostriatum, and shares several of the BDNF neurotrophic effects because, it also acts on TrkB receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>. Therefore, if BDNF exhibits a synthesis failure, which has been demonstrated in some degenerative illness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, TrkB receptors might be activated with NT-4/5 to protect medium spiny neurons from cell death. Nevertheless this stimulation should be given in early phases of cellular harm, before TrkB receptors reduce their expression due to neuronal damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>. Perhaps early stimulation with NT-4/5 will stop TrkB receptor decrement.</p><p>BDNF and NT-3, but not NT-4/5, regulates soma morphology in medium spiny neurons without changing GAD immunostaining or mRNA<sup>GAD</sup> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>. It has been demonstrated that BDNF and NT-4/5 control different functions in the same cell type, for example BDNF but not NT-4/5, increases the somatic area in neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>. According to our results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), BDNF and NT-4/5 may act on different neuronal populations; however, both neurotrophins may affect the same cell population at different times due to changes in their expression time course. Although both neurotrophins activate TrkB receptors, their temporal expression is different, and NT-3 activates TrkB receptors in a lower proportion and activates TrkC receptors as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>As neurotrophins have important actions on neuron's survival, differentiation and maintenance, any failure in spatial and temporal neurotrophic supply may harm neostriatal cells; hence, the knowledge about their postnatal expression shall be crucial to understanding those pathologies afflicting the neostriatum early in development. In the present study, the most important result was to visualize differences in neurotrophin&#x000b4;s temporal expression in the neostriatum. In particular, our data supporting NT-3 protein expression in fiber bundles opens the possibility of revising its function in the neostriatum as well NT-4/5 function, even though it is unclear which cells NT-4/5 is synthesized.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Initial experiments and image acquisition of IHC procedures were performed at the laboratory of Dr. Guti&#x000e9;rrez, (IIB, UNAM).
