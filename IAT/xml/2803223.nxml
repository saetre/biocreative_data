To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, the transport of carbohydrates into tomato fruits and the regulation of starch synthesis during fruit development in tomato plants cv. &#x02018;Micro-Tom&#x02019; exposed to high levels of salinity stress were examined. Growth with 160 mM NaCl doubled starch accumulation in tomato fruits compared to control plants during the early stages of development, and soluble sugars increased as the fruit matured. Tracer analysis with <sup>13</sup>C confirmed that elevated carbohydrate accumulation in fruits exposed to salinity stress was confined to the early development stages and did not occur after ripening. Salinity stress also up-regulated sucrose transporter expression in source leaves and increased activity of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) in fruits during the early development stages. The results indicate that salinity stress enhanced carbohydrate accumulation as starch during the early development stages and it is responsible for the increase in soluble sugars in ripe fruit. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses of salinity-stressed plants showed that the AGPase-encoding genes, <italic>AgpL1</italic> and <italic>AgpS1</italic> were up-regulated in developing fruits, and <italic>AgpL1</italic> was obviously up-regulated by sugar at the transcriptional level but not by abscisic acid and osmotic stress. These results indicate <italic>AgpL1</italic> and <italic>AgpS1</italic> are involved in the promotion of starch biosynthesis under the salinity stress in ABA- and osmotic stress-independent manners. These two genes are differentially regulated at the transcriptional level, and <italic>AgpL1</italic> is suggested to play a regulatory role in this event.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Abscisic acid</kwd><kwd>ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase</kwd><kwd><sup>13</sup>C accumulation</kwd><kwd>sucrose transport</kwd><kwd>salinity stress</kwd><kwd><italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic></kwd><kwd>starch biosynthesis</kwd><kwd>sugar accumulation</kwd><kwd>tomato</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Salinity stress improves the fruit quality of tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) by increasing the level of total soluble solids, including sugars, organic acids, and amino acids in fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tal <italic>et al.</italic>, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ho <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balibrea <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>, 1999; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krauss <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saito <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). An increase in soluble solids enhances not only the market value of fresh fruit but also its processing efficiency, because it increases flavour and lowers water content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stark <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). Sugar content is most important in terms of fruit taste. Many studies have used model plants in an attempt to understand the mechanism of the effect of salinity stress in enhancing the accumulation of metabolites in plant tissues. However, in the tomato plant, most investigations into salinity stress have been agronomic and have tended to explain the phenomenon as a &#x02018;concentration effect&#x02019; due to a reduction in the size of the fruit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ehret and Ho, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ho <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sakamoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Invertase and sucrose synthase have been the enzymes most studied in order to elucidate the control mechanisms of sink strength and sugar level in fruit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balibrea <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>, 1999; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nguyen-Quoc and Foyer, 2001</xref>). During the last decade, cell-wall invertase has attracted attention as a key player to determine fruit sugar level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fridman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>, 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baxter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). In addition, there is positive correlation between cytoplasmic invertase and hexose contents in salinity-stressed fruit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balibrea <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). On the other hand, early studies have related the level of soluble solids in ripe tomato fruit to the starch level in the immature and mature green fruit stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davies and Cocking, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dinar and Stevens, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schaffer and Petreikov, 1997</xref>).

ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase, EC 2.7.7.27) has been proposed to regulate starch biosynthesis during the early stages of the developing fruit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schaffer and Petreikov, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schaffer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). AGPase catalyses the synthesis of ADP-glucose from glucose-1-phosphate and ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Preiss, 1988</xref>). Evidence from starch-deficient mutants, transgenic plants, and kinetic analyses has confirmed that this reaction is the first regulatory step in starch synthesis in plants (Tsai and Nelson, 1966; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">M&#x000fc;ller-R&#x000f6;ber <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stark <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>). Plant AGPase is a hetero-tetrameric enzyme composed of two small and two large subunits, and all subunits are required for normal enzyme function.</p><p>In tomato AGPase, there are two isoforms of the small subunit and three isoforms of the large subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Janes, 1997</xref>).

There are currently three known mechanisms regulating AGPase expression. Post-transcriptionally, AGPase undergoes allosteric regulation by glycerate-3-phosphate (3PGA) and Pi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sowokinos, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sowokinos and Preiss, 1982</xref>) and by redox modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tiessen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). At the transcriptional level, AGPase-encoding genes are regulated by phosphate, nitrate, and sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">M&#x000fc;ller-R&#x000f6;ber <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scheible <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nielsen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sokolov <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>).

At the start of this experiment, the effect of salinity intensity on fruit brix (%) and fresh weight of red ripe fruit in cv. &#x02018;Micro-Tom&#x02019; was examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Fruit brix (%) increased in response to the elevation of the stress level of the salinity and finally reached 1.6-times that of control fruit in the 160 mM NaCl condition. By contrast, fresh fruit weight decreased to 82&#x02013;62% of the control in the given salinity conditions exhibiting an inverse correlation to the brix. Although size of the plants was concomitantly decreased under the salinity stress, the ratio of fruits to foliage was kept almost the same in both of the conditions on a fresh and a dry weight basis (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp333/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S2</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). In order to dissect the dynamic alteration of carbohydrate in salinity-stressed fruit, plants treated with 160 mM NaCl were investigated using the following analyses. To avoid an excessive concentration effect due to the salinity stress, similar sized fruits were selectively used between both conditions in each developmental stage through the present work (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp333/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). Soluble sugar contents (glucose, fructose, and sucrose) of developing fruits were determined in fresh fruit grown under saline and normal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). In the control fruits, sugar levels gradually decreased (glucose, sucrose, and total sugar) or were unchanged (fructose) during fruit development (10&#x02013;34 DAF) and, apart from sucrose, increased slightly by the end of the maturation stage (42 DAF). Sugar levels of salinity-stressed fruit were unchanged at 34 DAF but had increased substantially by 42 DAF; however, only sucrose had been kept at a similar level during this period even under saline conditions. Salinity stress enhanced the accumulation of glucose by 2.43 times, fructose by 2.05 times, sucrose by 7.87 times, and total sugars by 2.27 times at 42 DAF compared with those of the control. The promotion effect of the salinity stress on the accumulation of soluble sugars in red-ripe fruit was also confirmed on a dry weight basis (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp333/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S3</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). Water contents were 90.7 (10 DAF), 91.8 (18 DAF), 89.9 (26 DAF), and 93.2% (42 DAF) in control fruits and 85.9 (10 DAF), 85.8 (18 DAF), 86.7 (26 DAF), and 90.9% (42 DAF) in the salinity-stressed fruits (data not shown). In contrast to the sugar contents, salinity stress enhanced starch accumulation during the early fruit development stages by 5.04 (10 DAF), 2.13 (18 DAF), and 2.91 (26 DAF) times compared to those of the control, respectively. Accumulation of starch granules in the fruits at 10 DAF was visualized by Periodic acid&#x02013;Schiff (PAS) staining (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp333/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S4</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows that enhanced starch accumulation was observed in the fruit of plants exposed to the salinity stress in developmental fruits.

Because the transiently produced starch in immature tomato fruits is completely degraded to soluble sugars in ripe fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dinar and Stevens, 1981</xref>), it is probable that enhanced starch accumulation results in a higher sugar content in ripe red fruits under salinity stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). The higher level and the extended period of starch accumulation in the early stages of tomato fruit development were also reported in tomato introgression lines having a high soluble solids trait that have alleles derived from the wild species <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pennellii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baxter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>habrochaites</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Petreikov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Our results and those from the introgression lines suggest a regulation mechanism of soluble solids level in the ripe red stage via transient starch accumulation in the early developmental stages in tomato fruit and its variability is influenced by both environmental conditions and genotype. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balibrea <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref> reported that sucrose import during ripening played an important role for the increase in sugar content under salinity stress in wild species, suggesting there are different mechanisms to determine the sugar level within the germplasm.</p><p>The effect of salinity stress on promoting starch accumulation and AGPase activity in developing tomato fruit was also reported in a normal cultivar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). A similar increase in AGPase activity was found in salinity-stressed fruit of &#x02018;Micro-Tom&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>) and therefore the response of AGPase genes to salinity stress was examined. In control fruit grown without salt, these genes exhibited similar expression patterns to those previously reported: <italic>AgpS1</italic> is most strongly expressed, followed by <italic>AgpL1</italic> and <italic>AgpL2</italic>, then <italic>AgpL3</italic>, in which expression is low or absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park and Chung, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Petreikov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). When grown under saline conditions, <italic>AgpS1</italic> and <italic>AgpL1</italic> were up-regulated at the transcriptional level in fruits from 10&#x02013;22 DAF, while <italic>AgpL2</italic> and <italic>AgpL3</italic> showed little response to salinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). Since the AGPase activity declined earlier than <italic>AgpS1</italic> and <italic>AgpL1</italic> transcription, post-transcriptional regulation could be involved in those events. In plants, the large subunit of AGPase functions as an allosteric modulator, whereas the small subunit functions as a catalytic molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Okita <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>). Functional AGPase requires a heterotetramer consisting of two large and two small subunit genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Janes, 1997</xref>). In the early development of tomato fruits, transcriptional levels of the large subunit genes (<italic>AgpL1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>L3</italic>) are much lower than that of the small subunit gene (<italic>AgpS1</italic>), indicating that expression of the large subunit genes limits AGPase expression at the transcriptional level in young tomato fruit. Because expression of <italic>AgpL1</italic> was highest among the large subunit genes during early fruit development, and is expressed in a co-ordinated manner to the enzymatic activity and starch accumulation pattern during fruit development, <italic>AgpL1</italic> is likely to be responsible for the enhanced starch biosynthesis under salinity stress. The starch accumulation pattern observed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp333/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S4</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online also strongly supported the regulatory role of <italic>AgpL1</italic> in fruit because it entirely corresponded to the GUS expression pattern driven by the <italic>AgpL1</italic> promoter in an immature-green fruit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xing <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p><sup>13</sup>C analysis showed that salinity stress strongly promoted <sup>13</sup>C accumulation in immature green fruits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). This could be interpreted as the result of a suppressed respiration activity and subsequent lower utilization of carbohydrate for energy production in the salinity-stressed fruits. It was supported by the hexose profiles during 10&#x02013;34 DAF, in which the hexose contents slightly increased under the salinity stress whereas they gradually decreased in control condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). On the other hand, it was also likely to be caused by an increased influx of carbohydrate in the salinity-stressed fruit. If the higher <sup>13</sup>C accumulation is due to the lower carbohydrate utilization, sink strength should be higher in the control than in the salinity-stressed fruit. However, expression of <italic>AgpL1</italic> and <italic>AgpS1</italic> in the sink organs (fruit) were actually higher in salinity than control condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). An increased allocation of photosynthetic <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>13</sup>C to fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saito <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) and the higher expression of <italic>LeSUT1</italic> in source leaves of tomato plants exposed to salinity stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>) supported this possibility. To examine these hypotheses, a direct measurement of carbon transport using a positron-emitting tracer imaging system (PETIS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suwa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) will be needed. Although a small green fruit could have some photosynthetic activity, the possibility that the salinity stress promotes phyto-assimilation on the fruit surface was ruled out, because the accumulation of starch granules only appeared in the inner pericarp, the columella, and placenta tissue but not in the outer pericarp and exocarp where photosynthetic chloroplasts are localized (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp333/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S4</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). In addition, the <sup>13</sup>C value just after the <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> feeding was subtracted from all of the measured figures of the samples taken after 24 h and 48 h. Therefore, the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref> reflected the net influx and consumption in the fruit after the <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> feeding. The <sup>13</sup>C analyses also revealed that carbohydrate accumulation in the fruit was almost completed by the mature green stage and did not occur after the start of ripening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). It indicated that the higher sugar accumulation in salinity-stressed ripe fruit is due to active starch accumulation during the early stages of fruit development. Furthermore, the starch completely disappeared from the fruit by the red stage under both the control and salt-stressed conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), indicating that there is sufficient enzymatic activity for starch breakdown in ripening fruit. This leads us to conclude that the increase in carbohydrate accumulation in the fruit, probably caused by a promoted sugar transport at the early development stages, plays an important role in ensuring the soluble sugar content in the mature red fruit under these salinity conditions.</p><p>Because our analyses indicated that the expression of <italic>LeSUT1</italic> in source leaves was up-regulated at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>) under the salinity stress, a systemically co-ordinated mechanism is likely to be involved in this event. It will be interesting to elucidate which factor functions as the driving force for the amplification of carbohydrate flux; increased sink capacity of the fruit or intensification of the loading ability in source leaves. Overexpression of the bacterial small subunit gene driven by the potato <italic>spADPGPP</italic> promoter in the tomato plant resulted in a 20&#x02013;30% increase in total soluble solids in ripe fruit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stark <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>), indicating that fruit sink capacity can be controlled by a modification of AGPase gene expression. To clarify how AGPase genes contribute to the determination of sink strength during fruit development of tomato, functional analyses using overexpression or knockdown strategies in an organ- and stage-specific manner will be indispensable. Those transgenic plants would be available to analyse the balance of contribution of AGPase and other sucrolytic enzymes, such as invertase and sucrose synthase, in fruit sugar levels and sink strength.</p><p>Transcriptional regulation of the AGPase gene by sugar has been reported in several plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Salanoubat and Belliard, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">M&#x000fc;ller-R&#x000f6;ber <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sokolov <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akihiro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). In tomato, sucrose regulation of <italic>AgpL1</italic> expression in fruit was also reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li <italic>et al.</italic> (2002)</xref>. In the present study, it is demonstrated that both <italic>AgpL1</italic> and <italic>AgpS1</italic> are specifically up-regulated by sucrose but not by ABA and osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8A, D</xref>). The ANOVA results indicate that the sucrose response of <italic>AgpL1</italic> transcription was affected by ABA. However, we think that ABA does not have an effect on sucrose-regulation because the sucrose treatment strikingly induced <italic>AgpL1</italic> transcription even in the absence of ABA, and it did not exhibit a dose-response to ABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8A</xref>). Synergistic effects of ABA and sugar on AGPase gene expression were reported in <italic>Apl3</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rook <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>) and <italic>OsAPL3</italic> in rice cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akihiro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). In contrast to those tissues and species, our results indicate that starch biosynthesis in tomato fruit is mainly regulated by sugar in an ABA- and osmotic stress-independent manner. It was also supported by the lower level of endogenous ABA contents in immature-green fruit and the poor response to the salinity-stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). Considering the prominent activation of <sup>13</sup>C accumulation under salinity conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>), the increase of carbohydrate availability in the developing fruits plays an important role in the up-regulation of AGPase genes and consequent starch accumulation, resulting in later starch breakdown and more sugar accumulation in the salinity-stressed ripe fruit. In contrast to <italic>AgpL1</italic>, <italic>AgpS1</italic> exhibited a much lower response to sucrose, even though it was strongly up-regulated by salinity stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figs 8D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9D</xref>). These results indicate differential regulation pathways of those genes under the salinity stress in tomato fruit. On the other hand, the possibility was ruled out that <italic>AgpL2</italic> and <italic>AgpL3</italic> participate in starch accumulation in fruit because of the lower expression levels and poor responsiveness to salinity stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7B, C</xref>). In addition, our preliminary analysis suggested that <italic>AgpL2</italic> is mainly expressed in seeds (data not shown). <italic>AgpL3</italic> was the only isoform in which the synergistic effects of ABA/osmotic stress and sucrose were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8C</xref>; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp333/DC1">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). Since <italic>AgpL3</italic> is specifically expressed in source tissue including photosynthetic leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xing <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), such a regulation manner would be general for source-type AGPase genes in plant. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tiessen <italic>et al.</italic> (2003)</xref> reported that sucrose and glucose lead to transcriptional and post-translational up-regulation of AGPase by affecting its redox state and SNF1-related kinase- and hexokinase-mediated signalling pathways in potato tuber. In tomato fruit, it is likely that the elevated sugar transport under the salinity stress stimulates AGPase activity in a similar manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp333/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp333/DC1">Supplementary Table 1.</ext-link></bold> Primer sequences and accession numbers of target genes for quantitative RT-PCR analyses.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp333/DC1">Supplementary Table 2.</ext-link></bold> Statistical analyses of the effects of ABA, sucrose, mannitol, and those in combination on the expression of tomato AGPase genes.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp333/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1.</ext-link></bold> Fresh weight of developing fruits used in the present experiments.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp333/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 2.</ext-link></bold> Ratio of fruits to foliage on a dry weight basis of the 14-week-old plants grown under control and 160 mM of salinity condition for 7 weeks after flowering.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp333/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 3.</ext-link></bold> Soluble sugar contents on a dry weight basis in ripe fruits (42 DAF) of plants grown under control and salinity conditions.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp333/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 4.</ext-link></bold> Accumulation pattern of starch granules in tomato fruit at 10 DAF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="erp333_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="erp333_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><glossary><def-list><title>Abbreviations</title><def-item><term>ABA</term><def><p>abscisic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AGPase</term><def><p>ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DAF</term><def><p>days after flowering</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EC</term><def><p>electrical conductivity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>qRT-PCR</term><def><p>quantitative RT-PCR</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SUT</term><def><p>sucrose transporter</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>We thank Dr Takashi Akihiro, Shimane University, for technical advice on the AGPase enzyme assay.
