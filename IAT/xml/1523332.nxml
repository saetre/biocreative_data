The condition increases the risk of premature coronary artery disease due to atherosclerosis, and it occurs in about 1 in 500 in most populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The mutational spectrum is very heterogeneous in the Danish and other populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], including missense mutations, splice site mutations and large deletions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].

The results define the breakpoints of each deletion, and they suggest that unequal homologous recombination due to <italic>Alu </italic>repeats is responsible for the deletions.

The proportion of FH cases caused by large rearrangements has been estimated to be approximately 5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The number of large rearrangements reported to the FH website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] was 92, however, accounting for 13.5% of the mutations in the database. The five deletions described in this paper account for 3.1% of the mutations identified in Danish FH mutation carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], whereas a recent study of a Norwegian population of FH patients show that 10.2% of them carry complex rearrangements due to deletions or duplications in the <italic>LDLR </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. A Canadian study detected 17% deletions in a sample of 70 FH patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Complex rearrangements thus account for a small but possibly quite variable proportion of LDLR mutations in different populations.</p><p>The MLPA method initially used to identify the deletions described here does not include the promoter, exon 10 or exon 13 of the <italic>LDLR </italic>gene. Rearrangements involving only exon 10, exon 13 or the promoter will therefore not be diagnosed using MLPA. We expanded the findings made by MLPA in the two cases (del prom &#x02013; exon 1 and del 13 &#x02013; 15 respectively) in which it was unclear whether the deletion included parts of the promoter or exon 13. We found that the exon 1 deletion included a large part of the sequence upstream of exon 1, including the promoter, most probably rendering this a null allele. In the case of the deletion involving exon 14 and 15, the results show that exon 13 was also deleted. A new version of the MLPA kit now includes exon 10 and 13, making findings in these regions of the gene more reliable. On the other hand, if the MLPA method detects a mutation causing only a deletion of one exon, it could possibly be a false positive result, due to the risk of failure to bind or inefficient binding of a single probe to the sample DNA. MLPA results indicating a one-exon deletion should therefore always be confirmed by an independent method.</p><p>Three other deletions involving the promoter and exon 1 have been identified previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], one of which was characterized recently by Canadian researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We show that the deletion found in our patient was not identical to the one found in Canada. The deletion that we found was located approximately 6.1 kb upstream and 3 kb downstream of exon 1, whereas the French-Canadian deletion was located 11.7 kb upstream and 4 kb downstream of exon 1.</p><p>Three rearrangements deleting only exon 5 have been described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], two of them apparently smaller than the one described here. We found that the exon 5 deletion was identical to the one we have described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Deletions involving exon 7 &#x02013; 8 and exon 13 &#x02013; 15 have also been seen in other populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], but lack of information on precise breakpoints makes it impossible to establish whether the deletions we describe are identical to the ones reported from other populations. Mutations deleting exon 9 to 14 have to our knowledge not been identified in other populations. The diagnostic assay set up to detect the exon 7 &#x02013; 8 deletion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) proved to be a valuable and simple means of detecting affected family members. Instead of developing an assay based on ordinary long range PCR, e.g. detecting a fragment of 4.6 kb representing the wildtype allele and a fragment of 1.6 kb representing the mutated allele, we used duplex PCR, with one set of primers outside the breakpoint detecting the mutated allele, and another set of primers within the deletion breakpoints detecting the wildtype allele, to get amplification products of similar size. We were therefore able to run the PCR under relatively stringent conditions to get clear and reproducible bands from both the wildtype and mutated allele.</p><p>Since the first deletions in the <italic>LDLR </italic>gene were described in 1985 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] it has been widely accepted that complex rearrangements can be ascribed to an abundance of <italic>Alu </italic>repeats in the gene, since unequal homologous recombination occurs fairly easily between two <italic>Alu </italic>elements, typically located in different introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. <italic>Alu </italic>sequences represent as much as 85% of the intronic sequences of the LDLR gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The five deletions described in this work are all flanked by <italic>Alu </italic>elements, supporting a mutation mechanism involving unequal homologous recombination between highly similar <italic>Alu </italic>elements. R&#x000fc;diger and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] suggested that a 26 basepair part of an <italic>Alu </italic>consensus sequence (<italic>ALU</italic>-DEIN) served as a recombinogenic hotspot, not only because it occurs close to several complex rearrangements in the <italic>LDLR </italic>and other genes, but also because it contains a motif known to mediate recombination in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The <italic>ALU</italic>-DEIN sequence was also present in the exon 5 deletion identical to the one described here; it occurs close to the 5' flank of the promoter &#x02013; exon 1 deletion; and it constitutes the major part of the overlapping sequence in the exon 9 &#x02013; 14 deletion. Recently the hypothetical recombinogenic hotspot was also suggested to explain the occurrence of two deletions in the <italic>ALD </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], lending further support to the hypothesis that the <italic>ALU</italic>-DEIN sequence is a recombinogenic hotspot that can cause unequal homologous recombination.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the present study defines the precise genomic breakpoints of five deletions in the <italic>LDLR </italic>gene, opening new possibilities to develop specific diagnostic tests for these deletions. Furthermore, it supports the proposition that <italic>Alu </italic>repeats are involved in mutational events in the <italic>LDLR</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PHN designed the study, performed bioinformatic studies, participated in the interpretation of the data and drafted the manuscript.
