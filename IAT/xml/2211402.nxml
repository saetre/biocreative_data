In male transgenic mice, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> double positive (DP) cells undergo negative selection by TCR agonist ligands and die by apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Kisielow1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. However, CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells expressing mostly CD8&#x003b1; and low levels of CD8&#x003b2; as well as double negative (DN) cells with the transgenic TCR are present among extrathymic lymphocytes and intraepithelial gut lymphocytes (IEL) in male HY transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-vonBoehmer1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells with the transgenic TCR represent the most abundant population of T cells in the gut of these mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Rocha1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Two competing hypotheses with regard to the origin of these extrathymic cells have been put forward: one suggested that these cells survived the negative selection process at the DP stage of thymocyte development by down-regulating CD8 and CD4 co-receptor expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Teh1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. This hypothesis appeared consistent with later experiments showing that <italic>in vitro</italic> fetal thymic organ culture some DP cells from female HY-TCR transgenic mice could become CD8&#x003b1;&#x003b1; T cells when confronted with HY antigen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Yamagata1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, our previous fate mapping experiments indicated that in wild-type (WT) mice CD8&#x003b1;&#x003b1; IEL with TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2; are derived from precursors expressing ROR&#x003b3;t, which is an isoform of an orphan nuclear receptor, ROR&#x003b3;, encoded by the <italic>Rorc</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Eberl1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. ROR&#x003b3;t is specifically expressed in DP thymocytes. IEL with TCR&#x003b3;&#x003b4; expression are not derived from ROR&#x003b3;t expressing precursors. This led to the assumption that in WT and TCR transgenic mice CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> IEL are derived from DP thymocytes and that this pathway of differentiation represents induction of a lineage away from conventional TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2; cells that home to secondary lymphoid organs and towards intestinal intraepithelial TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2; lymphocytes that may have an important role in regulating gut immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-GuyGrand1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The competing hypothesis was that the CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and DN cells expressing the HY transgenic TCR in male mice represent an abnormal subset of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; lineage cells misguided by the premature expression of the transgenic TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2; that would mimic signals delivered normally by the TCR&#x003b3;&#x003b4;. In addition, it was postulated that the confrontation of DN cells with the HY agonist ligand led to expression of the CD8&#x003b1; co-receptor as is observed with some activated TCR&#x003b3;&#x003b4; cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-vonBoehmer1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with the second hypothesis was the observation that in mice exhibiting timely expression of the HY transgenic TCR, i.e. at the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> stage of development, CD8&#x003b1;&#x003b1; IEL in the gut of male mice were much reduced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Baldwin1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> arguing that abnormally early expression of this particular transgenic TCR was indeed responsible for the generation of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> IEL in male HY transgenic mice. Also, DN cells with the HY-TCR could be observed in the periphery of female mice indicating that a TCR agonist ligand was not required for their generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Kisielow1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The former, but not the latter, hypothesis postulates that extrathymic lymphocytes with the HY receptor are derived from ROR&#x003b3;t-positive DP precursors. By using ROR&#x003b3;t-dependent lineage fate mapping in HY-TCR transgenic mice, it is therefore possible to determine which of the models provides an adequate explanation for how these cells are derived. ROR&#x003b3;t is an orphan nuclear receptor, whose expression during T cell development begins in late DN cells and is mostly restricted to DP thymocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-He1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Villey1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Lineage fate mapping using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice in which cre-recombinase is controlled by ROR&#x003b3;t regulatory elements irreversibly labels cells developing through the conventional CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2;, but not the DN TCR&#x003b3;&#x003b4;, pathway. Moreover, IEL do not express ROR&#x003b3;t <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Ivanov1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, breeding of the ROR&#x003b3;t-cre mice to mice bearing a loxP flanked stop cassette in front of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) embedded in the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus results in fluorescent labeling of all ROR&#x003b3;t<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> precursor-derived T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Eberl1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Srinivas1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. We showed that all TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2; cells in the secondary lymphoid organs of WT mice were labeled by ROR&#x003b3;t-cre and that non-conventional TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2; populations of CD8&#x003b1;&#x003b1;TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2; IEL and V&#x003b1;14i natural killer T (NKT) cells were likewise selected from a common pool of ROR&#x003b3;t<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> precursors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Eberl1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Egawa1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Utilizing this approach we have found that both of the original hypotheses concerning non-conventional TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2; cells in HY transgenic mice may be correct: the majority of intraepithelial CD8&#x003b1;&#x003b1; cells in the gut of male HY-TCR transgenic mice was derived from ROR&#x003b3;t-negative precursors while a minority of HY-TCR<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD8&#x003b1;&#x003b1; cells in male mice and all CD8&#x003b1;&#x003b1; cells in WT mice are derived from ROR&#x003b3;t-positive precursor cells. Thus induction of the CD8&#x003b1;&#x003b1;TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2; lineage at the ROR&#x003b3;t<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> stage of development occurs in both WT and TCR transgenic mice whereas the precocious expression of a TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2; in TCR transgenic mice generates subsets of misguided TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2;-expressing T cells that are only rarely observed in normal mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Origin of non-transgenic T cells with diverse &#x003b1;&#x003b2; and &#x003b3;&#x003b4;TCRs in WT and TCR transgenic mice</title><p>In ROR&#x003b3;t-cre;ROSA26-stop-EYFP mice on a non-TCR transgenic background, practically all extrathymic cells with surface TCR&#x003b2; chains were EYFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and thus derived from ROR&#x003b3;t<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells such as DP thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001512-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The same EYFP expression pattern was observed in extrathymic T cells from lymph nodes of male and female HY-TCR transgenic mice that did not express the transgenic TCR because of replacement of transgenic TCR&#x003b1; by endogenous TCR&#x003b1; chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001512-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Borgulya1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-vonBoehmer2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. This indicates that, after endogenous TCR&#x003b1; rearrangement in TCR transgenic mice, cells with new TCRs composed of transgenic TCR&#x003b2; chain and endogenous TCR&#x003b1; chains develop in a similar pathway as they do in normal mice. Cells with the phenotype of extrathymic T cells were also found intrathymically (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001512.s001">Figure S1</xref>) making it likely that they are all derived from ROR&#x003b3;t<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DP thymocytes. Thus, in spite of the thymic cortex being largely devoid of DP thymocytes in male mice, some cells develop normally if they escape deletion by the early expression of endogenous TCR&#x003b1; chains.</p><fig id="pone-0001512-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001512.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Fate mapping of T cells from WT and HY-TCR transgenic mice expressing endogenous TCR&#x003b1; using ROR&#x003b3;t-cre.</title><p>CD4 and CD8&#x003b1; expression by gated HY (T3.70)<sup>&#x02212;</sup> TCR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> lymph node cells (left column) is shown in the second column.

However, Sox13 expression was then downregulated in TCR&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD24<sup>lo</sup> thymocytes and it became almost undetectable in TCR&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> IEL, while Sox13 expression was barely detected in TCR&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DN4 or DP thymocytes which are selected from DN3 precursors by pre-TCR signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001512-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>; data not shown). These results suggest that Sox13 is transiently upregulated following signals through TCR&#x003b3;&#x003b4;, but not pre-TCR, at the DN thymocyte stage and may play some role in specification of the TCR&#x003b3;&#x003b4; lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Melichar1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In thymocytes from male HY mice, we could observe significant upregulation of Sox13 in HY<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>DN thymocytes. Similar to WT TCR&#x003b3;&#x003b4; lineage cells, Sox13 upregulation was detected at the CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD24<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> stage and peaked at the CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD24<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> stage followed by Sox13 downregulation as cells matured. These findings strongly support our hypothesis that premature TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2; signals divert a proportion of TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN thymocytes into the TCR&#x003b3;&#x003b4; lineage.</p><fig id="pone-0001512-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001512.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Sox13 expression in thymocyte subpopulations from HY transgenic mice.</title><p>(A) <italic>Sox13</italic> expression in male HY<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN thymocyte subpopulations, WT DN thymocyte subpopulations and TCR&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> thymocyte subsets was determined by real time PCR.

This is the case even when normal regulatory elements of the <italic>Tcra</italic> and <italic>Tcrb</italic> genes have been used, such as in HY transgenic mice; in these mice, cosmids containing rearranged TCR genes were introduced and TCR&#x003b2; and TCR&#x003b1; transgenes were integrated in tandem such that expression of the TCR&#x003b1; transgenes can be regulated by <italic>Tcrb</italic> control elements. Because of the premature TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2; expression, the validity of conclusions obtained in TCR transgenic mice has sometimes been questioned. A good example is the deletion of DP thymocytes in HY transgenic mice, whose physiological relevance was questioned by either assuming that the virtual absence of DP thymocytes in male HY-TCR transgenic mice was not caused by deletion but by a developmental arrest at the DN stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Takahama1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> or by arguing that the too early TCR expression in the DP compartment was responsible for deletion that normally would only occur in the medulla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Baldwin1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. One of us has previously explained why these assumptions are unlikely to be true: DP cells are observed in the thymus of male HY-TCR transgenic mice and are increased in mice that lack CD8&#x003b2; co-receptor chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Crooks1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Killeen1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, arguing against a developmental arrest at the DN stage as the sole explanation for the low proportion of DP thymocytes in these mice. These studies, together with another study using transgenic mice expressing a mutant D<sup>b</sup> molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Killeen1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, suggest that interaction of MHC class I and the CD8&#x003b1;&#x003b2;/TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2; complex is important for efficient depletion of DP thymocytes in male HY mice. DP thymocyte deletion also occurs in male HY-TCR transgenic mice with timely onset of TCR transgene expression at the DP stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Baldwin1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, studies in WT and TCR transgenic mice show that ligation of the TCR on DP thymocytes results in their deletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Smith1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, there is convincing evidence that DP thymocytes are generally susceptible to deletion depending on the availability of appropriately presented antigen in the thymic cortex, especially class I MHC presented peptides derived from proteins such as HY antigen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Teh2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, and that deletion of DP thymocytes in TCR transgenic mice is representative of this physiological process.</p><p>The above considerations are important for the results presented here since it is believed that confrontation of DP thymocytes with cognate TCR ligands can result not only in deletion, but also in induction of development of alternative lineages, thereby generating T cells that can migrate from the thymus and regulate immunity in the gut as CD8&#x003b1;&#x003b1; T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-GuyGrand1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Since these conclusions were reached from studies that included experiments with TCR transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Yamagata1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, careful consideration has to be given to the possibility that results may have been influenced by precocious expression of the TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2; in TCR transgenic mice. With regard to this issue, it is important to consider that in male HY transgenic mice CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells with the transgenic TCR are present in peripheral lymphoid tissues and in IEL, in spite of the fact that the cortex is largely devoid of DP thymocytes. Two different scenarios were proposed to account for these observations: in one scenario, down-modulation of CD8&#x003b2; co-receptor at the DP stage was held responsible for the escape of T cells into the periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Teh1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> while in the other it was assumed that the CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were generated through activation of a differentiation program for DN &#x003b3;&#x003b4; lineage cells that express the transgenic TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2;, resulting in increased levels of CD8&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-vonBoehmer1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The different hypotheses can be tested by using lineage fate mapping that can distinguish whether subsets of T cells develop through the ROR&#x003b3;t<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> stage or are derived directly from ROR&#x003b3;t-negative precursors. The lineage fate mapping method utilized here had previously been employed to trace the origin of CD8&#x003b1;&#x003b1; cells in the gut and invariant NKT cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Eberl1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Egawa1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Using the same approach in female and male HY-TCR transgenic mice, we have now delineated the origin of various peripheral T cells in lymph node and gut epithelium. The results do in fact show that the vast majority of lymph node T cells and IEL with the HY transgenic TCR and low level or no expression of CD8 co-receptors are lineage diverted most likely at the DN stage of thymocyte development before expression of ROR&#x003b3;t sets in, and are thus independent of the DP thymocyte differentiation pathway. This hypothesis is also supported by studies using CD8&#x003b2; deficient mice or mice with a mutant MHC class I molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Crooks1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Killeen1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Although effective depletion of DP thymocytes relies on interaction of CD8&#x003b1;&#x003b2; and the MHC class I molecule, accumulation of HY<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN thymocytes was observed in CD8&#x003b2; deficient mice or in transgenic mice bearing a mutant D<sup>b</sup> molecule, in which substantially large numbers of DP cells escape from deletion. These results suggest that the lineage diversion of HY<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN cells does not require CD8&#x003b1;&#x003b2;/MHC interaction and may take place independently of the DP stage in which the majority of HY<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells are deleted. This conclusion applies to most, but not all, of the CD8&#x003b1;&#x003b1; cells in IEL, especially in male mice. In TCR transgenic mice, these cells are dependent on the premature expression of the transgenic TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2; in DN thymocytes and hence represent an artificially exaggerated population of cells that exists at a very low frequency in normal mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Aifantis1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The few EYFP-labeled CD8&#x003b1;&#x003b1; cells with the transgenic TCR in male HY transgenic mice may be generated through the DP thymocyte stage, similarly to non-transgenic CD8&#x003b1;&#x003b1;TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2; IEL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Yamagata1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. There is, however, a caveat to the assumption that these cells develop through the confrontation with TCR agonist ligands at the DP stage: EYFP-positive CD8&#x003b1;&#x003b1; cells with relatively high levels of the HY transgenic TCR are also found among IEL in female transgenic mice where the HY ligand is not present. However, it cannot be excluded that these cells also express endogenous TCR chains and hence may have encountered TCR agonist ligands intrathymically. The expression of endogenous TCR&#x003b1; chains cannot, however, explain the existence of EYFP-negative CD8&#x003b1;&#x003b1; IEL in female mice, since endogenous TCR&#x003b1; expression at the DN thymocyte stage is a rather rare event. These cells may express CD8&#x003b1; independently of cognate TCR ligands, perhaps facilitated by the gut microenvironment. We also do not completely rule out the possibility that a few EYFP-positive HY<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells or EYFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>TCR&#x003b3;&#x003b4; cells might turn on ROR&#x003b3;t expression in the lamina propria, where some T cells express ROR&#x003b3;t <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Ivanov1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, and then migrate to the epithelium.</p><p>It is of interest to note that all extrathymic T cells in TCR transgenic mice that do not express the transgenic TCR exhibit the same EYFP labeling pattern as extrathymic T cells in WT mice, i.e. the TCR transgenes do not lead to major changes in lymphoid organ structure that prevent normal lymphocyte development.</p><p>In summary these studies suggest that consequences of premature TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2; expression have to be considered when analyzing pathways of lymphocyte subset generation. It had previously been argued that signals from the prematurely expressed TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2; may &#x0201c;fool&#x0201d; DN cells to develop into &#x003b3;&#x003b4; lineage cells, including DN and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in lymph nodes and gut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-vonBoehmer1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The lineage fate mapping studies reported here support this scenario. Our conclusion is further strengthened by our data demonstrating that Sox13 was upregulated in HY<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN thymocytes following premature signals through TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2; instead of pre-TCR, as is by other reports showing that these abnormal cells exhibit profiles of surface marker and cytokine expression, which resemble those of TCR&#x003b3;&#x003b4; cells rather than those of conventional TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2; cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Melichar1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Terrence1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>HY TCR transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001512-Kisielow1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> were either from the colony maintained in the Dana Farber Cancer Institute or purchased from Taconic.
