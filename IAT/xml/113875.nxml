The most versatile and complex repair pathway is nucleotide excision repair (NER), which removes a remarkably wide range of structurally diverse DNA lesions, including UV-induced photoproducts, bulky chemical adducts and intra-strand cross-links (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c1">1</xref>). During eukaryotic evolution the basic &#x02018;cut-and-paste&#x02019; reaction mechanism of NER has been strongly conserved with striking parallels between humans and yeast and, to a lesser degree, even with prokaryotes. Thus, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> uses a set of six proteins (UvrA&#x02013;D, DNA polymerase I and ligase) to eliminate NER lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c3">3</xref> and references therein) while in eukaryotes 25&#x02013;30 proteins are implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c6">6</xref>). Genome-wide lesion detection is carried out by the XPC&#x02013;hHR23B complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c7">7</xref>), probably assisted by the UV-DDB (XPE) dimer for the recognition of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c8">8</xref>). Lesions in the transcribed strand of active genes, that block ongoing transcription, are likely signaled by an elongating RNA polymerase II complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c9">9</xref>). Subsequently, the multi-subunit TFIIH factor, the damage verifier XPA and the single-stranded DNA binding protein trimer RPA are recruited to the site of the lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c12">12</xref>). The bi-directional helicase activity of TFIIH involving the XPB and XPD helicases facilitates formation of a locally opened repair intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c16">16</xref>). A dual single-strand incision is made around the lesion by XPG at the 3&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c17">17</xref>), and the ERCC1&#x02013;XPF complex at the 5&#x02032; site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c18">18</xref>) allowing excision of a 24&#x02013;32mer oligonucleotide containing the damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c19">19</xref>). The last step of gap-filling is accomplished by general replication factors PCNA, RPA, RFC, DNA polymerase &#x003b4; and&#x0002f;or &#x0025b; and ligase sealing the final nick. The efficiency with which DNA injuries are excised is lesion- and location-dependent. Lesions for which the global genome NER is slow (such as CPDs) are preferentially removed when present in the transcribed strand of active genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c21">21</xref>). This points to a direct link between the transcription apparatus and repair. Cells carrying mutations in the <italic>CSA</italic> and <italic>CSB</italic> genes suffer from a selective defect in this transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER) subpathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c24">24</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, deficiencies in NER genes are associated with three distinct genetic disorders: xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS) and trichothiodystrophy (TTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c26">26</xref>). XP is mainly characterized by sun (UV)-hypersensitivity and a strong predisposition to skin cancer. Frequently accelerated neurodegeneration occurs. CS and TTD patients are not particularly cancer-prone but present sun sensitivity, pronounced developmental abnormalities and very severe neurological problems due to neurodysmyelination. The additional hallmarks of TTD include brittle hair and nails and ichthyosis. The heterogeneous spectrum of clinical manifestations present in CS and TTD, but absent in XP, is difficult to attribute to deficiencies in NER which in general are more severe in XP. Since specifically the NER genes implicated in TTD encode subunits of the repair-transcription factor TFIIH and thus have a dual involvement in NER and transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c27">27</xref>), we have proposed that part of the clinical features are the consequence of a viable defect in basal transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c29">29</xref>).</p><p>As the basic reaction of NER is highly conserved in eukaryotes, each yeast NER gene has in general at least one structural human counterpart. In recent years functions in the reaction mechanism have been assigned to all core NER factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c4">4</xref>). However, an additional category of UV-sensitive yeast mutants discloses genes that appear to be involved in NER <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic>, but are partly dispensable for the NER reaction <italic>in vitro</italic>. This class is comprised of <italic>RAD7</italic>, <italic>RAD16</italic>, <italic>RAD23</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c30">30</xref>) and <italic>MMS19</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c31">31</xref>) and is functionally poorly understood. Except for Rad23p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c32">32</xref>) no human homologs are known suggesting that these genes may be less well conserved during eukaryotic evolution. Here we focus on <italic>MMS19</italic>. The <italic>mms19</italic>&#x00394; mutant exhibits a unique phenotype for NER mutants: moderate UV-sensitivity due to a defect affecting both NER subpathways, global genome repair and TC-NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c33">33</xref>), thermosensitive transcriptional activity as well as methionine auxotrophy. Short treatment of a total cell extract at non-permissive temperature leads to a strong reduction of RNA polymerase II transcription activity. Remarkably, the transcription defect can be corrected by addition of purified TFIIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c31">31</xref>) although Mms19p appears not to be a subunit of this repair-transcription factor. Thus, the protein may not be directly involved in these two processes but influence them via TFIIH as an upstream regulatory factor. To examine whether this intriguing factor is conserved in evolution and to permit studies in higher species we have searched for homologs in mammals. Here we report the identification and partial characterization of a presumed human homolog of Mms19p.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Isolation of a cDNA encoding a putative human homolog of yeast <italic>MMS19</italic></title><p>A HeLa poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cDNA library constructed in &#x003bb;gt10 with relatively long inserts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c32">32</xref>) was screened with a probe described below.

A computer translated partial cDNA clone from human placenta (GenBank accession number c18436) attracted our attention because of potentially significant homology with a portion of Mms19p at amino acid positions 216&#x02013;377. To see whether the homology extended, an RT&#x02013;PCR probe was used to screen a HeLa poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cDNA library. The nucleotide sequence of the longest cDNA clone isolated (3.4&#x000a0;kb) showed that it was derived from the expected mRNA (see Materials and Methods for details).</p><p>The sequence predicts a protein of 1030 amino acids (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd640f1">1</xref>A) with a calculated molecular weight of 113 kDa consistent with the observed mobility on SDS&#x02013;PAGE of the <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> translated protein and with the normal gene product in WCE of HeLa cells detected using mono-specific antibodies (data not shown).</p><p>The hMMS19 polypeptide has a very alanine-rich N-terminus and is particularly rich in hydrophobic amino acids (17&#x00025; leucines) with highly hydrophobic regions in the N- and C-terminal parts, containing 18 trimers of hydrophobic residues frequently preceded and&#x0002f;or followed by proline, glutamic acid or histidine. Using a 3D structure prediction program amphiphatic helical wheel-like motifs with one side mainly polar and the opposite side hydrophobic residues were found mostly concentrated in the 360 C-terminal amino acids. Also, a putative nuclear localization signal, KKRXXRK, is present in the C-terminus. No other known motifs were found except for several potential casein kinase II and protein kinase C phosphorylation sites.</p><p>Comparison with yeast Mms19p revealed a striking correspondence in size (1030 versus 1032 amino acids for the human and yeast products, respectively) and highly significant overall homology: 26&#x00025; identity and 51&#x00025; similarity (when aligned with each other). The N- and C-termini are better conserved than the central part (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd640f1">1</xref>A). Leucine-rich motifs in Mms19p as defined by Lauder <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c31">31</xref>) appear poorly conserved. Screening of the complete human ORF against the entire <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> protein database using the BLAST algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c34">34</xref>) identified Mms19p as the by far most homologous protein (p &#x0003d; 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;41</sup>) indicating that within the yeast genome Mms19p is the only counterpart. On the basis of the above and the findings and arguments below we designate the gene as &#x02018;<italic>hMMS19</italic>&#x02019;, although until completion of the human genome sequence it is not excluded that additional human homologs exist defining a gene family. Using the human hMMS19 sequence we identified DNA fragments of various other species allowing a tentative reconstruction of the gene from separate exons for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> compiled in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd640f1">1</xref>A. This enabled the definition of several highly conserved sequence motifs in the N- and C-termini such as DGEKDPRNL and EDLFEVX<sub>2</sub>CYFPIXF (in addition to the putative NLS). However, screening of various databases failed to identify any significant similarity with other proteins that would hint to a function suggesting that these motifs are MMS19-specific. The alignment of the various homologous proteins enabled us to deduce a phylogenetic tree (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd640f1">1</xref>B). The degree of similarity between the different proteins matches well with the overall evolutionary relatedness of the species involved. These findings led us to conclude that in all species there is (at least) one clear homolog of Mms19p.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression pattern and subcellular localization of <italic>hMMS19</italic></title><p>Northern blot analysis revealed a single transcript of 4 kb in various mouse tissues and in human cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd640f2">2</xref>).

ESTs from various databases confirmed that the gene is widely expressed with <italic>hMMS19</italic> mRNA present in skin, placenta, cerebellum, mammary gland, parathyroid gland, myotubes, uterus and at all stages of development (blastocyst, embryo, fetus as well as adult tissues). To detect the protein in cells and on blots and to enable immunoprecipitation experiments we generated monoclonal antibodies. These tools were used to investigate the subcellular localization of hMMS19 protein after transfection of Cos-1 cells with a pcDNA3&#x02013;hMMS19 construct. An anti-hMMS19 monoclonal antibody raised against an N-terminal peptide revealed a clear nuclear localization confirmed by a second antibody raised against the C-terminus (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Chromosomal localization</title><p>To further characterize <italic>hMMS19</italic> and its potential involvement in human disorders, chromosomal localization was carried out. The cDNA encompassing the complete ORF was biotinylated and used as a probe for <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization to human metaphase spreads. A single site of hybridization on the human karyotype was found located on the long arm of chromosome 10 at the junction of q24 and q25 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd640f3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Interspecies complementation</title><p>In order to know whether the human protein is able to complement the yeast defect, an <italic>mms19</italic>&#x00394; strain (MGSC217) in which almost the complete ORF of <italic>MMS19</italic> is replaced by the <italic>URA3</italic> gene, was transformed with the <italic>hMMS19</italic> cDNA subcloned in the yeast expression vector, pYET2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c33">33</xref>). UV-sensitivity, thermosensitivity as well as methionine auxotrophy of this transformed strain were examined. We failed to observe any significant rescue of the cells for any of the defects, although the human protein could be detected as a weak band in the transformed yeast extract by immunoblot analysis using the monoclonal antibodies of above (data not shown). These findings suggest that the human protein has diverged too far from its yeast counterpart to be able to complement the various <italic>mms19</italic>&#x00394; deficiencies.</p></sec><sec><title>hMMS19 associates with TFIIH</title><p>Several observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c33">33</xref>) suggest that Mms19p affects NER and transcription by influencing the activity or stability of TFIIH. How Mms19 exerts this effect is currently unknown. To find out whether hMMS19 affects TFIIH via direct or indirect interactions the different polypeptides present in a fraction of TFIIH purified from HeLa cells were resolved by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and probed with antibodies against hMMS19. The p62 antibody indicated that TFIIH subunits could be easily visualized. We failed to observe detectable quantities of hMMS19 indicating that it is probably not a stable component of TFIIH (data not shown). To investigate the possibility of a weak interaction we performed immunoprecipitation from HeLa WCE using three different monoclonal antibodies raised against hMMS19. Interestingly, in addition to hMMS19 itself the p62 subunit of TFIIH was found to precipitate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd640f4">4</xref>A, lanes&#x000a0;2&#x02013;10). Conversely, monoclonal antibodies against another component of TFIIH, XPD, not only precipitated the p62 subunit of TFIIH but also significant quantities of hMMS19.</p><p>To examine whether hMMS19 interacts with TFIIH directly or via a partner protein we infected <italic>Sf9</italic> insect cells with recombinant baculoviruses containing the cDNAs of all nine TFIIH subunits as well as <italic>hMMS19</italic> to produce recombinant TFIIH and hMMS19 proteins as described by Tirode <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c38">38</xref>). Immunoprecipitation of lysates of the infected <italic>Sf9</italic> cells revealed that hMMS19 coprecipitated specifically with TFIIH (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd640f4">4</xref>B: compare lanes 6 and 7 with lanes 8 and 9) and vice versa (lanes 2&#x02013;5). This interaction is highly significant as it was resistant to stringent washing conditions (250 mM salt buffer containing 0.1&#x00025; Nonidet P-40). These observations strongly suggest that hMMS19 interacts physically with TFIIH.</p><p>To determine whether the physical interaction between hMMS19 and TFIIH has functional implications the reaction mixture of an <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted transcription assay was supplemented with the recombinant hMMS19&#x02013;TFIIH complex. We observed a similar transcriptional activity in the presence and in the absence of hMMS19 in the transcription assay (data not shown). Therefore, in spite of its physical interaction with TFIIH, hMMS19 neither up- nor downregulates the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcriptional activity of TFIIH. Perhaps other factors are required in addition to hMMS19, or the effect of the protein is not visible in the <italic>in vitro</italic> system, that reflects only part of the <italic>in vivo</italic> complexity.</p></sec><sec><title>hMMS19 interacts via the XPB and XPD subunits with TFIIH</title><p>TFIIH is comprised of two subcomplexes: core TFIIH&#x02013;XPD containing XPB, p62, p52, p44, p34 and less tightly associated XPD, and the CAK complex consisting of cdk7, cyclin H and Mat1. To determine which subcomplex interacts with hMMS19, immunoprecipitations were performed with extracts of <italic>Sf9</italic> cells simultaneously expressing either hMMS19 together with the six core subunits of TFIIH or hMMS19 together with the three CAK subunits. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd640f4">4</xref>C shows that hMMS19 interacts with core TFIIH&#x02013;XPD but not with the CAK complex (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd640f4">4</xref>C, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3&#x02013;5).</p><p>To establish which core subunit was responsible for the interaction, <italic>Sf9</italic> cells were infected with hMMS19 baculovirus in combination with each individual core TFIIH subunit. Immunoprecipitation using antibodies specific for the corresponding TFIIH component demonstrates that hMMS19 specifically coprecipitated with XPB and XPD and to a lesser extent with the p34 subunit (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd640f4">4</xref>D, lanes 1, 3 and 11). hMMS19 did not coprecipitate with any of the three other core subunits nor with GST alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd640f4">4</xref>D, lanes 5, 7 and 9). Conversely, anti hMMS19 antibodies coprecipitated XPB and XPD as well as trace amounts of p52 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd640f4">4</xref>E, lanes 1 and 2). Taken together these data indicate that, in contrast to what is reported in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c31">31</xref>), hMMS19 interacts with TFIIH as detected in WCE using natural expression conditions. Interaction specifically involves the XPB and XPD helicases establishing a direct link between hMMS19 and these NER&#x0002f;transcription factors. In agreement with the absence of an effect on the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription function of TFIIH we failed to find a significant effect of the addition of hMMS19 on the <italic>in vitro</italic> helicase activity of both XPD and XPB (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Phenotypic characterization of UV-sensitive <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> mutants revealed the existence of a large number of genes involved in NER, collectively assigned to the <italic>RAD3</italic> epistasis group. Similarly, studies on three human genetic disorders, XP, CS, TTD and a series of UV-sensitive Chinese hamster mutants uncovered a large set of mammalian NER factors. Analysis of the genes highlighted the structural and functional conservation of the core of the NER machinery from yeast to mammals. Here we report the isolation of a unique human cDNA, the deduced protein sequence of which shows a clear overall co-linear homology and similarity in size with Mms19p. <italic>MMS19</italic> is the only gene in the entire yeast genome that exhibits such a highly significant homology with the human cDNA we have isolated.</p><p>The ubiquitous expression, the elevated mRNA level in testis as well as the nuclear localization of the protein and the interaction with NER transcription factor TFIIH are entirely consistent with a function in DNA repair and transcription. Taken together these findings strongly support the idea that the isolated cDNA reflects the human homolog of yeast <italic>MMS19</italic>.</p><p><italic>hMMS19</italic> was localized to chromosome 10q24&#x02013;25, a region with a relatively high density of genes but where no genetic disorders with significance in relation to <italic>hMMS19</italic> have been assigned.</p><p>Despite extensive efforts we failed to find significant complementation of the yeast mutant by the human gene although expression of the human protein could be detected. These negative findings are consistent with the notion that only few human NER genes have been reported to correct (part of) the corresponding yeast mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c42">42</xref>).</p><p>The function of Mms19 in transcription and NER has been enigmatic in view of the very pleiotropic phenotype of the mutant. This includes temperature sensitivity and methionine auxotrophy, and a partial defect in NER reflected by an intermediate UV sensitivity. Remarkably, the compromised repair function affects both NER subpathways global genome repair as well as transcription-coupled repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c33">33</xref>). On the other hand, the connections with TFIIH are multiple. Extracts of <italic>mms19</italic>&#x00394; mutants exhibit a temperature-sensitive transcription defect that can be corrected by addition of purified TFIIH, but not by purified Mms19p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c31">31</xref>). The status of TFIIH in the treated extract was not determined. The NER defect present in cell-free extracts prepared from an <italic>mms19</italic>&#x00394; mutant can be complemented <italic>in vitro</italic> by mixing with extracts of other non-TFIIH NER mutants (e.g. by <italic>rad4</italic>), but not by a TFIIH NER mutant (e.g. <italic>rad3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c33">33</xref>). However, a direct interaction between Mms19 and TFIIH was not demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c31">31</xref>). Importantly, here we identify a physical association between hMMS19 and the two helicase subunits of TFIIH, XPB and XPD. These two proteins have a direct engagement in NER as well as in basal transcription initiation. The binding of Mms19 apparently has important biological consequences as in its absence the complex becomes functionally unstable and cannot optimally exert its role in NER. Similar to the p44 subunit of TFIIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c44">44</xref>), hMMS19 interacts with both helicases. In addition to the fundamental role of p44 in maintaining the architecture of TFIIH holo-complex by anchoring the CAK&#x02013;XPD subcomplex to the five subunit TFIIH core, p44 acts as a regulator of the XPD helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c45">45</xref>). Since no separate subcomplex of TFIIH containing both helicases has been reported <italic>in vivo</italic> so far, the binding of hMMS19 to both helicases probably occurs within the context of the holo-complex, as p44, through two distinct domains. The effect of the binding of hMMS19 to both TFIIH helicases is different to that of p44 since we failed to find a direct influence of hMMS19 on the helicase as well as the transcriptional activity of TFIIH <italic>in vitro</italic>. hMMS19 might therefore participate in the stabilisation of TFIIH upstream of the transcription process or may exert its effect only in the more complex <italic>in vivo</italic> context.</p><p>In favor of a possible <italic>in vivo</italic> function of hMMS19 in stabilization of TFIIH it is worth noting that we have recently obtained evidence that in all cases of TTD the overall levels of TFIIH are substantially reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c45">45</xref>). Thus, instability of TFIIH occurs <italic>in vivo</italic> adding a clinical dimension to the potential hMMS19 function towards the severe symptoms of this pleiotropic human NER&#x0002f;transcription disorder which is associated with TFIIH defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c26">26</xref>). The above intricate link with TFIIH prompted us to investigate whether this protein is implicated in TTD. One genetic form of this syndrome is not due to mutations in the <italic>XPB</italic> or <italic>XPD</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c26">26</xref>) nor to alterations in any of the other TFIIH core subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c45">45</xref>). This is complementation group TTD-A, which was originally represented by a single case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c46">46</xref>). We searched for abnormalities in <italic>hMMS19</italic> but no obvious ORF mutations could be detected in fibroblasts of this patient, nor did we find correction of the TTD-A NER defect upon microinjection of <italic>hMMS19</italic> cDNA. Nevertheless, the existence of a class of genes that, like <italic>hMMS19</italic>, directly interacts with TFIIH and affects its functioning in repair and transcription provides a plausible source for mutations causing TTD-like syndromes, a number of which have been described in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd640c26">26</xref> and references therein).</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd640f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> (<bold>A</bold>, opposite) Comparison of amino acid sequences of the human hMMS19 with its yeast counterpart and homologous translated ESTs of different species.
