We found that, although all expanded Tregs showed suppressive functions <italic>in vitro</italic>, only p524 (GAD524&#x02013;538)-expanded CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells inhibited diabetes development in the co-transfer models, while p509 (GAD509&#x02013;528)- or p530 (GAD530&#x02013;543)-expanded CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells had no such effects. Using computer-guided molecular modeling and docking methods, the differences in structural characteristics of these epitopes and the interaction mode (including binding energy and identified domains in the epitopes) between the above-mentioned epitopes and MHC class II I-A<sup>g7</sup> were analyzed. The theoretical results showed that the epitope p524, which induced protective Tregs, possessed negative surface-electrostatic potential and bound two chains of MHC class II I-A<sup>g7</sup>, while the epitopes p509 and p530 which had no such ability exhibited positive surface-electrostatic potential and bound one chain of I-A<sup>g7</sup>. Furthermore, p524 bound to I-A<sup>g7</sup> more stably than p509 and p530. Of importance, we hypothesized and subsequently confirmed experimentally that the epitope (GAD570&#x02013;585, p570), which displayed similar characteristics to p524, was a protective epitope by showing that p570-expanded CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells suppressed the onset of diabetes in NOD mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>These data suggest that molecular modeling-based structural analysis of epitopes may be an instrumental tool for prediction of protective epitopes to expand functional Tregs.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), consisting of 585 amino acids, has been shown to be the first of several &#x003b2; cell antigens to be recognized by T cells from nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice and patients with type 1 diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007034-Kaufman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007034-Ellis1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Its importance in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes is indicated by the following evidence: 1. T cell responses against GAD65 can be detected in young NOD mice and in humans at risk of type 1 diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007034-Tisch1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007034-Atkinson1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>; 2. &#x003b2; cell-specific suppression of GAD65 expression in antisense GAD65 transgenic NOD mice leads to complete prevention of type 1 diabetes and blocks the generation of diabetogenic T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007034-Yoon1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings suggest that modulation of GAD65 autoimmunity can influence the development of type 1 diabetes in NOD mice.</p><p>It is known that GAD65 contains dozens of epitopes which are specifically recognized by T cells as peptide epitope-MHC complexes on the surface of target cells thereby directing T cell function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007034-DiLorenzo1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, pretreatment of prediabetic NOD mice with GAD65 or some of its peptide epitopes efficiently delays the onset of type 1 diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007034-Tian1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Strikingly, Quinn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007034-Quinn1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> found the presence of two kinds of epitopes (named as effector and regulatory or protective epitopes) in GAD65 which were completely different in their mediation of T cell function and the pathogenesis of diabetes. Although many factors such as the mature state of antigen processing cells (APC) contribute to determining whether an epitope is an effector or regulatory epitope, the physical-chemical properties of epitopes may have important effects on their function. Differential structural properties of epitopes probably lead to divergent conformation of MHC class II molecules bound to the corresponding epitopes and ultimately to differential T cell functional activation. Peptide epitope immunization in NOD mice is associated with the induction of Tregs that secrete IL-10 and/or transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007034-Tisch2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007034-Chen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the efficiency of this strategy requires further improvement.

The data presented in this study indicate that this failure to inhibit transfer of diabetes may be attributed to the differential cytokine profiles of expanded CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. P524-expanded CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells produced higher levels of IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2; than those expanded by p509 or p530 stimulation.

In addition, differences between epitope-expanded CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in terms of migration to or re-activation in the draining lymph nodes also need consideration. Tang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007034-Tang1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> proposed that <italic>ex vivo</italic>-expanded BDC2.5-specific Tregs underwent significant proliferation after transfer into NOD mice.

Although experimental structure determination methods are providing high-resolution structure information about a subset of the proteins, computational structure predictions will provide valuable information for the large fraction of sequences whose structures will not be determined experimentally.</p><p>Recently, studies have indicated that the biological functions of the peptide-major histocompatible complex (MHC) depend on the structural property of the peptide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007034-Deng1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007034-Nicholson1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we focused on the correlation of epitope structural properties with their functions in expanding therapeutic Tregs. Quinn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007034-Quinn1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> carried out experiments on peptide epitope immunization and showed that GAD524&#x02013;543 consisted of at least two I-A<sup>g7</sup>-restricted determinants (p524 and p530, GAD530&#x02013;543), with apparently distinct properties. P524-specific T cells dominate the protective response after immunization with GAD524&#x02013;543, while CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells arise spontaneously in young NOD mice in response to a dominant determinant found within p530. Consistent with this we have shown a difference in structural properties between p524 and p530 using molecular modeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007034-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref><bold> and </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007034-g007"><bold>7</bold></xref>). This difference may influences the conformation of MHC class II I-A<sup>g7</sup> in NOD mice when bound to the corresponding peptide epitopes, as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007034-Arneson1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>To address this issue, the patterns of p524, p530, p509 bound to I-A<sup>g7</sup> were determined by molecular modeling using the structural framework of GAD peptide p207 (GAD207&#x02013;220) bound to I-A<sup>g7</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007034-Corper1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. The structural properties and binding pattern to I-A<sup>g7</sup> of another defined protective GAD peptide epitope, p286 (GAD286&#x02013;300) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007034-Tarbell3">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, used here as a positive control, were also analysed. We found that the secondary structures of p524 and p286 were alpha-helices and stable, while peptides p509 and p530 were coiled and very flexible. The 3-D structure of I-A<sup>g7</sup> in complex with peptides p509, p524, p530 and p286 revealed two kinds of binding mode; the binding mode of I-A<sup>g7</sup> to p524 and p286 was similar, but markedly different from its binding mode with p509 and p530 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007034-g008"><bold>Figure 8</bold></xref>). Overall, our data strongly suggest that protective peptide epitopes p524 and p286, binding to I-A<sup>g7</sup>, could form a unique conformation on the surface of APCs, allowing for the induction of Tregs.</p><p>To support this premise we analyzed another epitope p570, which is very similar to p524 in sequence tendency, surface electrostatic potential and interaction mode with I-A<sup>g7</sup>. Similar structural properties and binding patterns of p570 to I-A<sup>g7</sup>, to those of p524 or p286 were revealed in this analysis. The fact that p570 stimulation facilitated induction of IL-10/TGF-&#x003b2;-secreting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells indicates that p570 is a protective epitope. Therefore, while further comprehensive study is required, our present data highlight that computer modeling-based T cell-epitope study is a promising tool for function prediction of many autoimmune-related epitopes. We are currently analyzing the epitopes of another two critical autoimmune diabetes-related autoantigens (i.e. insulin and IA-2) using molecular modeling.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first report of molecular modeling-based analysis of T cell epitope function and prediction. Classical approaches, such as use of 15-mer overlapping synthetic peptides, are costly and time-consuming. With the help of molecular modeling, it will become possible to carry out large-scale screening of antigen/peptide targets, providing valuable structural information as well as predicting potential epitopes and their functions. Interestingly, to date, several of the GAD-specific clones isolated have been found to be pathogenic and quite a few are non-pathogenic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007034-Zekzer1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007034-Severe1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Accumulating evidence indicates that many GAD-specific responses may be protective and not diabetogenic. As a result, it is reasonable that GAD should be used preferentially as an immunogen to induce protective effects or to abrogate aggressive autoimmunity. The present study proposes two important regulatory epitopes (p524 and p570) in the region of GAD<sub>500&#x02013;585</sub> for expanding functional Tregs. These findings may be helpful for the design of autoimmune-related autoantigen epitopes for immune intervention and achievement of therapeutic epitope-specific Tregs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We
