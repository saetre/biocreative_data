However, we demonstrate here that regulatory sequences whose binding sites have been almost completely rearranged can still produce identical outputs. We sequenced the <italic>even</italic>-<italic>skipped</italic> locus from six species of scavenger flies (Sepsidae) that are highly diverged from the model species <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, but share its basic patterns of developmental gene expression. Although there is little sequence similarity between the sepsid <italic>eve</italic> enhancers and their well-characterized <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> counterparts, the sepsid and <italic>Drosophila</italic> enhancers drive nearly identical expression patterns in transgenic <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryos. We conclude that the molecular machinery that connects regulatory sequences to the transcription apparatus is more flexible than previously appreciated. In exploring this diverse collection of sequences to identify the shared features that account for their similar functions, we found a small number of short (20&#x02013;30 bp) sequences nearly perfectly conserved among the species. These highly conserved sequences are strongly enriched for pairs of overlapping or adjacent binding sites. Together, these observations suggest that the local arrangement of binding sites relative to each other is more important than their overall arrangement into larger units of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory function.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The transformation of a fertilized egg into a complex, multicellular organism is a carefully choreographed process in which thousands of genes are turned on and off in specific spatial and temporal patterns that confer distinct physical properties and behaviors on emerging cells and tissues. To understand how an organism's genome specifies its form and function, it is therefore necessary to understand how patterns of gene expression are encoded in DNA. Decades of analysis of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> have identified numerous regulatory sequences, but have not fully illuminated how they work. Here we harness the record of natural selection to probe the function of these sequences. We identified regulatory sequences from scavenger fly species that diverged from <italic>Drosophila</italic> over 100 million years ago. While these regulatory sequences are almost completely different from their <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterparts, they drive identical expression patterns in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, demonstrating extreme flexibility in the molecular machines that interpret regulatory DNA. Yet, the identical outputs produced by these sequences mean they must have something in common, and we describe one shared feature of regulatory sequence organization and function that has emerged from these comparisons. Our approach can be generalized to any regulatory system and species, and we believe that a growing collection of regulatory sequences with dissimilar sequences but similar outputs will reveal the molecular logic of gene regulation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent studies revealing how the gain, loss and repositioning of transcription factor binding sites within regulatory sequences can alter gene expression with observable phenotypic consequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000106-Wray1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> have focused efforts to understand the molecular basis for organismal diversity on the evolution of regulatory DNA.

But precisely because many of these changes do not affect regulatory output, they provide a powerful opportunity to understand how the arrangement of transcription factor binding sites in a regulatory sequence determines its output. We believe that identifying divergent enhancers that drive similar patterns of expression, and distilling the common principles that unite them, will allow us to decipher the molecular logic of gene regulation.</p><p>We began to explore the effectiveness of this approach with the extensively studied regulatory systems of the early <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000106-Gallo1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, using the recently sequenced genomes of 12 <italic>Drosophila</italic> species to document the evolutionary fate of transcription factor binding sites in early embryonic enhancers (Peterson, Hare, Iyer, Eisen, unpublished). A consistent pattern emerged: while binding site turnover is common, a large fraction of the binding sites in most enhancers are conserved across the genus (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000106-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen-1000106-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000106.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Binding site conservation and turnover in <italic>Drosophila even-skipped</italic> stripe 2 enhancer.</title><p>Predicted binding sites for the five factors known to regulate expression from the <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 enhancer in the twelve sequenced <italic>Drosophila</italic> species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000106-Clark1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>.

Perhaps the conserved sites were an imperturbable core essential for each enhancer's function. Or, perhaps, there had simply not been enough time since the divergence of the genus for mutation to have generated alternative configurations that would produce identical expression patterns. To resolve this ambiguity it was necessary to reconstruct binding site turnover events that occurred over longer evolutionary timescales by comparing <italic>Drosophila</italic> enhancers to their counterparts in species from outside the genus. The appropriate species for such comparisons would share basic patterning mechanisms with <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, but be sufficiently diverged from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to provide significant additional data on the constraints on binding site turnover.

Furthermore, in their comparisons the majority of binding sites were conserved, while our species sample has very few conserved binding sites. We have also generalized their observation to include additional enhancers responding to a different suite of transcription factors, including one (the MHE) active following gastrulation. Previous reports of the functional equivalence of divergent enhancers in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have involved blastoderm enhancers, leaving open the possibility that the observed binding site turnover was a byproduct of the syncitial nature of the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo.

One remarkable aspect of enhancer evolution is that despite the clearly frequent repositioning or replacement of transcription factor binding sites within enhancers, the enhancers themselves remain fairly compact. There must, therefore, be selection to keep the different sub-elements that contribute to an enhancer's output within the one to two kilobase span of a typical enhancer. This spatial constraint implies some functional interaction between enhancer sub-elements not currently captured by the billboard model.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>The Importance of Paired Sites in Gene Regulation</title><p>Given the extent of non-coding divergence between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and sepsids across most non-coding DNA, we were surprised to observe small islands of very strong sequence conservation.

Under the generally accepted model of binding site turnover, sites are lost in one region of an enhancer when new mutations create a complementary site elsewhere in the same enhancer. The appearance of new sites is the rate-limiting step as there are more mutational steps required to create a new site from random sequence than to destroy an existing site. Since random mutations are far less likely to produce pairs of adjacent sites than single sites, we expect functionally linked pairs of sites to be subject to far lower rates of binding site turnover. In contrast, if binding site turnover is driven by base substitutions, we expect functionally independent sites that are adjacent or even partially overlapping to have essentially the same rates of binding site turnover as isolated sites. The conserved blocks we observed between sepsids and <italic>Drosophila</italic> were generally larger than individual sites, as has been previously reported within <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000106-Bergman2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, consistent with the former model.

Taking this into account, we expect to observe reduced turnover in even functionally independent binding sites if they are overlapping or adjacent, as some fraction of the deletions that would remove a binding site with a complementary site elsewhere would also affect adjacent, and presumably uncompensated sites. These deletions would be subject to purifying selection, and the rate of turnover for the proximal sites would be reduced. Assessing whether such an effect could explain our observation requires more data on relative rates of nucleotide substitution and insertion and deletions of different sizes in sepsids, which will be accomplished with the sequencing of sepsid genomes.</p><p>We can, however, test the significance of our observation directly. The linked function model predicts that the paired binding sites we observe to be conserved between families should be more sensitive to manipulations that alter the spacing between the sites than paired binding sites that are not conserved.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Variation in <italic>eve</italic> Stripe Patterns</title><p>Though expression of the sepsid <italic>eve</italic> enhancers in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryos is qualitatively very similar to the patterns driven by the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> enhancers, there are subtle and interesting differences.

Finally, for each <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> site, the nearest aligned bases in each other species (plus/minus 5 bp for alignment error) were evaluated for presence of a binding site for the same factor. Three clades of increasing evolutionary distance were considered: &#x0201c;minimal&#x0201d; (<italic>melanogaster</italic> subgroup), &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; (all sequenced <italic>Drosophila</italic>), or &#x0201c;extreme&#x0201d; (12 <italic>Drosophila</italic> and 6 Sepsids). A given site in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> was categorized by the largest clade in which it is conserved, where conservation is defined as presence in at least 80&#x00025; of the species in that group (4/5 in subgroup, 10/12 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, 15/18 in all species considered here). Thus, each binding site in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is categorized both by proximity to other binding sites in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, and by evolutionary stability across increasingly divergent species groups.

Binding site predictions for each enhancer, as calculated above, were plotted in alignment position coordinates for each enhancer described here. Alignment position coordinates for binding site matches that overlapped a gap (in the species in which the site was predicted) were plotted at the midpoint of the gap. P-value cutoffs above which to plot glyphs for each factor were chosen independently from among predictions over the range described above (ln(p-value) between &#x02212;5 and &#x02212;7 in steps of 0.5) in order to maximize concordance with known DNase I footprinted binding sites in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> sequence for each enhancer.
