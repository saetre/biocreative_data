In eukaryotic cells, various translation inhibition and mRNA degradation mechanisms congregate in cytoplasmic processing bodies (P bodies). The P body protein Dhh1 inhibits translation and promotes decapping-mediated mRNA decay together with Pat1 in yeast, and has been implicated in mRNA storage in metazoan oocytes. Here, we have investigated in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> whether Dhh1 and Pat1 generally function together, and how they influence mRNA sequestration during oogenesis. We show that in somatic tissues, the Dhh1 orthologue (CGH-1) forms Pat1 (<italic>patr-1)</italic>-dependent P bodies that are involved in mRNA decapping. In contrast, during oogenesis, CGH-1 forms <italic>patr-1</italic>&#x02013;independent mRNA storage bodies. CGH-1 then associates with translational regulators and a specific set of maternal mRNAs, and prevents those mRNAs from being degraded. Our results identify somatic and germ cell CGH-1 functions that are distinguished by the involvement of PATR-1, and reveal that during oogenesis, numerous translationally regulated mRNAs are specifically protected by a CGH-1&#x02013;dependent mechanism.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>P.R.

In a dramatic example of this regulation, developing oocytes produce thousands of different mRNAs that must be maintained in a translationally silent state in order to prevent premature differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnstone and Lasko, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciosk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Richter, 2007</xref>). Many of these mRNAs are provided to the embryo maternally and then destroyed during the transition to zygotic gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schier, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stitzel and Seydoux, 2007</xref>). Much has been learned about how specific mRNA-binding proteins control translation of individual maternal mRNAs in oocytes and early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lipshitz and Smibert, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wickens et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Richter, 2007</xref>). However, less is understood about how these mRNAs are influenced by mechanisms that affect mRNA translation or turnover on a broader scale.</p><p>Various mechanisms that repress translation or degrade mRNAs are concentrated in cytoplasmic structures known as processing bodies (P bodies; also referred to as GW or Dcp bodies; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson and Kedersha, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eulalio et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parker and Sheth, 2007</xref>). These mechanisms include decapping- and nonsense-mediated mRNA degradation, as well as translational silencing and mRNA degradation directed by small RNAs. P bodies are defined by a set of &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; proteins that are involved in decapping-dependent decay, a process in which the protective 5&#x02032; cap is removed from a deadenylated mRNA, thereby exposing it to 5&#x02032;-to-3&#x02032; degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parker and Sheth, 2007</xref>). These core P body proteins, as described in yeast, include the decapping enzyme subunits Dcp1 and Dcp2 and a set of accessory proteins that form a decapping complex on mRNAs. Among these decapping accessory proteins are the Pat1 protein and the DEAD box RNA helicase Dhh1, which inhibit translation competitively and promote decapping complex assembly and P body formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pilkington and Parker, 2007</xref>). If decapping is prevented, this mechanism can maintain mRNAs in a translationally arrested state, providing a model for how silenced mRNAs might be sequestered in potentially any cell type. Evidence from human and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> cell lines indicates that the Dhh1 orthologue is important for microRNA (miRNA)-induced translational silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chu and Rana, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eulalio et al., 2007c</xref>), which suggests that this inhibitory mechanism might be involved in posttranscriptional regulation in many contexts.</p><p>In developing oocytes, early embryos, and neurons, the Dhh1 orthologue and other core P body proteins are found in RNA&#x02013;protein (RNP) granules that are proposed to correspond to mRNA storage particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Navarro et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coller and Parker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eulalio et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parker and Sheth, 2007</xref>). During <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> oogenesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), Dhh1 (CGH-1) colocalizes with the P body protein CAR-1 in RNP particles that accumulate in the syncytial gonad cytoplasm in parallel to newly synthesized mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Navarro et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boag et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lall et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jud et al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, translational silencing of some oocyte mRNAs depends upon the Dhh1 orthologue Me31B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakamura et al., 2001</xref>). In these and other metazoans, the Dhh1 helicase is found in a germ line RNP complex that includes CAR-1 and Y-box proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wilhelm et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakamura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Minshall and Standart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weston and Sommerville, 2006</xref>). In early biochemical studies of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes, it was proposed that this set of proteins &#x0201c;masks&#x0201d; mRNAs to prevent their translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Richter and Smith, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weston and Sommerville, 2006</xref>). It is still unknown whether the Dhh1 helicase associates with metazoan maternal mRNAs broadly or specifically, and how in general it influences their regulation in vivo. It has also not been determined whether the putative oocyte mRNA storage particles that are defined by this helicase correspond simply to a form of P body in which mRNA degradation has been blocked, or a different type of structure.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>A <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodite gonad, illustrating models discussed in the text.</bold> Germ cells develop in an &#x0201c;assembly line&#x0201d; fashion from stem cells that are regulated by the somatic distal tip cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hubbard and Greenstein, 2005</xref>). Each of two gonad arms produces sperm during the fourth larval stage, then oocytes during adulthood. Germ cells initially share a common cytoplasm, which flows as shown by arrows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wolke et al., 2007</xref>). Transcription increases sharply upon progression through the transition zone and entry into meiosis I. As new mRNAs move into the syncytial gonad core, some appear to pass through germ (P) granules (inset, green), which are located just outside of most nuclear pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pitt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schisa et al., 2001</xref>). CGH-1 associates with and protects particular translationally regulated maternal mRNAs in the context of storage bodies, which may be assembled on germ (P) granules (inset). Oocytes enlarge and become cellularized in the proximal region, and fertilization occurs in the spermatheca. Transcription ceases as oocytes enter diakinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Walker et al., 2007</xref>). Further development depends upon translationally regulated maternal gene products until embryonic transcription begins at the four-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Seydoux and Dunn, 1997</xref>). CGH-1 then associates with PATR-1 in <italic>patr-1</italic>&#x02013;dependent somatic P bodies (red dots).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1820543f01"></graphic></fig><table-wrap

The embryonic distribution of CGH-1 is remarkably similar to that of a large group of maternal mRNAs (class II mRNAs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Seydoux and Fire, 1994</xref>), which is consistent with the idea that CGH-1 might associate with maternal mRNAs.</p><p>Here, we have used genetics and biochemistry to investigate how core P body mechanisms contribute to oogenesis and maternal mRNA storage in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We show that in somatic tissues, CGH-1 forms Pat1 (<italic>patr-1</italic>)-dependent P bodies that are associated with decapping-dependent mRNA decay. In contrast, in developing oocytes, <italic>patr-1</italic> is not required for formation of CGH-1 RNP particles, which we refer to as storage bodies. During oogenesis, CGH-1 associates primarily with a set of translation regulators, and a large but specific set of translationally regulated maternal mRNAs. Surprisingly, CGH-1 is then required to protect these particular mRNAs from degradation. Our findings identify three distinct structures that contain CGH-1 (germ [P] granules, storage bodies, and somatic P bodies), and, for the first time, demonstrate tissue-specific and Pat1-independent functions for this core P body helicase. They also reveal that many maternal mRNAs are regulated not only by interactions with individual RNA-binding proteins that control their translation, but also by a CGH-1&#x02013;dependent protective mechanism.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Somatic but not germ line CGH-1 particles correspond to decapping-associated P bodies</title><p>We first investigated whether the CGH-1 particles that are present during oogenesis are assembled by the same mechanism as &#x0201c;typical&#x0201d; P bodies, and whether such structures are present in <italic>C. elegans</italic> tissues. P bodies are dynamic structures that accumulate in proportion to their steady-state supply of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parker and Sheth, 2007</xref>). If Pat1 or Dhh1 (CGH-1) is lacking, entry of mRNA into the decapping pathway is inefficient and P bodies are extremely small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sheth and Parker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eulalio et al., 2007b</xref>). In contrast, P bodies accumulate mRNA and become large if mRNA decapping is prevented. This paradigm is now well established in yeast and mammalian cells. As CGH-1 is a core P body component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parker and Sheth, 2007</xref>), it is possible to detect <italic>C. elegans</italic> P bodies that are involved in decapping-dependent decay by identifying CGH-1 particles that are smaller when PATR-1 (Pat1) is lacking, and larger when decapping-dependent degradation is blocked.</p><p>We performed these analyses using RNAi against <italic>patr-1</italic> and decapping-associated genes, and by examining previously uncharacterized predicted null mutations in <italic>patr-1</italic> and <italic>dcap-2</italic>, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologue of <italic>Dcp2</italic> (decapping enzyme catalytic subunit; Fig. S1, A&#x02013;C; and Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801183/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801183/DC1</ext-link>). <italic>dcap-2</italic>(<italic>tm2470</italic>) homozygotes produce fertile offspring, though in reduced numbers, which makes it possible to examine the consequences of an absence of mRNA decapping in animals of any stage.

In wild-type (WT) hermaphrodites, in the mitotic precursors at the distal gonad end, CGH-1 and CAR-1 are apparent on germ (P) granules around the nuclear periphery (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Navarro et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boag et al., 2005</xref>). As germ cells enter meiosis, CGH-1 and CAR-1 together form particles that accumulate within the syncytial gonad core and lack characteristic germ (P) granule proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801183/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801183/DC1</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Navarro et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boag et al., 2005</xref>). Strikingly, this distribution of CGH-1 and CAR-1 was not detectably altered by lack of either PATR-1 or DCAP-2 (Fig. S2 A), which suggests that these structures are formed differently from &#x0201c;standard&#x0201d; P bodies. We will refer to the CGH-1/CAR-1 particles that are seen in the gonad core as storage bodies because of this distinction, and because we have found that CGH-1 protects many oocyte mRNAs from degradation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>; see subsequent paragraphs).</p><p>Our failure to identify PATR-1&#x02013;dependent CGH-1 particles in the germ line made it important to investigate whether such structures might be present in <italic>C. elegans</italic> somatic tissues. In the embryo, CGH-1 staining overlaps with CAR-1, DCAP-2, and its cofactor DCAP-1, as predicted for P bodies (unpublished data; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audhya et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boag et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Squirrell et al., 2006</xref>). In somatic precursors, CGH-1 particles become increasingly less prominent after the four-cell stage in the WT but were far more prevalent at later stages after RNAi of <italic>dcap-1</italic> and <italic>dcap-2</italic> (<italic>dcap-1/-2[RNAi]</italic>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).

In striking contrast, after the four-cell stage, CGH-1 foci were far less prevalent in <italic>patr-1(RNAi)</italic> and <italic>patr-1(tm2402)</italic> embryos than in WT so that by the 100-cell stage, <italic>patr-1(RNAi)</italic> embryos contained 12-fold fewer CGH-1 foci (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B&#x02013;D</xref>). In somatic embryonic cells, CAR-1 antibody staining was affected similarly by <italic>dcap-1/-2</italic> and <italic>patr-1</italic>RNAi (unpublished data), as was a rescuing transgenic fusion protein in which CGH-1 is linked to GFP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). During postembryonic stages in WT animals, antibody staining detects CGH-1 and CAR-1 only in germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Navarro et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boag et al., 2005</xref>).

We conclude that these somatic CGH-1 foci, which we will refer to as somatic P bodies, may represent sites of decapping-mediated mRNA turnover.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Somatic embryonic CGH-1 foci have characteristics of decapping-associated P bodies.</bold> (A) Embryonic founder cells.

In the embryo, PATR-1(N) staining was diffuse and barely detectible through the two-cell stage.

In WT adults, the bulk of CGH-1 protein is found in germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boag et al., 2005</xref>). When we previously immunoprecipitated endogenous CGH-1 from adult extracts, we detected interactions between CGH-1 and CAR-1, Y-box proteins, and two prominent proteins of &#x0223c;75 and &#x0223c;70 kD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boag et al., 2005</xref>). Through mass spectroscopy, we have now identified those last two proteins as ATX-2 (ataxin 2) and PAB-1 (poly-A&#x02013;binding protein [PABP]), respectively. ATX-2 and PAB-1 are RNA-binding proteins that are involved in translational regulation, and PABP protects mRNAs from deadenylation and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mangus et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciosk et al., 2004</xref>). These two proteins interact with CGH-1 orthologues and each other in multiple species, but neither is typically found in P bodies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mangus et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciosk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ralser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wilhelm et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nonhoff et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Kedersha, 2008</xref>). We could detect PATR-1 in CGH-1 immunoprecipitates (IPs) by Western blotting (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>), which is consistent with evidence that this helicase interacts with Pat1 in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ho et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krogan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eulalio et al., 2007b</xref>). Neither actin nor the P body protein LSM-2 were similarly detectable in these CGH-1 IPs (unpublished data), which indicates that the interaction between CGH-1 and PATR-1 is specific. However, our CGH-1 IP/mass spectrometry analyses did not identify PATR-1, decapping enzyme subunits, or other core P body components among the prominent protein species that interact with CGH-1 in adults (unpublished data; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boag et al., 2005</xref>).

We performed these IPs using extracts that were prepared from intact 1-d-old adults in a way that excluded embryos so that they were enriched for CGH-1 that is expressed in adult germ cells. We then identified mRNAs that were on average at least threefold overrepresented in CGH-1 IPs relative to IgG controls because we expected that this arbitrarily defined level would identify specific interactions.

Significantly, however, nearly all of the mRNAs that were enriched in our CGH-1 IPs are known to be expressed primarily in germ cells and to be provided to embryos as maternally supplied mRNA. Of the 305 CGH-1&#x02013;associated mRNAs for which expression patterns have been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reinke et al., 2004</xref>), 92% (282) are expressed mainly in the hermaphrodite gonad and not during spermatogenesis, which indicates that they are produced during oogenesis. In addition, most CGH-1&#x02013;associated mRNAs (85%) have been classified as maternal mRNAs (present in embryos before the onset of zygotic transcription), and 52% have expression profiles consistent with class II maternal mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baugh et al., 2003</xref>). These CGH-1&#x02013;associated mRNAs correspond to a significant but restricted fraction of the &#x0223c;6,000 genes that are expressed in the hermaphrodite gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baugh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reinke et al., 2004</xref>). Taken together, our findings suggest that CGH-1 may associate with a limited set of maternal mRNAs.</p><p>To test this idea further, we examined the relative abundance of CGH-1&#x02013;associated mRNAs by interrogating <italic>C. elegans</italic> serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McKay et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khattra et al., 2007</xref>). The number of SAGE tags recovered for each mRNA is indicative of its relative abundance. If CGH-1 simply associates randomly with mRNAs that are present in developing germ cells, the most abundant germ line mRNAs should have been overrepresented in our CGH-1 IPs. This was not the case, however. None of the 50 most abundant gonad mRNAs were enriched at least threefold in our CGH-1 IPs (unpublished data). In addition, although the 50 most highly enriched CGH-1&#x02013;associated mRNAs were represented by a mean of 9.8 nonambiguous SAGE tags (per 100,000) in a gonad mRNA library, the mean number of SAGE tags for the 50 most abundant gonad mRNAs was &#x0003e;38-fold higher (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). This indicates that our CGH-1 IPs did not isolate the most abundant germ line mRNAs. A similar difference was seen when these CGH-1&#x02013;associated mRNAs were compared with the 50 most abundant of all adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> mRNAs (Fig. S3 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801183/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801183/DC1</ext-link>). We conclude that during oogenesis, CGH-1 associates specifically with a discrete subset of germ line mRNAs, nearly all of which are expressed during oogenesis and provided to the embryo maternally.</p><p>The proteins encoded by these CGH-1&#x02013;associated mRNAs are involved in various processes, including RNA binding, ubiquitylation, and gene regulation (Fig. S3 B). These functional categories are also highly represented among mRNAs that are present in mammalian oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evsikov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kocabas et al., 2006</xref>). Many CGH-1&#x02013;associated mRNAs are involved in embryonic fate specification or cell cycle control (i.e., <italic>nos-2</italic>, <italic>pos-1</italic>, <italic>cdk-1</italic>, and <italic>cdk-5</italic>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Tables II</xref> and S2). In addition, many of these mRNAs are known to be translationally regulated during oogenesis, in that their protein products are not detected until late oogenesis or early embryonic stages (i.e., <italic>nos-2</italic>, <italic>pos-1</italic>,and <italic>pie-1</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tenenhaus et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Subramaniam and Seydoux, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tabara et al., 1999</xref>). Together, the data suggest that CGH-1 associates with a particular subset of maternal mRNAs, many of which are subject to posttranscriptional regulation during oogenesis.</p><p>This interaction between CGH-1 and maternal mRNAs predicts that in oocytes, mRNA should be present in storage bodies along with CGH-1. To test this idea, we performed CGH-1 antibody staining simultaneously with in situ hybridization with a probe for SL1, a trans-spliced leader sequence that is found on &#x0223c;60% of <italic>C. elegans</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zorio et al., 1994</xref>). When <italic>C. elegans</italic> oogenesis is arrested, mRNA accumulates in large cytoplasmic foci, greatly enhancing its detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schisa et al., 2001</xref>). We therefore performed our experiments in the feminized strain <italic>fog-2(q71)</italic>, which ovulates infrequently because it does not produce sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schedl and Kimble, 1988</xref>). In <italic>fog-2(q71)</italic> oocytes, CGH-1 formed large particles that colocalized with the SL1 signal, which was also detected in smaller particles that lacked CGH-1 staining (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A&#x02013;C</xref>). In <italic>fog-2(q71)</italic>, this CGH-1 staining has been reported to colocalize with large CAR-1 foci, only some of which overlap with germ (P) granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jud et al., 2008</xref>). Taken together, this suggests that some but not all SL1-containing mRNA colocalizes with CGH-1 and CAR-1 in storage bodies and germ (P) granules.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>CGH-1 affects mRNA localization during oogenesis.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) CGH-1 and SL1 leader sequence localization in proximal oocytes in <italic>fog-2(q71)</italic> females.

Null <italic>cgh-1(ok492)</italic> and <italic>cgh-1(RNAi)</italic> hermaphrodites are sterile but produce oocytes in which gross abnormalities in gene expression have not been detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Navarro et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boag et al., 2005</xref>). This makes it very unlikely that the lack of CGH-1 results simply in a widespread release of germ line translational suppression, which would lead to somatic differentiation in the gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciosk et al., 2006</xref>). CGH-1 is required for appropriate localization of CAR-1, however. If CGH-1 is absent, CAR-1 forms aberrant sheetlike structures within the syncytial gonad core (Fig. S2 B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audhya et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boag et al., 2005</xref>). This appears to involve a defect in storage body formation because germ (P) granules remain largely intact during oogenesis in <italic>cgh-1</italic> null mutants (Fig. S2 B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boag et al., 2005</xref>). We examined how lack of CGH-1 affects the distribution of mRNAs during oogenesis by hybridizing with the SL1 probe, which in WT animals detects small foci throughout the syncytial core (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Remarkably, in <italic>cgh-1(ok492)</italic> animals, some SL1-containing mRNA was similarly found in small puncta, but a significant proportion of the SL1 signal colocalized with the large CAR-1 sheets (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, F&#x02013;I</xref>). We conclude that during oogenesis, CGH-1 is required for correct localization of a substantial proportion of SL1-containing mRNAs.</p><p>We next investigated whether a lack of CGH-1 differentially affects the localization or stability of representative mRNAs that our RIP-Chip experiments identified as being associated with CGH-1. For controls, we examined germ line enriched mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reinke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reinke et al., 2000</xref>) that were indicated by SAGE databases to be of comparable abundance but had not been detected as CGH-1&#x02013;associated in our IPs. We first performed in situ hybridization of dissected gonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and Schedl, 2006</xref>), a technique that reveals approximate mRNA levels during the different stages of oogenesis. Across multiple experiments, the levels of all six CGH-1&#x02013;associated mRNAs that we tested were dramatically and consistently reduced throughout the gonad in young <italic>cgh-1(ok492)</italic> adults (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6 A</xref> and S3 C). In contrast, the expression patterns of six out of seven control mRNAs that we examined were indistinguishable between <italic>cgh-1(ok492)</italic> and WT (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6 A</xref> and S3 D).

Some CGH-1&#x02013;associated mRNAs are known to be translationally regulated through binding of sequence-specific proteins to their 3&#x02032; UTRs (see text). Such proteins might be present on individual mRNAs in conjunction with the CGH-1 complex or could assume control of these mRNAs after they are released by this complex.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1820543f06"></graphic></fig><p>Our findings suggest that CGH-1&#x02013;associated mRNAs become differentially destabilized if CGH-1 is absent. Alternatively, it might be possible that <italic>cgh-1(ok492)</italic> animals have lower levels of these maternal mRNAs because they do not ovulate and therefore produce fewer oocytes, or if they have a germ cell differentiation block. <italic>cgh-1(ok492)</italic> and <italic>cgh-1(RNAi)</italic> animals switch from sperm to oocyte production at the appropriate stage, however, and as adults, produce only oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Navarro, et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boag, et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>cgh-1</italic> mutants express typical oocyte-specific genes. For example, three of the CGH-1&#x02013;unassociated mRNAs that we tested (<italic>gld-1</italic>, <italic>air-1</italic>, and <italic>zip-4</italic>) are expressed primarily during oogenesis and not in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reinke et al., 2004</xref>), and only one of these (<italic>gld-1</italic>) is present at modestly lower levels in <italic>cgh-1(ok492)</italic> hermaphrodites (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6 B</xref> and S3 D). Finally, mRNAs that are associated with (and dependent upon) CGH-1 are present at normal or increased levels in <italic>fog(q71)</italic> females, which also ovulate infrequently (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>). We conclude that during oogenesis, CGH-1 is needed to protect the specific group of mRNAs with which it normally associates but not most other mRNAs, in striking contrast to its previously described role in promoting mRNA decay in P bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coller and Parker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eulalio et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parker and Sheth, 2007</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Studies in yeast, cultured cells, and in vitro have shown that Dhh1(CGH-1) and Pat1 act in concert to recruit mRNAs to P bodies, inhibit their translation, and promote decapping (see Introduction). We now find that in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the oogenesis functions of CGH-1 are distinguishable genetically from its role in &#x0201c;typical&#x0201d; P bodies. In somatic tissues, CGH-1 is found in <italic>patr-1</italic>&#x02013;dependent decapping-associated P bodies, but during oogenesis, CGH-1 forms storage bodies independently of <italic>patr-1</italic>, interacts primarily with a set of translational regulators, and protects a specific group of maternal mRNAs from degradation.</p><sec><title>PATR-1&#x02013;dependent somatic CGH-1 particles have properties of decapping-associated P bodies</title><p>When we investigated whether germ line or embryonic CGH-1 particles have characteristic properties of P bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parker and Sheth, 2007</xref>), we found that this was the case only in somatic cells. The CGH-1 particles that are present in somatic cells after the four-cell stage (somatic P bodies) were stabilized if decapping-associated factors were lacking, and were essentially undetectable in the absence of PATR-1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B&#x02013;E</xref>). PATR-1(N) staining was seen almost exclusively in somatic P bodies, and in <italic>dcap-2(tm2470)</italic> animals, somatic P bodies that contained both PATR-1 and CGH-1 were prominent into adulthood (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3 A</xref> and S1 F). We conclude that PATR-1 dependence and PATR-1(N) staining are specific characteristics of somatic P bodies, and that in metazoan, Pat1 may represent a functional marker of degradative P bodies.</p><p>The somatic P bodies we identified are likely to correspond to previously described embryonic particles containing DCAP-2 and the miRNA-associated proteins ALG-1 (argonaute) and AIN-1 (GW182; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2005</xref>). Cell culture experiments suggest that mammalian CGH-1 (RCK) is required for gene silencing by miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chu and Rana, 2006</xref>), but <italic>cgh-1(ok492)</italic> homozygotes do not show either the devastating germ line defects caused by lack of the nuclease dicer (<italic>dcr-1</italic>) or the heterochronic phenotypes associated with some miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pasquinelli et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knight and Bass, 2001</xref>). Although this suggests that CGH-1 is not generally essential for miRNA function, it will be important to investigate whether CGH-1 might have redundant or more specific functions in miRNA-directed silencing.</p><p>Somatic CGH-1 particles became <italic>patr-1</italic> dependent approximately as decay of class II maternal mRNAs begins (see Introduction), which suggests that class II mRNAs might be degraded through decapping. However, class II mRNAs that we have analyzed by in situ hybridization and RT-qPCR (<italic>pos-1</italic> and <italic>nos-2</italic>) were not detectably stabilized in <italic>dcap-2(tm2470)</italic> embryos (unpublished data). Perhaps the decapping pathway degrades only some class II mRNAs or acts redundantly with other mechanisms. Consistent with the latter idea, <italic>dcap-2(tm2470)</italic> mutants develop to adulthood and are fertile (Table S1), which suggests that the decapping pathway is unlikely to be the most important mRNA decay mechanism in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>CGH-1 binds and stabilizes specific maternal mRNAs</title><p>In contrast to somatic P bodies, the CGH-1&#x02013;containing storage bodies found in germ cells were not detectably influenced by lack of <italic>dcap-2</italic> or <italic>patr-1</italic>, and they lacked PATR-1(N) staining (Fig. S2 and not depicted). In addition, neither the decapping proteins nor PATR-1 were among the most prominent CGH-1 interactors in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, in which the bulk of CGH-1 expression derives from developing oocytes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boag, et al., 2005</xref>). During oogenesis, CGH-1 therefore appears to act in a manner that is distinct from its P body functions. Accordingly, we identified two prominent CGH-1 interactors to be ATX-2 and PAB-1, which in mammalian cells are not found not in P bodies but are characteristic of stress granules, structures in which some mRNAs are transiently sequestered during stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Kedersha, 2008</xref>). We speculate that CGH-1 and the translational regulators with which it forms a germ line RNP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boag, et al., 2005</xref>) may assemble on an mRNA to form the functional unit of the storage body, much as the decapping complex is the &#x0201c;building block&#x0201d; of the P body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parker and Sheth, 2007</xref>). Although germ line storage bodies are distinct from P bodies, it should be remembered that core P body mechanisms have important functions during oogenesis: <italic>dcap-2</italic> and <italic>patr-1</italic> mutants show minor germ line abnormalities (Fig. S1 C and Table S1), and in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Dcp1</italic> is required for localization of some maternal mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We investigated the specificity with which CGH-1 acts on mRNA during oogenesis by performing a systems analysis of its interactions with mRNA. In RIP-Chip experiments, we obtained the unexpected finding that CGH-1 interacts specifically with a particular set of oocyte and maternal mRNAs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and Table S2). Our stringent criteria for CGH-1 association might have underestimated the number of mRNAs that interact specifically with CGH-1 in vivo, but we established that these CGH-1&#x02013;associated mRNAs are functionally linked to CGH-1, as we obtained the surprising finding that they were differentially destabilized in <italic>cgh-1(ok492)</italic> animals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and Fig. S3, C and D). Our findings indicate that CGH-1, and by extension the conserved CGH-1 germ line complex, defines a large but discrete maternal mRNA storage pathway.</p><p>What is the main function of the CGH-1 complex in regulating these mRNAs?

It is intriguing that CGH-1 protects particular maternal mRNAs from degradation, in striking contrast to its more familiar role in promoting decapping. In the protozoan <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>, the CGH-1 orthologue (DOZI) is also required for female fertility and stabilization of certain mRNAs that are translationally silenced in female gametocytes, the female gamete precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mair et al., 2006</xref>). Individual translationally suppressed mRNAs coIP from gametocytes along with DOZI, and without DOZI, many mRNAs that are normally translationally silenced in the gametocyte are degraded. This striking similarity to our findings suggests that a protective function for CGH-1 in reproduction might be conserved. One possibility is that the degradation that occurs in the absence of CGH-1 is a &#x0201c;default&#x0201d; fate that eliminates errant mRNAs that have escaped from being appropriately localized or translationally silenced (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 D</xref>).</p><p>It is an intriguing question how CGH-1 interacts with and protects particular mRNAs because DEAD box helicases generally bind mRNA nonspecifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rocak and Linder, 2004</xref>). This specificity might be provided by other CGH-1 complex components (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>), by transient interactions with other factors, or by proteins that interact specifically with particular subgroups of CGH-1&#x02013;associated mRNAs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 D</xref>). For example, in mammalian cells, the decapping machinery can be targeted to mRNAs by sequence-specific regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franks and Lykke-Andersen, 2007</xref>). One possibility is that the CGH-1 complex is formed on mRNAs at germ (P) granules, at which some CGH-1 is found throughout oogenesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and S2 A). Some maternal mRNAs seem to pass through germ (P) granules as they emerge from the nuclear pores, and the mRNAs that are most robustly detected in germ (P) granules by in situ hybridization (<italic>mex-1</italic>, <italic>pos-1</italic>, and <italic>nos-2)</italic> are prominent in CGH-1 IPs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Tables II</xref> and Table S2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pitt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schisa et al., 2001</xref>). The RNA-dependent association of PAB-1 with CGH-1 we have described here (see Results) suggests a plausible if speculative model for how the CGH-1 complex could protect these mRNAs. CGH-1 might allow these mRNAs to interact stably with PAB-1, binding of which inhibits deadenylation and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mangus et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Considerable progress has been made in various systems toward understanding how translation of individual maternal mRNAs is controlled through binding of regulatory proteins to their 3&#x02032; untranslated regions (UTRs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lipshitz and Smibert, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wickens et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Richter, 2007</xref>). In contrast, it has remained largely unknown to what extent CGH-1 or other putative &#x0201c;masking&#x0201d; proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weston and Sommerville, 2006</xref>) might influence regulation of these same mRNAs. Many of the mRNAs that we determined are bound and protected by CGH-1 are known to be translationally regulated during oogenesis (see Results). For example, one of the most prominent CGH-1&#x02013;associated and &#x02013;stabilized mRNAs is <italic>nos-2</italic> (<italic>nanos</italic> orthologue; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, A and B;</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>), the translation of which is controlled through interactions between specific regulators and UTR sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jadhav et al., 2008</xref>). CGH-1 thus defines a broader level of regulation that may act on many maternal mRNAs for which translation is controlled by sequence-specific UTR-associated mechanisms, raising the interesting question of how the CGH-1 complex might interact functionally with those mechanisms (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 D</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Developmental regulation of CGH-1 and PATR-1 functions</title><p>Our results in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have shown that CGH-1 functions differently in the oogenic germ line and soma, and have distinguished three types of CGH-containing particles (germ [P] granules, storage bodies, and somatic P bodies; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). In this simple metazoan, therefore, CGH-1 functions are tissue-specific and restricted with respect to its mRNA targets, at least during oogenesis. We conclude that CGH-1, PATR-1, and possibly other core P body mechanisms may have surprisingly complex functions during development. It will be important to elucidate how these mechanisms are targeted to individual mRNAs, and how CGH-1 and PATR-1 functions are regulated in different cellular and developmental contexts.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Strains</title><p>WT (N2 Bristol) and mutant strains were maintained as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brenner (1974)</xref>.
