HH is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from mutations in the <italic>HFE </italic>(hemochromatosis) gene, with clinical consequences which can range from cirrhosis of the liver, diabetes, heart failure, arthritis to liver cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The protein encoded by this gene is similar to MHC class I-type proteins and associates with &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin (&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>M). &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>M has been shown to play an important role in regulating iron absorption. The majority of HH patients carry an <italic>HFE </italic>mutation, in which cysteine at position 282 is changed to tyrosine (C282Y) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This mutation prevents the formation of a disulfide bond in the &#x003b1;3 domain, impairing the normal association of HFE with &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>M. This lack of association dramatically reduces the cell surface expression of HFE, whereby the majority of the C282Y mutant protein remains as high molecular weight aggregates, fails to undergo late Golgi processing and subsequently is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This retention of the mutant protein in the ER may provide a basis for the pathogenesis of this condition. In line with this, we propose that HH associated with C282Y HFE, may be viewed in the context of conformational diseases.</p><p>Conformational diseases arise from changes that lead to aggregation and retention of protein with consequent late or episodic onset of symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Cells respond to this perturbation in the ER by inducing the expression of novel genes whose products may restore ER function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] but may also act as proinflammatory stimulants. Regulation of these ER stress genes occurs <italic>via </italic>two signal transduction pathways: the ER overload response (EOR) and the unfolded protein response (UPR). The EOR activates IKK (inhibitor of &#x003ba;B kinase), which causes degradation of the inhibitor of &#x003ba;B (I-&#x003ba;B). This allows for the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B, a transcription factor that induces the expression of genes encoding several proteins involved in death, survival and inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The UPR pathway involves up-regulation of glucose responsive genes such as grp78 (Ig H chain binding protein (BiP)) in order to facilitate protein trafficking in the ER and the transcription factor CHOP/GADD153 (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], which sensitizes cells to ER stress. In this regard, ATF-6 is a member of the ATF/CREB basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) and a proximal transducer of both GRP78/BiP and CHOP/GADD153 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These protective responses are designed to relieve ER stress, however when they are ineffective, the cell undergoes apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Bcl-2 is an antiapoptotic protein located in the membranes of the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Studies have shown that ER stress downregulates Bcl-2, culminating in cytochrome <italic>c </italic>release and activation of caspase-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), an endogenous bile acid synthesized in the liver's conjugation pathway of urodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), has been demonstrated to inhibit these ER stress-induced pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It is also reported to have a role in preventing toxicity by reducing inflammatory signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]</p><p>The mechanisms involved in the intracellular processing of mutant proteins are complex and not fully understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Z &#x003b1;-<sub>1</sub>antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency is a disorder involving a polymerogenic mutant of the secretory glycoprotein A1AT. The protein product of the mutant Z A1AT gene is synthesized in hepatocytes but accumulates intracellularly rather than being secreted from the cell. The downstream effects of the expression of the mutant Z protein include ER stress resulting in mitochondrial injury and caspase activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Chronic liver disease develops in a subgroup of Z A1AT deficient individuals associated with the mutant Z A1AT protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Currently, liver transplantation is the only treatment available for severe liver disease associated with Z A1AT deficient individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The variable clinical presentations among affected individuals, suggests an important contribution of genetic and environmental disease modifiers. While early studies have reported an association between HH and the Z A1AT mutation which may modify the onset and severity of the liver disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], to date this possible association from clinical population studies remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Indeed, molecular studies have shown that activation of the Z A1AT UPR pathway only occurs in the presence of a secondary stimulus. This lack of activation of the UPR pathway has been suggested as an explanation for the onset of the liver disorder Z A1AT deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>While C282Y HFE HH is considered a monogenic disease its phenotypic expression varies considerably [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. We propose that differences in the quality control systems within the ER could explain some of this phenotypic variation. In this study, we test this hypothesis and demonstrate that ER stress is associated with mutant C282Y HFE expression. We determine the potential usefulness of TUDCA on C282Y HFE induced ER stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, the co-existence of both C282Y HFE and Z A1AT protein expression on ER stress responses were investigated (in particular C282Y HFE ability to activate the ZA1AT UPR pathway) as potential disease modifiers with respect to each other.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>C282Y HFE model system</title><p>To confirm C282Y HFE accumulated within the ER, we performed confocal microscopy on 24-h post transfected cells using GFP tagged HFE protein along with antibodies against the ER resident protein calnexin.

We demonstrated that the C282Y mutant protein co-localized with the ER resident protein calnexin and undergoes marked degradation compared to WT HFE, providing a suitable model of study for the C282Y HFE protein. C282Y HFE mutant protein accumulates in the ER and middle Golgi compartment, and consequently undergoes degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Mutant proteins with such impaired egress have been shown to cause ER stress in a variety of disorders, which in turn may give rise to a variety of stress pathways such as EOR, UPR activation and cellular death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>Upregulation of the EOR pathway leads to activation of the transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In this study we found that C282Y HFE protein induced NF-&#x003ba;B, which consequently resulted in a marked increase in protein production of both interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemotatic protein-1 (MCP-1), along with increased transcriptional activation of IL-8 in C282Y HFE-expressing cell line. IL-8 has been shown to be an important mediator in various diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. MCP-1 is secreted by a variety of cells as a response to several inflammatory stimuli and activates and attracts monocytes/macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Furthermore, MCP-1 concentrations are deregulated in patients with alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] and in patients with hepatitis C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. These findings suggest that the pathology of HH in C282Y/C282Y HFE patients may involve an aberrant inflammatory action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><p>Indeed, in this regards Lee <italic>et al </italic>found that HFE expression was increased during ER stress, induced by serum deprivation, menadione and &#x003b2;-amyloid. This increase in HFE expression was independent of transferrin receptor and ferritin. Furthermore, the labile iron pool was consistently decreased when HFE expression was increased, suggesting that the observed induction of HFE has a protective function by limiting cellular iron exposure during stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>UPR pathway involves up-regulation of the secretory pathway's capacity to process proteins and entails the transcriptional up-regulation of a co-ordinately expressed set of genes encoding ER chaperones, enzymes, and structural components of the ER. The UPR pathway culminates in the expression of glucose-responsive genes (<italic>grp</italic>) such as, <italic>grp78</italic>. Expression of the ER charpone <italic>grp78</italic>/BiP is a classical marker for UPR activation in mammalian cells. The <italic>grp78 </italic>promoter contains a consensus binding site called the ER stress response element; recognised by ATF6, a transcription factor specifically activated by ER stress. Several lines of evidence support the essential role of ATF6 in the ER stress response and have revealed it to be a proximal transducer of GRP78/BiP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Recent studies of proteomic analysis of hepatic iron overload in mice have shown increased levels of GRP78/Bip protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. This upregulation in response to iron excess has been demonstrated previously in human cells and it has been suggested that up-regulation of GRP78/Bip may indicate increased demand for re-folding or retention of proteins in the ER of iron-overloaded cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. The UPR is also known to up-regulate CHOP, which is generally linked to ER stress. CHOP protein belongs to the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors and is thought to play a critical role in cell survival or cell death during ER stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Prolonged activation of the UPR responses is known to result in cell death. Studies by Hacki et al, suggested that perturbing ER functions induces a specific crosstalk between the ER and mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. It is also worth noting that constitutive activation of NF-&#x003ba;B promotes survival of a range of cells, including B cells, hepatic cells and cancer cells. However, whereas NF-&#x003ba;B is most commonly involved in suppressing apoptosis by transactivating the expression of anti apoptotic genes, it is associated with promoting programmed cell death in response to ER stress <italic>via </italic>the EOR pathway by calcium release from the ER, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. In neuronal degenerating disease, ER stress results in activation of NF-&#x003ba;B, up-regulation of GRP78 protein levels, and ensuing apoptotic cell death due to the expression of mutant protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. The data in this study reveals a potential role for NF-&#x003ba;B in C282Y HFE mediated cellular death.</p><p>TUDCA is a non-toxic compound which is known to be effective in preventing cytotoxic processes. It has been demonstrated to inhibit activation of GRP78 and caspase-3, along with cytochrome <italic>c </italic>release. TUDCA stabilizes the lipid and protein structure of mitochondrial outer membranes, thus inhibiting Bax binding to the outer membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Indeed, mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species may be involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] as suggested by recent studies which report that TUDCA prevents the generation of ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The potential of TUDCA to prevent apoptosis and caspase activation may prove beneficial in protecting cells predisposed to disruptions in the ER. Cytochrome <italic>c </italic>release and caspase-3 activation along with decreased <italic>bcl-2 </italic>promoter activity suggest the damaging action of mutant C282Y protein in cellular stress and therefore TUDCA may protect cells during C282Y HFE protein induced stress.</p><p>A variable clinical presentation among C282Y homozygous individuals suggests an important contribution of disease modifiers acting on the same signalling pathways. Indeed, while the C282Y mutation results in an altered disease phenotype, mice studies have shown that the C282Y mutation does not completely disrupt the function of HFE, emphasising the importance of additional insults. Furthermore, activation of the UPR pathway can have a protective role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Therefore, it may be suggested that activation of this pathway by C282Y HFE protein expression as shown in this report might explain the milder phenotype of C282Y HFE mice compared to a similar but more severe phenotype of the HFE knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Z A1AT deficiency represents a possible genetic insult which is known to act on the EOR and UPR pathways and serves as an excellent model for conformational disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Recent work has revealed the lack of UPR activation by mutant Z A1AT, suggesting it is unlikely that mutant Z A1AT is "sensed" by the machinery of the UPR. Indeed, the signal appears not to be transmitted as a result of a block in the afferent or efferent components of the response, demonstrated by a lack of increased GRP78 activity. However, these studies have shown that Z A1AT UPR activation is found as a result of a secondary stimulus, revealing its activation in the presence of known chemical stress inducers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We wanted to examine the co-existence of both C282Y HFE and Z A1AT in our <italic>in vitro </italic>cell model system, whereby the C282Y HFE could act as a genetic insult in the context of secondary stimuli acting on the Z A1AT UPR pathway. Our findings indicate the potential for C282Y HFE to activate the Z A1AT UPR pathway (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>), thus implicating C282Y HFE as a factor which may 'trigger' and/or explain part of the clinical expression of Z A1AT deficiency and <italic>vice versa</italic>.
