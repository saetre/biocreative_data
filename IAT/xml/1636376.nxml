Here we describe the cloning, the biochemical and genetical analyses of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog dG9a. We show that dG9a shares the structural organization of mammalian G9a, and that it is a multi-catalytic histone methyltransferase with specificity not only for lysines 9 and 27 on H3 but also for H4. Surprisingly, it is not the H4&#x02013;K20 residue that is the target for this methylation. Spatiotemporal expression analyses reveal that dG9a is abundantly expressed in the gonads of both sexes, with no detectable expression in gonadectomized adults. In addition we find a low but clearly observable level of dG9a transcript in developing embryos, larvae and pupae. Genetic and RNAi experiments reveal that dG9a is involved in ecdysone regulatory pathways.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Modifications of histones are an important mark for transcriptional regulation during embryonic development. The protruding tales of the histones are modified by acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination and arginine and lysine methylation, and the combinations are hypothesized to form a histone code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). The best-characterized substrates for lysine methylation in eukaryotic cells are histone proteins, although methylation of several non-histone proteins, such as the tumor suppressor p53, has been reported as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>).</p><p>Histone H3 has been shown to be methylated on lysine residues K4, K9, K27, K36 and K79 whereas in histone H4, K20 is methylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Each of these lysine side chains can be mono-, di- or tri-methylated by histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTases), which, except for Dot1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), carry a catalytic SET [Su(var), Enhancer of Zeste, Trithorax] domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). The SET domain is a conserved &#x0223c;130 amino acid sequence, which is flanked by the less conserved pre-SET and post-SET regions at the amino and C-termini, respectively. The specificity of a HKMTase, as well as the number of methyl residues that attaches to a lysine residue, depends on the structure of the HKMTase or the presence of additional co-factor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). On the other hand Ezh2 requires the presence of the co-factors suppressor of zeste-12 (SUZ12) and embryonic ectoderm development (Eed) for tri-methylation of H3&#x02013;K27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). The HKMTase ERG-associated protein (ESET) di-methylates H3&#x02013;K9, but is converted into a tri-methylating enzyme by its association with a mouse-activating transcription-factor-associated modulator (mAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). The methylated histones recruit proteins that carry CHROMO, TUDOR or WD40 domains and are capable of specific interactions with differently methylated lysine residues reviewed in Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). This recruitment step is likely to define a unique functional readout for individual lysine methylations. Thus, tri-methylation of lysine 9 in histone H3 by Suv39H1 and Suv39H2 creates a binding site for the chromodomain-containing heterochromatic protein HP1 which is thought to induce heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Di-methylation of H3&#x02013;K9 by G9a is associated with the silencing of euchromatic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian G9a mono- and di-methylates H3&#x02013;K9 at euchromatic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), and has recently also been found at heterochromatic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). In g9a<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/g9a<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mice H3&#x02013;K9 methylation is drastically reduced resulting in severe growth retardation and early lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). The loss of G9a primarily affects the methylation of H3&#x02013;K9 in euchromatic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). G9a is the major euchromatic histone H3&#x02013;K9 methyltransferase in higher eukaryotes but in <italic>Drosophila</italic> the euchromatic H3&#x02013;K9 HKMTase has not been characterized. Although the H3&#x02013;K9 methylation is strongly reduced in <italic>Su(var)3&#x02013;9</italic> null mutants, a small amount of H3 molecules remain methylated at K9 suggesting the existence of other K9 specific HKMTases in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>).</p><p>There are several reports demonstrating the silencing effects from H3&#x02013;K9 methylation, including the inactive X chromosome of female mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), and developmentally regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p><p>In a search for SET domain containing genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that might code a K9 specific HKMTase, we performed a bioinformatics search of the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genome and found the gene <italic>CG2995</italic> which share significant homology to mammalian <italic>G9a</italic>. In this paper we describe the cloning, and the biochemical and genetical analyses of <italic>CG2995</italic>. We show that it encodes a histone methyltransferase specific for H3&#x02013;K9, K27 and H4, and that it shares the structural organization of mammalian G9a. Therefore, we suggest that CG2995 is renamed <italic>dG9a</italic>. It adds up to three methyl groups to unmethylated H3 and H4. Our results indicate a role for <italic>dG9a</italic> in germ cell formation. Using RNAi we show that <italic>dG9a</italic> is critical for development, very likely by being involved in the ecdysone regulated gene expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Fly handling and generation of transgenic flies</title><p>All genetic crosses were carried out at 25&#x000b0;C.

Performing a BLASTP search with the SET domain of one of these proteins, the annotated CG2995 protein, against the mouse and human database identified it as the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of the G9a protein. This SET domain alone shares 61% identity (76% similarity) with the corresponding domain of the mouse G9a protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In comparison, the SET domain of CG2995 shares 45% identity with the SET domain of the Su(var)3&#x02013;9 protein of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, suggesting that CG2995 is the only homolog of G9a in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome. This is emphasized when looking at the pre-SET/SET/post-SET regions, where it is notable that CG2995 is more similar to mouse G9a than to Su(var)3&#x02013;9 or dSET2. Thus, dSu(var)3&#x02013;9 versus G9a shows 37% identity, 55% similarity, dSET2 versus G9a displays 36% identity, 50% similarity, and CG2995 versus G9a has 47% identity, 68% similarity. <italic>CG2995</italic> is located as the third gene in region 1A1 on the X chromosome, and a further comparative analysis of the CG2995 protein with the mouse G9a shows that the CG2995 has 33% identity and 49% similarity to the mouse protein (1172&#x02013;1263 amino acid). The fly protein is longer at the N-terminus but otherwise shares the same module organization as its mouse counterpart. The CG2995 protein contains multiple putative domains in addition to the SET domain, like the adjacent cysteine-rich regions [the pre-SET (also called SAC); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>)], and conserved cysteine residues in the C-terminal region of the SET domain that corresponds to the post-SET domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which has shown to be required for enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Within the SET domain, a H(R)&#x003a6;&#x003a6;NHSC motif (where &#x003a6; indicates a hydrophobic residue) has previously been shown to be an important catalytic site. For SUV39H1 protein, a histidine-to-arginine mutation of the first histidine (His<sup>320</sup>) in the <sup>320</sup>H&#x003a6;&#x003a6;NHSC<sup>326</sup> motif resulted in a 20-fold higher catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). This observation suggests that the H(R)&#x003a6;&#x003a6;NHSC motif is correlated with the HKMTase activity. The CG2995 protein contains a <sup>1532</sup>R&#x003a6;&#x003a6;NHSC<sup>1538</sup> motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, underlined), together with another motif reported to be needed for HKMTase activity, GE(x)<sub>5</sub>Y, located in the C-terminal end of the SET domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, underlined).</p><p>In addition, the CG2995 protein harbors contiguous copies of a 33-amino acid repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This repeat, originally identified in the Notch protein of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and known as the ankyrin repeat, is also found in G9a and in a number of other proteins involved in intracellular protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>).</p><p>An AT-hook also is found in the N-terminus part of the CG2995 protein. The AT-hook is a small DNA-binding protein motif that was first described in the high mobility group non-histone chromosomal protein HMG-I(Y). Since its discovery, this motif has been observed in other DNA-binding proteins from a wide range of organisms. Furthermore, AT-hook motifs are frequently associated with known functional domains seen in chromatin proteins and in DNA-binding proteins (e.g. histone folds, homeodomains and zinc fingers). In general, it appears that the AT-hook motif is an auxiliary protein motif co-operating with other DNA-binding activities and facilitating changes in the structure of the DNA either as a polypeptide on its own [e.g. HMG-I(Y)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>) or as part of a multidomain protein [e.g. Swi2p in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> or HRX (ALL-1) in <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). It is most interesting that this motif seems to be specific to known or predicted chromosomal/DNA-binding proteins, suggesting that it may act as a versatile minor groove tether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). A nuclear localization signal is found in the N-terminal of the protein. In conclusion, CG2995 has a high level of similarity to mouse G9a and we suggest CG2995 is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of G9a and will refer to it as dG9a.</p><p>Full-length cDNA was cloned by RACE and RT&#x02013;PCR. This cDNA revealed that the <italic>dG9a</italic> gene consists of 10 exons with a 4911 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein of 1637 amino acid. The coding region ends by an in-frame stop codon that is followed by a poly(A) signal 1173 downstream, suggesting that it is full-length and consistent with the annotated sequence in FlyBase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu/"/>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

This antibody recognized a band of the predicted size of &#x0223c;180 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The localization of dG9a protein was investigated by analysis of polytene chromosomes from salivary glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The immunostaining showed discrete banding pattern in euchromatic regions with no staining observed in the chromocenter.</p></sec><sec><title>Spatiotemporal expression of <italic>dG9a</italic></title><p>To investigate the spatiotemporal expression of <italic>dG9a</italic> we first used semi-quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, a low but measurable amount of <italic>dG9a</italic> transcript is present in 0&#x02013;3-h-old embryos. In 3&#x02013;6-h-old embryos the expression of <italic>dG9a</italic> is barely detectable, indicating that the <italic>dG9a</italic> transcripts seen in 0&#x02013;3-h-old embryos are of maternal origin. Between 6 and 21 h of embryogenesis the expression of <italic>dG9a</italic> is low but clearly discernible, and about the same level of expression is observed throughout larval development, with a slightly elevated expression during the third larval instar. Then, in 12&#x02013;46-h-old pupae there is no or very little expression of <italic>dG9a</italic>. In adult flies the expression of <italic>dG9a</italic> is restricted to the gonads in both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, last four lanes). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that <italic>dG9a</italic> is expressed in one or more tissues of the gonadectomized flies, but at a level too low to be detected by the RT&#x02013;PCR settings used here.</p><p>Next, in order to study the spatiotemporal expression of dG9a in more detail, we stained ovaries and embryos with the dG9a antibody. The immunostainings revealed that dG9a is expressed in all cells of the ovary, including the germarium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) where especially the nurse cells, which undergo a dramatic endoreplication, stain heavily. It also clearly shows that dG9a is localized to the nucleus. In stage 10B egg chambers it appears that dG9a is markedly upregulated in what appears to be the centripetal follicle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, arrowheads). At this stage, a moderate upregulation is also discernible in the posterior follicle cells (arrow). During stage 11 nurse start dumping their content into the oocyte, which is revealed by an accumulation of dG9a at the border between the growing oocyte and the degenerating nurse cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). At this stage an increased expression of dG9a is also found in the posterior follicle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, arrow head). In stage 12 the amount of dG9a has increased considerably and has started to move into the oocyte. An accumulation in the posterior follicle cells is now prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, arrow). At stage 14, dG9a appears to be evenly distributed in the mature oocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>).</p><p>In blastoderm embryos (stage 4, &#x0223c;1.5&#x02013;2.5 h) <italic>dG9a</italic> transcript as well as protein are present in the syncytial nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L and M</xref>). During stages 9 and 12, dG9a expression appears to be more abundant in the central nervous system (CNS) and the neuroectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N, O and Q</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3S</xref> shows a surface view of embryo at the completion of germband shortening, with all cells evenly stained.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression and purification of recombinant histone methyltransferase dG9a</title><p>In order to investigate the enzymatic properties of dG9a we expressed a FLAG tagged N-terminal fragment (789&#x02013;1637 amino acid) using a baculovirus expression system. The purified dG9a was soluble and had the expected molecular size of 95 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To confirm that dG9a has HKMTase activity we incubated it in presence of H<sup>3</sup>-S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and different substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). dG9a methylates H3 and H4 present as free histones but had no detectable activity on nucleosomal arrays. In contrast to the recombinant dG9a, mouse G9a only methylates H3 even when other histones are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In order to exclude the possibility that the unexpected H4 HMT activity is due to a contaminating activity co-purifying with the recombinant dG9a we expressed the enzyme carrying a point mutation within the SET domain (H1536K) that dramatically impairs its catalytic activity. The mutated enzyme was not able to methylate either H3 or H4 indicating that both methylations are a result of dG9a activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In order to determine the substrate specificity we performed a quantitative MALDI-TOF analysis of H3 molecules methylated by dG9a. Similarly to the activity of the mouse ortholog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>), dG9a methylates exclusively K9 and K27 with K9 being the preferred substrate in wild-type (wt) H3. As shown for mG9a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>) dG9a is able to add up to three methyl groups to H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). This finding is confirmed by using H3 molecules carrying a lysine to alanine replacement at position 9 and 27 or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We observe decreased methylation efficiency on H3 K9A and H3 K27A compared to wt H3. In a filter binding assay we observed a 70% reduction when K9 was mutated and a 50% reduction when K27 was mutated. When both H3 lysine residues were mutated (K9A and K27A) we observe a lower activity (efficiency of 27%) indicating that in absence of K9 and K27 dG9a is also able to methylate other lysines. Mouse G9a also showed a decreased activity (27%) towards the double mutant (K9A/K27A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). When we use highly active mG9a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>), it methylates wt H3 and the H3 molecules carrying a single mutation on K9 or K27 with a similar efficiency. However, as we use relatively long reaction times we can not exclude the possibility that K9 is methylated faster than K27, which explains the larger differences observed in previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly dG9a was also able to methylate histone H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This is in marked contrast to the mouse G9a where we do not observe such an activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). The only lysine residue of H4 shown to be methylated <italic>in vivo</italic> is K20 and the first HKMTase identified with this activity was hPR-Set7/dSET8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). Other HKMTases in <italic>Drosophila</italic> shown to methylate H4 lysine 20 are Ash1 and Suv4&#x02013;20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). Ash1 is in addition able to methylate lysine 4 and 9 in histone H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). From these experiments we concluded that dG9a also is a multi-catalytic histone methyltransferase with specificity for lysine 9 and 27 on H3 and possibly lysine 20 on histone H4. However, when we incubated dG9a with H4 carrying a mutation of lysine 20 to alanine we observed no reduction of activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). To further investigate the specificity, we tested whether dG9a was able to methylate H4 molecules carrying different N-terminal deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). We observed that dG9a could methylate the H4 N-terminus when the first five amino acids were deleted, excluding K5 as a possible substrate. However, the activity was lost when we used the H4 &#x00394;10 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). This suggests that the substrate is K8, but considering that the minimal substrate specificity for mG9a surrounding K9 contains seven amino acids (TARKSTG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>) we cannot exclude that another downstream lysine can serve as a substrate. MALDI-TOF analysis of H4 methylated by dG9a, showed that only the peptide containing amino acids 4&#x02013;17 was methylated <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). We conclude from these experiments that dG9a can methylate lysine 8, 12 or 16 of H4 <italic>in vitro</italic>. It remains to be seen to what level these lysines are methylated <italic>in vivo</italic> and what the function of this methylation is.</p></sec><sec><title>dG9a is required for normal development</title><p>To investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of dG9a, transgenic flies with an inverted-repeat <italic>UAS-dG9a.IR</italic> construct were crossed to different GAL4-driver lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). The vector used for making the inverted repeats has an independent UAS-GFP marker so that a tissue exposed to RNAi will simultaneously show GFP expression [pUds-GFP; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>)] as an internal control to RNAi expression. In addition, down regulation of <italic>dG9a</italic> was confirmed by RT&#x02013;PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>Using the ubiquitously expressed <italic>da-GAL4</italic> driver with the <italic>UAS-dG9a</italic>.IR flies, the progeny developed normally until the end of the third larval instar. However, these RNAi larvae did not form their puparium and crawling larvae were found after 7&#x02013;8 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The majority of these larvae developed melanotic tumors, either one or two larger ones or several smaller. The larvae finally stopped moving, and in the few cases where &#x02018;pseudo-prepupae&#x02019; were formed, these maintained the elongated larval form and failed to evert the anterior spiracles; there was only slight melanization of these &#x02018;pseudo-prepupae&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>The defects in puparium formation seen in <italic>dG9a</italic> RNAi animals could result from either a decrease in the ecdysone titer or a decrease in the ability of the ecdysone signal to be transduced. To distinguish between these possibilities we examined the effects of feeding ecdysone to <italic>dG9a</italic> RNAi larvae. This method has been shown to effectively rescue phenotypes associated with ecdysone-deficient mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Mid- and late-third instar larvae were transferred to food either with or without 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) for 6&#x02013;8 h and scored on a 12-h basis. Feeding 20E to <italic>dG9a</italic> RNAi larvae did not rescue them to puparium formation. Therefore, we conclude that ecdysone is not limiting in the <italic>da-GAL4</italic>/<italic>UAS-dG9a.IR</italic> animals and that <italic>dG9a</italic> functions downstream of ecdysone biosynthesis and release.</p><p>When the ubiquitously expressed, but weaker, <italic>Act5C-GAL4</italic> driver was used, development of progeny of genotype <italic>Act5C-GAL4/UAS-dG9a.IR</italic> proceeded up to and through puparium formation (data not shown). However, most of the pupal cases were only lightly tanned and no flies eclosed from these cases. Upon dissection, dead and partially differentiated pharates with no eye pigmentation or legs were found (data not shown). Development appeared to have proceeded further in the posterior part of fly. Of all pupae formed (<italic>N</italic> = 133), &#x0223c;17% developed normally, and the eclosed flies were without exception females.</p><p>As immunostaining indicated a role for dG9a in neuroectoderm and CNS, a driver which expresses GAL4 in brain and throughout CNS, but not in discs, of third instar larvae, P{GawB}c698a, was used.

Here, however, most of the pupae were partly more melanized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), without differentiation proceeding any further than that described for the <italic>Act5C-GAL4</italic> driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). A small portion (&#x0223c;5%) of the pupae actually developed normally but of these almost all failed to escape from the pupal case.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>, these animals show a wing phenotype of a more extreme character, with both wings having a blister and being clearly smaller than normal, most likely because the wings never completely unfold. This phenotype has 100% penetrance. Taken together, these results support the notion that dG9a functions in ecdysone signaling pathways during development.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>dG9a is a euchromatic histone methyltransferase</title><p>In this study we show that CG2995 is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of the HKMTase G9a, and that it specifically mono-, di- and trimethylates H3&#x02013;K9, H3&#x02013;K27 and K8, 12 or 16 in H4. This methylation pattern is mainly correlated with silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) suggesting that dG9a is involved in transcriptional repression. Further, we showed that dG9a methylates free histones but has no detectable activity on nucleosomal arrays. As revealed by the staining of polytene chromosomes, the centromeric region, where Su(var)3&#x02013;9 predominantly stains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>), is devoid of dG9a. We therefore conclude that dG9a is a euchromatic histone methyltransferase that acts on loosely packed DNA and that methylation by dG9a may occur on pre-assembled histones.</p></sec><sec><title>dG9a is expressed throughout development</title><p>Immunostaining revealed that the dG9a protein is found throughout oogenesis, embryogenesis, and larval development. During these stages, large cells (like nurse cells and salivary gland cells) are metabolically very active, and having multiple copies of genes (polyteny) permits a high level of gene expression; that is, abundant transcription and translation to produce the gene products. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>). In adult flies the <italic>dG9a</italic> transcript and protein are solely found in the gonads, where cells are undergoing extensive endo- and mitotic replication. One can assume that is important that certain genes are kept silent in these cells, and one possible function of dG9a could be to maintain repression of a subset of genes in cells that otherwise have a high gene expression level.</p><p>In the RNAi knock down studies, no lethality was observed during embryogenesis, but this can be ascribed to the fact that the RNAi construct was made using a pUAST based vector that is defect in the germline during oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Conditional knock down of dG9a in the female germline was therefore not possible in this study, but should be subject for future investigation. An interesting observation is that the escapers from the RNAi studies are exclusively females. This result suggests that dG9a may have different roles in males versus females. It is possible that conditional depletion of dG9a in transgenic flies may affect the expression of genes that are required for chromatin stability, chromosome segregation and proper histone modifications resulting in a preferential lethality in male flies. This has recently been reported for <italic>Su(var)205</italic> (also called <italic>HP1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>), and <italic>bonus</italic> (<italic>bon</italic>), encoding a homolog of the vertebrate TIF1 transcriptional cofactors and required for male viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). Interestingly, bon is associated with genes that are implicated in the ecdysone pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>dG9a is involved in ecdysone mediated signaling</title><p>Next, we provide evidence that dG9a is required for important transitions during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development. Our results suggest a role for dG9a in regulation of genes, especially during the onset of metamorphosis, and wing development, processes tightly correlated to ecdysone responsive signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>). Additional evidence for dG9a being involved in the ecdysone hierarchy is the formation of melanotic tumors in the larvae that do not form their puparium. Several chromatin-modifying or chromatin-associated complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>) as well as ecdysone have been implicated in hemocyte development and melanotic tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>). Furthermore, our genetic studies revealed that the <italic>EcR<sup>M544fs</sup></italic> is able to dominantly affect the wing phenotype in <italic>ap-GAL4,UAS-dG9a.IR/EcR<sup>M554fs</sup></italic> flies. Genetic interactions between mutant alleles of different genes are indicative of these genes belonging to the same functional pathway. Thus, the genetic studies support the results from the RNAi experiments, and together provide strong evidence of dG9a being involved in the ecdysone signaling hierarchy. As the RNAi mutants are not rescued by hormone feeding, dG9a must exert its effect downstream of ecdysone biosynthesis and metabolism. One possible scenario is that dG9a acts as a co-regulator for the ecdysone receptor mediating downstream gene regulation as a response to ecdysone pulses. A similar scenario has been reported for mammalian G9a, where a reduction of endogenous G9a reduced hormonal activation of an endogenous target gene by the androgen receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>).</p><p>The genetic interaction between <italic>EcR<sup>M554fs</sup></italic> and <italic>ap-GAL4,UAS-dG9a.IR</italic> on wing development may suggest a molecular interaction between the EcR receptor and dG9a. Activation and repression of transcription involve the recruitment of many co-regulator (co-repressor or co-activator) proteins to the regulated gene promoter by sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factors. As dG9a contains an AT-hook, it could tether the ecdysone receptor to the DNA, or, more plausible, the DNA binding activity of EcR by could bring dG9a to the promoter. Two models could explain the EcR-dG9a relationship observed: <list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>dG9a act as a co-repressor of the early puffs according to the Ashburner model for the hormonal control of polytene chromosome puffing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>). Briefly, this model proposed that ecdysone, bound to its specific receptor, directly induces the expression of a small set of early regulatory genes. The protein products of these genes, in turn, repress their own expression and induce a much larger set of late target genes. dG9a could be involved in this repression.</p></list-item><list-item><p>dG9a act as a co-activator coupled to the transcription apparatus during activation of ecdysone regulated genes.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Vakoc and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>) reported recently that H3&#x02013;K9 methylation was found at high levels in the transcribed region of four genes while they were transcribed. This observation is rather remarkable in that it implies a coupling of the traditionally accounted H3&#x02013;K9 silencing mark to active transcription. Therefore, the possibility that dG9a plays a role in maintaining transcription should be further investigated. In addition, there are observations that murine G9a acts both as a co-repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>), and a co-activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>), depending on promoter context and/or regulatory environment, along with the observation that the zinc finger protein wiz links G9a/GLP histone methyltransferases to the co-repressor molecule CtBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>). Furthermore, NSD1, which methylates both H3&#x02013;K36 and H4&#x02013;K20 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>), acts as a co-activator and a co-repressor for NRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>).</p><p>As a complement to the RNAi approach, we have tried to generate null mutants (deletions) by re-mobilization of the P-element inserted in the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (5&#x02032;-UTR) of <italic>dG9a</italic> in the <italic>dG9a<sup>13414</sup></italic> stock. Whereas several independent lines with precise excision of the P-element were obtained we failed to find any imprecise excision (deletion) events (M. Stabell, unpublished data). During the course of the preparation of this manuscript, Mis <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>) also identified CG2995 as being the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of mammalian G9a.

Instead, they investigated the <italic>dG9a<sup>13414</sup>/dG9a<sup>13414</sup></italic> mutant and report only a minor phenotype without characterizing the nature of the mutant. On the other hand, they showed that this <italic>dG9a<sup>13414</sup></italic> mutant suppresses position effect variegation (PEV) and that it interacts genetically with Su(var)3&#x02013;9, suggesting that the two proteins have an overlapping role in heterochromatic gene silencing and may be members of protein complexes involved gene silencing. In contrast to Mis <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>) who concluded that dG9a is a H3&#x02013;K9 HKMTase, we provide evidence that dG9a (i) methylates H4 as well as H3, (ii) is able to add three methyl groups, (iii) methylates K9 and K27 on histone H3 with a preference for K9 and (iv) has a specificity towards K8, K12 or K16 on the H4 N-terminus. In polytene chromosomes dG9a is excluded from the chromocenter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), indicating a euchromatic role for dG9a. But as the majority of full-length GFP-mG9a fusion proteins has been found in pericentric heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), we cannot rule out a conceivable function for dG9a during facultative heterochromatinization in other tissues and/or stages of development.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Sriharsa Pradhan for providing the mouse G9a baculoviral protein, Danny Reinberg for H3 mutant plasmids, Thomas Jenuwein for the H4 K20A plasmid, Cedric R.
