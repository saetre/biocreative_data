Endothelial phenotype modulation by flow requires the integration of numerous mechanotransduction pathways, but how this is achieved is not well understood. We show here that, in response to flow, the adaptor protein Shc is activated and associates with cell&#x02013;cell and cell&#x02013;matrix adhesions. Shc activation requires the tyrosine kinases vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and Src. Shc activation and its vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) association are matrix independent. In contrast, Shc binding to integrins requires VE-cadherin but occurs only on specific matrices. Silencing Shc results in reduction in both matrix-independent and matrix-dependent signals. Furthermore, Shc regulates flow-induced inflammatory signaling by activating nuclear factor &#x003ba;B&#x02013;dependent signals that lead to atherogenesis. In vivo, Shc is activated in atherosclerosis-prone regions of arteries, and its activation correlates with areas of atherosclerosis. Our results support a model in which Shc orchestrates signals from cell&#x02013;cell and cell&#x02013;matrix adhesions to elicit flow-induced inflammatory signaling.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: AP, atheroprone; AR, atheroresistant; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cell; CL, collagen; EC, endothelial cell; ERK, extracellular signal&#x02013;regulated kinase; FN, fibronectin; LN, laminin; NF&#x003ba;B, nuclear factor &#x003ba;B; VE-cadherin, vascular endothelial cadherin; VEGFR2, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2; VTI, 4-[(4&#x02032;-chloro-2&#x02032;-fluoro)phenylamino]-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Fluid shear stress, the frictional force from blood flow, acts directly on the endothelium to modulate vessel structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davies, 1997</xref>). In arterial regions with laminar flow, the endothelial cells (ECs) express various atheroprotective genes and suppress several proatherogenic ones, leading eventually to stability and quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Malek et al., 1999</xref>). In contrast, in regions with slow or disturbed flow where low shear stress occurs, the atheroprotective genes are suppressed, whereas the proatherogenic genes are up-regulated, thereby promoting the atherosclerotic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Malek et al., 1999</xref>). Importantly, acute onset of laminar flow stimulates many of the same responses as disturbed shear. However, over longer periods, the cells adapt to the unidirectional shear forces and down-regulate the stress signaling, whereas in the disturbed shear, continual changes in flow magnitude and direction lead to sustained signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Orr et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the in vitro protocol in which cells under static conditions are exposed to an abrupt increase in flow has been widely used as a model for disturbed flow and is particularly useful in analyzing temporal responses to flow.</p><p>EC surfaces are equipped with numerous mechanoreceptors that are capable of detecting and responding to shear stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Traub and Berk, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lehoux et al., 2006</xref>). After activation of mechanoreceptors, a complex network of several intracellular pathways is triggered, a process known as mechanotransduction. Forces from the apical surface must be transmitted through the cytoskeleton to points of attachment that resist shear stress and anchor the cell in place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davies, 1995</xref>). In that regard, both cell&#x02013;cell and cell&#x02013;ECM adhesions have been implicated in shear stress signal transduction. The junction-localized, endothelial-specific cadherin, vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), is required for transducing shear stress&#x02013;dependent signals into the endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shay-Salit et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tzima et al., 2005</xref>). We recently reported that VE-cadherin forms a mechanosensory complex with the EC adhesion molecule PECAM-1 and tyrosine kinase VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), and this minimal complex is necessary for a subset of endothelial shear stress responses, such as the activation of nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF&#x003ba;B) and proinflammatory target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tzima et al., 2005</xref>). In addition to cell&#x02013;cell junctions, cell&#x02013;matrix adhesions have also been implicated in shear stress signaling. Acute onset of laminar flow stimulates the conversion of integrins to a high-affinity state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tzima et al., 2001</xref>) followed by their binding to the subendothelial ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jalali et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tzima et al., 2001</xref>). The newly occupied integrins subsequently activate multiple signaling pathways that lead to cell and cytoskeletal alignment in the direction of flow as well as the activation of NF&#x003ba;B, which is important for the expression of inflammatory genes in the endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jalali et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tzima et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2003</xref>). Importantly, the activation of NF&#x003ba;B by flow is dependent on ECM composition (activated on fibronectin [FN] but not collagen [CL]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Orr et al., 2005</xref>), and certain types of matrix proteins, such as FN, are deposited at the atherosclerosis-prone sites in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sechler et al., 1998</xref>). Although the biochemical and mechanical consequences of integrin- and cadherin-mediated adhesions each have been described, how these adhesions cross-talk and cooperate, especially in response to flow, is less well understood.</p><p>Members of the Shc family of adaptor proteins are key components of the pathways that activate Ras and MAPKs downstream of growth factors, cytokines, integrins, and mechanical forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pelicci et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ravichandran, 2001</xref>). Shc is phosphorylated at tyrosine residues 239/240 and 317 and recruits the adaptor protein Grb2 and the nucleotide exchange factor SOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ravichandran, 2001</xref>). The assembly of Shc&#x02013;Grb2&#x02013;SOS complex provides a mechanism for the activation of Ras and the MAP kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ravichandran, 2001</xref>). In addition, tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc associates with integrins &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, and &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> when they are conjugated to the appropriate ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhattacharya et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wary et al., 1996</xref>). Notably, ShcA is expressed primarily in the cardiovascular system of mouse embryos and is required for normal development of the heart and the vascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lai and Pawson, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that Shc associates with constellations of both cell&#x02013;cell and cell&#x02013;matrix adhesions in response to flow. Furthermore, activation of Shc occurs in areas of disturbed flow and correlates with atherosclerosis in vivo. Finally, we reveal a surprising role for Shc in flow-induced inflammatory signaling. Thus, Shc orchestrates signals from junctional and matrix adhesion complexes to mediate inflammatory signaling in response to fluid flow.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Activation of Shc in atheroprone (AP) areas of the vasculature</title><p>Areas of disturbed flow in vivo are prone to inflammation and atherogenesis. To determine whether Shc is activated in a flow-dependent manner, we performed immunohistochemical analyses in different locations of C57BL/6 mouse aortas using a Shc phospho-Tyr239/240 antibody as a marker. The arch of the aorta, which corresponds to proinflammatory and AP regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Suo et al., 2007</xref>), showed remarkably pronounced phospho-Shc staining. In contrast, the ascending aorta, which is atheroresistant (AR), displayed barely detectable levels of phospho-Shc (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The focal activation of Shc is not caused by differences in Shc expression levels as shown in Fig. S1 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200709176/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200709176/DC1</ext-link>). Thus, activated Shc is localized in regions where blood vessels exhibit sharp curvatures and are therefore more likely to be susceptible to blood turbulence and to develop atherosclerotic lesions. To further test whether the activation of Shc correlates with atherosclerotic lesions in vivo, the ascending aortas from ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and C57BL/6 mice were isolated and processed for immunohistochemistry. ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice develop atherosclerotic lesions throughout the aortic tree, with localization similar to the lesions seen in human atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daugherty, 2002</xref>). Although Shc phosphorylation was robust in ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, particularly in ECs overlying the atherosclerotic lesions, it was almost undetectable in C57BL/6 aorta (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Thus, Shc phosphorylation correlates with atherogenesis and atherosclerosis-prone regions near bifurcations.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Shc phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro.</bold> (A) Aortas were isolated from C57BL/6 mice.

Cells stimulated with prolonged oscillatory flow (which is proinflammatory and atherogenic) showed elevated Shc phosphorylation compared with cells stimulated with extended laminar flow (which is considered antiinflammatory and atheroprotective; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Interestingly, acute onset of laminar shear stimulates many of the same responses as disturbed/oscillatory flow (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200709176/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200709176/DC1</ext-link>). However, in a prolonged laminar shear, these events are down-regulated as cells adapt, whereas in a disturbed shear, they are sustained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Orr et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, a large number of in vitro studies have exploited the acute onset of laminar shear to model AP signaling, and a temporal map of signaling cascades can already be assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chatzizisis et al., 2007</xref>). We therefore used the laminar flow protocol to assay the early responses downstream of Shc. To this end, we first examined whether the rapid initiation of flow also regulates Shc activation in vitro. In bovine aortic ECs (BAECs), Shc phosphorylation was readily detected upon the onset of flow, as assessed by immunoblotting the cell lysates with a phospho-Shc Tyr239/240 antibody (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Notably, all three isoforms of Shc are phosphorylated in response to flow. Immunofluorescence staining showed that a fraction of activated Shc localized to cell&#x02013;cell junctions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>) and colocalized with &#x003b2;-catenin (Fig. S3 A). Flow-induced phosphorylation of Shc Tyr317 was not observed in parallel experiments (unpublished data), which suggests that the downstream signaling elicited by Shc in response to flow is primarily mediated through its phosphorylation at Tyr 239/240.</p></sec><sec><title>Shc associates with components of EC junctions in response to shear stress</title><p>The distinct spatial activation of Shc in response to the onset of flow suggested that Shc might associate with components of interendothelial junctions. Recently, we identified a minimal complex necessary for a subset of EC shear stress responses, which requires PECAM-1, VE-cadherin, and VEGFR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tzima et al., 2005</xref>). To further investigate the role of Shc in shear stress signaling, the association of Shc with crucial components of the VE-cadherin&#x02212;VEGFR2 signaling pathway was examined. Rapid onset of flow induced an acute association of Shc with VE-cadherin as assessed by coimmunoprecipitation assays (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). VEGFR2 was also present in these immune complexes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), which suggests its possible role in Shc activation and the existence of a multiprotein complex induced by shear. Stimulation of ECs with oscillatory flow also induced the formation of a Shc&#x02013;VEGFR2&#x02013;VE-cadherin complex and the localization of activated Shc to junctions (Fig. S3). Importantly, the association of Shc with VE-cadherin was sustained under oscillatory flow (Fig. S3 C), which is similar to the sustained Shc phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Shear-induced interaction of Shc with VE-cadherin and VEGFR-2.</bold> (A) BAECs were subjected to laminar flow for 1 min or left untreated.

Onset of flow triggered an increase in Shc phosphorylation irrespective of the matrix that the cells were plated on (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). To test whether the flow-induced Shc association with cell&#x02013;cell junctions is ECM dependent, immunoprecipitation assays were performed with lysates from cells plated on FN or CL. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>, Shc interaction with VE-cadherin was rapidly enhanced after the onset of flow regardless of the ECM composition.

To test whether Shc is involved in flow-induced extracellular signal&#x02013;regulated kinase (ERK) activation, we suppressed cellular levels of Shc using siRNAs. As depicted in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 (A and B)</xref>, transfection of BAECs with Shc-specific siRNA resulted in a 90&#x02013;95% decrease in the levels of all three isoforms of Shc.

Interestingly, ERK activation was impaired to a similar extent in VE-KO cells when compared with VE-RC cells (unpublished data). In parallel experiments, the activation of another MAPK, p38, was also inhibited by attenuating Shc expression levels with siRNA, although p38 was inhibited to a lesser extent compared with ERK (unpublished data).

The increased Shc phosphorylation in ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> aorta raises the possibility that Shc may participate in the regulation of the inflammatory response elicited by shear stress.

NF&#x003ba;B is normally held inactive in the cytoplasm through its interaction with I&#x003ba;B. Degradation of I&#x003ba;B results in NF&#x003ba;B nuclear targeting and initiation of transcription.

To test whether the Shc-dependent NF&#x003ba;B activation translates to altered gene expression, we assayed expression of both ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Because cellular responses to laminar flow are transient, we examined the expression of these cell adhesion molecules in ECs exposed to oscillatory flow for longer times. As shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 (A and B</xref>), under the extended oscillatory flow condition, although the expressions of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 increased significantly in cells transfected with control siRNA, the up-regulation was strongly inhibited when Shc function was abrogated. Consistent with these observations, monocyte adhesion to EC monolayers was also inhibited as a result of reduced Shc expression levels (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, C and D</xref>). Thus, flow-dependent NF&#x003ba;B nuclear translocation, phosphorylation, target gene expression, and monocyte adhesion correlate closely.

Shc activation occurs in vivo and correlates with areas of disturbed flow and atherogenesis. Shc associates with components of the junctional complexes VE-cadherin and VEGFR2 at early times after the onset of flow and with integrin&#x02013;ECM complexes at later times. The association with integrins requires VE-cadherin and the activation of Shc requires the activities of VEGFR2 and Src, two tyrosine kinases that localize to EC junctions in response to flow. Although Shc phosphorylation and its association with VE-cadherin are ECM independent, Shc binding to integrins occurs only on specific matrices. Depletion of Shc with siRNA inhibits the activation of flow-responsive signaling proteins including ERK and NF&#x003ba;B. The up-regulation of the EC adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, as well as leukocyte adhesion to endothelial monolayers, are also significantly inhibited as a result of reduced Shc expression levels. Interestingly, the activation of downstream ERK signaling is ECM independent whereas the activation of NF&#x003ba;B signaling is ECM specific and correlates with the ECM specificity for the Shc&#x02013;integrin association. Thus, we propose that Shc functions as a molecular switch to orchestrate signals from cell&#x02013;cell and cell&#x02013;matrix adhesions to elicit an inflammatory response in ECs under flow (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig9"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Coordination of cell&#x02013;cell and cell&#x02013;matrix flow-induced inflammatory signals through Shc.</bold> Shc functions as a molecular switch to coordinate signals from cell&#x02013;cell junctions and cell&#x02013;matrix adhesions in the regulation of flow-induced inflammatory responses.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1820185f09"></graphic></fig><p>Coordinated changes between cell adhesions to the ECM and those to neighboring cells are crucial for numerous physical transformations that the cells must undergo during development, tissue homeostasis, and wound healing. Although cell&#x02013;cell junctions and cell&#x02013;matrix adhesions mediate unique downstream signals, integrin and junctional signaling pathways are highly interwoven into complex signaling networks. In the context of shear stress signaling, there are many levels of cross talk. For instance, both cell&#x02013;cell and cell&#x02013;matrix adhesions activate common effectors such as NF&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shay-Salit et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tzima et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Orr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tzima et al., 2005</xref>), ERK and p38 MAPKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Takahashi and Berk, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Osawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shay-Salit et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fleming et al., 2005</xref>), Akt and Src kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Okuda et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fleming et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tzima et al., 2005</xref>), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dusserre et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fleming et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bagi et al., 2005</xref>). Another level of cooperation lies in the commonality of binding partners. VEGFR2 binds to both adherens junctions (through VE-cadherin) and integrins, and thus, at any given time, VEGFR2 may regulate two distinct signaling modules by interacting with either VE-cadherin or &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bussolino et al., 2001</xref>).

We now provide evidence that the adaptor protein Shc plays a critical role in the cross talk between cell&#x02013;cell junctions and integrins during flow.</p><p>The function of Shc in flow may be tightly regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events. Shear stress stimulates the activation of Src kinases, which transactivate VEGFR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jin et al., 2003</xref>). VEGFR2 activation may result in the recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, which is dependent on VE-cadherin. As demonstrated (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), VE-cadherin is required for the association of Shc with integrins, which mediates Ras&#x02013;ERK activation and the flow-dependent transcriptional responses. It is worth noting here that upon VEGF treatment, VE-cadherin becomes phosphorylated and binds to Shc, which is dephosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zanetti et al., 2002</xref>). The functional importance of this association may be that it facilitates Shc dephosphorylation through a VE-cadherin&#x02013;associated phosphatase. In contrast to the stimulation by VEGF, the temporal response of Shc tyrosine phosphorylation induced by shear stress is sustained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>The contribution of Shc to both integrin- and growth factor&#x02013;induced activation of ERK is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wary et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barberis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lai and Pawson, 2000</xref>), but this is the first study to reveal a role for Shc in the inflammatory signaling through NF&#x003ba;B. It has recently been shown that flow-induced NF&#x003ba;B activation is ECM dependent and is only observed in cells plated on FN but not on CL. ECM composition is a crucial factor in atherogenesis and may regulate the early changes in inflammation associated with atherogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Orr et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, NF&#x003ba;B activation in Shc-attenuated cells closely resembles cells plated on CL, whereas cells transfected with control siRNA emulate the FN phenotype observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Orr et al. (2005)</xref>. In addition, the association of Shc with integrins in response to flow is ECM specific (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Taken collectively, these data raise the possibility that Shc may function as a molecular switch to translate ECM specificity into ECs through its regulated interaction with integrin receptors engaged with the appropriate ECM.</p><p>Mutant mice lacking all three Shc isoforms die at embryonic day 11.5 due to cardiovascular defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lai and Pawson, 2000</xref>), whereas mice selectively missing the p66 ShcA isoform are long-lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Migliaccio et al., 1999</xref>) due to the role of p66 Shc in oxidative stress signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pinton et al., 2007</xref>).
