Avoiding solid&#x02013;solid (bare cartilage&#x02013;cartilage) contact, when mechanical loads can reach 18 MPa and are nominally 5 MPa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>), is important for preserving the longevity of the cartilage surface. The most superficial covering of articular cartilage contains a mucinous glycoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) that is expressed by superficial zone chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) and synoviocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). This protein, lubricin, provides lubrication in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Lubricin deficiency in humans causes the autosomal-recessive disorder camptodactyly-arthropathy&#x02013;coxa vara&#x02013;pericarditis syndrome (CACP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), which is associated with precocious joint failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Mice lacking lubricin also develop precocious joint failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) and provide a unique opportunity to study the lubricating behaviors of this glycoprotein in the intact joint. Likewise, synovial fluid (SF) from patients with CACP can be tested for its friction-reducing ability in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>).</p><p>Measurement of whole joint friction has been accomplished previously in pendulum systems in which the pivot point of the joint serves as the fulcrum of a pendulum. Classic work by Charnley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>) established that SF provides lubrication in a boundary mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>), which is independent of articular sliding speed and thus not dependent on joint fluid viscosity. Cartilage lubricated by SF has a very low coefficient of friction (&#x003bc;) of &#x0223c;0.001, which is lower than that of any man-made surface, including Teflon and graphite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). It has been difficult to study the wear of articular cartilage in the absence of lubricin since enzymatic methods to remove lubricin also destroy other cartilage surface components, and since the complex motions of mammalian joints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) are not replicable in vitro. Therefore, we developed a pendulum system to study whole-joint friction characteristics in lubricin-mutant (Prg4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice ex vivo. We complemented these studies with in vitro analyses of SF from patients with CACP, using a latex-on-glass bearing system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) that isolates the conditions of boundary lubrication and replicates lubricating behaviors of cartilage-containing bearings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Finally, since lubricating ability can be studied in noncartilaginous bearings such as mica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) and latex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>), we hypothesized that the atomic force microscope (AFM) could be used to characterize the physicochemical properties of lubricin at the nanoscale, the scale at which boundary lubrication occurs. Our studies show that lubricin reduces friction in vivo as well as in vitro, and suggest that it does so by forming higher-order structures that reduce the work of adhesion between apposing surfaces.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Lubricin-mutant mice</title><p>The generation of mice with heterozygous (Prg4<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup>) and homozygous (Prg4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) loss-of-function mutations of lubricin has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation and harvesting of mouse knee joints</title><p>Hind limbs from Prg4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and Prg4<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> mice were harvested following carbon dioxide asphyxiation.

Loss of lubrication in CACP SF was not due to loss of hyaluronate, since the hyaluronate concentration in the CACP aspirates averaged 5.45 mg/ml (range 3.82&#x02013;7.07), which was similar to (but greater than) that in normal human SF (&#x0223c;2.5 mg/ml).</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>In vitro lubricating abilities of synovial fluid samples. With healthy human synovial fluid (HSF), friction (&#x003bc;) was reduced to &#x0003c;0.02 and continued to decrease over time, likely due to more uniform covering of the in vitro bearing by the SF. In contrast, SF specimens from 6 individual patients with camptodactyly-arthropathy&#x02013;coxa vara&#x02013;pericarditis syndrome (CA1&#x02013;6) did not reduce friction any more than was observed with normal saline (NS).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="art0056-3662-f4"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our electron microscopy studies revealed absence of a lamina splendens, but an otherwise normal-appearing cartilage surface, in newborn Prg4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. By 2 weeks of age, the cartilage surface was no longer smooth, and the parallel orientation of collagen fibrils at the surface was disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>). The incipient damage to the articular surface evident soon after birth suggests that lubricin within the lamina splendens protects the surface from wear by reducing friction. Measurements of whole joint friction (&#x003bc;) in 1-month-old and 2-month-old Prg4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice support this hypothesis, since they were significantly greater than levels in unaffected littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>). However, the &#x003bc; value was only twice as high in Prg4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared with Prg4<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> animals, possibly due to the ability of pressurized interstitial fluid within cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) to contribute to lubrication via a &#x0201c;weeping&#x0201d; mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). These data indicate that small increases in friction are capable of causing damage to cartilage surfaces. Therefore, nongenetic disorders, which cause transient deficiency of lubricin as can occur during inflammation, or localized deficiency of lubricin, as can occur following minor trauma, may also predispose to precocious cartilage failure.</p><p>It may now be possible to test this hypothesis in animal models of inflammation or localized cartilage damage, since the pendulum apparatus we used enables measurement of whole joint lubrication ex vivo without disturbing normal joint architecture. The &#x003bc; values we observed are similar to those obtained by Charnley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>), who used a disarticulated, cadaveric, human ankle joint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). In Charnley's study, swing amplitude versus time showed a linear relationship; this differs from the present results, in which we observed a curvilinear relationship (derived from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1B</xref>). Two likely explanations account for this difference. First, we studied the intact knee joint, in which supporting ligaments, synovium, and SF contribute to pendulum damping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Second, the knee joint is a roller-slider bearing, since the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments do not cross the intraarticular space perfectly. The curvilinear relationship we observed is consistent with a sliding movement at high swing amplitude that transitions to a rolling movement at low amplitude. An advantage of the apparatus we utilized is that it retains these normal movements. This is important since the requirements of lubrication change from lowering &#x003bc; during sliding to reducing adhesion during rolling and static loading. Another advantage of studying the intact joint is that it allows retention of the normal pattern of cartilage deformation that occurs during joint motion. Arthrotripsometers, which load and oscillate annuli of cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) and other bearing materials, such as latex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), are unable to replicate the reciprocating crossed-surface motions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) or the pressurization of cartilage in its natural state.</p><p>To understand how lubricin molecules cover articular cartilage, we visualized purified human lubricin deposited on HOPG, using AFM in the pulsed force mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>). Lubricin is able to self-assemble into a mesh-like network and remain surface active, in that areas of lubricin deposition have low adhesion. As the lubricin concentration increases, the mesh openings of the quaternary structure become smaller but the underlying surface remains visible, indicating that the thin film formed by lubricin is nonuniform, at least on HOPG. The AFM images also afford the opportunity to visualize the formation of a network of lubricin molecules that creates an antiadhesive barrier capable of preventing solid&#x02013;solid contacts, which can otherwise occur in loaded joints. By keeping apposed and flattened articular cartilage asperities separated under load and preventing stick-slip motion, lubricin reduces wear, similar to industrial lubricants such as molybdenum sulfide. The observed sigmoid curve relationship between lubricin concentration and the reduction in work of adhesion of solid interfaces, as measured by PFM, is an indication of the molecules' self-assembly. This supports findings of thermodynamic modeling studies of polymer self-assembly, in which a phase transformation occurs at a critical concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Our results suggest that lubricin forms a nanofilm within the lamina splendens. This is consistent with previous observations that the cartilage surface has a net negative charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), which is removable by serine proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the genetic absence of lubricin also causes SF to lose its lubricating ability in vitro, we compared control SF with SF from 6 patients with CACP. All CACP SF samples failed to reduce friction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4</xref>). Since CACP SF has normal, and even elevated, levels of hyaluronic acid, we can conclude that hyaluronic acid alone does not function as a joint lubricant. Synergism of the 2 macromolecules in reducing &#x003bc; has been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>), and in recent work hyaluronate was shown to reduce friction only when chemically bound to a bearing surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). These observations suggest that lubricin, which has a hyaluronate-binding region, may help anchor hyaluronate to articular cartilage.</p><p>Human lubricin contains a large central, mucin-like domain, comprising &#x0223c;76 repeats of 7 peptide sequences, principally, KEPAPTT, which are sites of extensive <italic>O</italic>-linked &#x003b2;(1&#x02013;3)Gal-GalNAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). This latter posttranslational modification is essential to the protein's lubricating ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), conferring steric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>) and possibly hydration force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>), repulsion. Lubricin's binding to hydrophobic surfaces such as latex and HOPG, and its localization to aliphatic&#x02013;aqueous interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>), are typical of amphipathic polymers. Polysoaps, an amphipathic polymer network, have been shown to possess special properties, including liquid crystalline phases at high concentrations and dense packing of amphiphiles along a polymer backbone, which leads to restricted freedom of conformation and enables steric repulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Properties of polysoap aggregates have been observed in SF: under conditions of pressure between cartilage and glass, SF adopts a liquid crystalline structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). The C-terminus of lubricin may be the origin of surface interactions, including the molecule's ability to interact with articular cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>).</p><p>The genetic disorder CACP, in which the lack of lubricin leads to precocious joint failure in the absence of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), demonstrates the importance of friction reduction. In the mouse model of CACP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), in which precocious joint failure also occurs, there is early loss of superficial zone chondrocytes. We speculate that apoptosis of the superficial zone chondrocytes is a consequence of the increased mechanical load that follows a loss of lubricating ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Therefore, acquired deficiency of lubricin or localized disruption of lubricin at the cartilage surface, as can occur in inflammatory joint conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>) or traumatic joint injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>), may be the initiating event in more common forms of joint failure. Preventing lubricin degradation may serve to delay joint failure in inflammatory arthritis, and resurfacing damaged cartilage with lubricin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>) may delay further damage at those sites. Biomolecules, such as lubricin, may also supplement man-made materials in applications in which low friction and surface protection are required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>Dr. Jay had full access to all of the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.</p><p><bold>Study design.</bold> Jay, Torres, Rhee, Elsaid, Warman.</p><p><bold>Acquisition of data.</bold> Jay, Torres, Rhee, Helminen, Hyttinen, Cha, Elsaid, Cui, Warman.</p><p><bold>Analysis and interpretation of data.</bold> Jay, Torres, Helminen, Hytinnen, Elsaid, Kim, Warman.</p><p><bold>Manuscript preparation.</bold> Jay, Torres, Helminen, Cha, Elsaid, Kim, Warman.</p><p><bold>Statistical analysis.</bold> Jay, Torres.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr. Martin Lotz for providing normal human synovial fluid, Dr. Thomas Bliss for providing human synovial fluid for lubricin purification, and Dr. Jacob Israelachvili for constructive discussions.
