However, few studies have analyzed centromere assembly during mammalian meiosis. This study specifically targets this approach on mouse spermatocytes. We have found that during prophase I, the proteins of the chromosomal passenger complex Borealin, INCENP, and Aurora-B load sequentially to the inner centromere before Shugoshin 2 and MCAK. The last proteins to be assembled are the outer kinetochore proteins BubR1 and CENP-E. All these proteins are not detected at the centromere during anaphase/telophase I and are then reloaded during interkinesis. The loading sequence of the analyzed proteins is similar during prophase I and interkinesis. These findings demonstrate that the interkinesis stage, regularly overlooked, is essential for centromere and kinetochore maturation and reorganization previous to the second meiotic division. We also demonstrate that Shugoshin 2 is necessary for the loading of MCAK at the inner centromere, but is dispensable for the loading of the outer kinetochore proteins BubR1 and CENP-E.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The centromere is a chromosome domain essential for the correct partitioning of chromosomes during mitotic and meiotic cell divisions. The characterization of the centromeric proteins and their sequential assembly have been extensively studied in mammalian mitosis, since defective chromosome segregation is associated with birth defects and cancer. However, few studies have analyzed the centromere assembly during meiosis, a special cell division leading to the production of haploid gametes. Here, we analyze the sequence of loading of several centromeric and kinetochoric proteins during male mouse meiosis. We show that during both meiotic divisions, the proteins of the chromosomal passenger complex Borealin, INCENP, and Aurora-B load sequentially to the inner centromere before Shugoshin 2 and MCAK. The outer kinetochore proteins BubR1 and CENP-E are the last ones to be assembled. We also demonstrate, using a knockout mouse for <italic>Sgol2</italic>, that the inner centromeric protein Shugoshin 2 is dispensable for the loading of the outer kinetochore proteins BubR1 and CENP-E, but necessary for the assembly of MCAK.

Errors in chromosome segregation result in aneuploid daughter cells which are prone to become malignant. The centromere is the chromosome domain that directs this segregation process since it is involved in relevant events such as sister-chromatid cohesion, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), the attachment to spindle microtubules (MTs) and chromosome movements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Cleveland1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Maiato1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The centromere is structurally divided into the kinetochore and the inner centromere domains.

In vertebrates, this domain is subdivided into three distinct regions: the inner, the central and the outer kinetochore plates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Cheeseman1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Heit1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Rieder1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The inner kinetochore plate is formed by the chromatin subjacent to the kinetochore, in which histone H3 is replaced by CENP-A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Shelby1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Palmer1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, and additional constitutive proteins that appear at kinetochores throughout the cell cycle. On the other hand, the outer kinetochore plate and the fibrous corona, detected only in prometaphase, are mainly composed of MT motor proteins, such as CENP-E and cytoplasmic dynein, as well as SAC proteins, as for instance Bub1, BubR1, Mad1 and Mad2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Cheeseman1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Heit1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Kops1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Rieder1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The inner centromere domain is the region spanning between sister kinetochores. Several proteins with different functions have been localized in this region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Ruchaud1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Some proteins like CENP-B are constitutive, while many others are incorporated to the inner centromere at specific cell cycle stages. This is the case for the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) proteins INCENP, the kinase Aurora-B, Survivin and Borealin/Dasra. The CPC has been involved in many different functions such as chromatin modifications (through the phosphorylation of histone H3), correction of kinetochore attachment errors, the SAC, the assembly of a stable bipolar spindle, and completion of cytokinesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Ruchaud1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Vagnarelli1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Another group of inner centromere proteins are the cohesin complexes that maintain sister chromatids tightly associated until their segregation in anaphase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Onn1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Peters1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

While constitutive proteins of the inner kinetochore are present all along the cell cycle, some of the inner centromere proteins are loaded during prophase and most outer kinetochore proteins are assembled during prometaphase after nuclear envelope breakdown. Thereafter, most of these proteins are released from the centromere and the kinetochore after the inactivation of the SAC during anaphase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-McCleland1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Maiato2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. CENP-A has a crucial role in centromere specification and kinetochore assembly since most kinetochore proteins need, either directly or indirectly, its presence to be properly incorporated to the kinetochore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Heit1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Maiato2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Black1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

There is an ongoing controversy over whether CENP-A is required for the localization of Aurora-B.

CENP-A also seems to condition the localization of MCAK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Liu1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, Bub1 is necessary for the accurate localization of MCAK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Liu1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, the stability and correct positioning of CPC, and the binding of Shugoshin to the inner centromere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Boyarchuk1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Regarding the CPC, different studies have revealed that Borealin, INCENP, Aurora-B and Survivin form a complex in which each subunit seems to be necessary for the loading of the others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Ruchaud1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, and the immunodepletion of any of them caused the removal of the others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Bolton1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

Alternatively, it has also been suggested that SGOL2 is needed for the correct loading of the CPC proteins in yeast since, in its absence, Aurora-B can not be targeted to the centromeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Vanoosthuyse1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Kawashima1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this study, we have analyzed the loading sequence of the inner centromere proteins Borealin, INCENP, Aurora-B, SGOL2, and MCAK, and the outer kinetochore proteins CENP-E and BubR1, during both male mouse meiotic divisions. Additionally, we have used a knockout mouse for <italic>Sgol2</italic> to analyze the influence of this protein in the loading of MCAK and the outer kinetochore proteins CENP-E and BubR1.

However, most of the inner centromere and outer kinetochore proteins are loaded at different times during both meiotic divisions. In order to delineate the loading sequence of the CPC proteins Borealin, INCENP, and Aurora-B we made double immunolabelings on spermatocytes. Unfortunately, we were unable to detect Survivin even though we used several antibodies.</p><p>The double immunolabeling of INCENP and SYCP3, a structural component of synaptonemal complex lateral elements, allowed us to determine previously that INCENP labels the synaptonemal complex central element from zygotene up to mid/late pachytene when it begins to relocalize to heterochromatic chromocenters, while Aurora-B appears at chromocenters later in diplotene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Parra2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.

The chromocenters represent clustered centromere heterochromatic regions that are clearly discerned after DAPI staining, and located at the nuclear periphery. However, since we have projected different focal planes through the spermatocytes, some chromocenters appear in the middle of the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000417-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). In other pachytene spermatocytes, Borealin and INCENP colocalized at chromocenters whereas INCENP was also visualized at synaptonemal complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000417-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>). Taking into account these results we considered that Borealin first appeared at early pachytene, while INCENP began to redistribute from synaptonemal complexes to chromocenters in mid pachytene. These proteins colocalized at centromeres from mid pachytene up to late anaphase I. The labeling of INCENP at synaptonemal complexes became undetectable at late pachytene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000417-g001">Figure 1E and 1F</xref>) as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Parra2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, we did not know the relative loading sequence of these two proteins. Since we had found that Aurora-B was the last CPC protein loaded at centromeres, we used it as a marker to ascertain the loading time of SGOL2 and MCAK. During early diplotene, when Aurora-B labeled the chromocenters, no labeling was found for SGOL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000417-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>) or MCAK (data not shown).

On the other hand, when spermatocytes where double immunolabeled for SGOL2 and MCAK, some of them only showed SGOL2 labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000417-g002">Figure 2E and 2F</xref>), while in other ones both proteins colocalized at centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000417-g002">Figure 2G and 2H</xref>). Thus, SGOL2 is loaded at centromeres during late diplotene, and MCAK loads later at very late diplotene or in early diakinesis.

Our observations lead us to propose a sequence of assembly for those proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000417-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The first group of proteins that we have detected at the centromeric region, excluding the kinetochoric constitutive ones detected by the ACA serum, are the CPC proteins. During prophase I, these proteins are loaded at the inner centromere between early pachytene and early diplotene. Although it has been previously established that during mitosis the presence of all CPC subunits is necessary for the assembly of the complex at the inner centromere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Ruchaud1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, we have detected that during meiosis Borealin, Aurora-B and INCENP are loaded in a precise sequence. Thus, Borealin was the first CPC protein that we found at the heterochromatic chromocenters during early pachytene, followed by INCENP and Aurora-B during mid pachytene and early diplotene, respectively. It has been described that Borealin can bind DNA <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Klein1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, but it is still unknown if it has any affinity for centromeric DNA. However, Borealin could initiate the sequence of CPC assembly to the inner centromere during meiosis. In this sense, it might bind to the pericentromeric DNA and trigger the loading of the remaining CPC proteins. The next CPC protein in the meiosis assembly sequence, INCENP, presents an N-terminal domain that binds Borealin and Survivin that when depleted prevents their association to the inner centromere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Klein1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Gassmann1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, during meiosis INCENP could also interact with Borealin, and presumably also Survivin, by its N-terminal domain. We have to highlight that INCENP is initially detected at the central element of the synaptonemal complex during zygotene, and relocalizes to the centromeric region by mid pachytene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Parra2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. We do not know whether INCENP may play any specific role at the synaptonemal complex or is just waiting to be assembled at the inner centromere.

This fact suggests that once INCENP is targeted to the inner centromere, Aurora-B would then be loaded.</p><fig id="pgen-1000417-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000417.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Loading sequence of different inner centromere and outer kinetochore proteins throughout mouse prophase I.</title><p>A single telocentric bivalent with homologs in light and dark grey is depicted.

Interestingly, after the SGOL2 loading, the CPC proteins then change their distribution to become restricted to a smaller area that at that time colocalizes with SGOL2. It has been recently proposed that during fission yeast mitosis and budding yeast meiosis Sgo2 and Sgo1 are required, respectively, for the recruitment of some CPC components to the centromere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Vanoosthuyse1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Kawashima1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Yu1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this sense, our results indicate that during mouse meiosis the CPC proteins are loaded to centromeric heterochromatin without the participation of SGOL2, but their redistribution from the centromeric heterochromatin to the inner centromere occurs after the loading of SGOL2.</p><p>After the loading of SGOL2, and concomitantly with the relocalization of the CPC proteins, we detected the incorporation of MCAK to centromeres.

Thus, the relocalization of the CPC and the loading of MCAK could involve a reorganization of the centromere in preparation for microtubule interactions. The temporal localization of SGOL2 may indicate its key role in such centromere reorganization, and/or in the recruitment of other inner centromere proteins like MCAK. Indeed, it has been reported that in HeLa cells SGOL2 recruits MCAK to the inner centromere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Huang1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

These proteins are released from the inner centromere during interkinesis and are not visualized during meiosis II, thus suggesting that they are not essential for centromere behavior during meiosis II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Parra4">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. By contrast, all the proteins analyzed in this study are incorporated again at the centromere during the interkinesis stage with the same loading sequence as during meiosis I. This fact strongly suggests that the structural assembly of the centromere follows a pattern that is conserved in both meiotic divisions. However, important differences may be highlighted, since the assembly of the centromere during meiosis I is initiated during late prophase I, while the assembly for meiosis II takes place during interkinesis. This reveals that the underestimated interkinesis is not just a resting stage between the two meiotic divisions, but a crucial period during mammalian male meiosis, for, at least, chromosome and centromere reorganization for the second meiotic division.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Squashing of Seminiferous Tubules and Immunofluorescence Microscopy</title><p>Testes from adult normal C57BL/6 and <italic>Sgol2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000417-Llano1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref> male mice were used.
