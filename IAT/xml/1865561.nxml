Aberrations in the expression of imprinted genes on human Chromosome 7 have been suggested to play a role in the etiologies of Russell-Silver Syndrome and autism. We describe the imprinting of <italic>KLF14</italic>, an intronless member of the Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like family of transcription factors located at Chromosome 7q32.

In addition, we perform chromatin immunoprecipitation and find that the murine <italic>Klf14</italic> CpG island lacks allele-specific histone modifications. Despite the absence of these defining features, our analysis of <italic>Klf14</italic> in offspring from <italic>DNA methyltransferase 3a</italic> conditional knockout mice reveals that the gene's expression is dependent upon a maternally methylated region.

In this study, we identify a novel imprinted gene, named <italic>KLF14</italic>, on human Chromosome 7. It is predicted to bind DNA and regulate transcription and was shown to be expressed from the maternally inherited chromosome in all human and mouse tissues examined.

This genetically heterogeneous disorder, which is characterized by intrauterine and postnatal growth restriction as well as dysmorphic facial features, has been associated with numerous chromosomal rearrangements and anomalies. Most recently, hypomethylation of the imprinting control region (ICR) at Chromosome 11p15 has been associated with RSS &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030065-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.

To distinguish the two parental alleles, a G/A polymorphism corresponding to nucleotide 451 of AK030435 was identified. Equal peak heights of the two alleles were observed in sequencing electropherograms from PCR-amplified genomic DNA of BL6 &#x000d7; JF1 <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> hybrids, indicating lack of amplification bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030065-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). cDNA from the <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> hybrids was amplified, the products were sequenced, and allelic expression was analyzed in an intronless PCR fragment amplified by primers AK030435F/AK030435R. Due to the intronless nature of the amplicon, samples without reverse transcriptase were also prepared to account for the possibility of genomic DNA contamination. By use of reciprocal crosses of hybrid mice, monoallelic expression of the maternal allele was identified in all tissues examined, as noted by the expression of a single peak at the position corresponding to the G/A polymorphism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030065-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). In addition, <italic>Klf14</italic> was found to be imprinted in tissues extracted from 9.5 dpc embryos and neonates (unpublished data), indicating that the imprinted expression of <italic>Klf14</italic> is not developmental-stage specific and is an imprint established early in development.</p><p>To distinguish parental alleles of human <italic>KLF14,</italic> DNA derived from fetal samples was genotyped for a C/T polymorphism at nucleotide 336 of NM&#x0005f;138693, and three fetuses heterozygous for the polymorphism were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030065-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). cDNA corresponding to <italic>KLF14</italic> was sequenced, and the expression of the alleles was noted. Monoallelic expression of <italic>KLF14</italic> was observed in lung (fetus number 66), heart (fetus number 65), tongue, stomach, eye, intestine, and placental samples (fetus number 62).

Though such modifications are a feature of preferential expression when found in the promoter, they are integral at the level of ICRs. The unmethylated allele of ICRs is associated with &#x0201c;open chromatin&#x0201d; marks, such as the acetylation of histones and dimethylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4me2). In contrast, the methylated allele of ICRs is characterized by heterochromatic features, such as hypoacetylation of lysine 9 on histone 3 (H3K9ac), trimethylation of lysine 9 on histone 3 (H3K9me3), and trimethylation of lysine 20 on histone 4 (H4K20me3) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030065-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030065-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;.

We postulate that <italic>KLF14</italic> acquired imprinting through <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans-</italic>acting elements associated with the more ancient <italic>MEST,</italic> which is known to be imprinted in marsupials &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030065-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;. This would allow the host eutherian mammal to adapt to the increased gene dosage caused by the retrotransposition of <italic>KLF16</italic>. By analyzing the expression and epigenetic modifications of <italic>KLF14</italic> and other retrotransposed genes in eutherian mammals, it may be possible to elucidate the mechanism whereby these genes have acquired imprinted expression and the control elements upon which their imprinting depend.</p><p><italic>KLF14</italic>, unlike its closest relatives in the KLF family of genes, has a large CpG island spanning the vast majority of its ORF. At the same time, the gene is enriched for proline and arginine amino acids, which are encoded by the codons CCN and CGN, respectively. Hence, it is plausible that, upon the retrotransposition of <italic>KLF16,</italic> the fusion of the proline/arginine-rich exons created a CG-rich region, which is predicted to be a CpG island, yet lacks the biological functions generally associated with such regions. Such an occurrence would also account for the absence of epigenetic modifications observed in the CpG island. Thus, we cannot exclude the existence of a CG-neutral differentially methylated promoter or additional exons upstream of the <italic>KLF14</italic> ORF. However, attempts to identify the 5&#x02032;&#x02032; end of the gene in both human and mouse were fruitless (unpublished data).</p><p>The variability observed in the <italic>KLF14</italic> ORF in humans, particularly the three fixed nonsynonymous changes and two nonsynonymous SNPs with higher frequencies of the derived allele, are suggestive of positive selection. A recent investigation of selection in the human and chimpanzee genomes identified <italic>KLF14</italic> as a gene that has undergone adaptive evolution in the human genome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030065-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;. However, our detailed analyses of this gene failed to provide significant results in tests for positive selection, even when the gene was divided into the variable N terminus and the conserved C-terminal zinc-finger domains (unpublished data). Since the null hypothesis of neutrality could not be rejected, the evolution observed in <italic>KLF14</italic> could be due to relaxed functional constraint. The lack of significance observed may be caused by limitations in the analyses due to the gene's small size or by ongoing positive selection, as observed in previous studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030065-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;. Evidence for the latter lies in the numerous polymorphisms that are not fixed in the human lineage. Further experiments, such as the Extended Haplotype Homozygosity method &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030065-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d; are needed to elucidate whether selection is active at this locus.</p><p>While we cannot reject neutrality or provide conclusive evidence that <italic>KLF14</italic> is under positive selection, we demonstrate that this gene has undergone accelerated evolution in the human lineage. It is important to note that although the dN/dS values corresponding to the human lineage are &#x0003e;1, this accelerated evolution may in fact be caused by a relaxation of purifying selection. Although such a relaxation is unlikely, due to <italic>KLF14</italic>'s conservation throughout mammalian evolution, the gene's functional significance may have changed or decreased within the human lineage, allowing for multiple mutations to accumulate in nonsynonymous sites.</p><p>Numerous studies have focused their efforts on the identification of genes under positive selection or accelerated evolution in the human species &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030065-b061">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030065-b063">63</xref>&#x0005d; and have found that several functional categories, including transcription factors, are enriched for rapidly evolving transcripts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030065-b062">62</xref>&#x0005d;. Since <italic>KLF14</italic> had not been fully sequenced in the chimpanzee, and possibly due to the gene's size, these studies did not detect positive selection in the transcript. Thus, our analysis of <italic>KLF14</italic> adds to the mounting body of literature suggesting that transcription factors are often evolving rapidly or with positive selection. However, <italic>KLF14</italic> stands alone in this category due to its imprinting, which may have played a role in the evolution of this transcript. Previous papers have also failed to find evidence of positive selection across imprinted genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030065-b064">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030065-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Our data suggest that the <italic>KLF14</italic> sequence is highly variable, specifically in the human species. We propose that this variability may be due to the transcript's monoallelic expression, which allows for the accumulation of mutations on the silenced allele. Maternal inheritance of mutated alleles would give rise to their expression and deleterious mutations would face strong purifying selection due to haploinsufficiency. In contrast, beneficial mutations would undergo stronger and more rapid positive selection since their impact would be greater due to the gene's monoallelic expression. The latter phenomenon has been implicated in the increased rate of nonsynonymous substitution on the X chromosome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030065-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d;. Consequently, the inherited variations seen in <italic>KLF14</italic> should be nondeleterious and possibly advantageous. This is supported by the fact that the haplotypes carrying rare alleles are transmitted from both mothers and fathers and are consequently expressed in healthy individuals, as evidenced in the unaffected siblings of RSS and autism patients. All of these sequence variations, with the exception of a synonymous polymorphism observed in haplotype 6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030065-sg001">Figure S1</xref>), occur in the N-terminal end of the putative protein that has low sequence conservation, suggesting that variation in the C-terminal end of the protein may not be tolerated.</p><p>In 2004, Dorus and colleagues examined the evolutionary rates of nervous system-related genes between primates and rodents, thereby identifying genes under accelerated evolution in primates. They proposed that these genes may have played important roles in human speciation by developing human behavior and brain size &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030065-b061">61</xref>&#x0005d;. Consequently, the disruption of genes under accelerated evolution or positive selection in the human lineage has been associated with disease. For example, mutations in <italic>FOXP2</italic> underlie severe language and speech impairment/developmental verbal dyspraxia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030065-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030065-b067">67</xref>&#x0005d;, while <italic>Microcephalin</italic> and <italic>ASPM</italic> are associated with microcephaly &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030065-b068">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030065-b069">69</xref>&#x0005d;. Due to <italic>KLF14</italic>'s increased expression in neuronal cells, as well as the accelerated evolution observed in the human lineage, this gene may have played a role in the acquisition of human-specific traits. Such a function would agree with our hypothesis postulated above, describing the role of imprinting in the variability of the gene. Despite being imprinted in ancestral mammals, we observe that the evolutionary aspects of <italic>KLF14</italic> are unique to the human lineage. This observation could be due to selective pressures unique to this species, and possibly unique to demographic populations within the human population, which have accelerated the evolution of the gene. Consequently, the variations seen in <italic>KLF14</italic> may be beneficial to humans or subpopulations of the human species, particularly the variations that are fixed or are going towards fixation. However, further studies are required to determine the gene's function in the brain, particularly in neurons, to assess its contribution to human speciation and its putative role in cognitive disease.</p><p>Although, the sequencing of the <italic>KLF14</italic> ORF in autistic individuals and RSS patients did not identify mutations unique to these populations, it does not rule out the involvement of <italic>KLF14</italic> in these phenotypes since mutations may be present in regulatory regions causing changes in expression levels, loss of imprinting, or transcript instability. Due to the lack of <italic>KLF14</italic> expression in lymphoblasts, we were unable to quantify transcript levels in patients, nor were we able to verify imprinted expression in these patients. Future studies may ascertain the involvement of <italic>KLF14</italic> in these disorders by obtaining fibroblast cells from patients, thereby elucidating the role of both imprinted genes and positively selected genes on development and cognitive function, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>RT-PCR using RNA from somatic cell hybrids, human tissues, and murine embryonic samples.</title><p>cDNA was obtained and amplified from somatic cell hybrids&#x02013;cell lines and human tissues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030065-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.

ChIP was performed using formaldehyde fixed chromatin. Antibodies against histone 3 acetylated at lysines 9 and 14 (H3K9acK14ac), histone 4 acetylated at lysines 5, 8, 12, and 16 (H4ac), and H3K4me2 were used in the ChIP assay. Precipitated DNAs were PCR amplified using primers specific to the CpG islands of <italic>Mest</italic> and <italic>Klf14</italic> and subsequently digested as shown in (A). DNA before immunoprecipitation (input) and the product obtained with no antibody (N.C.) were also included in the analysis. The difference in band intensities between the precipitated products and input DNA reveals that there is preferential precipitation of H3K9acK14ac, H4ac, and H3K4me2 on the paternal allele of the <italic>Mest</italic> CpG island, but no allelic differences were detected at the <italic>Klf14</italic> region.</p><p>(C) Analysis of histone modifications by native-ChIP in whole embryos of BL6 &#x000d7; JF1 hybrids. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated using antibodies against H3K9ac, H3K4me2, H3K9me3, and H4K20me3. Anti-chicken was used as a nonspecific antibody (mock). Input DNA is denoted by I. Antibody-bound and unbound fractions of the precipitate are denoted by B and U, respectively. Precipitated DNA was PCR amplified using the same primers as in (B). The amplified DNA was analyzed by single strand conformation polymorphism.

In wild-type mice (upper panel), the maternally methylated CpG island in <italic>Mest</italic> (black circle) silences the expression of the gene from the maternal allele (M), while <italic>Klf14</italic> is actively transcribed on this allele. The opposite pattern of expression is seen on the paternal strand (P), because of the unmethylated CpG island (white circle). In <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> &#x02212;/&#x0002b; embryos (lower panel), maternal methylation of the <italic>Mest</italic> CpG island is lost, causing increased expression of <italic>Mest</italic> and loss of expression of <italic>Klf14</italic>.</p><p>(F) Bisulfite sequencing results from 12.5-dpc whole embryos of BL6 &#x000d7; JF1 hybrids.

Hollow circles and black circles indicate unmethylated and methylated CpG dinucleotides, respectively (N, could not be determined). Each row of circles represents CpGs in an individual PCR product clone. In each block, the top section and bottom sections correspond to clones from the maternal allele (BL6) and paternal (JF1) alleles, respectively, as determined by use of polymorphisms.
