We investigated the effects of chronic 21 day isolation of Wistar rats on the extrinsic negative feedback part of HPA axis: hippocampus (HIPPO) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). In addition to serum corticosterone (CORT), we followed GR subcellular localization, GR phosphorylation at serine 232 and serine 246, expression of GR regulated genes: GR, CRF and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), and activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Cdk5 kinases that phosphorylate GR. These parameters were also determined in animals subjected to acute 30&#x0200a;min immobilization, which was taken as &#x02018;normal&#x02019; adaptive response to stress. In isolated animals, we found decreased CORT, whereas in animals exposed to acute immobilization, CORT was markedly increased. Even though the GR was predominantly localized in the nucleus of HIPPO and PFC in acute, but not in chronic stress, the expression of GR, CRF, and BDNF genes was similarly regulated under both acute and chronic stresses. Thus, the transcriptional activity of GR under chronic isolation did not seem to be exclusively dependent on high serum CORT levels nor on the subcellular location of the GR protein. Rather, it resulted from the increased Cdk5 activation and phosphorylation of the nuclear GR at serine 232 and the decreased JNK activity reflected in decreased phosphorylation of the nuclear GR at serine 246. Our study suggests that this nuclear isoform of hippocampal and cortical GR may be related to hypocorticism i.e. HPA axis hypoactivity under chronic isolation stress.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="CS200">Wellcome Trust</funding-source><award-id rid="CS200">069024</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="CS1">Ministry of Sciences of Serbia</funding-source><award-id rid="CS1">ON143042B</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Response to neuroendocrine stress begins with the activation of the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal (HPA) axis leading to the increase in stress hormones glucocorticoids (GCs). These hormones mediate adaptation to stress and also regulate termination of the stress response through the intrinsic and extrinsic negative feedback action at the level of the HPA axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Kloet &#x00026; Reul 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Magarinos <italic>et al</italic>. 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Diorio <italic>et al</italic>. 1993</xref>). Feedback response in the extrinsic HPA axis structures hippocampus (HIPPO) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) is regulated by the GC receptor (GR), which, in the absence of hormone, resides in the cytoplasmic compartment as heterocomplex with heat shock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sanchez <italic>et al</italic>. 1990</xref>). Upon ligand binding, GR dissociates from the heterocomplex, translocates to the nucleus, and regulates neuronal target gene expression, including downregulation of the GR itself. However, under chronic stress this feedback sometimes becomes deregulated leading to the variety of maladaptive syndromes such as anxiety and various forms of depressive disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sapolsky <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>). In addition to regulating its own gene expression, GR also controls expression of other brain genes, such as corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), and cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goujon <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schulkin <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morsink <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schulte-Herbruggen <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). The GR transcriptional activity is dependent on the cell type, the sequence of the GC response elements, presence of coactivators or corepressors, and on post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weigel &#x00026; Moore 2007</xref>).</p><p>The rat GR is phosphorylated at threonine 171 (T171), serine 224 (S224), serine 232 (S232), or serine 246 (S246), which are all located in its N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krstic <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>). Several protein kinases phosphorylate GR at the specific sites, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krstic <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ismaili &#x00026; Garabedian 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kino <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). It has been reported that in heterologous systems, such as yeast strains that carry defective CDK homologues, GR exhibits decreased transcriptional activity suggesting that these kinases exert a stimulatory effect on GR. GR is also targeted by glycogen synthase kinase-3 that phosphorylates GR at Thr171 and this phosphorylation is shown to inhibit GR-mediated transcription, whereas mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family member JNK was reported to phosphorylate GR at S246 and also has a suppressive effect on GR function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rogatsky <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ismaili &#x00026; Garabedian 2004</xref>). The GR phosphorylation was further reported to be involved not only in the regulation of its transcriptional activity, but also in the regulation of its subcellular localization and protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krstic <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Webster <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rogatsky <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ismaili &#x00026; Garabedian 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Davies <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>).</p><p>The role of the mentioned kinases, particularly of MAPKs, in the brain was related to the regulation of neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, as well as to the consolidation of memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ortiz <italic>et al</italic>. 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Flood <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grewal <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sweatt 2001</xref>).

The capability of JNKs to phosphorylate GR implied their regulatory role in the central nervous system (CNS) stress response. In addition to that, recent reports document the role of one of the members of Cdk family, Cdk5, in the regulation of nervous system functions via GR-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kino <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cruz &#x00026; Tsai 2004</xref>).</p><p>In accordance with the above-mentioned reports in the current study, we exploited chronic 21 day isolation stress in Wistar male rats as a model of possible maladaptive stress. In this model, we analyzed GR subcellular localization, GR phosphorylation at serine 232 (GRS232) and at serine 246 (GRS246), and alterations in GR, CRF, and BDNF mRNA in the upper CNS regulatory structures HIPPO and PFC, which are related to the GR-mediated negative feedback regulation of the HPA axis activity. In parallel, the changes in protein expression of Cdk5 and its activators p35 and p25, as well as protein expression and phosphorylation of JNK1 and JNK2/3, were recorded. These parameters were also determined in Wistar males subjected to acute 30&#x0200a;min immobilization taken as &#x02018;normal&#x02019; adaptive response to stress. Finally, the alterations in normal stress response after chronic stress experience were investigated by the combination of the two treatments mentioned above (&#x02018;combined stress&#x02019;). The combined stress model was used to test whether chronic stress caused irreversible alterations, which could potentially indicate that this form of stress is maladaptive.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animal care and treatment</title><p>All experiments were performed in adult (3 months old) Wistar male rats (body mass 330&#x02013;400&#x0200a;g) housed four per standard size cage with access to food (commercial rat pellets) and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>.

Cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) phosphorylate S224 and S232 of the rat GR, whereas JNK pathway has been shown to phosphorylate S246 amino acid. It has been suggested that phosphorylation of these residues is of importance in the regulation of the GR transcriptional activity and the target gene specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Blind &#x00026; Garabedian 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Davies <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). In the next series of experiments, we observed the increased level of GRS232 phosphorylation in both cytoplasmic and nuclear HIPPO extracts following acute and chronic stresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>A, B second panel, and D). In animals subjected to the combined stress, GRS232 was similar to the control level in both compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>D). On the other hand, both cytoplasmic and nuclear GRS246 phosphorylation levels were lower than control in most samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>A, B first panel, and D). The pGR232/246 ratio was determined in order to quantitatively compare the extent of GR phosphorylation at S232 or S246 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>D). The ratio values above 100% indicated the dominance of GRS232 phosphorylation, while values below 100% suggested the prevalence of GRS246 phosphorylation. This approach indicated that GR phosphorylation at S232 is predominant compared with that at S246, independent of the type of stress or cellular compartment analyzed. The only exception was that of the cytoplasmic GR in the combined stress, which was equally phosphorylated at both S232 and S246 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>D).

Such alterations were observed under conditions of chronic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chrousos &#x00026; Kino 2007</xref>). In the present <italic>in vivo</italic> study, we exploited the Wistar rat model to investigate chronic stress-dependent GR alterations in HIPPO and PFC, the two CNS structures known to participate in the HPA axis homeostatic regulation. We analyzed stress-dependent GR redistribution and its transcriptional activity after the chronic 21 day social isolation that represented potentially maladaptive stress. In animals subjected to this type of stress, we found a decreased level of CORT in the blood serum compared with the control animals. This finding is in accordance with the data of other authors showing HPA axis hypoactivity in Wistar rats under similar conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sanchez <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Malkesman <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). In the group of animals exposed to acute 30&#x0200a;min immobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garcia <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>), applied either solely or after the chronic stress, we found a significantly increased level of serum CORT. The prominent increase in CORT after acute immobilization was expected, since this type of stress is of high intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garcia <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>). Thus, animals with previous chronic stress experience did not exhibit compromised HPA axis responsiveness to the subsequent acute stress as concluded from the observed hormone levels.</p><p>The analysis of the tGR protein levels in HIPPO indicated that in accordance with the well-known &#x02018;dogma&#x02019; of the molecular mechanism of GR action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nishi &#x00026; Kawata 2006</xref>), this protein was translocated from the cytoplasmic to the nuclear compartment when CORT levels were elevated, i.e. under acute or combined stress. In agreement with that, under the chronic stress, when CORT levels were low, tGR levels in the cytoplasm and nucleus of HIPPO remain indistinguishable from the control. Thus, our results suggested that chronic stress did not compromise the ability of GR to undergo nuclear translocation upon subsequent acute stress, i.e. when hormone level is increased.</p><p>However, under the chronic stress, despite of unaltered level of the nuclear tGR, this protein exhibited significant transcriptional activity regarding the expression of its own gene, as well as the expression of CRF and BDNF genes, which are two other well-known GR targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tapia-Arancibia <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lu &#x00026; Cidlowski 2006</xref>). This nuclear tGR activity under chronic stress was comparable with the one observed under acute stress, i.e. when CORT levels were high and increased levels of the GR were found in the nucleus. Namely, under both acute and chronic stresses, similar downregulation of GR gene and upregulation of CRH gene were detected. Moreover, while BDNF was unaltered by acute stress, it was downregulated under chronic stress. These findings suggested that the transcriptional activity of GR did not seem to be regulated solely by the levels of hormone. In order to further investigate this process, we followed the GR phosphorylation status that is one important level of control of the GR transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krstic <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rogatsky <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ismaili &#x00026; Garabedian 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Davies <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). Specifically, we monitored GR phosphorylation at the two GR amino acids S232 and S246, which are known to be modified by CDK and JNK kinases respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Orti <italic>et al</italic>. 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krstic <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Webster <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rogatsky <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ismaili &#x00026; Garabedian 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Davies <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). We hypothesized that the pattern of GR phosphorylation, particularly that of the nuclear GR, might be related to GR transcriptional activity at the three target genes studied.</p><p>Under chronic stress, we observed an increase in GR phosphorylation at S232 in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments of HIPPO, which corresponded well with the elevated levels of Cdk5 activator proteins p35 and p25. Considering that association of Cdk5 with p35 as well as its association with p25 is critical for kinase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tsai <italic>et al</italic>. 1994</xref>), our results indicated that Cdk5 activity could be increased in the both cell compartments under chronic stress. Further analyses indicated that at the same time chronic stress decreased GR phosphorylation at S246 in both cell compartments. The decrease in nuclear GRS246 phosphoisoform level corresponded well with downregulation of JNK2/3 activities under the chronic stress. Taken together, these results suggest that increase in GRS232 phosphorylation may be at least in part due to diminished phosphorylation of GR at S246, i.e. higher activity of Cdk5 relative to that of JNKs at the level of GR. This is in accordance with data of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ismaili &#x00026; Garabedian (2004)</xref> that the decrease in GRS246 phosphorylation may stimulate that at GRS232. As an additional measure of the GR phosphorylation status, we determined GRS232/GRS246 ratio and observed the clear prevalence of nuclear GRS232 isoform under chronic stress. This GR phosphoisoform may be important for BDNF and GR gene repressions and CRH gene activation in chronic stress where hormone levels are low. Thus, increased phosphorylation of hippocampal GR at S232 and its decreased phosphorylation at S246 may be related to GR transcriptional activity, HPA axis hypoactivity, and compromised negative feedback regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herman &#x00026; Spencer 1998</xref>). It is important to mention that the pattern of hippocampal GR phosphorylation under chronic stress was reversed by subsequent acute stress.</p><p>In contrast to unchanged levels of tGR in HIPPO under chronic stress, this stress caused increase in GR protein levels in both compartments of PFC and its accumulation in the cytoplasm. Such differences in response of PFC to chronic stress compared with those of HIPPO could be due to alternative signalling pathways operating in these CNS substructures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mizoguchi <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>) or altered level/activity of tGR-interacting proteins (chaperones, kinases, components of proteasome, and other cofactors). Nevertheless, under acute or combined stress, the compartmental distribution of tGR in PFC was similar to that of HIPPO, i.e. GR exhibited translocation to the nucleus upon CORT increase. Thus, likewise in HIPPO, GR translocation to the nucleus of PFC was not compromised by the previous chronic stress exposure.</p><p>Similarly to our findings in HIPPO of chronically stressed animals, the tGR in the nuclear compartment of PFC also exhibited transcriptional activity, since the expression of cortical GR gene was attenuated, whereas expression of CRF and BDNF genes was upregulated. The magnitude of these changes in gene expression in PFC was somewhat smaller compared with the one observed in HIPPO, which may be explained by the relatively lower initial level of tGR in PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cerqueira <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>). The analysis of GR phosphorylation status in PFC of chronically stressed animals revealed, again, the presence of increased levels of GRS232 form primarily in the nucleus. Its presence in the nucleus corresponded well with the elevated levels of Cdk5, as well as of its activator proteins p35 and p25. The nuclear GRS232 prevailed over nuclear S246 phosphoisoform, which again may be due to decreased activity of JNKs. In contrast to HIPPO, the pattern of cortical GR phosphorylation under chronic stress was not reversed by subsequent acute stress, indicating prevalence of S246 phosphorylation that correlated with BDNF gene repression.</p><p>In summary, our data indicated that the regulation of the expression of the GR, CRH, and BDNF genes in HIPPO and PFC under chronic stress did not seem to be exclusively dependent on the predominant nuclear positioning of GR protein determined by high serum CORT levels. This finding suggests that cell signaling through GR phosphorylation may be of special importance under low GC's level, i.e. low GR occupancy with GCs as recently also reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen <italic>et al</italic>. (2008)</xref>. Based on these observations, future efforts should be directed towards detailed analyses of transcriptional activity of individual GR phosphoisoforms. In particular, it will be important to provide more evidence regarding the role of S232 phosphoisoform of the GR in chronic stress-induced hypocorticism and HPA axis hypoactivity. In that view molecular signals emerging from cell membrane receptors or those generated internally e.g. from mitochondria should be considered as potential regulators of the GR activity. Understanding of those mechanisms would be of immense help for the selection of pharmaceutical agents aiming to restore chronic stress-disturbed homeostasis of HPA axis.</p></sec><sec><title>Declaration of interest</title><p>There is no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (Research Fellowship
