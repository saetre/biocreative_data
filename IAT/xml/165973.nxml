These may arise during replication, recombination or may be caused by DNA-damaging agents. DNA ligases play a critical role in the maintenance of genetic stability as they catalyse the joining of DNA molecules at sites of single- and double-stranded breaks by formation of new phosphodiester bonds in the DNA backbone. Prokaryotic cells express an NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-driven ligase that catalyses the rejoining reactions during replication, recombination and DNA repair. Most eukaryotic organisms express DNA ligases that are driven by ATP. Moreover, they possess a variety of ligases each having a distinct funtion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c2">2</xref>).</p><p>In yeast and mammalian cells, DNA ligase I is the main ligase involved in replication. It functions at the replication fork where it joins Okazaki fragments. However, DNA ligase I does not solely function in replication, as it is also required for base excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c5">5</xref>). An orthologue of the yeast and mammalian DNA ligase I gene has recently been cloned from the plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and shown both to complement a mutation in the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> DNA ligase I gene (<italic>CDC9</italic>) and to be most highly expressed in meristematic dividing tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c6">6</xref>). These results suggested that, as in yeast and mammalian cells, this ligase plays an important role in DNA replication in plants.</p><p>Molecular cloning and biochemical analysis of cell extracts from different mammalian cell types revealed the presence of three other DNA ligases, termed DNA ligases II&#x02013;IV. DNA ligase II has a lower molecular mass than DNA ligase III, shows a high degree of similarity in protein sequence to this ligase and may therefore be either a proteolysis product of the DNA ligase III protein or an alternative splicing product of the corresponding gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c7">7</xref>). An <italic>in vivo</italic> function for this ligase has yet to be discovered. The transcript of the DNA ligase III gene can be alternatively spliced, producing two products designated ligase III&#x003b1; and ligase III&#x003b2;. Ligase III&#x003b1; is thought to be involved in base excision repair because it interacts with XRCC1, an essential protein of this repair pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c8">8</xref>). Ligase III&#x003b2; is only expressed in the testis and may function in meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c9">9</xref>). A ligase has also been isolated from mammalian mitochondria. This ligase, which appears to function in the repair of damage to mitochondrial DNA, is most probably also a product of the ligase III gene, produced by the translation from an upstream start site, resulting in a protein with a potential mitochondrial targeting sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c10">10</xref>). A detailed survey of the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> genome did not reveal the presence of a ligase III homologue.</p><p>Ligase IV was first detected in mammalian cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c11">11</xref>). The protein was found in a complex with the product of the <italic>XRCC4</italic> gene and the interaction required a region between the BRCT domains present in the C-terminus of ligase IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c12">12</xref>). Cells deficient for <italic>XRCC4</italic> are hypersensitive to ionising radiation and defective in V(D)J recombination, which is the process that assembles immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes in cells of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c14">14</xref>). Targeted disruption of the ligase IV gene in mice leads to late embryonic lethality and is associated with defects in V(D)J recombination and apoptosis in the embryonic central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c17">17</xref>). These findings suggested that ligase IV is involved in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway for repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In higher eukaryotes, NHEJ is the pathway that is predominantly used for the repair of DSBs and the generation of immunoglobulins and T-cell receptor genes by V(D)J recombination. It is often associated with the loss of genetic information as it produces deletions and rearrangements. Besides the ligase IV&#x02013;XRCC4 complex, this pathway involves the DNA&#x02013;PK complex, consisting of the KU70&#x02013;KU80 heterodimer and the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), and the multiprotein complex of RAD50&#x02013;MRE11&#x02013;NBS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c19">19</xref>). Although in lower eukaryotes, such as yeast, homologous recombination is primarily used for DSB repair, the pathway for DSB repair by NHEJ is present. Homologues of the mammalian NHEJ genes, including ligase IV, have been found in yeast, indicating that NHEJ is highly conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. Yeast cells lacking the ligase IV gene <italic>LIG4</italic> are viable, but are deficient in NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c23">23</xref>). The product of the yeast <italic>LIG4</italic> gene interacts with ligase-interacting factor 1 (Lif1). Cells deficient for Lif1 also showed an increased sensitivity to ionising radiation, which is consistent with a role in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c24">24</xref>). Moreover, Lif1 was shown to stabilize DNA ligase IV and to recruit it to sites of DNA DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c25">25</xref>). Recently we found that DNA ligase IV also plays a role in the integration of <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> T-DNA in yeast.</p><p><italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> is a plant pathogen that induces crown gall disease on many dicotyledonous plant species at wound sites. The bacterium transfers an oncogenic segment of DNA, the transfer- or T-DNA, which is derived from a tumour-inducing (Ti)-plasmid in the bacterium, into plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c26">26</xref>). The T-DNA integrates at random positions into the plant genome by a process of non-homologous recombination (NHR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c29">29</xref>). <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> is used for the genetic engineering of plants, because the oncogenes in the T-DNA can be replaced by any other gene of interest without loss of transfer function. The host range of <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> is not restricted to plants. The bacterium is also able to transfer its T-DNA into cells of yeasts and filamentous fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c32">32</xref>). In yeast, the T-DNA integrates by a mechanism of NHR similar to that in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c34">34</xref>). Recently, we discovered that the NHEJ genes <italic>RAD50</italic>, <italic>MRE11</italic>, <italic>XRS2</italic>, <italic>YKU70</italic> and <italic>LIG4</italic> are involved in T-DNA integration in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c34">34</xref>). In plants, the histone H2A-1 gene <italic>RAT5</italic> was identified as being important for T-DNA integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c35">35</xref>), but whether the NHEJ genes play a role in T-DNA integration in plants has not yet been determined.</p><p>Recently, the sequence of the <italic>A.thaliana</italic> genome became available and a detailed analysis revealed the presence of genes with high homology to the mammalian and yeast ligase IV and XRCC4 genes, which were termed <italic>AtLIG4</italic> and <italic>AtXRCC4</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c36">36</xref>). The product of <italic>AtLIG4</italic>, a single-copy gene in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome, was shown to encode an ATP-dependent ligase, which interacted strongly with the AtXRCC4 protein via the BRCT domain in the C-terminus of the AtLIG4 protein. The expression of <italic>AtLIG4</italic> was induced by &#x003b3;-radiation but not by UV-B irradiation, which implies a role for <italic>AtLIG4</italic> in DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c36">36</xref>). Here we describe the isolation of an <italic>A.thaliana</italic> plant line in which the <italic>AtLIG4</italic> gene is disrupted by a T-DNA insertion. Plants homozygous for the T-DNA insertion are phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type plants. In contrast to mammals where disruption of the gene encoding ligase IV is lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c16">16</xref>), we obtained viable plants homozygous for the T-DNA insertion. These plants developed and grew normally, were fertile, but were hypersensitive to the DNA-damaging agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and to X-rays, demonstrating that <italic>AtLIG4</italic> plays a role in the repair of DNA damage in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. In contrast to yeast, we found that <italic>AtLIG4</italic> is not required for integration of the <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> T-DNA into the plant genome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Isolation of the <italic>Arabidopsis Atlig4</italic> mutant</title><p>The collection of T-DNA insertion lines available at the University of Wisconsin <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Knock-out Facility was screened using the T-DNA-specific primer JL-202 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c37">37</xref>) and the <italic>AtLIG4</italic>-specific primers LG1 (5&#x02032;-AGTTACTGGGAGAGAAGACCGAGTCACTG-3&#x02032;) and LG2 (5&#x02032;-TTTCTTCACTAGAGGAGGAACTACGTCTG-3&#x02032;) according to the guidelines available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biotech.wisc.edu/Arabidopsis/">http://www.biotech.wisc.edu/Arabidopsis/</ext-link>.

Eventually, we identified by PCR five individual plants harbouring a T-DNA insertion in the <italic>AtLIG4</italic> gene.

However, RT&#x02013;PCR analysis using primers flanking the insertion site detected a product in the wild-type, but not in <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> plants. Apparently, splicing at intron 17 does not occur in the <italic>Atlig4</italic> mutant and, consequently, the T-DNA is present in the <italic>AtLIG</italic> mRNA in the mutant (the PCR product in the mutant would be &#x0003e;10 kb in size and was therefore not detectable). This result was confirmed by RT&#x02013;PCR analysis using a T-DNA-specific primer and a primer in the <italic>3</italic>&#x02032; <italic>AtLIG4</italic> coding region, with which a product was obtained in <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> plants, but not in wild-type plants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg458f1">1</xref>C). Sequence analysis showed that the transcript of the mutant <italic>AtLIG4</italic> gene could encode a truncated protein of 597 amino acids (the wild-type protein contains 1219 amino acids), of which the last two are derived from intron 17 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg458f1">1</xref>D). This putative protein will lack the nuclear localisation sequence and BRCT domains that are necessary for the interaction with AtXRCC4. If this protein is formed at all, it is most likely that it will be non-functional. Thus, the T-DNA insertion in the <italic>AtLIG4</italic> gene seemed to completely inactivate the gene (null phenotype).</p><p>In striking contrast to mice, where disruption of the ligase IV gene is embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c16">16</xref>), we were able to obtain plants homozygous for the T-DNA insertion.

We tested whether disruption of the <italic>AtLIG4</italic> gene affects sensitivity of the plant to DNA-damaging agents by comparing growth of wild-type and <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> plants after exposure to MMS and X-rays. Seed was germinated on solid 1&#x0002f;2 MS medium and 4-day-old seedlings were transferred to liquid 1&#x0002f;2 MS medium supplemented with MMS and grown for 3 weeks. For X-ray sensitivity, seedlings were irradiated at the stated dosage in liquid medium and then grown further for 3 weeks. <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup>plants were hypersensitive to MMS and X-rays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg458f2">2</xref>). In order to show that the sensitivity to MMS and X-rays correlates with the disruption of <italic>AtLIG4</italic>, we expressed the <italic>AtLIG4</italic> cDNA from the (CaMV) 35S promoter in <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup>plants. Plants expressing the <italic>AtLIG4</italic> cDNA from the 35S promoter grew and developed more slowly on selection medium compared with wild-type and <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup>plants that did not contain the 35S::<italic>AtLIG4</italic> construct (data not shown). However, the expression from the 35S promoter partially restored the X-ray sensitivity (data not shown), and completely restored the MMS sensitivity of <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> plants to levels similar to that of wild-type plants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg458f2">2</xref>A). These data showed that the hypersensitivity to MMS and X-rays is due to disruption of <italic>AtLIG4</italic> by the T-DNA insertion.

Our data show that, as in yeast and mammalian cells, <italic>AtLIG4</italic> also plays a role in the repair of DNA damage in plants.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>AtLIG4</italic> is not required for <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> T-DNA integration</title><p>Recently we found that a yeast <italic>lig4</italic> mutant is deficient in T-DNA integration by NHR, which showed that <italic>LIG4</italic> is required for T-DNA integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c34">34</xref>). To test whether the <italic>AtLIG4</italic> gene is similarly required for T-DNA integration in plants, we compared T-DNA integration in <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> plants with that in wild-type plants in two different <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> transformation assays. First, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> root segment tumorigenesis assay as described by Nam <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c41">41</xref>). Sterile roots of 3-week-old wild-type and <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> plants grown in agar were cut into segments and inoculated with the virulent <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> strain A208. This strain harbours the nopaline-type Ti plasmid pTiT37 and induces the formation of large tumours on root segments. After 2 days co-cultivation, an excess of <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> cells was washed away and the root segments were placed on solid culture medium lacking hormones. Tumorigenesis was scored as the percentage of infected root segments that produced any form of tumours. The efficiency of tumour formation of the <italic>Atlig4</italic> mutant did not differ significantly from that of the wild-type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg458f3">3</xref>A). Secondly, we performed a germline transformation using the floral dip method described by Clough and Bent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c40">40</xref>). <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> and wild-type plants were transformed using the <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> strain LBA1115(pSDM3010) and plants resistant to hygromycin were selected as the T-DNA from the pSDM3010 binary vector carried a hygromycin resistance gene under control of the nopaline synthase promoter and terminator. The transformation efficiency was determined as the number of hygromycin-resistant seedlings per total number of plated seeds. The transformation efficiency of <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup>plants did not differ significantly from that of the wild-type plants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg458f3">3</xref>B). Thus, in both the tumorigenesis and floral dip assay, <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> plants were as susceptible as wild-type plants to <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation, which indicated that T-DNA integration is not blocked in <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> plants. Therefore, we conclude that <italic>AtLIG4</italic> is not required for efficient integration of <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> T-DNA.</p><p>Previously, we found in yeast that in the absence of ligase IV, the T-DNA, if integrated at all, preferably formed repeat structures at unknown chomosomal loci. Although the absence of ligase IV in plants did not affect the efficiency of T-DNA integration, it may alter the features of T-DNA integration. To investigate this, we subjected 12 transgenic wild-type and 12 <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> plant lines, which were generated by floral dip transformation using <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> LBA1115(pSDM3010), to Southern blot analysis. The number of T-DNA copies and T-DNA repeat structures found in the genome of wild-type and <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> plants was comparable (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg458tb1">1</xref> and data not shown). We then used TAIL-PCR to isolate the T-DNA left end&#x02013;plant DNA junction sites for a number of T-DNA insertions in wild-type and <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> plants. Sequences obtained from the TAIL-PCR products were analysed and used in BLAST searches against the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome. We were able to determine the position of eight T-DNA insertions in wild-type and <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> transformants, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg458tb1">1</xref> and data not shown). In both the wild-type and <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> plants, T-DNA insertions were found at different positions on all chromosomes, but preferentially at intergenic regions as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c46">46</xref>). No insertions were found at regions of repeated DNA (rDNA, telomeres and retro-elements). Moreover, in both the wild-type and <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> plants, truncation of the T-DNA left end (0&#x02013;27 and 0&#x02013;23 bp), microhomology between the T-DNA left end and the insertion site (0&#x02013;8 and 0&#x02013;4 bp) and formation of filler DNA (0&#x02013;9 and 0&#x02013;112 bp) were seen after integration, as described before for T-DNA integration in plants (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg458tb1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c29">29</xref>). Taken together, these data indicated that the features of T-DNA integration in wild-type and <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> plants were comparable. Thus, the absence of <italic>AtLIG4</italic> also did not affect the features of T-DNA integration.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we describe the isolation and characterization of an <italic>A.thaliana</italic> plant line in which the gene encoding ligase IV, <italic>AtLIG4</italic>, is disrupted by a T-DNA insertion. We were able to obtain plants homozygous for the T-DNA insertion. These plants were viable, although they lacked the wild-type <italic>AtLIG4</italic> mRNA. A transcript containing the T-DNA insertion was detected by RT&#x02013;PCR, which may encode a truncated version of the AtLIG4 protein. However, it is unlikely that this truncated protein would be functional as it would lack the nuclear localization sequence and the BRCT domain. Consequently, it would not be imported into the nucleus and could not interact with the XRCC4 protein, which is essential for ligase IV activity in NHEJ in yeast and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c47">47</xref>). Therefore, we predict that the disruption line will have a null phenotype. We were not able to detect any significant differences in phenotype between <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> and wild-type plants. <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> plants germinated, developed and grew normally and were fertile. However, <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> plants were more sensitive to treatments with the DNA-damaging agents MMS and X-rays. Thus, as in yeast and mammalian cells, <italic>AtLIG4</italic> plays a role in the repair of DNA damage.</p><p>Targeted disruption of the ligase IV gene in mice resulted in late embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c16">16</xref>). However, we demonstrate here that, as in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c23">23</xref>), inactivation of the ligase IV gene is not lethal in plants. This may be explained by differences in function between the ligase IV proteins from plants and yeast on one side and mammals on the other side. Mammalian, yeast and plants cells that lack ligase IV are all deficient in the repair of DNA damage. However, in mice, deficiency for ligase IV additionally leads to defects in V(D)J recombination, and thus a compromised immune response, and cell death by apoptosis in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c17">17</xref>). These two additional developmental effects may explain why the absence of ligase IV leads to embryonic lethality in mammals. However, as plants lack both an immune and nervous system, these consequences of a ligase IV deficiency are absent in plants. Indeed, the presence of ligase IV is not required for development of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> embryo.</p><p>We have tested the role of the <italic>AtLIG4</italic> gene in DSB repair in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> by comparing the response of <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> and wild-type plants to treatment with the DNA-damaging agents X-rays and MMS. We found that <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> seedlings are hypersensitive to both X-rays and MMS. The sensitivity to MMS of <italic>Atlig4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> seedlings seemed to be comparable with that of the previoulsy identified <italic>Atmre11-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c43">43</xref>) and <italic>Atku70</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c44">44</xref>) mutants as we did not observe any differences in experiments where we compared the sensitivity to MMS of <italic>Atlig4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup>, <italic>Atku70</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> and <italic>Atmre11&#x02013;2</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> seedlings (data not shown). <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> seedlings seemed to be more sensitive to X-rays than MMS. After exposure to 0.006&#x00025; MMS and 80 Gy of X-rays, wild-type seedlings were still able to grow and develop. However, at these dosages, growth and development of <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> seedlings were more affected by treatment with X-rays than MMS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg458f2">2</xref>). X-rays induce predominantly DSBs, whereas treatment with MMS leads to abasic lesions and single-strand breaks, which may be converted to DSBs during DNA replication in S phase. In yeast, DNA ligase IV has been shown to play an exclusive role in the repair of DSBs by NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c23">23</xref>). The finding that <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> seedlings are more sensitive to X-rays than MMS is therefore consistent with a role for <italic>AtLIG4</italic> in the repair of DSBs by NHEJ in plants.</p><p>Components of the NHEJ machinery in yeast, mammalian and plant cells have been shown to control telomere length. For example, yeast and mammalian cells lacking Ku70 have shortened telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c50">50</xref>), whereas plants deficient for <italic>KU70</italic> have longer telomeres when compared with the corresponding wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c51">51</xref>). However, neither in yeast nor in mammalian cells did mutations in <italic>LIG4</italic> affect telomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c50">50</xref>). We analysed telomere length in <italic>AtLIG4</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> plants as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c52">52</xref>) and did not observe any significant difference in telomere length between these plants and wild-type plants (data not shown). This indicated that, as in yeast and mammals, DNA ligase IV does not play a role in telomere length regulation.</p><p>Recently we found that a yeast <italic>lig4</italic> mutant is deficient in T-DNA integration by NHR, which showed that <italic>LIG4</italic> is required for T-DNA integration. In the <italic>lig4</italic> mutant, the T-DNA, if integrated at all, preferably formed repeat structures at unknown chomosomal loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c34">34</xref>). In contrast to our findings in yeast, we demonstrated here that in plants <italic>AtLIG4</italic> is not required for T-DNA integration. Neither the efficiency nor the features of T-DNA integration, meaning the number of T-DNA copies, T-DNA repeat structures and distribution of T-DNAs in the plant genome, were affected by the absence of ligase IV in plants. How may these differences between yeast and plants in the requirement for DNA ligase IV in T-DNA integration be explained?</p><p>Could the function of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> DNA ligase IV be taken over by another ligase? <italic>AtLIG4</italic> is a single-copy gene in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome and is not a member of a gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c36">36</xref>). Homologues of the mammalian DNA ligase II and III have not been found yet in plants and therefore their role in T-DNA integration remains unclear. West <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c36">36</xref>) reported the identification of a novel putative DNA ligase in <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis.</italic> Further characterisation of this DNA ligase may show whether it is a homologue of the mammalian DNA ligase II or III or a novel plant-specific DNA ligase and whether it plays a role in T-DNA integration. The best characterized DNA ligase in plants so far is DNA ligase I. We may therefore only speculate about a possible role for DNA ligase I in T-DNA integration in plants.</p><p>Functional analysis of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> DNA ligase I gene showed that it complements a mutation in the yeast ligase I gene <italic>CDC9</italic>, implicating a function in replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c6">6</xref>). Biochemical analysis of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> DNA ligase I demonstrated that not only nicks in DNA, but also double-stranded DNA molecules with blunt and cohesive ends are good substrates for ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c54">54</xref>). Joining of blunt and cohesive ends is normally required for the repair of DSBs by NHEJ, a process that exclusively involves DNA ligase IV in yeast and mammalian cells. Indeed, the yeast <italic>CDC9</italic> was unable to complement the deficiency of a <italic>lig4</italic> mutant in a plasmid DSB rejoining assay, demonstrating that <italic>in vivo</italic> DNA ligase I does not play a major role in DSB repair in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c21">21</xref>). To our knowledge, these types of experiments have not yet been done with the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> DNA ligase I and so it is theoretically possible that the plant DNA ligase I can join DNA DSBs. By using cell cycle phase-specific inhibitors, Villemont <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c55">55</xref>) showed that T-DNA integration predominantly occurs during the S phase in plants. This suggests that DNA replication may be a prerequisite for T-DNA integration and that the T-DNA may become integrated during the repair of DNA damage formed during DNA replication. The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> DNA ligase I has been implicated to function in DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c6">6</xref>). Morover, in plants, expression of the DNA ligase I gene was shown to be highest in flowers, which primarily consist of meristematic cells undergoing mitosis and meiosis. This is consistent with a role for the plant DNA ligase I in DNA replication and a possible function in T-DNA integration during S phase. Consequently, we cannot rule out that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> DNA ligase I may be able to take over the role of DNA ligase IV in T-DNA integration.</p><p>We have found previously that besides Lig4, other NHEJ proteins such as Yku70, Rad50 and Mre11 are required for T-DNA integration by NHR in yeast. Orthologues of the yeast <italic>KU70</italic>, <italic>RAD50</italic> and <italic>MRE11</italic> genes have been found in plants, and plant lines in which these genes are disrupted by a T-DNA insertion are viable and became available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg458c52">52</xref>). In view of our finding that <italic>AtLIG4</italic> is not required for T-DNA integration in plants, a crucial next step would be to investigate whether mutations in these other NHEJ genes, as in yeast, do affect T-DNA integration. This should further increase our understanding of the mechanism of T-DNA integration in plants.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg458f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Molecular analysis of the T-DNA insertion in the <italic>AtLIG4</italic> locus.

Primary bolts were clipped and secondary bolts of 5&#x02013;10 cm in length were dipped into inoculation medium containing <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> strain LBA1115 (pSDM3010). Seed from infected plants was harvested, weighed to determine the total number of seeds (1 mg &#x0223c; 50 seeds) and plated on 1&#x0002f;2 MS medium containing hygromycin. The number of hygromycin-resistant seedlings was scored 2 weeks after germination. The transformation efficiency is represented as the number of hygromycin-resistant seedlings per total number of seeds.
