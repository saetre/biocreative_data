In the brain, CD88 can be expressed on astrocytes, microglia and neurons. Previous studies have shown that the hippocampal CA3 region displays CD88-immunolabelling, and CD88 mRNA is present within dentate gyrus granule cells. As granule cells send dense axonal projections (mossy fibres) to CA3 pyramidal neurons, CD88 expression could be expressed on mossy fibres. However, the cellular location of CD88 within the hippocampal CA3 region is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The expression of CD88 within the hippocampal CA3 region was characterized using dual-immunolabelling of hippocampal sections prepared from Wistar rats. Immunolabelling for CD88, using a monoclonal antibody, was combined with immunolabelling for markers of astrocytes (GFAP), microglia (IBA1), presynaptic proteins (synaptophysin and synapsin-1) and preterminal axons (neurofilament). In addition, electron microscopy was performed on peroxidase-visualized CD88-immunolabelling to determine its cellular localisation within the CA3 region.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Dense CD88-immunolabelling was observed within the <italic>stratum lucidum </italic>of the CA3, consistent with the presence of CD88 on mossy fibres. Labelling for CD88 rarely co-localized with astrocytes or microglia, but was highly co-localized with presynaptic proteins. Electron microscopy revealed CD88-immunolabelling was localized to large presynaptic terminals within the <italic>stratum lucidum</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results demonstrate that CD88 is expressed on presynaptic terminals of mossy fibres within the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Although the role of CD88 on mossy fibres remains to be established, their involvement in synaptic/cellular plasticity, and in cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease deserves investigation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The complement system is an integral part of the innate immune system activated in response to tissue injury and invading pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Consisting of over thirty fluid-phase and membrane-associated proteins, a major function of the complement systems is cytotoxic destruction of invading pathogens, via the formation of the membrane attack complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, due to the release of soluble anaphylatoxins such as C3a and C5a, the complement system also initiates and maintains inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. For many years the complement system was thought confined to the periphery, it is now recognised that complement factors are expressed in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, the complement system has been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The anaphylatoxin C5a, a 74 amino acid glycoprotein, functions primarily as a pro-inflammatory mediator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In the periphery, the release of C5a results in a host of inflammatory responses, including increased vascular permeability, chemotaxis of inflammatory cells, and the release of cytokines and chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These responses are primarily mediated via a C5a-selective seven-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor (termed CD88) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This C5a-receptor is expressed on a wide range of peripheral cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, activated mast cells, endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the CNS, CD88 can be found on astrocyctes, microglia and neurons in normal human and mouse brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Neuronal expression of CD88 has been reported within the <italic>cornus ammonis </italic>sub-fields (CA1 - 3) of the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus, the neocortex, and the cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Similarly, <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization has demonstrated CD88 mRNA within neurons of the neocortex, cerebellum and dentate gyrus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Granule cells of the dentate gyrus send axonal projections (the mossy fibres) that terminate on CA3 pyramidal neurons within the <italic>stratum lucidum</italic>, a layer lying immediately dorsal to CA3 pyramidal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These strong, excitatory synapses formed by mossy fibres on CA3 pyramidal neurons are critical for the normal function of the hippocampus, and dysfunction of this synapse is thought to contribute to psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although CD88 expression has been reported in the CA3, its precise cellular location has not been fully characterised. The presence of CD88 mRNA within dentate gyrus granule cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] suggests CD88 might be expressed on mossy fibres within the CA3 region. Indeed, upon close examination of previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], CD88 immunolabelling within the human hippocampus does appear to be located within the <italic>stratum lucidum</italic>. Determining whether CD88 is located presynaptically on mossy fibres, or postsynaptically on CA3 pyramidal neurons, is critical to our understanding of its function in this region. Therefore, the present study sought to characterize CD88 expression within the CA3 region of the rat hippocampus with the use of dual-immunolabelling and electron microscopy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Experimental animals</title><p>All results were obtained from male Wistar rats (postnatal days 30-37) housed under standard laboratory conditions with a 12-hour light/dark cycle and food and water available <italic>ad libitum</italic>.

Sections were then incubated in a monoclonal mouse anti-CD88 antibody (1:500 in PBS containing 1% BSA, 4&#x000b0;C; Clone R63, Hycult Biotechnology) for 48 hours, after which they were washed in PBS and incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C in a solution of biotinylated donkey anti-mouse antibody (1:300 in PBS containing 1% BSA; Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA). After washing in PBS, sections were incubated in one of the following primary antibodies (made up in PBS containing 1% BSA). Microglia were labelled with a rabbit anti-ionizing calcium-binding molecule antibody (IBA1, 1:600, Biocare Medical, USA). Astrocytes were labelled with a rabbit anti-glial fabrillary acidic protein antibody (GFAP, 1:100; DAKO, Denmark). Presynaptic terminals were labelled using two antibodies directed against protein components of the presynaptic vesicular-release machinery: rabbit anti-synaptophysin antibody (1:100, DAKO), or rabbit anti-synapsin-1 antibody (1:100, Sigma-Aldrich). Preterminal portions of axons were labelled with neurofilament-200 kDa antibody (1:500, Sigma-Aldrich). Following an overnight incubation at 4&#x000b0;C, all sections were washed thoroughly in PBS and incubated in a mixture of Alexa 568-conjugated streptavidin (1:300 in PBS containing 1% BSA, Invitrogen, CA, USA) and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:300 in PBS containing 1% BSA, Invitrogen). Following a wash in PBS, 16 &#x003bc;m thick sections were incubated for 5 min in 4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:15000) and then washed with PBS. All sections were cover-slipped in fluorescence mounting medium (DAKO, Denmark), sealed with acrylic and stored at 4&#x000b0;C.

Brains were then removed and postfixed overnight in the same fixative at 4&#x000b0;C and then washed in PBS, after which coronal forebrain (50 &#x003bc;m) sections were cut using a vibratome (Leica VT1000S). All sections were washed (4 &#x000d7; 10 min) in PBS, incubated in a 3% BSA/PBS solution and then incubated in mouse anti-CD88 antibody (1:500 in PBS containing 1% BSA, 4&#x000b0;C; Hycult Biotechnology) for 48 hours. Sections were then washed in PBS and incubated for 2 hours in a solution of biotinylated donkey anti-mouse antibody (1:300 in PBS containing 1% BSA. Jackson ImmunoResearch). After further PBS washes sections were placed into a solution of avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex (6 &#x003bc;l A and 6 &#x003bc;l B/ml of 1% BSA in PBS; Vector Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, USA) for 2 hours. This was followed by PBS washes (2 &#x000d7; 5 min) and a sodium acetate buffer (pH = 6.0) wash for 5 min. Sections were exposed for 15 min to a 2% NiSO<sub>4 </sub>solution (in sodium acetate buffer) containing 2 mg/ml D-glucose, 0.4 mg/ml NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and 0.025% 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB). This was followed by another incubation in the same solution but with the addition of glucose oxidase (0.2 &#x003bc;l/ml). The subsequent production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>initiates the peroxidase reaction resulting in the deposition of nickel-DAB. At a suitable time point, based on the background level of staining seen, all sections were washed in sodium acetate buffer to stop the reaction, and then washed thoroughly in PBS (3 &#x000d7; 10 min). Sections were then stained in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated through a graded series of acetone, and processed into epon resin using a microwave (Pelco Biowave). Sections were flat embedded in resin which was polymerized at 60&#x000b0;C for 48 hr. Ultrathin sections (70 nm thick) were cut using an ultra-microtome (Lecia EMUC6) and collected onto grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined with a JEOL 1010 electron microscope.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>CD88 is expressed within the <italic>stratum lucidum </italic>of the hippocampus</title><p>To confirm previous reports that CD88 is expressed within the rat hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], western blots were performed.

These terminals were densely packed with presynaptic vesicles and were present in apposition to dendritic processes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D-F</xref>).

Immunolabelling for CD88 revealed a pattern of expression identical to that observed when mossy fibres are visualized with a Timm's stain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Consistent with this, immunolabelling for CD88 almost entirely co-localized with immunolabelling for the presynaptic proteins synaptophysin and synapsin-1. However, CD88 immunolabelling rarely co-localized with neurofilament (a marker of pre-terminal portions of the axon). The localisation of CD88 was further determined using electron microscopy, demonstrating CD88 immunolabelling within large presynaptic terminals of the <italic>stratum lucidum</italic>.</p><p>The production and specificity of the CD88 antibody used in this study (monoclonal mouse anti-ratCD88, clone R63) has previously been fully described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Briefly, this antibody was raised against membrane-expressed CD88 in a rat basophilic leukemia cell line (RBL-2H3). The specificity of the antibody raised was the established using flow cytometry and ELISA procedures, with the antibody found to target the N-terminal region (the putative first extracellular domain) of CD88. In the present study, western blot analysis revealed that this CD88 antibody detected a single 45 kDa band from both isolated hippocampus tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Recently, a second C5a binding receptor has been identified termed C5a-like receptor 2 (C5L2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This receptor does not appear to couple to G-proteins and is suggested to be either a C5a decoy receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] or a functional C5a signalling receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The C5L2 receptor and CD88 display ~35% homology in their amino acid sequences, and a considerable amount of this homology is located in their N-terminal regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. As the antibody used in the present study binds in the N-terminal region of CD88 we considered the possibility that this antibody also recognized C5L2. To test this we immunolabelled rat hippocampal sections with a specific anti-ratC5L2 antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. This revealed C5L2 expression on astrocytes, but, consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], no C5L2 immunolabelling was observed on mossy fibres of the <italic>stratum lucidum </italic>(data not shown). As such, the immunolabelling seen within the <italic>stratum lucidum </italic>of the rat hippocampus in the present study is due to the presence CD88.</p><p>Immunolabelling for CD88 within the <italic>stratum lucidum </italic>of the CA3 region of the hippocampus was found to display a high degree of co-localisation with immunolabelling for the presynaptic proteins synaptophysin and synapsin-1. Both synaptophysin and synapsin-1 proteins are located on synaptic vesicles and are involved in exocytosis of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. As such, the co-localization of CD88 immunolabelling with synaptophysin and synapsin-1 immunolabelling indicates that CD88 is located in close proximity to the presynaptic terminals of mossy fibres within the <italic>stratum lucidum</italic>. In contrast, immunolabelling for CD88 was not co-localized with neurofilament immunolabelling. As neurofilaments are almost entirely confined to the preterminal region of axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], this result indicates that CD88 expression is confined to the presynaptic terminals of the mossy fibres. This was subsequently confirmed using electron microscopy, in that CD88 immunolabelling was confined to large presynaptic terminals present within the <italic>stratum lucidum</italic>.</p><p>The role of CD88 on mossy fibre terminals within the CA3 region of the hippocampus is not known. However, a range of functions for CD88 within the CNS have been proposed, including apoptosis, cytoskeletal plasticity and axodendritic outgrowth, the migration of neural stem cells, and the release of neurotrophins and cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Neuroblastoma cells respond to C5a with an increase in calcium influx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], increased expression of the immediate early gene c-<italic>fos </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], activation of protein kinase-C, and the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-&#x003ba;B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Activation of CD88 is mitogenic for undifferentiated neuroblastoma cells, protects terminally differentiated neuroblastoma cells against amyloid &#x003b2; peptide mediated toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and leads to calcium influx and apoptosis in cortical neuronal cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, CD88 activation also appears to protect against glutamate-mediated cell death, possibly via the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and to have an anti-apoptotic function in cultured cerebellar granule cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Primary neuronal cultures from the hippocampus respond to CD88 activation with an increased calcium influx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Similarly, calcium influx into hippocampal neurons is seen in brain slices treated with a CD88 agonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Administration of C5a reduces kainic acid-induced excitotoxicity in CA3 pyramidal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and CA3 pyramidal neurons of CD88 knockout mice are more susceptible to excitotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Interestingly, C5a has also been suggested to act presynaptically to increase noradrenaline release, a mechanism that might underlie the increased eating seen in response to intra-hypothalamic infusion of C5a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Further, systemic administration of a CD88 antagonist has been reported to decrease the pathology, increase synaptophysin immunolabelling in the CA3 <italic>stratum lucidum </italic>and enhance behavioural outcomes in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These previous findings provide evidence that C5a plays a neuromodulatory role in the CNS. That C5a also acts through CD88 to modulate neurotransmission between mossy fibres and CA3 pyramidal neurons is, therefore, an intriguing possibility.</p><p>The generation of new neurons is thought to be a significant form of plasticity within the CNS. Recently, cultured neural stem cells have been shown to express CD88. This expression was also found on doublecortin-positive cells within the sub-ventricular zone (the primary site of neurogenesis in the rodent brain) and rostral migratory stream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus is a site of neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain. Incorporation of these neurons into the dentate gyrus and their subsequent synaptic connection to CA3 pyramidal neurons appears to be involved in some forms of hippocampal-dependent learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Given that C5a acts as a strong chemotactic signal in the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], it is possible that it also acts as a guidance cue for the axons of newly formed granule cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the present study clearly demonstrate that CD88 expression within the CA3 region of the rat hippocampus is primarily located within the <italic>stratum lucidum </italic>of the rat hippocampus. Immunolabelling for CD88 co-localized with immunolabelling for the presynaptic proteins synaptophysin and synapsin-1, suggesting that CD88 is located on terminals of mossy fibre axons originating from dentate gyrus granule cells. This result was confirmed using electron microscopy, demonstrating that CD88 immunolabelling was confined to large presynaptic terminals of the <italic>stratum lucidum</italic>. As such, the C5a-receptor CD88 is well positioned to influence hippocampal function in both diseased and non-diseased states.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JWC and TMW jointly conceived the project in discussions with SMT, and performed preliminary experiments in the laboratory of SMT.
