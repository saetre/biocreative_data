What mechanisms determine the size differences between species? What genetic and environmental factors contribute to variations of size within a species? How does an individual regulate the size of its organs to maintain proportion with the rest of the body? Although much remains unanswered, it is clear that the size of an individual is directly related to the number of cells it has, and the size of these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Thus, the final size of an organism is determined by the number of cell divisions that occur during development, and the amount of growth these cells undergo. When considering the size difference between two organisms, such as a mouse and a human, it is obvious that the main cause of the size difference is the total number of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Intuitively, this may lead to the conclusion that the size of an organism is related to the rate of cell proliferation during development. However, experimental evidence shows that there are more subtle controls involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. For example, increasing or decreasing cell proliferation in the Drosophila imaginal discs does not alter the final size, but instead produces discs with either an increased number of small cells or a decreased number of large cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These studies indicate that there must be a genetically predetermined total cell mass and a mechanism for sensing this critical size.</p><p>Studies in Drosophila demonstrate that the evolutionarily conserved insulin signaling pathway is involved in the control of body size, through alterations of cell size and cell number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Seven Drosophila insulin-like peptides (Dilps) have been identified that are able to promote organism growth when expressed ubiquitously during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The Dilps activate cell signaling through the Drosophila insulin receptor (dInr), a receptor tyrosine kinase, which can promote growth when overexpressed in the developing eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Loss of function mutations in <italic>dInr</italic> are lethal during embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, reduction of dInr levels through combination of weak heteroallelic mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], or through partial loss of function mutations[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], reduces growth and leads to the development of small adults that have reduced cell size and number. In mammals, the insulin receptor promotes signaling through adaptor proteins, the insulin receptor substrates (IRS) 1&#x02013;4, which are required to activate phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. PI3K is a lipid kinase that phosphorylates inositide lipids on the inner surface of the cell membrane, leading to the activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt. Once activated, Akt phosphorylates many substrates that are involved in the regulation of metabolism, cell death/survival, and cell proliferation. Negative regulation of insulin signaling occurs through the tumor suppressor, PTEN. PTEN removes phosphates from inositide lipids, thus acting in opposition to PI3K. This signaling mechanism appears to be conserved in Drosophila, and the Drosophila homologues of IRS 1&#x02013;4 (chico), PI3K (dPI3K), Akt (dAkt) and PTEN (dPTEN) have all been individually implicated in the regulation of cell size, and cell number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Flies that are homozygous for a null mutation in <italic>chico </italic>are smaller than normal due to a reduction in cell size and cell number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Null mutations in <italic>dAkt </italic>are lethal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], however, rescue of <italic>dAkt </italic>mutants through ectopic expression of <italic>dAkt </italic>during embryogenesis results in a small fly phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] similar to that seen with <italic>chico </italic>mutants and through reduction of dInr activity. Clearly, components of the insulin signaling pathway act to control body and organ size through regulation of cell size and cell number during development.</p><p>In addition to developmentally predetermined size control, many cells and organisms can alter their size according to environmental stimuli, such as nutrient limitation. When Drosophila larvae are raised under nutrient limited conditions the adults are smaller than well-fed flies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] This phenomena appears to be phenocopied in the generation of small adults through inhibition of Drosophila insulin signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Interestingly, expression of <italic>Dilps 3</italic>, <italic>5</italic>, and <italic>7 </italic>has been linked to the availability of nutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These Dilps are produced in neurosecretory cells in the larval brain where they are released into the circulatory system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These studies indicate that nutritional signals may regulate body size by modulating the levels of Dilps 3, 5, and 7 in the body.</p><p>Newly hatched Drosophila larvae require a nutritional signal to initiate the cell cycle in mitotic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Well-fed larvae increase their body mass very rapidly due to replication of cells in mitotic tissues. In contrast, larvae hatched into conditions of amino acid starvation live in a state of developmental arrest for several days until nutrients become available to initiate the cell cycle[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Dominant negative inhibition of dPI3K in developing Drosophila larvae has been shown to phenocopy the effects of amino acid starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Expression of dPI3K in subsets of cells in the imaginal discs of starved larvae allows these cells to divide in the absence of nutritional signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Expression of dPI3K in the fat bodies of starved larvae significantly reduces their survival, thus conferring starvation sensitivity in these larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This suggests that Drosophila insulin signaling may play a protective role in the response to starvation.</p><p>An insulin-like signaling pathway involved in the response to nutrient limitation also exists in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabiditis elegans</italic>. When <italic>C. elegans </italic>are raised under conditions of nutrient limitation, they enter an alternate developmental stage called the dauer larvae. The dauer stage is characterized by arrest of growth at a sexually immature stage along with altered metabolism to increase the storage of fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Mutations in components of the insulin signaling pathway in <italic>C. elegans </italic>lead to dauer larvae formation and increased life span [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A null mutation in the <italic>C. elegans </italic>gene, Daf-16, negates dauer formation and the life expanding effect of these mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Thus, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, Daf-16 is necessary for dauer formation and seems to be the primary effector molecule under conditions of low levels of insulin signaling.</p><p>Daf-16 is the <italic>C. elegans </italic>homologue of a highly conserved group of Akt phosphorylatable forkhead transcription factors, the FOXO (<underline>f</underline>orkhead b<underline>ox</underline>, subgroup "<underline>O</underline>") transcription factors. These transcription factors were first discovered as proto-oncogenes, which were disrupted as a result of chromosomal translocations leading to acute myeloid leukemia and rabdomyosarcoma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Three versions of FOXO have been identified in humans (FOXO1, FOXO3a, and FOXO4; formerly known as FKHR, FKHR-L1, and AFX) and mice (Foxo1, Foxo3, and Foxo4), and additional homologues have been identified in zebrafish and chickens[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The FOXO transcription factors share a highly conserved forkhead box DNA binding domain in the N-terminal half of the protein, and three highly conserved Akt phosphorylation sites. Mammalian cell culture studies have shown that in the absence of Akt signaling, FOXO is able to activate gene transcription and cause cell death, cell cycle arrest, or cell senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In the presence of activated Akt, FOXO becomes phosphorylated and is sequestered in the cytoplasm through facilitation of 14-3-3 binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and/or disruption of a nuclear localization signal[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The down-regulation of FOXO in this manner is, possibly, one of the most important consequences of Akt mediated signaling.</p><p>Based on evidence from studies in <italic>C. elegans </italic>and mammalian cell culture, it appears that FOXO transcription factors are a critical mediator of cellular processes under conditions of low levels of insulin signaling. To investigate this further, we have identified and characterized the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>version of <italic>FOXO</italic>. We show that Drosophila FOXO (dFOXO) retains the conserved domains seen in other organisms and is involved in the regulation of growth. Of special interest is that dFOXO appears to have an effect upon feeding behavior, and may be a key player in the response of Drosophila larvae to nutritional stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>dFOXO retains the functional domains found in Daf-16 and the mammalian FOXO homologues</title><p>The <italic>dFOXO </italic>gene consists of 10 exons and is spread out over approximately 31 kb in polytene chromosome section 88A within the genomic scaffolding region, AE003703, of the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). <italic>dFOXO </italic>encodes a theoretical protein of 463 amino acids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

The Akt phosphorylation sites are also well conserved in their relative position in the protein, and in sequence. The T1 site is located at T24 in dFOXO, the S1 site at S160, and the S2 site at S239. These sites align well with the human FOXO homologues in the ClustalW alignment, however the Daf-16 S1, and S2 sites are slightly out of line (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). All three of the potential Akt phosphorylation sites in dFOXO fit the Akt consensus target sequence (RxRxxS/T).</p><p>Other notable features found in FOXO homologues include a DYRK1a phosphorylation site, a 14-3-3 binding site, a nuclear localization signal (NLS), a nuclear export signal (NES), and Ral dependent phosphorylation sites. A DYRK1a phosphorylation site was confirmed experimentally in FOXO1 at S329 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. This serine residue is conserved in human FOXO3a (S324), FOXO4 (S267), Daf-16a1 (S317), and dFOXO (S248) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In addition, the sequence surrounding this site in dFOXO (LS<sup>248</sup>PI) is identical to that in FOXO1. The high conservation of this sequence indicates that dFOXO may be phosphorylated at this site by the Drosophila homologue of DYRK1a, minibrain (mnb).</p><p>Binding to 14-3-3 proteins is thought to be an important part of FOXO sequestration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. 14-3-3 proteins normally bind to a consensus site containing a phosphoserine residue, either RSxS<sup>P</sup>xP, or RxxxS<sup>P</sup>xP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In the case of dFOXO, the sequence surrounding the T1 Akt phosphorylation site fits the former perfectly, aside from the substitution of a threonine for a serine. It has been shown experimentally that 14-3-3 does bind to this site in FOXO1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], FOXO3a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and Daf-16[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], hence, it is likely that this region functions as a 14-3-3 binding site in Drosophila.</p><p>The current model for FOXO deactivation suggests that a NES exists which causes constitutive localization of FOXO in the cytoplasm in the absence of a functional NLS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. A non-conventional NLS was identified in human FOXO4 from amino acids 180&#x02013;221 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The corresponding sequence in dFOXO (amino acids 147&#x02013;194) is 38% identical and 66% similar in amino acid content (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This similarity suggests that this region may act as an NLS in dFOXO as well. A leucine rich NES has been identified in FOXO1 (368 <underline>M</underline>EN<underline>L</underline>LDN<underline>L</underline>N<underline>L</underline> 377) and the conservation of this sequence is quite high FOXO3a, FOXO4, and Daf-16[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The corresponding region in dFOXO retains two of the important leucine residues (281 LTGTMADE<underline>L</underline>T<underline>L</underline> 291). However, the remaining sequence is more divergent, and may or may not act as an NES in Drosophila.</p><p>FOXO4 has previously been shown to be phosphorylated in a Ral-dependent manner at threonines 447 and 451[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. However, these sites do not appear to be conserved in the other human FOXO homologues, Daf-16, or dFOXO (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), indicating that Ral dependent phosphorylation of FOXO may be specific to FOXO4.</p><p>Interestingly, the carboxy-terminal three amino acids are conserved between dFOXO and FOXO1 (VSG). Also, FOXO3a contains a similar sequence in the final three amino acids (VPG). In view of this conservation, it is possible that this tail plays a functional role in FOXO regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>dFOXO expression during development phenocopies starvation and alters feeding behavior</title><p>Drosophila larvae feed continuously for about 5 days after egg laying (AEL). During this time the appetite and growth rate of the larvae is enormous. If young larvae are deprived of food, they do not grow and tend to disperse randomly[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. When the food supply is replenished, the larvae immediately move towards it and continue eating until they are close to pupation. If the food supply is depleted, the larvae will disperse again[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. We utilized the UAS/Gal4 ectopic expression system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] to overexpress dFOXO in the developing larvae under the control of the <italic>ActGal4 </italic>driver[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. This resulted in complete developmental arrest of the larvae, which remained as first instar for up to 7 days (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), similar to the life expectancy of starved larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This trend was also seen using a constitutively active version of <italic>Murine </italic>Foxo1 (mFoxo1) containing an alanine substitution at the T1 (T24A), and S1 (S253A) Akt phosphorylation sites (mFoxo1-AA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In addition, larvae expressing dFOXO and mFoxo1-AA were often found to be wandering far from their food supply. We monitored feeding behavior by assessing the number of larvae away from their food at 48 and 72 hours after egg laying (AEL). Larvae expressing dFOXO and mFoxo1-AA showed a 3&#x02013;4 fold increase in wandering over larvae expressing Gal4 alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Thus, dFOXO expression drastically alters feeding behavior and is able to induce a starvation type response in larvae which have an adequate food supply.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of dFOXO in first instar larvae phenocopies starvation and effects feeding behavior. </bold>Expression of dFOXO and mFOXO1-AA early in larval development using the (A) <italic>ActGal4 </italic>and (C) <italic>hsGal4 </italic>driver lines leads to developmental arrest similar to that seen in starved larvae.

When dFOXO expression was discontinued after 2, 4, and 6 days of HST, developmentally arrested larvae were able to recover with decreased levels of survival as time progressed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Significant lethality was observed in controls as well suggesting that low survival rate was partially due to the expression of Gal4, which can induce apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], or the HST itself (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Nevertheless, developmental arrest caused by dFOXO is clearly reversible as these individuals could be returned to their normal path of development.</p></sec><sec><title>dFOXO performs an analogous function to <italic>C. elegans</italic>, Daf-16</title><p>The formation of dauer larvae in <italic>C. elegans </italic>is a developmental response to nutrient limitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

Although a few larvae did survive to adulthood after 2 days of HST, none of the larvae were able to continue development after 4, or 6 days of HST (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Out of 450 larvae examined at all time points, only 10 expressing mFoxo1-AA survived, when compared to 110 and 180 for larvae expressing dFOXO, and Gal4 alone, respectively. Presumably this occurs because Akt is unable to deactivate mFoxo1-AA, allowing it to continue functioning long after expression is induced. Taken together, this data suggests that dFOXO is evolutionarily conserved in function, possibly playing a role in the response to nutritional adversity, as seen in the formation of dauer larvae in <italic>C. elegans.</italic></p></sec><sec><title>dFOXO inhibits growth through alterations in cell size and cell number</title><p>Expression of dFOXO in the third instar larvae caused significant lethality, however, rare flies that did survive were much smaller than control flies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), showing a phenotype similar to that caused by mutations in <italic>chico </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], <italic>dAkt </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and <italic>dInr </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].

Expression of dPI3K caused a significant increase in ommatidia size over wild type (p = 0.001) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

Reduction of cell number can occur through either increased cell death, or decreased of cell proliferation. The Drosophila inhibitors of apoptosis, Diap1 and Diap2 (data not shown), and the baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis, p35 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), were unable to rescue the phenotype caused by dFOXO expression. In addition, acridine orange staining of eye imaginal discs expressing dFOXO showed no increase in apoptosis when compared to controls (data not shown). Drosophila Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (dEGFR) signaling acts to protect differentiated cells from death during eye development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. We thought that the pro-survival effects of dEGFR may be sufficient to suppress the phenotype caused by dFOXO overexpression. Co-expression of dEGFR with dFOXO, however, does not rescue the dFOXO phenotype as ommatidia and bristles are clearly still missing (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). Conversely, dFOXO does not appear to affect the phenotype of dEGFR overexpression as the general disorganization of the ommatidia appears to be the same (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Thus, it appears that these two mechanisms are acting independently. Taken together, these results suggest that dFOXO overexpression does not cause cell death during eye development as direct inhibitors of the apoptotic machinery (p35 and Diap1/2) and a known cell survival factor (dEGFR) were unable to rescue the dFOXO phenotype.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>dFOXO responds to dRas2 signaling, but not to inhibitors of apoptosis. </bold><italic>GMR-Gal4 </italic>was used to drive the expression of <italic>UAS-dFOXO </italic>(A) alone, and in the presence of (B) <italic>UAS-p35</italic>, (D) <italic>UAS-dEGFR</italic>, (F) <italic>UAS-Ras2</italic><sup><italic>V</italic>14</sup>. <italic>UAS-Ras2</italic><sup><italic>V</italic>14 </sup>was also expressed in combination with <italic>UAS-mFoxo1 </italic>(G) and <italic>UAS-mFoxo1-AA </italic>(H).

Expression of UAS-dRas2<sup>V14 </sup>under the control of GMR-Gal4 led to extreme overgrowth of the eye, lack of ommatidial organization, and the formation of huge ommatidia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>).

Recently, components of the insulin signaling pathway have been shown to regulate body size in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>through alterations in cell size and cell number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We have identified dFOXO as a negative controller of growth and organism size, which is regulated by components of the Drosophila insulin signaling pathway, dPI3K and dAkt. Through overexpression studies in the developing eye, we have shown that dFOXO is regulated by dPI3K and dAkt in a manner that is consistent with the regulatory mechanisms deduced through studies in <italic>C. elegans </italic>and mammalian cell culture. In addition, overexpression of dFOXO in the larvae reduces larval growth, phenocopies the effects of nutritional stress, and causes alterations in feeding behavior. With this in mind, we propose that dFOXO is involved in the response of Drosophila larvae to nutritional stress.</p><sec><title>Conservation of FOXO in Drosophila</title><p>The FOXO homologues appear to play an evolutionarily conserved role in the control of cellular processes under conditions of low levels of insulin signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Our experiments provide three lines of evidence supporting the conservation of this mechanism in Drosophila. First, dFOXO shows strong sequence homology to Daf-16 and the human FOXO homologues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). One significant characteristic is the high conservation of the three consensus Akt phosphorylation sites, suggesting that dAkt is most likely able to phosphorylate dFOXO <italic>in vivo</italic>, as shown biochemically with the mammalian FOXO homologues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Second, our experiments show that dFOXO and mFoxo1 cause nearly identical phenotypic responses when overexpressed in the developing Drosophila eye (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This suggests that the activity of these proteins is highly conserved as is observed when the <italic>C. elegans </italic>FOXO homologue, Daf-16, is expressed in mammalian cell culture[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Third, the phenotypic effects of FOXO overexpression can be modulated by alterations in the insulin signaling pathway. Reduced insulin signaling leads to a drastic enhancement of the phenotype that results from expression of FOXO factors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In contrast, increased insulin signaling tends to mask these phenotypes, in a manner that is dependent on the integrity of the Akt phosphorylation sites (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). As a result, we believe that regulation of FOXO is conserved in Drosophila, and that this will be a very useful system in elucidating the function of FOXO transcription factors in a model organism.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of size by dFOXO</title><p>Our results show that ectopic dFOXO expression can mediate reduction in cell size and cell number (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which these reductions occur are still unclear. Net reduction in cell number may occur through decreased cell proliferation or increased apoptosis. Insulin and other growth factors that activate PI3K and Akt have been implicated as potent survival factors in mammalian cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. They prevent cell death, in part, by inhibition of FOXO factors and it has been shown that FOXO3a can upregulate expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. In Drosophila, reduction of insulin signaling can lead to apoptosis in the developing embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. It is possible that this increase in apoptosis is a result of dFOXO activation, however, when dFOXO is expressed in the developing eye there is no apparent increase in apoptosis, nor is the phenotype suppressed by inhibition of caspases, or by co-expression of a known cell survival factor, dEGFR (unpublished observations, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These apparent discrepancies may be the result of tissue specific differences. In mammalian cell culture, induction of cell death by FOXO factors seems to be limited to non-transformed haematopoietic cell lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In Drosophila, loss of dAkt function, inhibition of dPI3K, or overexpression of dPTEN, all induce cell death in the embryo[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, in imaginal disc cells lacking PI3K function, there is no increase in apoptosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Thus, the cells in the embryo and imaginal discs may react differently to reduced levels of insulin signaling. Although we do not observe induction of apoptosis upon dFOXO expression, it is possible that increased levels of dFOXO activity (eg. through dominant negative inhibition of PI3K) do cause apoptosis.</p><p>Studies in mammalian cell culture have implicated FOXO factors in control of the cell cycle through increased expression of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. It is possible that the reduction of cell number seen upon dFOXO expression is a result of cell cycle inhibition. Co-expression of an activated version of Drosophila Ras2 (dRas2<sup>V14</sup>) was sufficient to increase cell number in the presence of dFOXO (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). dRas1 has been shown to induce growth in Drosophila imaginal discs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] through activation of dPI3K and the transcription factor dMyc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Although there is very little information available about dRas2, it is possible that the function of dRas2 overlaps with that of dRas1. Expression of dRas2<sup>V14 </sup>in the developing eye does cause a phenotype that suggests overgrowth of cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>), and the dRas2<sup>V14 </sup>interaction with dFOXO appears to be dependent on dAkt signaling (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6H</xref>). This is not surprising considering that dRas1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] and mammalian Ras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>] have been shown to activate PI3K signaling. Interestingly, increasing the cell cycle through overexpression of the transcription factors E2F and Dp did not rescue the cell number deficit seen upon overexpression of dFOXO (unpublished observations). This suggests the possibility that activation of dFOXO may override the function of other growth promoting factors, such as dMyc, which mediates dRas1 induced G1/S progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Supporting this, we have observed that increased growth as mediated by dAkt is entirely dependent on its ability to inactivate dFOXO (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4P</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Furthermore, increased growth mediated by dPI3K appears to be dependent on dFOXO inactivation with respect to increased cell number, but not cell size (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4O</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In humans, inactivation of FOXO factors may play an important role in tumor suppression by down regulating expression of D-type cyclins, thus inhibiting cell cycle progression and transformation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. It will be interesting to test the interactions between dFOXO and other cell cycle promoters to determine the extent of dFOXO dominance over cell proliferation.</p><p>In addition to its effect on cell number, dFOXO is able to control cell size (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The ability of dAkt to increase cell size is dependent on dFOXO inactivation, however, dPI3K does not need to inactivate dFOXO to increase cell size (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The difference between dPI3K and dAkt might be attributed to greater activity of the <italic>UAS-dPI3K </italic>transgene. However, expression of these constructs individually yields very similar results (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) indicating that this is probably not the case. This suggests that dPI3K may control size through dAkt-independent mechanisms. One possibility is through the positive growth regulator, dS6k[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. dAkt appears to increase growth through inhibition of a TSC1/TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis) complex[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. This complex acts through inhibition of dTOR (target of rampamycin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>], which promotes growth through activation of dS6K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Although it appears that dAkt can upregulate growth through dS6K, dS6K activity is not reduced in larvae lacking dAkt or dPI3K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. These results do not necessarily suggest that dPI3K and dAkt can not activate dS6K, as dS6K levels may be maintained through amino acid signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. dS6K activity was shown to be dependent on phosphoinositide dependent kinase (dPDK1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>], which interacts genetically with dAkt, dPI3K, dPTEN, and dInr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>] Thus, it is possible that dPI3K can modulate dS6K activity through dPDK1, independently of dAkt.</p></sec><sec><title>Insulin signaling and stress response</title><p>Studies in <italic>C. elegans </italic>indicate that insulin signaling is a critical mediator of longevity and stress resistance[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. One of the most well-studied stress responses is the Daf-16 mediated formation of the dauer larvae under conditions of starvation and/or crowding. Several lines of evidence indicate that dFOXO may play a similar role in Drosophila larvae. When Drosophila larvae are deprived of food prior to 70 hours AEL, they live in a state of developmental arrest for several days before death. However, when starved after 70 hours AEL, the larvae are able to develop into adults that are reduced in size. This alteration in developmental response has been termed the "70 hour change" and is likely determined by the minimum size required for a Drosophila larvae to enter pupation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We have mimicked the "70 hour change" through overexpression of dFOXO at different stages of larval development, in the presence of ample food (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). For example, ubiquitous high level expression of dFOXO in the early larvae (i.e. before 70 hours AEL) leads to developmental arrest, whereas heat shock induced expression of dFOXO during the third instar (i.e. after 70 hours AEL) leads to the development of small adults. Second, the normal development of starved larvae can resume upon the acquisition of food. Similarly, developmental arrest caused by expression of dFOXO prior to the "70 hour change" can be reversed if dFOXO expression is discontinued (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Developmental arrest caused by expression of mFoxo1-AA before the "70 hour change" is not reversible suggesting a constitutive starvation type response as seen in <italic>C. elegans </italic>when Daf-16 phosphorylation sites are mutated[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Interestingly, the reversibility of FOXO induced arrest has also been observed in mammalian cell culture[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. Third, under conditions of poor nutrition or crowding larval development does not cease, but the larval period is extended and small adults are produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We have replicated this effect through low level expression of dFOXO during the course of development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Finally, feeding behavior is drastically altered in larvae expressing dFOXO (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), causing them to wander away from their food. These larvae are often found crawling on the sides and lids of Petri dishes. This response may provide a selective advantage in the search for food as seen in <italic>C. elegans </italic>dauer larvae, which often crawl up to the highest point possible in hopes of attaching to passing organisms that could move the larvae to new locations with better food supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Taken together, these results suggest that dFOXO activity may act to promote survival during times of nutritional stress in a manner that recapitulates the formation of dauer larvae in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. It is tempting to speculate that dFOXO plays a role in response to other forms of stress, as observed with Daf-16[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. Mammalian FOXO factors have been implicated in the protective response to oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>] and FOXO factors are upregulated in response to caloric restriction in rat skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that FOXO factors provide an evolutionarily conserved switch, by which an organism can alter its developmental program in order to promote survival under harsh conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Insulin signaling and feeding behavior</title><p>Previously, it was observed that activation of insulin signaling caused larvae to wander away from their food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We have observed a similar effect through overexpression of dFOXO, which acts in opposition to insulin signaling. As described previously, it is possible that hyperactivation of insulin signaling may lead to depletion of the haemolymph by increasing the cellular uptake of nutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This would lead to increased hunger and cause the larvae to wander in search of food. Since PI3K activity is lost under conditions of starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] it stands to reason that dFOXO would be active under these conditions. Being a transcription factor, endogenous dFOXO could activate a host of genes under conditions of starvation leading to a "genetic starvation profile". Indeed gene expression is drastically altered upon starvation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Thus, dFOXO may induce larval wandering through expression of a sub-set of genes which are normally active during starvation, whereas activation of insulin signaling may induce larval wandering by causing physiological changes that lead to a false sense of starvation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have shown that dFOXO is conserved in sequence and regulatory mechanisms when compared to homologues from mammals and <italic>C. elegans</italic>. <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>provides a powerful tool for the analysis of genes in a whole organism. Thus, future studies in this organism should provide new insights into the biological function of the FOXO transcription factors. This may have implications to the study of cancer and diseases related to insulin, such as diabetes and obesity. Our data, taken together with that of others, suggests that dFOXO plays a protective role in the developmental response of Drosophila larvae to nutritional stress. Thus, it is possible that dFOXO plays a functional role in response to multiple forms of stress. In a world plagued with massive pollution and hunger it is important that we understand how our bodies react to starvation and environmental stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Identification and sequence analysis of <italic>dFOXO</italic></title><p>The human <italic>FOXO4 </italic>gene was used to search the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) genomic data bank for Drosophila homologues.
