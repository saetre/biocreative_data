While the gating properties of TRPM6 and TRPM7 channels have been studied in detail, little is known about the mechanisms regulating kinase activity. Recently, we found that TRPM7 associates with its substrate myosin II via a kinase-dependent mechanism suggesting a role for autophosphorylation in substrate recognition. Here, we demonstrate that the cytosolic C-terminus of TRPM7 undergoes massive autophosphorylation (32&#x000b1;4 mol/mol), which strongly increases the rate of substrate phosphorylation. Phosphomapping by mass spectrometry indicates that the majority of autophosphorylation sites (37 out of 46) map to a Ser/Thr-rich region immediately N-terminal of the catalytic domain. Deletion of this region prevents substrate phosphorylation without affecting intrinsic catalytic activity suggesting that the Ser/Thr-rich domain contributes to substrate recognition. Surprisingly, the TRPM6-kinase is regulated by an analogous mechanism despite a lack of sequence conservation with the TRPM7 Ser/Thr-rich domain. In conclusion, our findings support a model where massive autophosphorylation outside the catalytic domain of TRPM6 and TRPM7 may facilitate kinase-substrate interactions leading to enhanced phosphorylation of those substrates.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The channel-kinases TRPM6 and TRPM7 are bifunctional proteins consisting of a TRP cation channel fused to a kinase and represent the only two proteins in the mammalian genome with this particular architecture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001876-Bodding1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001876-Penner1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

The change in electrophoretic mobility is due to autophosphorylation because incubation of a catalytically inactive mutant with ATP had no effect on the migratory behavior of TRPM7-C-long.

In this classical experimental design, it is predicted that the phosphorylated kinase will phosphorylate its substrates more rapidly than the nonphosphorylated kinase if autophosphorylation is a key event in activating the protein kinase. The reason for the difference in kinetics is that the kinase pre-treated with ATP will be able to directly phosphorylate its substrates whereas the nonphosphorylated kinase will first need to undergo autophosphorylation. Here, we show that pre-treatment of TRPM7-C-long with ATP led to a significant increase in the kinetics of myosin II phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001876-g005">Fig. 5A,B</xref>). Suddenly, phosphorylation of myosin II was detectable within 10 s and increased steadily in the first 5 min, which is a time scale where no to little myosin II phosphorylation was detected if TRPM7-C-long was not previously incubated with ATP. TRPM7 requires approximately 5 min to complete autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001876-g004">Fig. 4</xref>) and after this time point, myosin II phosphorylation will proceed at the same rate in both samples explaining the detection of significant myosin II phosphorylation at later time points.

Our work now demonstrates a vital role for autophosphorylation of the Ser/Thr-rich domain in controlling the protein kinase activity of TRPM6 and TRPM7 towards their substrates. This investigation provides the first account of a mode of activation for the mammalian &#x003b1;-kinases TRPM6 and TRPM7 which will help refine current models and develop new ones as to how TRPM6 and TRPM7 function during health and disease.</p><p>How does autophosphorylation of the Ser/Thr-rich region affect the protein kinase activity of TRPM6 and TRPM7? Our data clearly demonstrate that in the absence of autophosphorylation or the Ser/Thr-rich domain, the phosphorylation of protein substrates by TRPM6 and TRPM7 is inefficient despite the kinase having full enzymatic activity. Thus, autophosphorylation of the Ser/Thr-rich region does not enhance enzymatic activity but provides access of the catalytic domain to the substrate. The simplest mechanistic explanation for this process is that substrate recognition occurs through a direct interaction between the hyperphosphorylated Ser/Thr-rich region and substrate. Unfortunately, the high salt conditions required to maintain myosin II filaments in a non-aggregated state <italic>in vitro</italic>, do not allow us to study direct interactions between hyperphosphorylated TRPM7 and myosin II. However, in support of this model, we have demonstrated that several residues in the Ser/Thr-rich domain are phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> and that the association of TRPM7 with myosin II in mammalian cells requires kinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001876-Clark1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, hyperphosphorylation of the Ser/Thr-rich region is predicted to cause dramatic changes in the 3D structure of TRPM6 and TRPM7, which may promote a conformation more apt for the phosphorylation of protein substrates. Current efforts are aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms by which hyperphosphorylation of the Ser/Thr-rich domain elevates substrate phosphorylation.</p><p>Although TRPM6 and TRPM7 are highly homologous proteins (50&#x00025; identity; 64&#x00025; similarity), remarkably the Ser/Thr-rich domain is poorly conserved at the amino acid level. Yet TRPM6 also requires massive autophosphorylation of the Ser/Thr-rich region for efficient substrate phosphorylation. From these results, we conclude that the build-up of negative charge in response to hyperphosphorylation is the defining property rather than the primary structure of the protein. In an attempt to further examine this notion, we varied the salt concentration in the kinase reactions. It is predicted that if the negative charge is an important characteristic of the hyperphosphorylated kinase then counteracting this charge by adding sodium ions should interfere with protein phosphorylation. Indeed, we noticed that the addition of salt inhibited the ability of TRPM7-C-long to phosphorylate myosin II but it had no effect on autophosphorylation (Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001876.s003">Fig. S2A, B</xref>). The differences in the degree of TRPM7-mediated phosphorylation of itself and myosin II in presence of salt is not due to different modes of catalysis (intra- vs. intermolecular) since intermolecular autophosphorylation of TRPM7 appears to be independent of salt or the presence of the regulatory domain (Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001876.s003">Fig. S2C</xref>). These data further strengthen the notion that the role of hyperphosphorylation of the Ser/Thr-rich region is to allow access of the catalytic domain to the substrate and moreover, that this process requires the build-up of negative charge. Notably, the region of the coiled-coil domain of myosin II that is phosphorylated by TRPM7 is positively charged. Thus, we speculate that electrostatic interactions between the hyperphosphorylated Ser/Thr-rich domain and myosin II are established to enhance substrate phosphorylation or provide substrate specificity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although we cannot exclude other effects of salt within the kinase reactions such as effects on substrate rather than kinase, this salt dependency should be further explored to assess the role of massive autophosphorylation in regulating the kinase activity of TRPM6 and TRPM7 towards their substrates.</p><p>One of the most surprising results of this investigation is the unprecedented number of autophosphorylation sites in TRPM6 and TRPM7. By LC-MS/MS, we identified 46 residues phosphorylated in wild-type (WT) but not in a catalytically inactive mutant of TRPM7 demonstrating that phosphorylation the result of autophosphorylation. Moreover, hyperphosphorylation of TRPM7 appears to be a physiologically relevant process since 20 sites were phosphorylated <italic>in vivo.</italic> Our phosphomapping experiments are consistent with the level of phosphate incorporation into the kinase where 32&#x000b1;4 mol of phosphate is incorporated per mol of TRPM7. Moreover, we identified previously reported sites of TRPM7 autophosphorylation including Thr1482, Ser1512 and Ser1568 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001876-Matsushita1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001876-Hermosura1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The authenticity of the phosphorylation sites is further demonstrated by the ratio of phosphorylated serine and threonine residues and their distribution within TRPM7. Phosphoamino acid analysis of TRPM7 determined that phosphate is incorporated 70&#x00025; into serines and 30&#x00025; into threonines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001876-Schmitz2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001876-Hermosura1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Accordingly, we identify 31 serine and 15 threonine residues that are phosphorylated by TRPM7. Moreover, these residues (37 out of 46) are predominantly located in the Ser/Thr-rich domain, which is directly adjacent to the catalytic domain. Deletion of this region leads to a corresponding 4-fold decrease in phosphate incorporation into TRPM7. Others have also found this region of TRPM6 and TRPM7 to be strongly autophosphorylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001876-Matsushita1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001876-Schmitz2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In conclusion, our data convincingly show the presence and identification of multiple TRPM6/TRPM7 autophosphorylation sites.</p><p>A major challenge is to identify residues essential for TRPM6 and TRPM7 kinase activity. By deletion mapping, we have determined that the Ser/Thr-rich region between residues 1380 and 1548, which contains the greatest density of autophosphorylation sites, is required for the electrophoretic mobility shift and efficient phosphorylation of substrates. However, we have yet to identify any priming event that would modulate the extent of TRPM7 autophosphorylation, which is consistent with a model where a build-up of negative charge is required for substrate phosphorylation. Mutation of different residues to alanine (Ser1512, Ser1568, Thr1686, Ser1694, Ser1780) either individually or in combination did not suffice to affect TRPM7 autophosphorylation or activity towards myosin II (Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001876.s004">Fig. S3</xref>). Previously, Matsushita and colleagues reported that Ser1512 and Ser1568 are the major sites of TRPM7 autophosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001876-Matsushita1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Mutation of these residues to alanine led to a 90&#x00025; decrease in phosphate incorporation during <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays. This discrepancy with our study may reflect differences in expression systems. We have opted to purify TRPM7 directly from mammalian cells whereas Matsushita <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001876-Matsushita1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> produced TRPM7 in bacteria. A major problem with the purification of recombinant proteins from prokaryotic cells is the reproducibility of the specific activity of the enzyme. Unfortunately, Matsushita and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001876-Matsushita1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> did not provide evidence that catalytic activity of the TRPM7 S1512A/S1568A double mutant was intact by measuring the phosphorylation of a peptide substrate such as MBP, which was previously shown to be independent of autophosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001876-Ryazanova1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, nor did they confirm that mutation of Ser1512 and Ser1568 was sufficient to abolish the incorporation of <sup>32</sup>P into TRPM7 in mammalian cells. In contrast, we have found many autophosphorylation sites of TRPM7 basally phosphorylated in mammalian cells and in combination with our <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis of TRPM7 mutants, it seems unlikely that the TRPM7 S1512A/S1568A mutant would have significantly reduced incorporation of phosphate in living cells. Although our study raises doubts about the contribution of Ser1512 and Ser1568 to the capacity of TRPM7 to undergo autophosphorylation in mammalian cells, it is plausible that an unknown factor in mammalian cells may predispose TRPM7 to undergo massive autophosphorylation despite the mutation of Ser1512 and Ser1568 to alanine. This factor could be an associated protein or phosphorylation by upstream protein kinases. Indeed, we have found 3 phosphorylation sites in a catalytically inactive mutant of TRPM7 demonstrating the presence of protein kinases capable of phosphorylating TRPM7. These sites are unlikely to be phosphorylated in bacterially-produced TRPM7 and therefore, may regulate the extent of TRPM7 autophosphorylation. Clearly, further studies are required to address the discrepancies between our study and that of Matsushita and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001876-Matsushita1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The molecular mechanism regulating the protein kinase activity of TRPM6 and TRPM7 shows similarities but also important differences with that of other &#x003b1;-kinases.

However, complete autophosphorylation does not appear to be required for activation of MHC kinases since autophosphorylation of 3 sites (out of 10) is sufficient to activate MHCKA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001876-Medley1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> and myosin II phosphorylation proceeds in parallel to MHCKC autophosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001876-Liang1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, TRPM6 and TRPM7 only phosphorylate myosin II under conditions allowing complete autophosphorylation of the kinases. Interestingly, eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2) kinase and MHCK, like TRPM7, require the presence of additional regulatory domains for efficient substrate phosphorylation. In contrast to TRPM6 and TRPM7 however, the regulatory domains in eEF-2 kinase and MHCK are not subject to autophosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001876-Steimle1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001876-Diggle1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

Based on the experimental evidence, we propose that massive autophosphorylation of the Ser/Thr-rich domain in TRPM6 and TRPM7 provides an electrostatic interface for the recruitment of substrates which greatly enhances their phosphorylation.

(C) Intermolecular autophosphorylation of TRPM7 is independent of salt. Lysates of mammalian cells expressing WT TRPM7-C-short were added to those of cells expressing KD TRPM7-C-long. The proteins were co-purified by immunoprecipitation using anti-HA antibodies. The beads were incubated with Mn&#x0005b;g-32P&#x0005d;-ATP for 30 min at 30&#x000b0;C in presence of 0 and 250 mM NaCl. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography.</p><p>(0.46 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001876.s003.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001876.s004"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p>Mutation of Ser1512, Ser1568, Thr1686, Ser1694 or Ser1780 to alanine has no effect on TRPM7 autophosphorylation or substrate phosphorylation.

(A) Electrophoretic mobility shift. After incubation in absence or presence of ATP, proteins were subjected to immunoblotting using anti-HA antibodies. (B) Phosphorylation of myosin II is unaffected by the different point mutations. TRPM7-C-long was incubated with GST-myosin IIB in presence of Mn&#x0005b;g-32P&#x0005d;-ATP.
