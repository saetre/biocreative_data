So far, the function of OBF1 has been mainly identified in late stage B cell populations. The central defect of OBF1 deficient mice is a severely reduced immune response to T cell-dependent antigens and a lack of germinal center formation in the spleen. Relatively little is known about a potential function of OBF1 in developing B cells. Here we have generated transgenic mice overexpressing OBF1 in B cells under the control of the immunoglobulin heavy chain promoter and enhancer. Surprisingly, these mice have greatly reduced numbers of follicular B cells in the periphery and have a compromised immune response. Furthermore, B cell differentiation is impaired at an early stage in the bone marrow: a first block is observed during B cell commitment and a second differentiation block is seen at the large preB2 cell stage. The cells that succeed to escape the block and to differentiate into mature B cells have post-translationally downregulated the expression of transgene, indicating that expression of OBF1 beyond the normal level early in B cell development is deleterious. Transcriptome analysis identified genes deregulated in these mice and <italic>Id2</italic> and <italic>Id3</italic>, two known negative regulators of B cell differentiation, were found to be upregulated in the EPLM and preB cells of the transgenic mice. Furthermore, the <italic>Id2</italic> and <italic>Id3</italic> promoters contain octamer-like sites, to which OBF1 can bind. These results provide evidence that tight regulation of OBF1 expression in early B cells is essential to allow efficient B lymphocyte differentiation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The development of B lymphocytes is under precise control by a large number of transcription factors acting at distinct stages to promote cellular differentiation, survival or proliferation. Critical factors for early B cell specification and commitment are E2A, early B cell factor 1 (EBF1) and Pax5 and other factors play important roles at later stages (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Fuxa1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Nutt1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>). OBF1 is a transcriptional coactivator that is expressed predominantly in B cells but also in activated T cells and forms a ternary complex with the POU domain transcription factors Oct1 and/or Oct2 on conserved octamer motifs (ATGCAAAT) of immunoglobulin (Ig) and other target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Luo1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Zwilling1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

Work from several laboratories has shown that OBF1 has an important function in late B cell development: ablation of OBF1 leads to reduced splenic seeding by transitional B cells and to lower numbers of recirculating B cells in the bone marrow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Hess1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Schubart3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

Surprisingly, we observed that these mice have strongly reduced numbers of follicular B cells in the periphery as well as of preB cells in the bone marrow. In addition, these mice show defects in the immune response elicited by follicular B cells, but have a normal MZ B cell response. We present evidence that these defects are due to the premature expression of OBF1 in early progenitors with lymphoid and myeloid potential, the so-called EPLM cells, which normally do not yet express this factor. Furthermore, we identified a number of genes which are deregulated in the transgenic cells, among which the negative regulators <italic>Id2</italic> and <italic>Id3</italic>.

The mature B cell gate can be further subdivided into the sessile MZ B cells (CD23<sup>low</sup> CD21<sup>high</sup>) and the follicular B cells (CD23<sup>high</sup> CD21<sup>low</sup>). Unexpectedly, the BCS transgenic mice showed a strong reduction in the number of splenic transitional and follicular B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, left). The increased relative percentage in the MZ gate by FACS analysis is due to the reduction of the follicular B cell compartment and not to an increase of MZ B cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, right).

The immune response of follicular B cells was also investigated by injecting NIP-OVA subcutaneously and measuring the NIP-specific anti-IgG serum titers 14 days later. In this case, this TD immune response was found to be significantly weaker in the BCS than in the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g001">Fig 1E</xref>). The impaired T-dependent immune response was further confirmed by immunizing mice with DNP-KLH, another TD antigen, and examining specific IgG serum titers at different time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>); in this case, a delayed and reduced response in the BCS mice was also observed, in good agreement with the observations presented above.</p><p>Next, western blot analysis was performed to investigate the expression of the transgene in splenic B cells and in the thymus, as the promoter/enhancer combination used to drive the <italic>OBF1</italic> cDNA can also be active in T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Jenuwein1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Surprisingly, in splenic B cells of BCS origin expression of the transgenic OBF1 protein was not detected by either the anti-OBF1 or the anti-HA antibody, suggesting that it may be very low (see also below). In contrast, in WT splenic B cells bands corresponding to the p34 and p35 isoforms of endogenous OBF1 were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). Moreover, in thymocytes from BCS, but not from WT mice, transgenic OBF1 expression could be evidenced by both antibodies. Since the OBF1 expressed from the transgene should be an HA-tagged p34 protein, its expected size is marginally larger than that of endogenous p35 and this is just what is observed (compare lanes 2 and 3). Together, the reduced follicular B cell numbers, the apparent lack of OBF1 expression in mature B cells and the T dependent immunodeficiency observed in BCS mice suggest the presence of a defect at an early developmental stage in the bone marrow.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>The decrease of splenic B cell populations is due to impaired early B cell differentiation</title><p>To identify the cause of the reduced splenic B cell compartment in BCS mice, the bone marrow B cell populations were investigated by FACS analysis using a number of antibodies allowing to define the early stages of B cell development.

deregulated genes were then clustered in 9 expression pattern families with the Expressionist program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). The cluster &#x0201c;a&#x0201d; is possibly the most interesting group, as these genes are upregulated both in EPLM and large preB2 cells of BCS mice, and are therefore putative OBF1 direct target genes. The top upregulated genes in this cluster are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g005">Figure 5D</xref>; based on the gene ontology (GO) classification, the genes in cluster &#x0201c;a&#x0201d; are mainly involved in lymphocyte development and activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>).

In addition, cluster &#x0201c;a&#x0201d; also contains the <italic>Id2</italic> gene, which encodes an inhibitor of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein E2A. Cluster &#x0201c;d&#x0201d;, which corresponds to genes specifically deregulated in EPLMs, is also particularly interesting, as it contains another Id gene, <italic>Id3</italic>. Thus, <italic>Id2</italic> and <italic>Id3</italic> are both upregulated in EPLMs of BCS mice and <italic>Id2</italic> is also upregulated in BCS large preB2 cells.</p><p>The same gene can appear in different clusters (e.g. <italic>TCF12</italic> in clusters a and d), because different probes recognize different forms of the corresponding gene transcript.

This misregulated expression pattern of OBF1 ultimately has a dramatic impact on mature B cells in the spleen, as the mice have an impaired T-dependent immune response accompanied with a strong reduction of follicular B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g001">Fig. 1Band E, F</xref>). This immunodeficiency is likely due to the reduced number of follicular B cells, since the T-independent immune response is not impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Surprisingly, the number of marginal zone B cells is not affected despite the B cell developmental block in the bone marrow and the decrease in splenic immature B cells. One explanation might be that the transitional B cells entering the spleen first repopulate the MZ compartment and then the follicles, and are in sufficient number to fill the MZ. This hypothesis is supported by the earlier observation that the MZ compartment is normal in several other lymphopenic mutant mice such as <italic>IL-7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-vonFreedenJeffry1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> or <italic>Lambda5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Harfst1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, the response to immunization with NIP-Ficoll, which is known to be dependent on the MZ B compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Zandvoort1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, is also normal in BCS mice. Thus, by these two criteria the follicular and MZ B cell compartment are differentially affected by the presence of the transgene. The total IgM level in unimmunized BCS mice was higher than in the WT mice suggesting that it could be the cause for the high NIP specific IgM background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). In fact, the number of B1b B cells is increased in the peritoneal cavity of BCS mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004007.s001">Figure S1</xref>), which could contribute to explain the higher IgM level in these mice. On the other hand the total IgG level, as well as specific IgG isotypes, were not altered in unimmunized BCS mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). The transgene is expressed in the thymus at the protein level, but surprisingly not in splenic B cells; this suggests that the cause for the decreased number of immature and follicular B cells is localized at an earlier B cell developmental stage in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>). OBF1 was recently reported to also function in determining T helper cell polarity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Brunner1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the elevated OBF1 expression in thymocytes might influence TD antibody responses; however, it is worth noting that T cell development and the numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the thymus are not affected by the transgene (data not shown).</p><p>Investigation of the bone marrow, which is the site of early B cell development, allowed to identify the cause of the reduced splenic B cell numbers. A first block was detected between the EPLM and the preB1 cell stage. In the normal situation, EPLMs are mostly committed to the B cell lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Balciunaite1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> and do not yet express OBF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). However, enforcing expression of OBF1 in this population induces an accumulation of EPLMs with a strong B cell commitment deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Indeed, the cells that succeed to pass this developmental block downregulate the transgene post-translationally, indicating that the level of OBF1 has to be low at this stage for proper B cell differentiation. OBF1 is known to be regulated at the protein level in mature B cells, potentially through interaction with the Ring finger protein SIAH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Boehm1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Tiedt1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results suggest that the OBF1 protein level may also be modulated in early B cells, at least in the case of the transgenic mice described here. Whether this modulation of OBF1 protein levels is mediated by SIAH, or by other mechanisms, is not known. Remarkably, <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures of EPLMs showed that premature expression of OBF1 in this cell compartment severely impairs their proliferation and differentiation potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). This is in stark contrast to the effect observed in OBF1 deficient IL-7 dependent pro-preB cells: in this case, cellular proliferation is markedly improved in comparison to WT cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Siegel1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> and data not shown). Thus, in very early B cells OBF1 appears to antagonize cell proliferation and fine regulation of its expression level may be used to set a regulatory threshold. A second differentiation block was also observed after the large preB2 (CD43<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) cell stage. It is not clear whether this is directly due to the increased expression of OBF1 in the preB cells, or whether this is a secondary effect whose origin is in the EPLMs. Generation of mice overexpressing OBF1 starting at the preB1 or preB2 stage might allow to address this point.</p><p>Mixed bone marrow chimera mice could fully recapitulate the initial phenotype and confirmed that the differentiation defect is intrinsic to the BCS B cell precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). When a 1&#x02236;1 mix of WT and BCS bone marrow was injected into irradiated mice, we observed that about 40&#x00025; of the thymic developing T cells were of BCS origin and in the spleen the proportion was still about 25&#x00025;. In striking contrast, the BCS-derived B cell compartment was underrepresented and contained only a few percent of mature B cells in the spleen. Furthermore, a strong developmental block was evident in the bone marrow with a dramatic accumulation of EPLMs accompanied with a deficit to progress to the preB1 stage.</p><p>How the deregulated expression of OBF1 in the early EPLM compartment leads to the defects described here is not understood yet. As a first attempt to address this question, we have analyzed the transcriptome of EPLM and large preB2 cells in WT or BCS mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). We found significantly more genes misregulated at the EPLM stage than at the large preB2 cell stage and relatively little overlap between the two sets of genes. However, several of the main transcription factors and known regulatory molecules of early B cell differentiation were either not affected or rather expressed at a slightly higher level in the BCS-derived EPLMs. For example, the helix-loop-helix factor <italic>E2A</italic> is expressed at a normal level, while <italic>EBF1</italic> and <italic>Pax5</italic> are both upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Generally our results point to the critical importance of maintaining proper regulation of OBF1 expression during early B cell differentiation. So far, relatively little is known about how the <italic>OBF1</italic> gene is regulated and the DNA sequences controlling its cell-specific and temporal expression have not been delineated yet. A functionally important cAMP response element (CRE) binding site has been identified in the proximal OBF1 promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Stevens1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref> but it can not explain the regulated B cell-specific expression of this gene and in transfection experiments the <italic>OBF1</italic> promoter does not appear to be clearly B cell-specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Massa1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, EBF1 has been very recently identified as a potentially direct regulator of OBF1 expression in progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Zandi1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. As shown here, OBF1 is co-expressed from the preB1 stage onwards together with transcription factors like EBF1 that drive B cell commitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g002">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). However, in the BCS mice the OBF1 transgene is expressed already before EBF1 and this altered sequence of expression compromises the development of the proB cells. In fact, the elevated level of endogenous OBF1 expression in EPLMs of BCS mice may be a direct consequence of the EBF1 upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g006">Fig. 6</xref>), in agreement with the findings of Zandi et al. (2008). However, although EBF1 and Pax5 are misregulated in BCS-derived EPLMs, this does not explain the observed B cell commitment defect, as enforced expression of these genes favours B cell differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Cotta1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Zhang2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, <italic>EBF1</italic> showed the same pattern of expression as <italic>Id2</italic> and <italic>Id3</italic> in EPLM cells from BCS mice. The <italic>EBF1</italic> promoter also contains conserved octamer sequences, and preliminary results suggest that they can be targeted by OBF1. Therefore the EBF1-OBF1 axis constitutes a positive feedback loop, as OBF1 is itself an EBF1 target gene. The upregulation of EBF1 in BCS mice may also be explained by the upregulation of Pax5 in EPLM cells, which was recently reported to activate the proximal promoter of <italic>EBF1</italic> (Roessler et al., 2007).</p><p>The <italic>Id2</italic> and <italic>Id3</italic> genes were both found deregulated in the microarray as well as in the qPCR validation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g005">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g006">6</xref>); in particular, elevated expression was found in EPLMs and also in large preB2 cells, which are just the stages were the developmental blocks have been observed in BCS mice <italic>in vivo</italic>. Expression of <italic>Id3</italic> has been reported to be repressed by OBF1 in a preB cell line expressing an inducible OBF1-ER fusion protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Brunner1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>; the reason for this difference is not clear, but might be due to differences between the expressed proteins (OBF1 vs OBF1-ER fusion) or between the cells examined. The identification of several motifs with homology to the octamer site in the <italic>Id2</italic> and <italic>Id3</italic> promoters suggested that these genes could be direct OBF1 targets and chromatin immunoprecipitations showed that OBF1 can indeed bind to these octamer sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Generally Id proteins have been found to antagonize the activity of bHLH proteins, and in particular of E2A. Several previous studies have shown that low levels of Id proteins are necessary to allow E2A to drive B cell commitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Deed1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Ji1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. In line with this, constitutive expression of Id proteins downstream of the preB1 stage was found to impair B cell development, indicating that Id downregulation is critical for B cell ontogeny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Sun2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, it was also reported that Id3 inhibits the growth and survival of B lymphocyte progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Kee1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. These observations therefore suggest that elevated expression of Id2 and Id3 could result in a differentiation block at the EPLM and large preB2 cell stage, as seen in the BCS mice.</p><p>Finally, Syndecan1 is a plasma cell marker whose <italic>in vivo</italic> function is not clear yet. However, Syndecan1 was reported previously to be upregulated on the surface of <italic>OBF1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> splenic B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004007-Corcoran1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> and our microarray analysis of <italic>OBF1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice showed that Syndecan1 is upregulated also at the mRNA level (data not shown). Interestingly, we found here that Syndecan1 expression was strongly downregulated in all the early B cell populations of the BCS mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004007-g006">Fig. 6</xref>), indicating that there is a negative correlation between OBF1 and Syndecan1 expression. Thus, <italic>Syndecan1</italic> represents a novel OBF1 target gene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004007.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>(A) FACS analysis of the spleen and peritoneal cavity.
