In eukaryotes two proteins eRF1 and eRF3 play a crucial function in the termination process. The essential GTPase Sup35p, the eRF3 release factor of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>is highly conserved. In particular, we observed that all eRF3 homologs share a potential phosphorylation site at threonine 341, suggesting a functional role for this residue. The goal of this study was to determine whether this residue is actually phosphorylated in yeast and if it is involved in the termination activity of the protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We detected no phosphorylation of the Sup35 protein <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, we show that it is phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A on T341 <italic>in vitro</italic>. T341 was mutated to either alanine or to aspartic acid to assess the role of this residue in the activity of the protein. Both mutant proteins showed a large decrease of GTPase activity and a reduced interaction with eRF1/Sup45p. This was correlated with an increase of translational readthrough in cells carrying the mutant alleles. We also show that this residue is involved in functional interaction between the N- and C-domains of the protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results point to a new critical residue involved in the translation termination activity of Sup35 and in functional interaction between the N- and C-domains of the protein. They also raise interesting questions about the relation between GTPase activity of Sup35 and its essential function in yeast.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The translation of genetic information into proteins is essential for all biological systems. In eukaryotes, the process is divided into at least three steps: initiation, elongation and termination, and all three steps of translation involve GTP-binding proteins and phosphorylations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The structure of the GTP-binding proteins functioning at each step is well conserved from yeast to mammals, and these proteins are fundamental to living cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In the initiation and elongation steps, eIF2 and eEF1A, which deliver, respectively, the methionyl-initiator tRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit and the aminoacyl-tRNAs to the A-site of the ribosome, were identified as the GTP-binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] while in the termination step, it is eRF3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Translation termination takes place on ribosomes when a stop codon enters the ribosomal A site and signals polypeptide chain release from the peptidyl-tRNA located in the ribosomal P site. In eukaryotes, two polypeptide chain release factors have been described: eRF1 recognizes and decodes all three nonsense codons and eRF3 stimulates peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis in the ribosome in a GTP- and eRF1-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Recent genetic and biochemical data suggest that the GTPase activity is required to couple the recognition of translation termination signals by eRF1 to efficient polypeptide chain release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, reconstitution <italic>in vitro </italic>of the eukaryotic translation initiation, elongation, and termination processes made it possible to propose a model for the mechanism of translation termination in eukaryotes. Binding of eRF1, eRF3, and GTP to pretermination complexes induces a major structural rearrangement that leads to GTP hydrolysis for correct positioning of eRF1, followed by rapid release of the nascent peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Similarly, in prokaryotes, RF3 is involved in recycling of RF1 and RF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, eRF1 and eRF3 are encoded by essential genes, <italic>SUP45 </italic>and <italic>SUP35</italic>, and often designated as Sup45p and Sup35p, respectively. eRF1 and eRF3 can interact both <italic>in vivo </italic>and in <italic>vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The eRF3 genes are conserved from yeast to mammals. In most species examined, eRF3 consists of three domains (N, M and C) whose functions have been defined for <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>eRF3. Both the N and M domains are dispensable for viability and translation termination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] in contrast to the C-terminal region which carries the GTPase activity, interacts with eRF1 and is indispensable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. All the mutants isolated up to now, showed a correlation between GTPase activity and viability.</p><p>The C-terminal domain of the eRF3 proteins is highly conserved between species and shows significant homology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], as well as close structural similarities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] to the elongation factor eEF1A. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and also in other budding yeast species, the N and M domains are responsible for the formation of the prion-like [PSI+] factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In [PSI+] (but not in [psi-]) cells, eRF3 forms aggregates which lead to defects in translation termination and consequently to omnipotent nonsense suppression. The N domains of higher eukaryotes have no obvious sequence homology with the corresponding domains of lower eukaryotes although, they have an unusual amino acid composition as do the yeast proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we identified a potential cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation site in the C-terminal region of the yeast Sup35 protein. We show that the protein is phosphorylated <italic>in vitro </italic>by PKA on threonine 341 (T341), although no phosphorylation was detected in the conditions tested <italic>in vivo</italic>. Alteration of this evolutionary conserved site modifies the <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>activity of the protein in translation termination. Surprisingly our results demonstrate that Sup35p mutants displaying very low GTPase activity are able to support cell growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Conservation of the phosphorylation site among organisms</title><p>The amino acid sequence R/K-R/K-N-S/T is the consensus PKA recognition site, and either S or T is the phosphorylation site. A putative PKA phosphorylation site containing threonine 341 (T341) is present in the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>eRF3 (Sup35p) sequence and is conserved among others yeasts and fungi. In drosophila, human and mouse the site is degenerated, but T341 still belongs to a phosphorylation site, recognized by the CK2 protein kinase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In a sequence-based approach, the evolutionary conservation of all PKA consensus sites in the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>proteome was systematically assessed within a group of related yeasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The study demonstrated that the likelihood of phosphorylation correlated well with the degree of conservation of the PKA consensus sites. The evolutionary preservation of the eRF3 phosphorylation site thus suggests that this site probably plays an important role <italic>in vivo</italic>. To test the functionality of the PKA phosphorylation site of Sup35p, we generated threonine to alanine (A) or aspartate (D) mutants. Alanine cannot be phosphorylated, whereas aspartate mimics the presence of phosphate groups.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Alignment of eRF3 protein sequences</bold>.

Furthermore, the purified full-length proteins were unstable and precipitated rapidly upon storage, probably due to the presence of the aggregating N-terminal domain. Consequently, the same experiments were performed with the C-terminal part of the wild-type, A or D mutant proteins purified as His-Tag fusion polypeptides from <italic>E. coli</italic>. We wondered if the Sup35pcter [C-terminus] alone could be phosphorylated by PKA <italic>in vitro</italic>. The results show that the truncated proteins behaved as did the corresponding full-length proteins. The C-terminal part of Sup35p was phosphorylated by PKA <italic>in vitro</italic>, and the A and D mutants were also phosphorylated but to a much lower extent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>).</p><p>To search for a difference in electrophoretic mobility between the <italic>in vitro </italic>phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated protein forms, we performed SDS-polyacrylamide gels in various conditions (see Materials and Methods), but no change in the electrophoretic migration was seen between the protein forms (not illustrated).</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>in vitro </italic>phosphorylated residue is threonine 341</title><p>To check which residue was phosphorylated by PKA <italic>in vitro</italic>, the phosphorylated full-length His-Tag fusion Sup35p was subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. The MALDI mass spectrum of the unfractioned tryptic digest allowed us to obtain 70% sequence coverage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). A peptide whose mass did not correspond to the mass of any predicted tryptic peptide was detected, but it was about 80 Da above the theoretical mass of the peptide [339&#x02013;349]. The possible presence of one phosphate group was fully relevant, as long as the sequence of this tryptic fragment is RYTILDAPGHK, and contains 2 potential phosphorylation sites (Y340 and T341). This was confirmed by performing an on-target dephosphorylation experiment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). As the signal of the alkaline phosphatase-treated sample was diminished by 80 Da compared to the untreated peptide, [339&#x02013;349] was indeed a mono-phosphorylated species.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Mass spectrometry analysis of phosphorylated Sup35p</bold>.

Each fraction collected was analysed by MALDI mass spectrometry prior to and after on-target dephosphorylation, and [339&#x02013;349] was recovered in the presence of two other minor peptides (data not shown). Peptide [339&#x02013;349] of the HPLC fraction was sequenced by PSD-MALDI TOF mass spectrometry. The PSD spectrum of the derivatised peptide [339&#x02013;349] (m/z 1528.6565) is shown Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>. The &#x003b2;-elimination occurring (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>loss) suggested phosphorylation on the T341 residue rather than on Y340, because such &#x003b2;-elimination is observed for phosphorylated serine or threonine, but not for tyrosine. This was confirmed by the presence of a mass difference between two adjacent peaks corresponding to a dehydroamino-2-butyric acid product (i.e. 83 Da).</p></sec><sec><title>Search for a pool of phosphorylated Sup35p <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To determine whether Sup35p is phosphorylated in yeast cells, we labelled with [<sup>32</sup>P]orthophosphate a culture of the <italic>SUP35</italic>-deleted strain that contains a plasmid-encoded <italic>SUP35 </italic>wild-type gene fused to a C-terminal HA-Tag, and immunoprecipitated Sup35p with an HA-specific antibody. Western blot analyses of the immunoprecipitated proteins and the immunoprecipitation supernatants showed that approximately one third of the Sup35 proteins was immunoprecipitated. The same experiments were performed using a strain deleted of PKA, and also in a <italic>SUP35</italic>-deleted strain expressing a plasmid coding for the A mutant protein fused to the HA-Tag and unable to be phosphorylated on T341. Labelling and immunoprecipitation were carried out on exponentially growing cells, as well as on stationary phase cells. In spite of numerous attempts, we did not observe a radioactive pool of Sup35p (data not shown). Since the FS1 strain carries a [PSI+] determinant, it seemed possible that the aggregation of Sup35p could alter protein phosphorylation, or decrease immunoprecipitation efficiency and as a result could reduce the immunoprecipitated sub-fraction of phosphorylated Sup35p. To test this possibility, similar experiments were performed in a <italic>SUP35</italic>-deleted strain carrying only the C-terminal domain of Sup35p, fused to a C-terminal HA-Tag and again, no radioactive pool of Sup35p was detected (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Mutation T341D compromises cell viability, T341A does not</title><p>Complementation assays of a <italic>SUP35 </italic>gene deletion were performed with the mutated alleles.

Plasmid shuffling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] was then carried out by plating the transformants onto medium supplemented with 5-fluoroorotic acid, an uracil analog that allows the formation of colonies only from cells that have lost the wild-type <italic>SUP35 </italic>plasmid with the <italic>URA3 </italic>marker. The ability to form colonies indicates that the Sup35p mutant alone can support viability, while the absence of colonies indicates that the mutant form of Sup35p is unable to support cell viability. The wild-type and the A mutant were able to grow but not the D mutant, suggesting that the T341 residue is subjected to functional constraints and that the introduction of a negative charge in this position alters cell viability. The A mutant behaved like the wild-type strain and did not show thermosensitivity at 37&#x000b0;C (data not shown). A glutamate mutant (T341E) was also constructed to mimic the presence of phosphate groups, and presented the same phenotypes as the D mutant. The essential function of Sup35p is located in the C-terminal domain, thus C-terminal-T341A and C-terminal-T341D mutants were also constructed and used in such a complementation assay as above. Surprisingly, both mutants were able to complement the loss of wild-type Sup35p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), indicating that the N-terminal part of Sup35p might be implicated in the lethality observed in presence of the full-length Sup35p D mutant.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Full-length T341D compromise viability whereas the C-terminal T341D does not.

Alignment of eRF3 sequences showed that this site is highly conserved. Kallmeyer <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] already addressed the absence of phosphorylation of Sup35p <italic>in vivo</italic>, however Le Roy <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] demonstrated differential phosphorylation states of the human eRF3, which is highly homologous to the yeast Sup35p. In addition, the serine/threonine protein kinase Sch9, whose activity functionally overlaps those of the PKA and TOR kinases, was recently identified in a proteome-wide screen for protein-protein interactions as forming a complex with, and presumably, phosphorylating Sup35p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Phosphorylation being sometimes very labile, the modified isoforms might be difficult to detect. This led us to run the experiment in conditions different from Kallmeyer <italic>et al</italic>. We demonstrated that threonine 341 of the consensus site was indeed phosphorylated <italic>in vitro </italic>by PKA. However, in the <italic>in vivo </italic>conditions tested, no pool of phosphorylated Sup35p was observed. Since Budovskaya <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] demonstrated that the presence of a highly conserved PKA consensus site was a very strong predictor of physiological PKA phosphorylation, we think it cannot be excluded that phosphorylation could occur, but in particular conditions we did not explore yet. However, the simplest interpretation is that Sup35 protein is actually not phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic>. Indeed, <italic>in vitro </italic>phosphorylation assays frequently identify non-physiological substrates for various kinases.</p><p>Although no phosphorylation was detected in position 341, mutant forms of Sup35p, mimicking either a non-phosphorylated (A mutant), or a constitutively phosphorylated (D mutant) protein were constructed, anticipating that if phosphorylation actually occurs in particular physiological conditions, the residue involved would have an important role in the function of the protein. These mutations were incorporated either in the full-length protein or in the essential C-terminal domain. An almost two fold increase in the level of readthrough was observed with the C-terminal form of the T341A mutant and a four fold increase was observed with the C-terminal form of the T341D mutant, compared to the wild-type. Consistent with these results, both mutant forms showed decreased interaction with Sup45p, indicating that the termination complex is less actively formed. The highest readthrough levels obtained in the A and D mutants were observed with the TGA stop codon. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis of Salas-Marco and Bedwell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] that Sup35p may help Sup45p discriminate between UGG and certain stop codons.</p><p>When we checked for phenotypes, we found that strains expressing the C-terminal form of either mutant are viable, while the T341D mutation in the full-length protein context was not able to support viability. Thus functional interaction between the N- and C-terminal parts of Sup35p is responsible for the lethality of the full-length D mutant. The presence of the N-terminal part of Sup35p was previously shown to decrease translation termination efficiency in a [psi-] background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Similarly, in a recent work Volkov <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] found that the N terminus acts as a negative factor, increasing nonsense suppression efficiency in <italic>sup35 </italic>mutants containing amino acid substitutions in the C-terminal domain. Therefore, one reason for the lethal effect of the T341D mutation in the full-length protein could be a too important rate of nonsense readthrough, which could be incompatible with cell viability. Strikingly, a Y340H substitution (the residue preceeding T341) directed higher stop codon readthrough efficiencies in a full-length compared to a C-terminal context, while not affecting the PKA consensus site. This is consistent with the results reported here for the T341D mutant. In the later case the consequence is even more drastic since the presence of both domains leads to lethality. Volkov <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] concluded that the N-terminal extension of Sup35p might decrease the GTPase activity in strains that contain amino acid substitutions in the C-terminal domain. In our case, the GTPase activity of the C-terminal D mutant is already extremely low, but if it is sufficient for cell growth, adding the N-terminal domain could reduce it to a non viable level.</p><p>The T341 residue is located in the GTPase fold of Sup35p, between the switch I and G2 switch II regions. The A and D mutations most likely affect the Sup45p and ribosome-dependent GTPase function of the resulting proteins, since both of them display reduced GTPase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. The A mutation exhibits a strong reduction of GTPase activity, and to date, the GTPase activity of Sup35p was always shown to be essential for cell viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In the C-terminal D mutant, the GTPase activity is 100 times lower than in the wild-type but it is still compatible with growth. Cell viability of both the full-length and the C-terminal A mutant could be explained by the residual GTPase activity (about 15 times less compared to the wild-type Sup35p), since the concentration of Sup35p in yeast is 6 times higher than the concentration of Sup45p (1.31 10<sup>4 </sup>protein molecules per cell for Sup45p and 7.89 10<sup>4 </sup>for Sup35p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]). These results lead to two interesting conclusions: 1) even with a 100 times lower GTPase activity, this C-terminal D mutant is still active in termination and supports viability; 2) there must be a negative feedback link between this mutation in the C-terminal domain and the N-M domains of Sup35p.</p><p>Salas-Marco and Bedwell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] examined how mutations in the GTPase domain of Sup35p influence translation termination, and suggested that the GTPase activity of Sup35p is required to couple recognition of translation termination signals by Sup45p to efficient polypeptide chain release. One of the mutants these authors described (H348L), which is unable to support viability and has the largest reduction in GTPase activity, could correspond to our D mutant, but none of the other mutants was comparable to the A mutant, with a growth similar to the wild-type and a low GTPase activity, nor to the C-terminal D mutant with its extremely low GTPase activity. Recent findings shed light on the role of Sup35p in translation termination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]: based on <italic>in vitro </italic>evidences a model is proposed where the GTPase activity is needed for the correct positioning of the Sup45p GGQ in the PTC. This might lead to the release of Sup35p-GDP from the ribosome or modify the interaction between Sup35p-GDP and Sup45p. Sup45p would then trigger hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA. Our <italic>in vitro </italic>results are consistent with this possibility since the stimulating RF activities of the A and D mutant Sup35pcter towards Sup45p were clearly diminished.</p><p>Differences in protein activities between the mutants studied here most likely depend on the structure of Sup35p. Only a small effect is observed on the interaction of the mutated proteins with its Sup45p partner, but it is not an "all or nothing" response, and is probably due to a change in protein conformation. According to the crystal structure available for eRF3 of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], the S319 residue, corresponding to <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>T341, is not directly involved in GTP binding but localizes at the surface of the protein. Due to their high flexibility, large portions of the switch I and II regions of the GTPase domain were not defined by electron density and hence are absent from the crystal structure (AA 280&#x02013;307 and 325&#x02013;331 are missing). It is therefore difficult to precisely predict the impact of the mutations studied on the protein structure. This region was speculated to become ordered when the Sup45p/Sup35p-GTP complex associates with the ribosome, thereby stimulating the GTPase activity of Sup35p in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. In G proteins, it is well documented that these switch regions adopt different conformations depending on the nucleotide bound (GDP or GTP) and on the coordinate Mg<sup>2+</sup>, which is an essential cofactor for GTP hydrolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The D mutation might influence both regions, resulting in a dramatic conformational change and loss of GTP hydrolysis activity.</p><p>It has also been suggested that Sup35p might be implicated in other pathways different than translation processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Recent data focused on the relation between Sup35p and the cytoskeleton since it interacts through its N-terminal domain with various proteins of the actin cortical cytoskeleton. The T341D mutation might thus lead to an altered protein unable to perform these other functions. Since the interaction between Sup35p and the cytoskeleton is not known to involve its GTPase activity, it might be this pathway that is involved in the essentiality of Sup35p. This would explain why the D mutant, almost completely devoid of GTPase activity and highly deficient in termination, is nevertheless viable.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, we characterized T341 as a new critical residue for peptide release factor Sup35p activity. We demonstrate that this residue is involved in the activity of Sup35p in translation termination and functionally interacts with the N-terminal part of the molecule. That an extremely low GTPase activity of Sup35p is compatible with normal growth raises interesting questions about the absolute requirement of this release factor for cell viability. Indeed the indispensability of the protein was so far related to its GTPase activity, and our work demonstrates either that extremely low GTPase activity is sufficient for cell growth, or that the protein is implicated in one or several other essential pathways not requiring the GTPase activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Strains, growth conditions and methods</title><p>The <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>strains used here were FS1 (MAT &#x003b1; ade2-592 (frameshift) <italic>lys2&#x00394;201 leu2-3, 112 his3&#x00394;-200 ura3-52</italic>) which is derived from Y349 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and pJ69-4A for the two-hybrid analysis (MAT <italic>a </italic>and <italic>&#x003b1; trp1-901 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 his3&#x00394;-200 gal4&#x00394; gal80&#x00394; GAL2-ADE2 LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 met2::GAL7-lacZ</italic>) (described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]).

To test for the specificity of the reaction for PKA, 30 &#x003bc;g of PKA inhibitor (PKI) (Sigma) were added to the reaction buffer to specifically inhibit the activity of PKA. For mass spectrometry analyses, Sup35p (100 &#x003bc;g) was phosphorylated by 75 U of PKA with 750 &#x003bc;M unlabelled ATP in 1.2 ml. Phosphorylated proteins were then TCA precipitated and loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which were then autoradiographed.

They were destained by several incubations in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.5 containing 50% acetonitrile, dehydrated again in acetonitrile and vacuum dried. After reduction (10 mM DTT for 35 min at 56&#x000b0;C) and alkylation (55 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature), each cube was reswollen in 20 &#x003bc;l 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.5 containing 10% acetonitrile and 500 ng of trypsin (unmodified, sequencing grade, Roche Diagnostics), and left on ice for 45 min before proteolysis (overnight at 37 &#x000b0;C). Supernatants were removed and peptides extracted sequentially with 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and followed 1% TFA in 60% acetonitrile. The resulting supernatants were combined and dried.</p></sec><sec><title>Peptide purification</title><p>Tryptic peptides resuspended in 0.1% TFA were loaded onto a 250 &#x000d7; 2,1 mm Vydac C18 reversed phase column (300 &#x000c5; pore size) and eluted with a 90 min linear gradient of 0&#x02013;70% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. The flow rate was 0.3 ml/min. Fractions were collected manually based on the absorbance profile at 215 nm.</p></sec><sec><title>MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis</title><p>An aliquot of unfractionated tryptic digest was resuspended in 10 &#x003bc;l 50% acetonitrile and 0.3% TFA, and 1 &#x003bc;l was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with a saturated solution of a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 0.3% TFA/50% acetonitrile. An aliquot of each HPLC fraction was concentrated 20-fold under vacuum before 1 &#x003bc;l of the concentrate was mixed with 1 &#x003bc;l of the matrix saturated solution. The different mixes were deposited on a standard stainless probe and allowed to air dry. MALDI analysis was performed on a Voyager-DE STR equipped with a 337 nm laser source (Applied Biosystems, USA). Spectra were recorded in positive-ion reflectron mode, with a 20 kV acceleration voltage in the ion source. External calibration was performed with a mixture of 6 reference peptides covering the m/z 900&#x02013;3700 Da range, allowing a mass accuracy of 10 to 30 ppm.</p></sec><sec><title>Phosphopeptide and phosphorylation site identification</title><p>To ensure a reliable identification of phosphorylated peptide(s), dephosphorylation experiments were performed for unfractionated tryptic digests and HPLC fractions on the MALDI target using alkaline phosphatase (1 unit/&#x003bc;l; Roche) prior to analysis as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. To characterize the phosphorylation site in peptide [339&#x02013;349], a Post-source-decay MALDI-TOF (PSD) experiment was performed. As tryptic peptides are difficult to fragment in PSD-MALDI-TOF due to their proton sequestring C terminus, the Chemically Assisted Fragmentation (CAF) technology was used. Based on the introduction of a negatively charged sulphonic acid group to the N terminus of peptides after lysine residue protection by their conversion to homoarginine, this technology significantly improves the sensitivity of PSD-MALDI by increasing the fragmentation efficiency. Furthermore, the clarity of the spectrum is improved as only the y-ion series is observed. Indeed, only the y-ions (C-terminal fragments) retain a net positive charge allowing them to be detected, while the b-ions (N-terminal fragments) are neutral and cannot be detected. Simplified mass data were obtained using the Ettan CAF MALDI sequencing kit as described by the manufacturer (GE Healthcare Amersham Biosciences).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Western blots</title><p>Protein samples were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Western blots were probed with either affinity purified polyclonal rabbit antibodies against the peptide 137&#x02013;151 of Sup35p (a kind gift from Dr. S. Lindquist), or a rabbit monoclonal antibody against phospho-PKA substrates (detecting R-R-X-S*/T* motifs, Cell Signaling). The bound antibodies were detected using the Amersham ECL system.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo </italic>labelling and immunoprecipitation</title><p>Yeast cells were grown in a low-phosphate YPD medium (LP-YPD Broth, BIO 101 Systems) to the appropriate OD<sub>600 </sub>(1.5 for the exponential phase, and 6 for the stationary phase). Cells in 1 ml growth medium, harvested from 4 ml for the exponential and 1 ml for the stationary phases were labeled by adding 250 &#x003bc;Ci of [<sup>32</sup>P] orthophosphate (Amersham) for 1 h at 30&#x000b0;C. The cells were lysed by incubation for 10 min on ice with 100 &#x003bc;l of 1.85 M NaOH plus 1% &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were then precipitated by adding 100 &#x003bc;l of 50% TCA. The precipitate was centrifuged at 15,000 g for 5 min, washed with 1 M Tris base, resuspended in 50 &#x003bc;l of SDS-PAGE loading buffer without &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and dissociated by heating for 10 min at 95&#x000b0;C. TNET buffer (0.6 ml; TNET = 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, plus 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) and protease inhibitors) was added, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 12,000 g. The supernatant was incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with 50 &#x003bc;l rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (clone 3F10, Roche Diagnostics), plus 100 &#x003bc;l of 50% protein G-Agarose beads (Roche Diagnostics). Supernatants were 10-fold concentrated using Vivaspin 500 ultrafiltration spin columns (10,000 MWCO PES, Sartorius AG), and aliquots were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with TNET buffer, twice with 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, and once with 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5. The proteins were eluted by incubation for 5 min at 95&#x000b0;C in 100 &#x003bc;l of 2-fold concentrated SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and autoradiographed.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of readthrough efficiency</title><p>Yeast strains were transformed with pAC99 reporter family plasmids. In each case, at least five independent transformants, cultivated in the same conditions, were assayed. Cells were broken using acid-washed glass beads, as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Luciferase and &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities were assayed in the same crude extract. Readthrough efficiency is estimated by the ratio of luciferase activity to &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity. To establish the relative activities of &#x003b2;-galactosidase and luciferase when expressed in equimolar amounts, the ratio of luciferase activity to &#x003b2;-galactosidase from an in-frame control plasmid was taken as a reference. Readthrough frequency, expressed as percentage, was calculated by dividing the luciferase/&#x003b2;-galactosidase ratio obtained from each test construct by the same ratio obtained with the in-frame control construct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This allowed us to determine the percent readthrough while controlling differences in mRNA abundance or efficiency of translation initiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Two-hybrid analysis</title><p>The GAL4-based two-hybrid system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] was used. pGAD plasmids (empty pGAD, pGAD-SUP35, pGAD-SUP35A, pGAD-SUP35D and pGAD-SUP45) were transformed into the MAT&#x003b1; pJ69-4A strain, and pGBDU plasmids (empty pGBDU, pGBDU-SUP35, pGBDU-SUP35A, pGBDU-SUP35D and pGBDU-SUP45) into the MATa pJ69-4A strain. These transformants were mated in different pairwise combinations overnight at 30&#x000b0;C on YPD plates, and diploids selected on uracil and leucine omission medium. The two-hybrid interactions were assessed by the ability to transactivate <italic>HIS3 </italic>or <italic>ADE2 </italic>reporter genes (to confer growth either in the absence of adenine, or in the absence of histidine and in presence of different concentrations of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (Sigma)). Interactions were visualized on histidine, uracil and leucine omission medium containing either 5 mM, 10 mM, or 25 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, and also on the more selective adenine, uracil and leucine omission medium. Similar interactions were detected on each medium when Sup35 was fused to the Gal4 activating domain (pGAD vectors) and Sup45 to the binding domain (pGBDU vectors). Lighter interactions were seen in the opposite combinations (Sup35 into pGBDU vectors and Sup45 into pGAD vectors) on the histidine omission medium, and no interaction at all on the adenine omission medium. As negative control, diploids bearing the empty vector and fusion constructs were used, and the <italic>HIS3 </italic>or <italic>ADE2 </italic>reporter genes were not activated. Quantitative &#x003b2;-galactosidase assays were undertaken on lysates prepared from each diploid strain in order to estimate the interaction strength, but no coherent results were obtained because of the leakiness of the promoter controlling the expression of the <italic>lacZ </italic>gene (same level of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity in the diploid carrying at least one empty vector).</p></sec><sec><title>Assay for GTPase activity</title><p>The incubation mixture (12.5 &#x003bc;l) contained 2 &#x003bc;M [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P] GTP (sp. activity 4000&#x02013;5000 cpm/pmole), 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 15 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 &#x003bc;M 80S rabbit ribosomes, 0.32 &#x003bc;M Sup45p and 0.4 &#x003bc;M Sup35pCter. The reaction was performed at 25&#x000b0;C for 30 min, stopped by adding 750 &#x003bc;l of 5% charcoal in 50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>on ice. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C. The [<sup>32</sup>P]P<sub>i </sub>released into 500 &#x003bc;l of supernatant was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. [<sup>32</sup>P]P<sub>i </sub>release in the absence of one out of the three protein components of the incubation mixture was measured and the average value (8&#x02013;10%) was subtracted for all samples.</p></sec><sec><title>The RF stimulating activity of Sup35pcter towards Sup45p in an <italic>in vitro </italic>termination assay</title><p>The RF stimulating activity of Sup35pcter towards Sup45p was measured as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Stop-codon-dependent hydrolysis of f[<sup>35</sup>S]Met-tRNA<sup>fMet </sup>associated with the AUG-80S rabbit ribosome complex took place at 5 &#x003bc;M stop codon (UAAA) that corresponded to ~10% of the saturation level needed for complete fMet release with Sup45p but without Sup35pcter. The RF activity was calculated as the amount of f[<sup>35</sup>S]Met released in the presence of stop codon; the value of f[<sup>35</sup>S]Met released in the absence of stop codon was subtracted from all values.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CF, BC and IH performed the molecular characterization of the mutants and the phosphorylation experiments.
