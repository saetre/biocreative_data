If this is the case, identification and characterization of transcripts from the Ig loci should permit a better understanding of the gene rearrangement process. We have isolated a 2.3 kb cDNA clone from the human pre-B cell line Nalm-1 that contains enhancer-specific sequences from the Ig heavy (H) chain gene locus. The 2.3 kb transcript initiated within the enhancer region and showed extreme 5' heterogeneity, with more than 50 initiation sites mapping near the Ig-specific octamer ATTTGCGT. Sequencing of the cDNA clone demonstrated that 644 nucleotides from the Ig enhancer region were incorporated as a leader exon spliced to the mu constant (Cmu) region. This leader exon contained many translation termination codons and may function to inhibit the translation of sterile Cmu polypeptides. Using an enhancer-derived probe, we detected two low-abundancy mRNA transcripts with sizes of 2.3 and 12 kb. Northern blot analysis suggested that the 12 kb transcript was the unspliced precursor mRNA of a VDJ rearrangement. The potential role of these enhancer-containing transcripts in the opening of the IgH chain gene for rearrangement and for class switching is discussed.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00089-0180-a" xlink:role="2430"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00089-0180-b" xlink:role="2430"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00089-0177.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2427"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00089-0178.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2428"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00089-0179.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2429"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00089-0180.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2430"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00089-0181.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2431"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00089-0182.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2432"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00089-0183.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2433"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
