However, the lack of direct functional consequences of the mutant mtDNA load on the mitochondria-dependent cell metabolism has raised many questions on the physiological importance of the age-related mtDNA variations. In the present work, we have analyzed the bioenergetic properties associated with the age-related T414G mutation of the mtDNA control region in transmitochondrial cybrids. The results show that the T414G mutation does not cause <italic>per se</italic> any detectable bioenergetic change. Moreover, three mtDNA mutations clustered in the 16S ribosomal RNA gene cosegregated together with the T414G in the same cybrid cell line. Two of them, namely T1843C and A1940G, are novel and associate with a negative bioenergetic phenotype. The results are discussed in the more general context of the complex heterogeneity and the dramatic instability of the mitochondrial genome during cell culture of transmitochondrial cybrids.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Human mitochondria are known as the power plants of eukaryotic cells. To fulfil their main task, they utilize reduction equivalents in form of NADH and molecular oxygen to generate an electrochemical potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane that is in turn utilized to generate ATP. Deficiencies in oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhoS) activity ultimately lead to a decrease in oxidative energy supply. Moreover, OxPhoS defects are accompanied by an increase of reactive oxygen species. The reactive oxygen species come into play when electrons in the initial steps of the malfunctioning electron transport chain are transferred directly to molecular oxygen. The formed superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup><underline>&#x02212;</underline></sup>) is converted by the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) that can further generate a number of other reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, thereby damaging membranes, proteins, RNA and DNA.</p><p>Ever increasing evidence has been accumulated in the recent years on the role played by the mitochondria during the aging process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In particular, attention has been paid to the characterization and identification of age-associated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Rearrangements of mtDNA molecules have been usually found at very low levels, thus questioning their functional significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). However, recent reports have demonstrated that high levels of mtDNA deletions can be detected in substantia nigra neurons in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, the work of Michikawa <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) showed that specific single base replacements of mtDNA can accumulate during aging in human fibroblasts and opened a complete new aspect in this field. This work was further substantiated by animal models that focused on the premature aging in mice expressing defective mtDNA polymerase gamma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Also in this case, the contribution of mtDNA point mutations to the aging process has been recently challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Therefore, the physiological importance of mtDNA variations is still under intense debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>The aim of the present work was to study the functional impact of the age-related T414G mutation that is located in the mtDNA control region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In order to minimize the influence of nuclear/mitochondrial genome background, we have first analyzed the biochemical phenotype of homoplasmic transmitochondrial cybrids carrying either the 414T (wild-type) or 414G (mutant) mtDNA genotype deriving from the same heteroplasmic mitochondrial donor(s) and nuclear acceptor cell lines. Our results show that the T414G mutation does not cause <italic>per se</italic> any detectable bioenergetic change. Unexpectedly, when we checked the complete mtDNA sequence of the only homoplasmic T414G cybrid (AL4.3) showing a negative bioenergetic phenotype, we found three additional mutations in the 16S rRNA gene. Two of these mutations were responsible for a defective mitochondrial protein synthesis efficiency.</p><p>The results are finally discussed in the larger context of the suitability of the transmitochondrial cybrid system for the characterization of the phenotypic impact of specific mtDNA alterations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell lines and media</title><p>The AL4.3, AL4.5, 1AC1.2 human cell lines, carrying in homoplasmic form the T414G transversion in the mtDNA and the AL4.8, AL4.27 and 1AC1.48 cell lines, carrying in homoplasmic form the wild-type version (T) of the same position (414) of the mtDNA, were previously isolated by transfer into human mtDNA-less 143B.TK<sup>&#x02212;</sup> &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>206 cells of mitochondria from fibroblasts of the individuals 100-3y (for the AL series of transformants) and 98y (for the 1AC series of transformants) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).

PCR fragments were subcloned into a suitable plasmid using TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA); several independent clones were analyzed, randomly isolated from each single PCR fragment. Cloned mtDNA molecules were used as template in a second round of PCR using commercial primers T3 and T7. PCR products were purified using ExoSAP-IT treatment (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) and dispensed in 96-well plates for sequencing with an automated sequencer 3100 (Applied Biosystem) and analyzed with SeqScape Sequence Analysis software. The mutational burden for a given sample was calculated as the number of mutations (defined as discrepancies with the Cambridge reference sequence) found in multiple clones divided by the total number of sequenced bases.</p></sec><sec><title>Graphical representation of human mitochondrial LSU RNA</title><p>The secondary structure model of human mitochondrial 16S rRNA was derived from entry V00710 of the ribosomal database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 23S rRNA as a template and visualized with RnaViz2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).

It turned out that all cell lines were capable of growing on galactose, besides clone AL4.3 (mut). This was confirmed by the analysis of the endogenous respiratory fluxes measured in intact cells. In fact, it is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> that the basal and the maximal dinitrophenol uncoupled respiration rates of the AL4.3 cells were significantly lower as compared with all the other cell lines. No significant differences were observed among all other cell lines. Surprisingly, even the homoplasmic mutant AL4.5 cells, although coming from the same mitochondrial donor, displayed full bioenergetic competence. Furthermore, we also examined an additional homoplasmic mutant T414G cybrid cell line (AC1.2) that was derived from a different mitochondrial donor (age of 98 years) and also showed full bioenergetic competence. This led us to the conclusion that the T414G mutation is not <italic>per se</italic> responsible for the diminished respiration rate. <table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Mitochondrial bioenergetic competence of 143B.

Nevertheless, the specific decline of the mitochondrial complexes I, II + III and IV that do contain mitochondrial encoded subunits and the absence of any defect in the nuclear encoded complex II, pinpoints to the possibility of the existence of other yet unknown mtDNA variants in the AL4.3 cell line.</p><p>This led us to sequence the entire mitochondrial genome of the AL4.8 and AL4.3 cybrid cell lines.

Three mutations were located in the D-loop, one in the 12S ribosomal RNA gene and 17 in protein coding regions (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn592/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> I for a detailed list of the mitochondrial genotype).</p><p>Surprisingly, the AL4.3 cells displayed three additional heteroplasmic mutations all clustered within the 16S rRNA gene, namely T1843C, A1940G and A2623G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). These mutations were neither detectable in the AL4.8 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), the AL4.5 and the AL4.27 cell line, nor in the original DNA extract of the donor fibroblasts (data not shown). Interestingly, the A2623G mutation cosegregated in homoplasmic form together with the T414G mutation in the above mentioned cybrid (AC1.2) deriving from a different mitochondrial donor. Also, in this case, the bioenergetic competence of the AC1.2 cell line excluded a direct impact of the A2623G mutation on the mitochondrial functionality. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Sequence analyses of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA genes.

The heteroplasmic mutation levels obtained as the mean value of the quantification of the cleaved fragments were of 54, 64 and 54% for the T1843C, A1940G and A2623G, respectively.

This technique additionally allowed us to position the three mutations on the mitochondrial DNA at a molecular level. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, the T1843C and A1940G showed a striking cosegregation as opposed to the A2623G mutation thus accounting for at least three distinct mitochondrial genome types just in relation to the three above mentioned 16S rRNA mutations. On 36 analyzed, genetically independent clones, 61% carried both the T1843C and A1940G mutations, while 33% carried only the A2623G mutation. One clone carried only wild-type DNA in respect to 1843, 1940 and 2623, while another one carried only the A1940G mutation. A similar analysis was carried out on AL4.8 DNA and confirmed exclusively wild-type sequence at positions 1843, 1940 and 2623 (data not shown).

nuclear-encoded subunits of respiratory complex I and complex IV. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, the protein level of nuclear-encoded subunit IV and 39 kDa subunit of complex IV and complex I, respectively, was similar in AL4.8 and AL4.3 total cell lysates. On the other hand, the level of the mitochondrial-encoded catalytic subunit I of respiratory complex IV of AL4.3 cells was significantly reduced by 43% as compared with AL4.8 cells, with this change being in good agreement with the above described reduction in complex IV activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, the mitochondrial-encoded 20 kDa subunit of respiratory complex I was barely detectable in AL4.3 cells. These results confirmed the direct and specific impact of the 16S rRNA mutations on mitochondrial protein synthesis machinery. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Expression level of nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded subunits of respiratory complex I and complex IV.

The discovery of the age-associated accumulation of the T414G mutation in human fibroblast mtDNA in 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) shifted the attention from simple DNA rearrangements to the more complex single and multiple base replacements. Consequently, the tissue specificity of certain point mutations was genetically linked to the general aging process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) as well as to age-associated neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Some of these mutations have been shown to affect mtDNA transcription and/or replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), but their impact on the bioenergetic functionality of mitochondria has not yet been investigated. Furthermore, the simultaneous occurrence of different mutations makes it difficult to assign specific effects to single mutations, while giving more importance to their synergy hence to the mitochondrial haplotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Even the earliest developmental processes seem to attribute certain aspects of aging, since the T414G transversion accumulates in an age-dependent manner in human oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>Cybrid cell lines have long been used in the analysis of mutant mtDNA on a neutral nuclear background so that biochemical and enzymatic analysis could be carried out. The rationale behind the use of the transmitochondrial cell lines was mainly based on the assumption that in these cells the possibility of differently expressed nuclear isoforms as well as the impact of different nuclear haplotypes on the overall cellular phenotype should have been avoided. Therefore, we have utilized transmitochondrial cybrids generated by the fusion of cytoplasts from aged individuals with mtDNA-depleted 143B.TK<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (&#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells), thus carrying either the 414T (wild-type) or 414G (mutant) mtDNA genotype. The first outcome of this analysis excludes a direct impact of the T414G mutation onto the mitochondrial bioenergetic efficiency and capacity. In fact, two cybrid cell lines homoplasmic for the T414G mutation showed a full bioenergetic competence. However, the existence of a third homoplasmic T414G cybrid cell line presenting with a deficient bioenergetic phenotype strongly suggested the possibility of additional mtDNA variants. Indeed, we found three additional ribosomal RNA mutations, two of which, i.e. T1843C and A1940G were recorded for the first time at MitoMap database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The third mutation (A2623G) was previously reported as to be a polymorphic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) although it was not functionally characterized. Our results clearly rule out the A2623G mutation produces any detectable bioenergetic defect since the coexistence of this mutation at a homoplasmic level together with the T414G mutation has been found in a fully respiratory competent transmitochondrial cybrid cell line. This conclusion is strengthened by the finding that the heteroplasmic level of this mutation in galactose selected cells is increased.</p><p>Our results lead us to propose that the T1843C and the A1940G mutations are the cause of the observed bioenergetic deficiency. The underlying molecular mechanism is most likely linked to the malfunctioning translational system of mitochondria, since the 16S rRNA is an integral member of the mitochondrial protein synthesis machinery.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, the mutations relevant for the bioenergetic deficiency are not located in close proximity to the catalytic center of the rRNA, which is mainly formed by the central loop of domain VI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Instead, they are located in the 5&#x02032; part of the RNA. The role of the A1940G mutation (A270G in the RNA) is readily explained, because the change leads to formation of a G&#x02022;U wobble pair instead of a regular A&#x02013;U base pair, and thus will destabilize helix D8 in domain II. Although this helix is not directly linked to the catalytic region, a tertiary interaction between A323 in Loop D10 to C767 in the E16&#x02013;E4 junction (green line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) will bring this whole structure in close proximity to the peptidyl transferase center and may thus influence the overall stability of this domain. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Predicted secondary structure of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA. The nucleotides in the peptidyl transferase region (the multi-branched loop connecting helices G1&#x02013;G2&#x02013;G16&#x02013;G17), which are relevant for catalytic activity or chloramphenicol binding in bacterial 23S rRNAs are highlighted in red. The mutations in mitochondrial 16S rRNA are also highlighted in red and their position within the rRNA is additionally indicated by red numbers. Base numbering is according to the Ribosomal Database: position 173 corresponds to T1843C; position 270 to A1940G, and position 953 to A2623G, respectively. The long-range interaction between C767 and A323 is depicted by a thin green line. For clarity, base and helix numbering is not contiguous.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn592f4"/></fig></p><p>The defect caused by the T1843C mutation (U173C in the RNA) is not as straightforward to explain, because domain I in mitochondrial 16S rRNA is much less structured than the corresponding part of bacterial 23S rRNA. Whereas the latter is forming a highly ordered stem-loop arrangement and is linked to the 3&#x02032;- end of the RNA by a regular helical stem, only some small isolated stem-loop structures are present in the mitochondrial RNA, and no extended pairing to the 3&#x02032;-end is possible. Even a manual search for alternative secondary structures in the region did not reveal any possible structural stabilization within this region close to the 5&#x02032;-end of 16S rRNA.</p><p>However, an effect on mitochondrial 16S rRNA modification, stability and/or folding as well as an effect on ribosome assembly due to the interaction of nucleic acid and protein subunits needs to be investigated. The functional effect of the mutations on mitochondrial translation is clearly demonstrated by the specific decline of mitochondrial-encoded subunits of respiratory complex I and IV observed by western blot analysis on total cell lysates of AL4.3 cells, when compared to AL4.8 control cells.</p><p>As stressed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), the coexistence of different mutations in the same gene makes it difficult to assign a specific function to each position unless clones carrying only one of these mutations can be selected, as in the case of the A2623G mutation in our study.</p><p>The discovery of three clustered mutations in the 16S rRNA gene cosegregating together with the T414G mutation offered us the possibility both to investigate the phenotypic effect of novel mtDNA variants as well as to suggest a different mechanism by which the age-associated T414G mutation could lead to the accumulation of additional mtDNA mutations (generator for mtDNA alterations).</p><p>The striking observation that the T1843C and the A1940G mutation appeared at a heteroplasmic state may account for their recent occurrence in relation to the homoplasmic presence of the T414G mutation. Even more, the cloning and sequencing data clearly show that T1843C and the A1940G appear on the same DNA molecules as opposed to the A2623G mutation. If mutations in the ribosomal gene region alter the looping mechanism shown to occur during rRNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), the efficiency of the mtDNA replication cycle could be affected as well. This could possibly explain the recently reported linkage between a common photoaging-associated mtDNA deletion and the T414G mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>Overall, this highlights the complex heterogeneity and the dramatic instability of the mitochondrial genome during tissue culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). This is worsened by the high variability of the osteosarcoma karyotype of the 143B.TK<sup>&#x02212;</sup> acceptor cell line (P.S., unpublished data). The present observation also underlines the need of a continuous monitoring of mtDNA fidelity when utilizing transmitochondial cybrids, especially if patient's diagnostics has to rely exclusively on results obtained by this valuable and so far irreplaceable technique.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn592/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>National Research Project (PRIN 2003 n&#x000b0; 2003064310_002 and PRIN 2006 n&#x000b0; 2006069034_004 to G.V.) of the Italian Ministry for the University (MIUR); the S&#x000e4;chsische Ministerium f&#x000fc;r Wissenschaft und Kunst SMWK.
