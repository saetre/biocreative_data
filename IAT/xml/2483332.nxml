As a test for pore blockade, we examined whether the effect of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> on Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 is affected by permeant ions. We find two components to block by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, a rapid block with little voltage dependence, and a slow block most visible as accelerated tail currents. Rapid block is weaker for outward vs. inward currents (apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> &#x0003d; 3 vs. 1 mM Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, with 2 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>) and is reduced at high permeant ion concentration (110 vs. 2 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>). Slow block depends both on the concentration and on the identity of the permeant ion (Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> vs. Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> vs. Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>). Slow block is 2&#x02013;3&#x000d7; faster in Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> than in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (2 or 110 mM), and is &#x0223c;10&#x000d7; faster with 2 vs. 110 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. Slow block is orders of magnitude slower than the diffusion limit, except in the nominal absence of divalent cations (&#x0223c;3 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>). We conclude that both fast and slow block of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> are most consistent with occlusion of the pore. The exit rate of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> for slow block is reduced at high Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations, suggesting that the site responsible for fast block can &#x0201c;lock in&#x0201d; slow block by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, at a site located deeper within the pore. In contrast to the complex pore block observed for Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, inhibition of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> was essentially independent of voltage, and was similar in 2 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> vs. Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, consistent with inhibition by a different mechanism, at a site outside the pore.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviation used in this paper: IIV, instantaneous current-voltage relationship.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Many ions block channels by binding within the pore, preventing flux of permeant ions. In particular, several di- and trivalent cations bind with high affinity to the ion selectivity filter of voltage-dependent cation channels. Indeed, that is how calcium itself blocks permeation of monovalent cations, introducing calcium selectivity into a channel that has a high intrinsic conductance for monovalent cations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almers et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hess and Tsien, 1984</xref>). High affinity blockers, which can block not only flux of monovalent cations but also current carried by calcium ions, have been especially useful as probes for the functional architecture of the calcium channel pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yang et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Obejero-Paz et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Although the fundamental mechanism of ion selectivity is conserved among the Ca<sub>V</sub> family of voltage-dependent calcium channels, it has long been recognized that there are significant quantitative differences in selectivity for permeation and block. Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> has received particular attention. Originally thought to be a selective blocker of T-type calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Narahashi et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Hagiwara et al., 1988</xref>), it is now clear that only one of the three cloned mammalian T-channels, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2, is strongly inhibited by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lee et al., 1999</xref>), while one high voltage-activated channel, Ca<sub>V</sub>2.3, is quite sensitive to Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Soong et al., 1993</xref>). However, it has been suggested that Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> acts in part by binding to a site on the extracellular side of the channel, affecting current through the channel allosterically, not only by binding within the permeation pathway itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Zamponi et al., 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Lacinova et al. (2000)</xref> reported that Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> accelerated deactivation of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, interpreted as a modification of activation gating, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Diaz et al. (2005)</xref> concluded instead that this effect resulted from time-dependent block by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>.</p><p>Recently, mutational analysis has found that high affinity inhibition by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 requires a histidine near the extracellular side of the S4 transmembrane segment of domain I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kang et al., 2005</xref>). Replacement of histidine with glutamine (the corresponding residue in Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1) increased the IC<sub>50</sub> from 5 to 300 &#x003bc;M in Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2. The reverse mutation (Q172H in Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1) had a partial effect, changing the IC<sub>50</sub> from 300 to 60 &#x003bc;M. This suggests that high affinity inhibition by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> results from binding to an extracellular site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kang et al., 2005</xref>). That result also reopens the question of the mechanism of the relatively low affinity inhibition of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. One clue is that the effect of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> on Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 is essentially voltage independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Diaz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kang et al., 2005</xref>), while pore block by di- and trivalent cations is typically voltage dependent for Ca<sub>V</sub> channels, including Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lee et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Serrano et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Obejero-Paz et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>We examine here not only the voltage dependence of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> inhibition of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, but also the dependence on the chemical nature and the concentration of the permeant ion. The potency of pore block is strongly influenced by competitive interactions among ions in the pore; for example, block is much stronger when monovalent ions are the charge carrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yang et al., 1993</xref>). We have also found that block by Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is considerably stronger in 2 mM Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> than in 2 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> for Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, even though currents carried by Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> are quite comparable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Serrano et al., 2000</xref>). The nature of the ionic effects may vary among blocking ions, however, as the rate of block by Y<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> is sensitive to Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> vs. Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> for closed but not open channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Obejero-Paz et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>We report here that Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> has two inhibitory effects on Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channels, a rapid inhibition that is ion dependent but weakly voltage dependent, and a slower block (reflected in tail current acceleration) that is both ion and voltage dependent. Both effects are most consistent with interactions of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> with the ion conduction pathway, as opposed to an extracellular allosteric site (see Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200809988/DC1">http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200809988/DC1</ext-link>). Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> blocks Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 by mechanisms fundamentally different from the voltage-independent high-affinity block of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>General methods for whole-cell patch clamp recording from HEK 293 cells stably transfected with Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 (&#x003b1;1G) were specified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Khan et al.

Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> was added in the concentrations indicated (as NiCl<sub>2</sub>) without other change in the extracellular solution.</p><p>Effects of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> were examined by two basic protocols: the I-V protocol, where currents were recorded directly upon depolarization from a holding potential of &#x02212;100 mV to the voltages indicated, and the IIV protocol, where the voltage was varied following a 2-ms step to &#x0002b;200 mV to maximally activate channels with minimal inactivation. These two protocols, taken together, help separate effects of voltage and ions on gating vs. permeation. Both protocols were delivered sequentially before, during, and after recovery from Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> exposure, to assess current rundown. Two versions of the I-V protocol were run, brief (5 ms) voltage steps from &#x02212;90 to &#x0002b;200 mV, and longer (40 ms) steps from &#x02212;90 to 0 mV (&#x0002b;30 mV in 110 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>), since channel activation is not complete in 5 ms at some negative voltages.

The kinetics of block (from tail currents at negative voltages) and relief of block (from activation at positive voltages) are consistent with a contribution of slow pore block. Slow block can also explain the observation that block is much stronger with the I-V protocol than with the IIV. However, the instantaneous block observed with the IIV and the incomplete relief of block by depolarization to &#x0002b;200 mV in 3 mM Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> suggest a faster, lower-affinity process with different ion and voltage dependence (Fig. S1 A).

We will first describe how this hypothesis can explain the major features of our results, as well as a substantial number of subtle features. We next consider alternative interpretations, and relate our findings to previous views of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> action on calcium channels.</p><sec><title>Two sites for Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> Block in the Permeation Pathway of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1</title><p>Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> inhibited currents measured &#x0201c;instantaneously&#x0201d; following strong depolarization. This suggests a site accessible to Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> at near the diffusion-limited rate. However, this component of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> block was low affinity, with <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> &#x0003d; 1&#x02013;3 mM (in 2 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>). Fast block had a weak voltage dependence, suggestive of a primary dependence on the direction of current flow (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C and F</xref>). Fast block was similar with Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> as the charge carrier, but was reduced in 110 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>). The effect of high Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, and the voltage or current dependence, suggests that this site is in the ion permeation pathway (as opposed to a completely extracellular site that affects ion flow allosterically). This is supported by the observation that relief of slow block is inhibited by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> at the high concentrations that produce significant fast block (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>), suggesting a weak &#x0201c;lock-in&#x0201d; effect. That effect should be weak, since the &#x0201c;steady-state&#x0201d; outward current is inhibited by &#x0003c;50% at &#x0003e;&#x0002b;150 mV in 3 mM Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>), implying &#x0003c;50% occupancy of the fast block site.</p><p>The most plausible location for the fast block site is therefore near the outer end of the permeation pathway, perhaps in an outer vestibule, which Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> might be able to access readily (perhaps even without dehydrating). If that site is outside the electrical field of the membrane, Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> occupancy would not be directly voltage-dependent, but it seems plausible that an outward current could relieve Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> block at this superficial site.</p><p>Slow block by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> shares several properties of block by other di- and trivalent cations, but there are interesting differences as well. Block is relieved by strong depolarization, as observed for Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lux et al., 1990</xref>), Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Serrano et al., 2000</xref>), and Y<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Obejero-Paz et al., 2004</xref>). The rate of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry is voltage dependent, and is much slower with Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> than with Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, as observed for block of closed channels by Y<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup>. However, the apparent electrical distance (&#x003b4;) is 0.4, vs. 0.1 for Y<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Obejero-Paz et al., 2004</xref>), in 2 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. Note that this &#x003b4; value, estimated from the entry rate, is the apparent electrical distance to the energy barrier that limits Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry, not the distance to the actual binding site. Curiously, &#x003b4; varied with ionic conditions (see below). The bimolecular rates for Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry are much lower than for Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> near &#x02212;60 mV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Khan et al., 2008</xref>) or Y<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> (10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at &#x02212;80 mV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Obejero-Paz et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the most plausible site for slow block by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is the selectivity filter for Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> appears to have considerable difficulty in entering this site, even though it is thought to be physically near the extracellular side of the pore. This may involve both slow dehydration and competitive ion&#x02013;ion interactions. These two factors may be related, since compared with many other di- and trivalent cations, Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry might require more complete replacement of waters of hydration with the side chains of the glutamate and aspartate residues of a Ca<sub>V</sub>3 selectivity filter, which could increase the ability of ions within the pore to prevent Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry. Perhaps some ions (e.g., Y<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup>) can aggressively push any competing Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions through the pore, while Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> must wait patiently in the low-affinity fast-block site until Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions permeate. In that view, most ions pass quickly by the site where Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> occupancy produces a fast block. That could explain the lack of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> selectivity for effects on fast block by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>.</p><p>Why is the &#x003b4; for Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry so large, and so ion dependent? Those two features together suggest that the large &#x003b4; is a consequence of strong interactions with other ions within the pore, rather than an accurate measure of an electrical location within the pore. The ion dependence predicts that the &#x003b4; for Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry should approach the &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; value in the absence of competition, which would explain the observation that &#x003b4; is lower in Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (0.16, vs. &#x0223c;0.4 in 2&#x02013;110 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>).</p><p>It is noteworthy that the extent of block, measured from I-V relations, was less ion dependent than the rate of block. Furthermore, the apparent voltage dependence of block depended in the opposite direction on ion concentration, with &#x003b4; &#x0003d; 0.45 in Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, &#x003b4; &#x0003d; 0.19 in 2 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, and &#x003b4; &#x0003d; 0.15 in 110 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. This can be explained in part by the low-affinity Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding site, which is relatively insensitive to ionic conditions and to voltage. That site would make the largest contribution to the net block by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> when &#x0201c;high-affinity&#x0201d; slow block is the weakest (in high Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>). In addition, the measured &#x003b4; could be in error if Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> affects gating, or if slow Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> block has not reached steady state at the time of peak current.</p><p>This two-site model for pore block by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> provides an attractive qualitative explanation for the behavior of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> block under a variety of ionic conditions, and a wide range of voltages. However, we are well aware that this will need to be confirmed by molecularly based modeling of ion permeation in calcium channels, at a sufficient level of detail to account for the complex organometallic chemistry of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions.</p><p>The Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry rate was sensitive to the identity of the permeant divalent cation (Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> vs. Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>), even at 110 mM concentrations where flux through the pore is saturated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Khan et al., 2008</xref>). It is often assumed that saturation of flux implies saturation of binding site(s) within the pore, but that is not necessarily true.</p></sec><sec><title>Alternative Interpretations of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> Action</title><p>As for any pharmacological agent, there are several possible mechanisms by which an ion such as Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> can affect the behavior of a voltage-dependent ion channel, including pore block, shifts in gating by screening or binding to surface charge, and allosteric modulation by binding to extra-pore sites.</p><p>There is good reason to expect that Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> will shift channel activation to more positive potentials, at least in part by a surface charge mechanism. Effects of three other divalent cations (Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>) on gating were well described by screening a surface charge of 1 e<sup>&#x02212;</sup> per 98 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, which predicts (e.g.) that addition of 1 mM divalent cation to 2 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> would shift channel activation by &#x0223c;3 mV. It is possible that Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> affects surface charge more strongly than Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>; for example, Fe<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> shift gating as expected for both screening and low-affinity binding to surface charge (Lopin, K.V., I.P. Gray, C.A. Obejero-Paz, and S.W. Jones. 2007. Biophysical Society meeting. Abstract 2867; Jamieson, Q., C.A. Obejero-Paz, and S.W. Jones. 2008. Biophysical Society meeting. Abstract 3129).</p><p>The effect of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> on tail kinetics is in the direction expected for a surface charge effect: that is, faster tail currents (measured at a particular voltage) could in principle result from a positive shift along the voltage axis. However, where the effect of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> on tail current time constants was the strongest (2 mM Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>; nominally Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> free, <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 D</xref>), the effect was not a pure parallel shift along the voltage axis. Furthermore, the effect of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> to speed tail currents more profoundly in Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> vs. Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> would not be expected from a surface charge mechanism. Finally, this interpretation would imply that it is merely coincidental that the effect on tail kinetics is well approximated by bimolecular kinetics with a voltage-dependent rate for Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> block (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 F</xref>, and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 E</xref>). Thus, we conclude that Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> speeds tail currents primarily by voltage- and time-dependent channel block, not by effects on channel gating.</p><p>Several figures in this paper present the fractional inhibition by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> of the peak current measured from I-V relationships (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C and F</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 I</xref>, and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 I</xref>). Inhibition can result from voltage-dependent block by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> within the ion permeation pathway, but a positive shift in channel activation would also lead to a voltage-dependent reduction in current amplitudes. This complicates interpretation of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Woodhull (1973)</xref> fits to the data from the I-V protocol. Specifically, if Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> shifts activation to more positive voltages (even by a few mV), inhibition at more negative voltages would reflect a combination of pore block and a reduction in the probability that a channel is open. It is important to recognize that a positive shift in the I-V curve (or derived measures such as the G-V) could result either from a true shift in channel activation, or from voltage-dependent block. For a fast blocker (e.g., Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>) pore block can be measured as a reduction in the IIV, and shifts in gating from the I-V/IIV ratio (P<sub>O,r</sub>), but separation of the two effects is difficult for a slow blocker such as Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. If block is very slow, the block observed at the time of peak current with the I-V protocol may not fully reflect steady-state block, as noted previously for other channel blockers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Th&#x000e9;venod and Jones, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Block et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babich et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In principle, surface charges could also affect ion permeation, if the charges are close enough to the permeation pathway to affect the local concentration of permeating and blocking cations. However, this effect appears to be minimal for voltage-dependent calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kuo and Hess, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Block et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>One possible explanation of the low-affinity inhibition by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> of the IIV relationship is that Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 retains a low-affinity extracellular site for Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> block, homologous to the high-affinity site in Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2. Perhaps Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> traps a voltage sensor in the &#x0201c;down&#x0201d; position, analogous to voltage sensor toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Li-Smerin and Swartz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">McDonough, 2007</xref>). That could slow activation, and/or keep some channels from opening at all. We cannot fully exclude this, but that mechanism would not easily explain the reduced fast block in 110 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. Furthermore, concentrations of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> that occupy that low-affinity site &#x0201c;lock in&#x0201d; Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> block at the deep pore site, suggesting a more direct interaction (which we propose to be at the extracellular side of the permeation pathway). Note also that high-affinity inhibition of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 is not reversed even by depolarization to &#x0002b;200 mV (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>), consistent with simple voltage-independent inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Diaz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kang et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>This study illustrates how the basic I-V and IIV protocols, combined with an analysis of ion dependence, can go a long way toward determining the mechanisms of action of an ion such as Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> on a calcium channel. A discrepancy between the extent of inhibition measured from the I-V and IIV protocols can be explained either by time-dependent block, or by modified channel activation. Acceleration of tail currents may result either from time-dependent open-channel block or from a shift in activation, but differential effects on tail kinetics in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> vs. Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> strongly suggest a pore block mechanism. That is especially true for Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, where changes in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration shift the voltage dependence of gating in the same manner, implying similar &#x0201c;surface charge&#x0201d; effects of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> on channel activation. Analysis of tail current acceleration in terms of pore block can test that hypothesis by comparison to expectations for a bimolecular reaction, with voltage-dependent rates. Conversely, analysis based solely on effects on I-V relationships may not be sufficient for mechanistic analysis. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Lacinova et al. (2000)</xref> concluded that Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> modified activation kinetics for Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, by slowing channel deactivation (more strongly in 20 mM Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> vs. Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>). Their experimental results are consistent with ours, but we conclude instead that Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> accelerates tail currents primarily by time- and voltage-dependent block, vs. a true modulation of the kinetics of channel closing.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison to Previous Studies of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> Block of Calcium Channels</title><p>We propose that Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> block of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 involves a low affinity site with rapid kinetics, and a high affinity site within the &#x0201c;deep&#x0201d; pore. This agrees quite well with single-channel data on Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> block of L-type calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Winegar et al., 1991</xref>), where Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> not only reduced the apparent single channel conductance, but also produced discrete blocking events. The rate for discrete block of L channels by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> was also quite slow, 6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 0 mV in 110 mM Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Winegar et al., 1991</xref>), compared with 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 (from <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 F</xref>). In addition, the rates of block and relief of block both increased with hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Winegar et al., 1991</xref>), consistent with our observation that the rate of block by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> was more voltage dependent than the steady-state block (which depends on the off/on rate ratio). We do not have direct measurements of the exit rate, but note that an exit rate that increases with hyperpolarization suggests that Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> can exit the pore to the intracellular site (i.e., Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is a weakly permeant ion).</p><p>Many previous studies, on T channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lee et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kang et al., 2005</xref>) and other calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Zamponi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">McFarlane and Gilly, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Magistretti et al., 2001</xref>), concluded that Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> modified channel gating, most likely by an extra-pore site. Our results do not provide compelling evidence for such an effect for Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1. This is consistent with the interpretation that the high-affinity site near the extracellular side of S4 in Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 is essentially absent in Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kang et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Ed Perez-Reyes for the gift of cells stably transfected with Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, and for a plasmid encoding Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2.</p><p>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grant NS24771 to S.W.
