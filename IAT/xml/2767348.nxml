Th2 cells are known to be critical for the induction of allergic asthma manifestations by the production of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. Regulatory T (Treg) cells can counteract Th2 cell activity, and have the ability to suppress AHR and allergic inflammation upon allergen provocation in mouse models of allergic asthma. For instance, adoptive transfer of Treg cells into allergen-sensitized mice down-regulates asthma manifestations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], while depletion of these cells exacerbates experimental asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Interestingly, AHR was shown to be more sensitive than allergic airway inflammation to the number of regulatory T cells present in the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These data identify Treg cells as a potentially relevant target for therapeutic intervention in allergic asthma, in particular in case of persistent AHR, and Treg cell-based therapies are currently being considered for the treatment of this complex disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor family related protein (GITR) is a type I transmembrane protein and a member of the TNFR superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. GITR is constitutively expressed to high levels on the cell surface of natural T regulatory (nTreg) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In contrast, resting na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells express very low levels of GITR, and its expression is strongly up-regulated following activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. GITR stimulation was initially reported to abolish the suppressive properties of nTreg cells both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] However, this was later shown to be a T responder cell-intrinsic effect through the acquisition of resistance to Treg cell-mediated suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In fact, GITR stimulation delivers a strong co-stimulatory signal to effector T cells, and increases proliferation and production of IL-2 of freshly purified mouse CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>- </sup>cells stimulated <italic>ex vivo </italic>via CD3 and on mice splenocytes stimulated by CD3/CD28 or cognate peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. On the Treg cells, GITR stimulation also delivers a strong co-stimulatory signal, allowing IL-2 dependent proliferation of Tregs in the absence of TCR stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, when GITR agonistic antibodies are added to mixed populations of CD4<sup>+ </sup>T responder cells and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+ </sup>Treg cells, the acquisition of resistance to suppression by the responder cells is the dominant effect, thereby functionally preventing the Treg suppressive effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>While the effects of GITR stimulation on the total CD4<sup>+ </sup>fraction are well characterized, studies aimed at dissecting the effects of GITR on polarized Th1 and Th2 effector cells yielded conflicting results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. On mouse primary CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>- </sup>cells, addition of a GITR agonist antibody during <italic>in vitro </italic>differentiation into the Th1 or Th2 phenotype resulted in enhanced cytokine release from both Th1 and Th2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, in fully polarized Th1 and Th2 cell clones, GITR triggering only enhanced Th1 cell proliferation at low cognate peptide concentrations, whereas for Th2 cells, GITR triggering retains its co-stimulatory effect on cell proliferation, irrespective of the dosage of the cognate peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The effects on Th cell effector function or cytokine production was not analyzed in this study. To further investigate this issue, we evaluated the effects of GITR stimulation on primary and fully differentiated Th1 and Th2 cell populations, and show increased cytokine release from Th2 but not Th1 cells. Furthermore, to test the relevance of this observation <italic>in vivo </italic>we used an OVA-induced Th2-driven mouse model of asthma, characterized by AHR, induction of specific IgE and airway eosinophilia. We show for the first time that AHR is dramatically increased by GITR triggering at the time of allergen challenge, resulting in a left-shift of the response curve. In line with our <italic>in vitro </italic>data, this effect was associated with enhanced Th2 effector functions, such as increased secretion of IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13, and increased OVA-specific IgE levels in serum. Therefore, we conclude that GITR signaling during an ongoing immune response potentiates Th2 effector functions <italic>in vivo</italic>, resulting in an enhanced AHR and specific IgE levels in our mouse model of allergic asthma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Animal care and use were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Groningen (IACUC-RuG).

In agreement with these <italic>in vitro </italic>observations, GITR triggering at the time of allergen challenge in a mouse model of allergic asthma increased AHR and levels of OVA-specific IgE in serum.</p><p>The effects of GITR stimulation on T cell responses are dual. It is generally accepted that GITR engagement on na&#x000ef;ve or effector T cells provides resistance to Treg cell-mediated suppression, as well as delivering a co-stimulatory signal leading to enhanced proliferation and cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. When associated with CD3 stimulation, na&#x000ef;ve mouse CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>- </sup>cells show higher proliferation upon GITR signaling by DTA-1 or GITR ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. At the same time, GITR signaling also delivers a strong co-stimulatory signal for Treg cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The direct effects of GITR signaling on Th1 and Th2 effector functions have not been characterized in great detail. One study showed an up-regulation of cytokine production from both Th1 and Th2 cell populations differentiated <italic>in vitro </italic>in the presence of GITR agonistic antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In contrast, when fully polarized Th1 and Th2 cell-lines are stimulated through TCR by cognate peptide presentation, the co-stimulatory effect of GITR signaling on Th1 cell proliferation can only be seen at low peptide concentrations, while in Th2 cells GITR signaling has a co-stimulatory effect on cell proliferation irrespective of the strength of the TCR signal, suggesting that GITR exerts a differential effect on Th1 and Th2 cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In this latter study, however, effector functions of Th cell subsets were not analyzed. Here, we show for the first time that GITR signaling has no co-stimulatory effect on cytokine production by primary, fully polarized Th1 cell populations <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>The effect of GITR signaling on T cell responses <italic>in vivo </italic>has been studied in considerable detail. For instance, it has been reported that the progression of Th1-driven acute graft versus host disease is inhibited by treatment with a GITR agonist antibody (DTA-1), and that this effect is dependent on the inhibition of Th1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In contrast, several other studies have reported aggravating effects of DTA-1 treatment on mouse disease models with a strong Th1 component, such as autoimmune gastritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] or HSV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although the enhanced <italic>in vivo </italic>Th1 activity in these studies might be explained by indirect effects of the DTA-1 antibody treatment on Treg cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], Treg depletion did not alter the DTA-1 effect in the EAE model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In contrast to Th1-driven disease models, the role of GITR triggering in Th2-driven disease models has not been studied extensively <italic>in vivo</italic>. In one study it was shown that DTA-1 administration during allergen challenges exacerbated eosinophilic airway inflammation and OVA-specific IgE responses, indicating that Th2 effector functions were augmented <italic>in vivo </italic>as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>We show that GITR treatment at the time of allergen challenges increases AHR to methacholine in our mouse asthma model, as shown by the left-shift of the AHR response curve. Clinically, AHR is the most characteristic feature of allergic asthma and is the main factor of morbidity in asthma patients. This is the first time that GITR triggering is reported to have a direct effect on this critical parameter for lung function. The effect of GITR triggering on AHR likely reflects enhanced Th2 effector function leading to an increased IL-13 production from lung cells, which has been shown to be the main effector cytokine inducing AHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. From our data, it is not possible to determine whether the increased Th2 cytokine production by lung cells was due to a higher number of Th2 cells recruited to the lungs or an enhanced cytokine production by individual Th2 cells. Nevertheless, the latter seems to be more likely when combining our <italic>in vitro </italic>cytokine measurement data with the fact that the amount of lymphocytes in the BAL did not differ between control and DTA-1-treated mice.</p><p>Surprisingly, eosinophil infiltration in the lung was not further increased by DTA-1 treatment although IL-5 production by lung cells was enhanced. This could be explained by the concomitant increase of IL-10 production by these cells, which has been shown to antagonize eosinophil recruitment but potentiate AHR in a similar mouse model of allergic asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. These observations are in line with several studies reporting dissociation between AHR and airway eosinophilia in mouse asthma models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Our results on the effect of DTA-1 treatment on airway eosinophilia are in contrast to the study of Patel <italic>et al</italic>. mentioned above where lung eosinophilia was increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Several differences between the two experimental asthma protocols used in their and our studies can explain these differences. First, we used male mice, which display higher levels of AHR in mouse asthma protocols than do females, whereas the Patel study used female mice, which display stronger parameters of allergic inflammation (IgE, airway eosinophilia) than do male mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Second, the amount of OVA used for the sensitization and the administration route for the challenges were different. Finally, Patel <italic>et al</italic>. administered DTA-1 at 2 different time points, 1 day before the first challenge and 1 h before the second challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], whereas we only gave DTA-1 once 1 h before the first challenge. In our model, we do observe a strongly increased OVA-specific IgE response in serum after DTA-1 treatment, indicating that the augmentation of Th2 effector function is consistent between the two studies.</p><p>It is possible that DTA-1 treatment had an effect on the Treg cell subset in our mouse model of asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In our experiments, we cannot exclude that the GITR-mediated increase of asthma manifestations was partly due to an effect on Treg cell. In fact, the selective effects we observe on AHR but not on airway eosinophilia are in line with a decreased number or activity of Treg cells in the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Nevertheless, our <italic>in vivo </italic>data on serum IgE and Th2 cytokine production in the lung seem to indicate a potentiation of Th2 effector functions in accordance with our <italic>in vitro </italic>observations. In our experiments we cannot distinguish whether this augmented Th2 effector activity is the result of a direct effect of GITR signaling on Th2 cells, an indirect effect of GITR signaling on Tregs, or a combination of the two.</p><p>In conclusion, we show that activation of GITR during allergen exposure can aggravate AHR in a mouse model of allergic asthma, which seems to be associated with increased Th2 cell activity in the lungs and elevated serum IgE responses. Our data bear relevance to the understanding of the mode of action of the GITR in cell-mediated immunity, a pathway which is currently considered for potential therapeutic intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Activation of GITR during allergen provocation induces an exacerbated Th2 cell response in the lungs and aggravates airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine in a mouse model of allergic asthma, as shown by a left shift of the AHR response curve to methacholine.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AHR: airways hyperresponsiveness; GITR: Glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor family related protein; OVA: Ovalbumin; Penh: enhanced pause; Treg: Regulatory T cell.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ACM performed the <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments, contributed to the <italic>in vivo </italic>experiments and drafted the initial version of the manuscript.
