Little is known about how such proteins interact functionally and biochemically with each other. Here, we focus on the Y-box transcription factor ZONAB (zonula occludens 1-associated nucleic-acid-binding protein)/DbpA (DNA-binding protein A) and the Rho GTPase activator guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)-H1/Lbc's first cousin, which are two tight-junction-associated signalling proteins that regulate proliferation. Our data show that the two proteins interact and that ZONAB activity is Rho-dependent. Overexpression of GEF-H1 induces accumulation of ZONAB in the nucleus and activates transcription. Microtubule-affinity regulating kinase/partition-defective-1, another type of GEF-H1-associated signalling protein, remains in the cytoplasm and partially co-localizes with the exchange factor. GEF-H1 and ZONAB are required for expression of endogenous cyclin D1, a crucial RhoA signalling target gene, and GEF-H1-stimulated cyclin D1 promoter activity requires ZONAB. Our data thus indicate that GEF-H1 and ZONAB form a signalling module that mediates Rho-regulated cyclin D1 promoter activation and expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>tight junctions</kwd><kwd>cyclin D1</kwd><kwd>Rho GTPases</kwd><kwd>proliferation</kwd><kwd>TNF&#x003b1;</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intercellular junctions regulate epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation using different signalling mechanisms. Tight junctions, the most apical component of the epithelial junctional complex, recruit signalling proteins such as protein kinases, Rho GTPase regulators and transcription factors that can localize to junctions as well as to nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Aijaz <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). However, there is little understanding of how the different junction-associated signalling molecules are interconnected and coordinate cellular responses.</p><p>ZONAB (zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1)-associated nucleic-acid- binding protein)/DbpA (DNA-binding protein A) is a Y-box transcription factor that is recruited to tight junctions by binding to the Src homology 3 domain of ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Balda &#x00026; Matter, 2000</xref>). ZONAB regulates epithelial proliferation by restricting G1&#x02013;S phase progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Balda <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Its transcriptional activity is important for this regulation because one of the target genes of ZONAB is cyclin D1, which is a key cell-cycle regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Sourisseau <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). As ZO-1 binding to ZONAB results in inhibition, tight junction formation suppresses this proliferation-promoting pathway. The reported deregulated expression of ZO-1 and ZONAB in different tumours might, therefore, contribute to the transformed phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Hoover <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Martin <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Yasen <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Binding of activated RalA also inhibits transcriptional activation of ZONAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Frankel <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). By contrast, the mechanisms that mediate ZONAB activation are poorly understood: Apg-2, a heat-shock protein, can stimulate ZONAB activation indirectly by binding to ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Tsapara <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>); but mechanisms that activate ZONAB directly are not known.</p><p>Another tight-junction-associated signalling component that promotes G1&#x02013;S phase progression is guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)-H1/Lfc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Benais-Pont <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Aijaz <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). GEF-H1 is an exchange factor for RhoA, and it has been proposed that its deregulation contributes to carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Birkenfeld <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). In epithelial cells, GEF-H1 activates RhoA signalling, regulating paracellular permeability, junctional dynamics and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Benais-Pont <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Aijaz <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Ivanov <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Rho GTPases are central regulators of signalling pathways that guide cell proliferation and differentiation. RhoA signalling regulates G1&#x02013;S phase transition, and one of the crucial target genes of Rho signalling during this cell-cycle step is the cyclin D1 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Coleman <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Ridley, 2004</xref>). However, if and how GEF-H1 participates in the regulation of gene expression is not known.</p><p>Cyclin D1 is upregulated during G1 phase and stimulates G1&#x02013;S phase transition by binding and activating cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6, which contributes to cyclin E&#x02013;CDK2 activation and inactivation of the cell-cycle inhibitory function of retinoblastoma protein (pRb) by hyperphosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Fu <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Cyclin D1 also has a role during other cell-cycle phases that require careful regulation of localization and degradation by phosphorylation and the ubiquitin/proteosome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Sherr, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Gladden &#x00026; Diehl, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that two tight-junction-associated signalling proteins, ZONAB and GEF-H1, form a complex and that activation of the transcriptional activity of ZONAB is regulated by Rho. Our results indicate that ZONAB and GEF-H1 form a signalling module that links a Rho activator to a downstream signalling effector and mediates Rho-regulated cyclin D1 expression.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>GEF-H1 regulates cyclin D1 expression</title><p>ZONAB and Rho GTPase signalling regulate G1&#x02013;S phase progression and cyclin D1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Balda <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Coleman <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Ridley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Sourisseau <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). As GEF-H1, a GEF for RhoA, regulates epithelial cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Aijaz <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), we first tested whether GEF-H1 is also required for cyclin D1 expression. Our experimental system used Madin&#x02013;Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, which allow tetracycline-regulated conditional depletion of ZONAB and GEF-H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Aijaz <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Sourisseau <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). To monitor the expression levels during G1&#x02013;S phase progression, cells were arrested in low serum and then stimulated by adding back serum, which results in efficient re-entry of MDCK cells into the cell cycle and effective progression into S phase in 24 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Balda <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Depletion of both ZONAB and GEF-H1 resulted in a strong reduction in cyclin D1 expression in cells that were stimulated with serum after synchronization in low serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig 1</xref>). Depletion of GEF-H1 did not affect the expression of ZONAB. Overexpression of both proteins stimulated cyclin D1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig 1C,D</xref>). Overexpression of GEF-H1, but not ZONAB, was sufficient to stimulate increased cyclin D1 levels in arrested cells (0 h), indicating that ZONAB requires serum stimulation for activity. In confluent cells, expression of cyclin D1 was low in all cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S1</xref> online). These data show that GEF-H1 regulates cyclin D1 expression in proliferating cells and, similarly to ZONAB, is required for serum-induced cyclin D1 upregulation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>GEF-H1 and ZONAB form a complex</title><p>GEF-H1 and ZONAB associate with tight junctions but are also found at other subcellular locations in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Balda &#x00026; Matter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Benais-Pont <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). By immunofluorescence, the two proteins co-localize with ZO-1 at intercellular junctions, indicating that the two proteins might exist in a complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S2</xref> online). Therefore, we tested whether GEF-H1 and ZONAB form a complex in MDCK cells by using immunoprecipitation and by monitoring co-precipitation through immunoblotting.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig 2A</xref> shows that GEF-H1 was detected in ZONAB but not in control immunoprecipitates. Similarly, ZONAB was detected in precipitates with GEF-H1-specific antibodies, although co-precipitation was less efficient. Co-precipitation of GEF-H1 was seen in confluent, but not in proliferating, subconfluent cells that had been cultured for 2 days, indicating that the complex does not exist constitutively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig 2B</xref>). Similarly, GEF-H1 is less junctional in low confluent than in confluent cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S3</xref> online). These data indicate that GEF-H1 and ZONAB can form a complex in epithelial cells and that complex formation depends on cell confluence.</p><p>Glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing different domains of GEF-H1 were then used to map the binding site for ZONAB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Aijaz <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Pull-down experiments with MDCK cell extracts revealed that the C1 domain is sufficient to mediate the interaction with ZONAB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig 2D</xref>). ZONAB is expressed in two isoforms, ZONAB-A and -B, and both could be pulled down efficiently with the C1 fusion protein from extracts of COS-7 cells transfected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-tagged ZONAB isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig 2E</xref>). As both ZONAB-A and -B co-immunoprecipitated with GEF-H1, both seem to be able to form a complex with the exchange factor.</p><p>We then used recombinant His-tagged ZONAB to determine whether the interaction could be reconstituted <italic>in vitro</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig 2F,G</xref> shows that recombinant ZONAB was precipitated by glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST)-C1 but not GST alone, indicating that the C1 domain of GEF-H1 can bind directly to ZONAB. ZONAB is thus far the only GEF-H1-interacting protein known to interact with GST-C1, as other proteins require different or further domains (for example, microtubule-affinity regulating kinase/partition-defective-1 (MARK/Par1) needs an additional intervening domain; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S4</xref> online).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>GEF-H1 stimulates ZONAB activity</title><p>Our next step was to ask whether GEF-H1 can stimulate ZONAB activity. As overexpression of GEF-H1 is sufficient to stimulate RhoA activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Birkenfeld <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>), we first tested whether overexpression stimulates nuclear translocation of ZONAB. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig 3</xref> shows that overexpression of GEF-H1 did result in nuclear accumulation of ZONAB. The remaining cytoplasmic, dotty staining often seemed to follow the cytoplasmic GEF-H1 staining. GEF-H1 was no longer detected at junctions but, as indicated in existing reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Birkenfeld <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>), was cytosolic and partially associated with microtubules. MARK/Par1, another GEF-H1 interaction partner in MDCK cells that was originally identified in a proteomics screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Brajenovic <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), also dissociated from cell&#x02013;cell contacts on GEF-H1 overexpression, but remained cytoplasmic and partially co-localized with GEF-H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S4</xref> online). Induction of GEF-H1 expression induced nuclear translocation of ZONAB without affecting the expression levels of ZONAB and ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S5</xref> online).</p><p>We next analysed whether Rho signalling and GEF-H1 regulate the transcriptional activity of ZONAB. We used a reporter gene assay based on two minimal promoters&#x02014;one driving firefly luciferase expression and the other driving renilla luciferase expression&#x02014;that differ only by the presence of a ZONAB binding site in one of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Frankel <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). ZONAB functions as a repressor of the promoter with a functional ZONAB binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Balda &#x00026; Matter, 2000</xref>). Expression of dominant-negative RhoA (T19N-RhoA) stimulated the ZONAB-responsive promoter, reflecting ZONAB inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig 4A</xref>). Accordingly, a constitutively active form (V14-RhoA) increased ZONAB activity, and incubation with membrane-permeable C3 transferase&#x02014;which inactivates RhoA, B and C&#x02014;reduced ZONAB activity. As ZONAB is active in low-density, proliferating cells, but not in high-density cells, promoter stimulation reflecting ZONAB inactivation was observed only in low-density cultures. Therefore, the transcriptional activity of ZONAB is regulated by Rho signalling.</p><p>Overexpression of GEF-H1 also repressed the promoter, indicating ZONAB activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig 4B</xref>). Stimulation did not require the C1 domain, which binds to ZONAB, but overexpression of an active exchange factor domain was sufficient, as expected from the constitutively active RhoA mutant result. This indicates that a direct interaction is not required for regulation when active RhoA levels are very high (that is, expression of constitutively active GEF or RhoA). However, depletion of GEF-H1 inhibited ZONAB activity in low-density cells to a similar extent as did ZONAB depletion, indicating that GEF-H1 is a functionally relevant ZONAB activator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig 4C</xref>). Expression of the ZONAB-interacting C1 domain inhibited the transcription factor in low-density cells, indicating that it functions as a dominant mutant. As the C1 domain co-localized with endogenous ZONAB but did not affect nuclear accumulation, inhibition might have been due to its prevention of another interaction required for transcription (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S6</xref> online). In addition, expression of the C1 domain did not affect the distribution of GEF-H1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S7</xref> online).</p><p>ZONAB RNA interference (RNAi) was then combined with the constitutively active GEF-H1 mutant to confirm the involvement of ZONAB in the changes observed in promoter activation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig 4D</xref> shows that in high-density cells, in which ZONAB is not active, constitutively active GEF-H1 only repressed the promoter in the presence of ZONAB (with or without co-transfection of a control RNAi plasmid) but not when the transcription factor was depleted. This confirms the requirement of ZONAB for repression of the promoter by GEF-H1.</p><p>ZONAB and GEF-H1 regulate expression of cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig 1</xref>). To determine whether this involves changes in cyclin D1 promoter activity, we used a firefly luciferase reporter construct containing a full-length cyclin D1 promoter with a ZONAB binding site at position &#x02212;530 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Albanese <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Sourisseau <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig 4E</xref> shows that this promoter was stimulated by overexpression of GEF-H1. However, when the ZONAB RNAi plasmids were co-transfected, stimulation was strongly reduced. Co-transfection of the control RNAi plasmid did not influence the promoter. ZONAB is thus required for GEF-H1-stimulated cyclin D1 promoter activation.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Epithelial junctions recruit various signalling proteins, and several of them are thought to regulate proliferation and differentiation. Unravelling the biochemical and functional networks that these proteins form is therefore important in order to understand the signalling mechanisms they are involved in. The data presented here show that GEF-H1 and ZONAB form a signalling module that mediates Rho-stimulated transcription.</p><p>The transcriptional activity of ZONAB is Rho-regulated as both dominant-negative RhoA and C3 transferase inhibit its activity. How Rho activation stimulates ZONAB is not yet clear. Inhibition of Rho signalling by inhibition of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and myosin, or transfection of dominant-negative Dia, did not inhibit ZONAB activity (data not shown). We could not find evidence for direct binding of ZONAB to RhoA. Therefore, it might be that a yet-to-be-identified Rho effector stimulates ZONAB activation. Alternatively, it is possible that inactive GEF-H1 and ZONAB form a complex in the absence of a stimulus that localizes at tight junctions and is thus primarily observed in confluent cultures. GEF-H1-mediated Rho activation then leads to a dissociation of the complex and, hence, activation of ZONAB. Given the absence of GEF-H1 from junctions in overexpressing cells, Rho activation might also lead to an inactivation of the mechanisms that recruit GEF-H1 complexes to the junction.</p><p>GEF-H1 has already been linked to Rho/ROCK/myosin-regulated junctional dynamics and dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Aijaz <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Samarin <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). It thus seems that GEF-H1 functions as a junction-associated Rho signalling hub that activates Rho and, subsequently, different Rho effector pathways that then drive junctional rearrangements as well as transcriptional responses. Recently, GEF-H1 has also been found to be activated in response to inflammatory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Fukazawa <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kakiashvili <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>), which is also observed in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S8</xref> online). However, at least one such stimulator, TNF&#x003b1;, does not stimulate the transcriptional activity of ZONAB (data not shown), suggesting that additional signalling mechanisms act on ZONAB to modulate its activation. One possibility is that RalA binding inhibits TNF&#x003b1;-induced ZONAB activation: RalA binds to and inhibits ZONAB and is activated in response to TNF&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Sugihara <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Frankel <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Rho signalling regulates transcription of genes by different mechanisms. Perhaps the best studied one is the regulation of serum response factor, a transcription factor that is activated by a co-activator in which nuclear accumulation is regulated by Rho GTPases through actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Miralles <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Another type of Rho regulation is represented by NF-&#x003ba;B, a transcription factor that is modulated by Rho GTPases and Rho kinases either directly or indirectly by phosphorylation of upstream regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Perkins, 2007</xref>). To our knowledge, ZONAB is the first case of a Rho-regulated transcription factor that associates with a Rho GEF. Thus, GEF-H1 and ZONAB form a new type of signalling module that spatially links a Rho activator to an effector pathway to transmit signals to the nucleus.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p><bold>Cell lines, expression constructs, RNAi and antibodies.</bold> MDCK cells for tetracycline-regulated GEF-H1 expression, and RNAi of GEF-H1 and ZONAB were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Aijaz <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Sourisseau <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).
