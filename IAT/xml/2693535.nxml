The function of Nkx6-2 in directing the fate of those progenitors has, however, not been thoroughly analyzed. We used a combination of genetic inducible fate mapping and in vivo loss-of-function to analyze the requirement of Nkx6-2 in determining the fate of cortical interneurons. We have found that interneuron subtypes are born with a characteristic temporal pattern. Furthermore, we extend the characterization of interneurons from the Nkx6-2 lineage through the application of electrophysiological methods. Analysis of these populations in <italic>Nkx6-2</italic> null mice suggests that there is a small and partially penetrant loss of delayed non-fast spiking somatostatin/calretinin double positive cortical interneurons in the absence of <italic>Nkx6-2</italic> gene function.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>genetic fate mapping</kwd><kwd>interganglionic sulcus</kwd><kwd>loss of function</kwd><kwd>mouse genetics</kwd><kwd>whole-cell physiology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Based on their immunohistochemical, morphological, electrophysiological, and connectivity properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gonchar and Burkhalter 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kawaguchi and Kubota 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Somogyi et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Markram et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flames et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wonders et al. 2008</xref>), cortical interneurons comprise a heterogeneous and diverse array of &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) neuronal populations. These populations arise from 2 primordial ventral telencephalic structures, the medial and caudal ganglionic eminences (MGE and CGE, respectively). We and others have used transplantation, in vivo fate mapping, and loss-of-function analysis to study cells derived from these ventral eminences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wichterle et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nery et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butt et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flames et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miyoshi et al. 2007</xref>). Although all cortical interneurons likely arise solely from the ventral regions, distinct populations of cortical interneuron subtypes are derived from the MGE and CGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butt et al. 2005</xref>). Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that the MGE gives rise to the parvalbumin (PV)- and somatostatin (SST)-expressing populations of interneurons, whereas the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and the majority of calretinin (CR)-expressing lineages are predominantly generated in the CGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nery et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butt et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cobos et al. 2006</xref>). This strongly suggests the existence of a spatial mechanism for the specification of interneuron subsets that distinguishes between these embryonic structures. In agreement with such a mechanism, a number of studies have observed the spatially restricted expression of particular transcription factors within the MGE and CGE. These factors may impart distinct properties to progenitors located in these different domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butt et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flames et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fogarty et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kanatani et al. 2008</xref>). Recently, we have been able to provide a more refined understanding of the function of <italic>Nkx2-1</italic>, which appears to be a central regulator of MGE-derived interneurons, by showing its temporal requirement in this specification process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Butt et al. 2008</xref>). Both this analysis and a previous study from our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miyoshi et al. 2007</xref>) demonstrate that cortical interneuron heterogeneity in addition to a reliance on spatial cues also depends on temporally regulated mechanisms.</p><p>The notion that changing progenitor competence underlies neuronal diversity has been observed in both invertebrate and vertebrate systems. Work in the Drosophila nerve cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cleary and Doe 2006</xref>), the vertebrate retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cepko et al. 1996</xref>), as well as the mammalian cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Desai and McConnell 2000</xref>), has provided evidence that neuronal progenitors can attain specific identities through progressive restrictions of their differentiation potential during development. In addition, it has long been established that neurons born sequentially at different developmental time points occupy distinct final positions in an inside-out manner in the layered structure of the mature mammalian cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rakic 1974</xref>). Previous work has also found a similar correlation between the birthdate of cortical interneurons and their laminar position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miller 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fairen et al. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Valcanis and Tan 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yozu et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butt et al. 2005</xref>). Through in vivo genetic fate mapping studies, the time of origin has also been shown to play a role in determining the immunocytochemical and physiological properties of cortical interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miyoshi et al. 2007</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, those temporally dependent interneuron properties also correlate with their laminar position within the mature cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miyoshi et al. 2007</xref>).</p><p>To further understand the spatial and temporal mechanisms of cortical interneuron determination, we have analyzed the homeodomain transcription factor Nkx6-2. Nkx genes and their homologs in other species are known to regulate neuronal cell fate. Both the <italic>ventral nervous system defective (vnd)</italic> gene in Drosophila and the Nkx proteins in the mouse spinal cord act to direct progenitors to adopt specific ventral neural identities, while repressing the fates of neighboring regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McDonald et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weiss et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Briscoe et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sander et al. 2000</xref>). Specifically, in the spinal cord, Nkx6-2 was shown to be required for specification of V1 interneurons and its absence causes progenitors to adopt a more dorsal V0 identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vallstedt et al. 2001</xref>).</p><p>In the ventral telencephalon, Nkx6-2 is expressed in a small subset of ventral neural progenitors in a restricted spatial pattern at the border between the MGE and CGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stenman et al. 2003</xref>). Despite its relatively small region of expression, the <italic>Nkx6-2</italic> region has been shown to give rise to both PV and SST cortical interneurons and in particular be enriched in a subpopulation of SST cortical interneurons that coexpress CR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fogarty et al. 2007</xref>). Our laboratory has recently demonstrated that the generation of these populations is at least partially dependent on the homologous protein Nkx2-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Butt et al. 2008</xref>).</p><p>The analysis of the function of Nkx6-2 provides, therefore, an excellent opportunity to further understand the contribution of spatial and temporal determination mechanisms in the telencephalon. In this study, we have used a combination of genetic inducible fate mapping (GIFM) (Zinyk et al. 1998) and in vivo loss-of-function to analyze the temporal requirement of Nkx6-2 for cortical interneuron specification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Generation of Nkx6-2<sup>CreER</sup> Mutant Mice</title><p>Mouse <italic>Nkx6-2</italic> genomic DNA was obtained from a 129/Ola mouse genomic library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vallstedt et al. 2001</xref>) and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of genomic DNA from the <italic>Nkx6-2</italic> locus.

Given that interneuron subtypes that arise from this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fogarty et al. 2007</xref>) are similar to the subtypes arising from the Nkx2-1-expressing portion of the MGE, the roles of Nkx6-2 and Nkx2-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Butt et al. 2008</xref>) may be similar and potentially redundant. Indeed, Nkx6-2 is coexpressed with Nkx2-1 in many of the progenitors from which cortical interneurons arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fogarty et al. 2007</xref>), and these 2 proteins are homologous in structure.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Temporally and spatially regulated expression of Nkx6-2 in the ventral telencephalon.

Second, as we used a single <italic>Nkx6-2<sup>CreER</sup></italic> allele in all experiments, it permitted us to compare the fates of the same precursor population in control and mutant mice by avoiding any quantitative differences in the kinetics of Cre recombination. Third, the addition of a hybrid CAG promoter to the Rosa locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Soriano 1999</xref>) in the <italic>RCE:loxP</italic> reporter resulted in strong EGFP labeling of the mature offspring of temporally distinct cohorts of <italic>Nkx6-2</italic>-derived precursors.

To identify the initial precursors that give rise to our fate-mapped population, we analyzed EGFP expression 24 and 72 h after tamoxifen administration and found that cells in the telencephalon arise exclusively from the spatially restricted interganglionic domain in both control and mutant mice. Notably, 72 h after tamoxifen administration was performed at E10.5, most EGFP-expressing neurons were located in the mantle of the subpallium with a number of cells appearing to be migrating toward the cortex (data not shown). The presence of limited but persistent labeling within the progenitor zone of both control and mutant embryos 3 days after tamoxifen induction indicates that in addition to nonproliferating precursors, <italic>Nkx6-2</italic> appears to be expressed in some radial glial stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2<italic>D</italic></xref>).</p><p>Previous analyses observed a correlation between birthdate and the final laminar position of cortical interneurons, with early-born interneurons occupying deeper layers and late-born interneurons occupying more superficial layers in the mature cortex.

We therefore examined the laminar distribution of interneurons labeled at different embryonic time points in the somatosensory cortex of P21 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>).

These observations are consistent with our previous genetic fate mapping of the ventral MGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miyoshi et al. 2007</xref>). Moreover, it suggests that in both control and <italic>Nkx6-2</italic> null mice, GIFM results in labeling of distinct populations at the 2 time points examined.

This was accomplished by utilizing immunohistochemistry with markers of interneuron subtypes in both control (<italic>Nkx6-2<sup>CreER/+</sup></italic>) and <italic>Nkx6-2</italic> null (<italic>Nkx2-1<sup>CreER/LacZ</sup></italic>) animals. Consistent with their dorsal MGE origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flames et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fogarty et al. 2007</xref>), EGFP-expressing cells in <italic>Nkx6-2<sup>CreER/+</sup></italic> mice colabeled with a diversity of immunomarkers usually associated with interneurons born in the MGE (PV and SST). In addition, we also observed that a subpopulation of the labeled neurons expressed either CR or vasoactive intestinal peptide at both time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic>,<italic>E</italic></xref>), suggesting that some of the labeled cells had characteristics similar to CGE-derived cortical interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butt et al. 2005</xref>). Regardless of their expression of these markers, the production of all populations that we could classify as specific subtypes were biased toward the later time point (E12.5). The most numerous group of interneurons generated at E10.5 and E12.5 colabeled with SST. However, distinct SST-expressing subpopulations were born at each time point. At E10.5, the SST population was primarily SST positive (SST+) but CR negative (CR&#x02212;; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>). This is consistent with our previous finding demonstrating that burst-spiking Martinotti neurons, which are SST+ and CR&#x02212;, are predominantly an early-born population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miyoshi et al. 2007</xref>). By contrast, at E12.5, SST+/CR+ double-labeled interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fogarty et al. 2007</xref>) predominated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3<italic>E</italic></xref>). Interestingly, this later group of interneurons in some <italic>Nkx6-2</italic> null mice appears to be partially affected by the loss of <italic>Nkx6-2</italic>. In a subset of mutant mice, the number of EGFP fate-mapped cells that colabeled with SST and CR was decreased when compared with a wild-type littermate. However, the reduction in SST+/CR+ cells was not fully penetrant as it was only observed in a subset of the <italic>Nkx6-2<sup>CreER/LacZ</sup></italic> mutants analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3<italic>F</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the Intrinsic Physiological Properties of Cortical Interneurons from the Nkx6-2 Lineage</title><p>A percentage of EGFP-labeled populations in the E10.5 fate mapping did not express any of the immunohistochemical markers analyzed. In addition, these markers are usually also expressed in an overlapping fashion and in multiple interneuron subtypes (as identified by morphological or electrophysiological analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miyoshi et al. 2007</xref>]). This reinforces the notion that immunohistochemical analysis alone provides a relatively incomplete description of the diversity encountered in the cerebral cortex. In order to characterize the specific subtypes produced from the Nkx6-2 lineage, we performed whole-cell current clamp recordings on 13 EGFP-positive cells from 5 different mice whose mothers had been administered tamoxifen at E12.5, an age where the entire interneuron diversity is better represented based on the immunohistochemical data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). The cells were randomly chosen, and the first healthy EGFP-positive neuron that was encountered after locating the somatosensory cortex was recorded. In all, 93% of cells recorded exhibited electrophysiological and morphological characteristics of one of the discrete interneuron subtypes that our laboratory has previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butt et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miyoshi et al. 2007</xref>). In accordance with the immunohistochemical data, we identified cells from classes that we have previously found to be both CGE-and MGE-derived (6 and 7, respectively). Consistent with the MGE-derived populations being SST-expressing, 6 of the cells showed the typical physiological profile of the non-fast spiking (NFS) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miyoshi et al. 2007</xref>). These correspond to populations that have been previously described as regular spiking nonpyramidal cells (RSNPs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kawaguchi 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butt et al. 2005</xref>) but can be further subdivided based on the presence of a delayed spike at threshold or the spike half- width (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miyoshi et al. 2007</xref>). Following the same classification protocol, we found 4 NFS cells with a delay to the threshold spike (dNFS) and 2 larger NFS cells with a short spike half width (0.9 ms), which identifies them as NFS1. Of the 4 dNFS cells recorded, we recovered 2 morphologies that were consistent with the dNFS2 subtype. These cells were located in superficial layer II and were multipolar with lateral dendrites extending along the I/II border and an axon projecting up into layer I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). The morphologies of the other 2 dNFS cells could not be recovered, but their superficial location suggests that these might also be of the dNFS2 subtype. The seventh cell exhibited rebound bursting from &#x02212;100 mV, as well as a burst at threshold when kept at &#x02212;80 mV which is typical for the initial intrinsic bursting (iIB) subtype, indicating that it likely expressed SST and calbindin (CB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miyoshi et al. 2007</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Nkx6.2+/&#x02212; EGF+ cortical interneurons recorded in the somatosensory cortex.

Interneurons that are thought to arise exclusively from both the MGE and the CGE were obtained from our fate-mapping analysis. This is consistent with the fact that the <italic>Nkx6-2</italic> expression domain spans both parts of the dorsal MGE and ventral LGE/CGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). These include PV- and SST-labeled interneurons from the MGE and VIP-expressing interneurons from the CGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butt et al. 2005</xref>). In agreement with the spatial expression, we observed that most types of interneurons born in this region appear in frequencies that are intermediate between what has been seen for the MGE and CGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miyoshi et al. 2007</xref>). Interestingly, the exception to this general trend is the subset of interneurons that labels for SST, which is the dominant class of interneuron derived from the <italic>Nkx6-2</italic> domain.

From our electrophysiological analysis, we identify the early-born SST+/CR&#x02212; interneurons as iIB Martinotti cells and the later-born SST+/CR+ as dNFS2 interneurons. The properties of the iIB subtype are consistent with cells reported to be SST+ and CB+ but CR&#x02212; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xu et al. 2006</xref>), whereas the laterally biased morphologies and the firing patterns of the dNFS2 cells are consistent with those previously reported to be SST and CR double positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xu et al. 2006</xref>).

Although we obtained good physiological and morphological confirmation that 2 of the neurons analyzed were of dNFS2 subtype, 2 others although not definitively classified also likely belonged to this category. This enrichment of dNFS cell types is consistent with the high levels of SST+/CR+ double expressing neurons observed both in the present analysis as well as in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flames et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fogarty et al. 2007</xref>).</p><p>The present study extends our previous observations that birthdate is a strong predictor of interneuron subtype.

As such, this study suggests that Nkx6-2 may be required in the regulatory cascade for cortical interneurons generated from this population at E12.5. Nevertheless, this study does not exclude an additional function for Nkx6-2 at earlier time points. <italic>Nkx6-2</italic> is expressed in the ventral telencephalon well before the appearance of dNFS cells, and a requirement for the related <italic>Nkx</italic> transcription factor Nkx2-1 has been found in the ventral telencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Butt et al. 2008</xref>).

We have shown that dNFS cells, a subpopulation of SST+ interneurons that also express CR and have multipolar morphologies, are preferentially derived from E12.5 precursors within the <italic>Nkx6-2</italic> expression domain. We demonstrate that this subgroup of later-born interneurons appears to be affected by the loss of <italic>Nkx6-2</italic> gene function, suggesting that this gene may be functional during this phase of neurogenesis for specification of this interneuron subtype.
