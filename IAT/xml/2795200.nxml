Two of these non-coding first exons are conserved between species: exon 1a located 3.5 kb upstream of the GATA4 ATG site in exon 2, and a second first exon (exon 1b) located 28 kb further upstream. Expression of both mRNA variants was found in all GATA4-expressing organs but with a preference for the exon 1a&#x02013;containing transcript. The exception was the testis where exon 1a&#x02013; and 1b&#x02013;containing transcripts were similarly expressed. In some tissues such as the intestine, alternative transcript expression appears to be regionally regulated.

The E1b-E1c amplified sequence matched one found in a human intestine EST database (GenBank AK097060), except that E1c in the EST sequence was connected to E3 and not E2 as in our clones. E1b-containing transcripts are likely to have a more complex secondary structure when compared to E1a transcripts as the calculated free energy value for the E1b sequence was almost twice as that of the E1a sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008454-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

This pivotal developmental role emphasizes the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate expression of the <italic>GATA4</italic> gene. Despite its critical role in organogenesis, our knowledge of <italic>GATA4</italic> gene transcription remains surprisingly limited. Here, we report the identification of novel <italic>GATA4</italic> transcripts that differ solely in their non-coding first exons. These alternative first exons are located several kilobases upstream of the classic <italic>GATA4</italic> transcription initiation site suggesting that their expression is being driven from novel upstream promoters. The fact that some of these first exons are species-conserved also indicates that alternative promoter usage is likely an important regulatory mechanism for controlling the tissue- and cell-specific expression of the <italic>GATA4</italic> gene in humans and other mammalian species.</p><p>As for the other GATA genes, the GATA4 ATG initiator codon and the start of its open reading frame is located in E2. Its originally described first exon, which is non-coding, is located 3.5 kb upstream of E2. Other GATA gene family members, however, are known to express multiple transcripts with different untranslated first exons (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008454-Burch1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>). Moreover, many of these alternative GATA transcripts are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. To determine whether GATA4 is or is not an exception to alternative first exon usage, we used 5&#x02032; RACE to screen GATA4 transcripts in mouse, rat, and human tissues. Our results confirmed the existence of additional first exons for the <italic>GATA4</italic> gene, located far upstream of E2 (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008454-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Conventional RT-PCR amplifications followed by sequencing of the PCR products showed that the novel GATA4 first exons are used alternatively and rarely in association with one another, the one exception being in the human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008454-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). All of the first exons are devoid of a translational start point and, thus, will not affect, the open reading frame coding for the GATA4 protein. Therefore our data show that the <italic>GATA4</italic> gene also exhibits prominent alternative first exon usage, a feature common to the other GATA genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008454-Burch1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as many other genes that display complex temporal and/or spatial expression patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008454-Ayoubi1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Amongst the newly identified first exons, although E1b was well conserved between rodents and human, E1b&#x02032; and E1c were not. E1b&#x02032;-containing transcripts were also expressed at very low levels as determined by qPCR (data not shown). In human tissues, we amplified transcripts containing E1c intercalated between E1b and E2. This is similar to a published EST (AK097060) where E1c is present but connected to E3. For these specific <italic>GATA4</italic> transcripts, the combination of poor conservation and low level of expression render the biological significance of these transcripts unlikely, as suggested for the <italic>Nr5a1/Sf1</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008454-Kimura1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, E1b was not only well conserved between rodents and human from a sequence standpoint, but was also expressed at significant levels in most, if not all, GATA4-expressing tissues examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008454-g003">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008454-g004">4A</xref>). This was particularly true for the testis where E1a and E1b mRNA levels were comparable. Surprisingly, a previous study by Ohara <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008454-Ohara1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> did not identify the E1b transcript in their 5&#x02032; RACE screen of mouse heart and testis. This might simply be due to differences in experimental procedures as the energy require to denature the secondary structure of E1b is predicted to be about twice as high as that needed for E1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008454-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). At least in the heart, it might also be a reflection of the lower abundance of the E1b transcript. Although the E1b sequence appears to be conserved for mammalian <italic>GATA4</italic> genes, this may not extend to all vertebrate species. For example, an analysis of transcription initiation sites in the zebrafish <italic>gata4</italic> gene, has revealed that its ATG initiator codon is located in its first exon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008454-HeicklenKlein1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, thus ruling out the possibility of similar mammalian-like alternative 5&#x02032; untranslated exons. The absence of alternative first exon usage has also been reported for the chick <italic>Gata6</italic> gene and the zebrafish and Xenopus <italic>Gata2</italic> genes when compared to their orthologous mouse loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008454-Burch1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, the decrease in conservation of alternative 5&#x02032; leader exons with species divergence is not unique to GATA4.</p><p>While differential first exon usage is common to the mammalian GATA genes, their functional significance is less clear. For the hematopoietic GATA1/2/3 subfamily, promoter sequences upstream of different non-coding first exons have been shown to contribute to the tissue-specific expression of the factors. For example, regulatory sequences upstream of exon 1T direct <italic>Gata1</italic> expression specifically in the testis whereas sequences upstream of exon 1E direct <italic>Gata1</italic> expression in blood cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008454-Onodera1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. For the <italic>GATA4</italic> gene, however, the use of alternative first exons appears to be less well correlated with tissue specificity. Indeed, we detected <italic>Gata4</italic> E1a- and E1b-containing transcripts in several <italic>GATA4</italic>-expressing organs both in rodents and humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008454-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This suggests that both transcript variants are expressed in all GATA4-positive cell types or that they are specific for a cell type in a given organ. In the adult mouse intestine, where E1a is predominantly expressed, the pattern of GFP transgene expression directed by promoter 1a sequences correlated well with the <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization signal specific for this exon, but did not exactly match with the endogenous protein localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008454-g004">Figure 4A&#x02013;H</xref>). Indeed, GFP staining, as well as E1a mRNA, were present in a majority of epithelial cells but only in a subset of villosities whereas GATA4 protein could be detected in all villosities. Thus in the intestine where the epithelium is composed predominantly of enterocytes, we can speculate that E1a and E1b transcripts complement one another at a local level. Our demonstration that the <italic>Gata4</italic> E1a and E1b variants are translationally active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008454-g006">Figure 6</xref>) supports this hypothesis. However, in more complex organs such as the gonads which are composed of different cell types that express GATA4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008454-Viger1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, this picture is less clear due to our inability to obtain a reliable <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization signal for the E1b-specific transcript. As a result, other approaches such as generation of transgenic mice expressing a reporter gene driven by E1b promoter sequences will undoubtedly have to be used to answer this question.</p><p>It is interesting to note that GATA4 more closely resembles GATA6 than the hematopoietic GATA factors not only at the level of coding sequence but also in terms of its transcriptional regulation. Thus while differential exon 1 usage clearly contributes to tissue specificity in the case of the hematopoietic GATA1/2/3 subfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008454-Burch1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, the mostly coordinated exon 1 usage for both GATA4 (this study) and GATA6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008454-Brewer1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> suggests other roles. For GATA4, redundant transcripts could provide a backup mechanism to guarantee the availability of GATA4 protein in cell types where its presence is crucial for cell function, such as differentiation of Sertoli cells in the fetal testis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008454-Manuylov1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008454-Tevosian1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. The promoter regulatory sequences driving expression of the different <italic>GATA4</italic> transcripts could be under the influence of distinct trans-regulatory factors and this may account for basal and/or induced <italic>GATA4</italic> expression in specific cell types. Alternatively, redundant transcripts might be required to maintain a high level of protein translation. Finally, the presence of different first exons may play regulatory roles themselves on either RNA stability, protein translation efficiency, or both, as it has recently been described for the <italic>Cyp19</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008454-Wang1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.

A control sample was made by adding EDTA (100 mM) to the PLB as well as to the sucrose gradient solution. The presence of EDTA sequesters the magnesium ions required for ribosome stability. Samples were disrupted by vortexing twice for 10 sec, intermitted by a 30 sec pause and clarified by a 20 min centrifugation at 12,000 g. Supernatants were assayed for absorbance at 260 nm using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).

Once the supernatant was discarded, the RNA from each pellet was further purified using the Picopure RNA isolation kit (Molecular Devices). An aliquot of each fraction was used to quantify and assess the integrity of RNA using the 2100 Bioanalyser RNA 6000 Nano Chip kit (Agilent Technologies).
