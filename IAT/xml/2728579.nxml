In this study, we investigated whether intracellular &#x003b1;-synuclein affects proteasome activity in SH-SY5Y cells. To monitor intracellular proteasome activity, we used a reporter consisting of a short peptide degron fused to the carboxyl-terminus of green fluorescent protein (GFP-CL1), which is known to be degraded by proteasome. The level of intact GFP-CL1 was dramatically increased by coexpression of GFP-CL1 and &#x003b1;-synuclein, as judged by confocal microscopic and immunoblot analyses. Expression of two pathogenic mutants of &#x003b1;-synuclein, A30P and A53T, and phosphomimetic S129D mutant increased the intensities of GFP more effectively than did wild-type &#x003b1;-synuclein. GFP fluorescence in cells transfected with &#x00394;73-83 mutant or &#x003b2;-synuclein, which does not assemble into filaments <italic>in vitro</italic>, was not changed as compared with that in cells expressing GFP-CL1 alone. Thus, the ability of &#x003b1;-synuclein to inhibit proteasome activity is related to its propensity to assemble into filaments. Furthermore, we observed that some compounds inhibiting &#x003b1;-synuclein filament formation <italic>in vitro</italic> prevented the &#x003b1;-synuclein-mediated proteasome dysfunction in cells transfected with both GFP-CL1 and &#x003b1;-synuclein. The cellular model expressing both GFP-CL1 and &#x003b1;-synuclein may be a useful tool to screen compounds protecting neurons from &#x003b1;-synuclein-mediated proteasome dysfunction.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>bi900619j</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>bi-2009-00619j</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value>40.75</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fs1" fn-type="funding-statement"><label>&#x02020;</label><p>This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas&#x02212;Research on Pathomechanisms of Brain Disorders (to M.H., 20023038) and Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (to M.H., 18300117) and (C) (to T.N., 19590297) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. It is characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and by intracellular inclusion bodies known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neuritis. &#x003b1;-Synuclein is a natively unfolded protein and is deposited in a hyperphosphorylated form as the major component of these filamentous inclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). Genetic studies have revealed that missense mutations (A30P, E46K, and A53T) in the &#x003b1;-synuclein gene cause familial forms of PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). It has also been reported that multiplications (duplication and triplication) of &#x003b1;-synuclein gene cause an inherited form of PD and DLB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Thus, an increased level of intracellular &#x003b1;-synuclein is thought to contribute to the onset of familial PD.</p><p>Intracellular and extracellular protein deposits may cause neuronal cell death and may signal onset of many neurodegenerative diseases. We have reported that phosphorylated &#x003b1;-synuclein is partially ubiquitinated in &#x003b1;-synucleinopathy brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). We also found that ubiquitination of &#x003b1;-synuclein occurs in cultured cells at sites identical to those of filamentous &#x003b1;-synuclein ubiquitinated <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that ubiquitination may be a late event in the formation of Lewy bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). A recent paper confirmed our findings and showed that monoubiquitination and multiubiquitination at Lys12, 21, and 23 are detectable on phosphorylated &#x003b1;-synuclein in &#x003b1;-synucleinopathy brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). These findings indicate that the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is targeted to abnormal &#x003b1;-synuclein in the brains of patients but that ubiquitinated &#x003b1;-synuclein cannot be degraded by the UPS, suggesting that the UPS may not be effective to clear the abnormal form of &#x003b1;-synuclein.</p><p>The UPS functions in cellular quality control by degrading misfolded, unassembled, or damaged proteins that might create toxic intracellular aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). As the proteasome efficiently degrades multiubiquitinated proteins, the presence of elevated levels of ubiquitin conjugates in intracellular deposits of aggregated proteins in most neurodegenerative diseases suggests a linkage between UPS dysfunction and pathogenesis. Functional relationships between &#x003b1;-synuclein and the UPS have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). Synder et al. reported that aggregated and monomeric &#x003b1;-synuclein inhibit proteasomal function <italic>in vitro</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). Lindersson et al. also observed proteasomal inhibition by &#x003b1;-synuclein filaments and oligomers <italic>in vitro</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). In cultured cells, it remains controversial whether expression of &#x003b1;-synuclein affects intracellular proteasome activity. Martin-Clemente et al. reported that &#x003b1;-synuclein expression level does not significantly affect proteasome function in PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>), while Fujita et al. reported that proteasome activity was significantly decreased in cells overexpressing wild-type &#x003b1;-synuclein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). Stefanis et al. described that expression of A53T mutant, but not wild-type &#x003b1;-synuclein, inhibits proteasome activity in PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). It was also reported that cell-produced &#x003b1;-synuclein oligomers are targeted to and impair the 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>).</p><p>Recently, Bence et al. reported impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system by the expression of an exon 1 fragment of huntingtin containing expanded polyglutamine homopolymer in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>).

This fluorescent reporter system is also useful for facile detection of proteasome activity in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>).</p><p>In this study, to investigate whether intracellular &#x003b1;-synuclein affects proteasome activity, we have established a more sensitive assay system to monitor proteasome activity in cells using the GFP reporter and demonstrated impairment of proteasome function by expression of &#x003b1;-synuclein in SH-SY5Y cells. We also found that two pathogenic mutations of &#x003b1;-synuclein (A30P and A53T) and S129D mutant, which mimics phosphorylation, inhibit proteasome activity more effectively than does wild-type &#x003b1;-synuclein, while &#x00394;73-83 mutant and &#x003b2;-synuclein, which do not form fibrils <italic>in vitro</italic>, do not affect proteasome function. Furthermore, we used our cellular model to screen for compounds protecting cells from proteasome inhibition by &#x003b1;-synuclein and found that some polyphenols attenuate &#x003b1;-synuclein-induced proteasome impairment.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Construction of Plasmids</title><p>The GFP-CL1 plasmid was constructed by digestion of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) with <italic>Bgl</italic>II and <italic>Sal</italic>I and ligation with hybridized oligonucleotides termed CL1s (5&#x02032;-GATCCGCTTGTAAAAATTGGTTTTCTTCTTTATCTCATTTTGTTATTCATTTATAAG-3&#x02032;) and CL1a (5&#x02032;-TCGACTTATAAATGAATAACAAAATGAGATAAAGAAGAAAACCAATTTTTACAAGCG-3&#x02032;).

Interestingly, in cells expressing GFP-CL1 treated with MG132, a band of uncleaved GFP-CL1 was detected in the SDS-soluble fraction in addition to the weak bands seen in the TS- and TX-soluble fractions, suggesting that uncleaved GFP-CL1 unexpectedly aggregates in cells when proteasome activity is inhibited by MG132 treatment.

To reconfirm that GFP-CL1 is effectively degraded by proteasome, cells transfected with GFP-CL1 were treated with several protease inhibitors. SDS-soluble fraction of cell lysate was subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-GFP antibody. As shown in Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, increased levels of GFP-CL1 band were observed in cells coexpressing GFP-CL1 and &#x003b1;-synuclein (lane 6), indicating that proteasome activity is inhibited effectively by expression of &#x003b1;-synuclein. Similar results were obtained when we treated cells expressing GFP-CL1 with MG132 or lactacystin (lane 3 and 4). On the other hand, leucyl-leucinal (LL, a calpain inhibitor) or chloroquine (a lysosomal inhibitor) did not inhibit GFP-CL1 degradation (lanes 2 and 5). We then tested whether the proteasome inhibition by &#x003b1;-synuclein is dose-dependent, i.e., dependent on the &#x003b1;-synuclein expression level.

We found that expression of tau protein (3R1N and 4R1N) did not affect the proteasome activity in SH-SY5Y cells, suggesting that the effect of &#x003b1;-synuclein on the proteasome activity observed in this study is not simply due to overexpression of a protein, but is specific for &#x003b1;-synuclein. We also confirmed the absence of significant cell death in our cellular model transiently expressing &#x003b1;-synuclein, suggesting that the decreased proteasome activity found in cells expressing &#x003b1;-synuclein is not caused by cellular damage due to the toxicity of expressed &#x003b1;-synuclein.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Expression of &#x003b1;-synuclein inhibits proteasome activity in SH-SY5Y cells.

Impairment of proteasome function leads to induction of apoptosis, followed by cell death, so it is important to protect cells from such inhibition by intracellular &#x003b1;-synuclein. These results raised the possibility that our cellular model, in which both GFP-CL1 and &#x003b1;-synuclein are expressed, might be useful to screen for small molecules preventing proteasome inhibition mediated by expression of &#x003b1;-synuclein. Recently, we have reported that several compounds, including polyphenols, phenothiazines, and porphyrins, inhibit aggregation of recombinant &#x003b1;-synuclein <italic>in vitro</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>). We therefore asked whether these compounds might affect proteasome inhibition by &#x003b1;-synuclein in cultured cells. Compounds of interest were added to the culture medium of cells transfected with both GFP-CL1 and &#x003b1;-synuclein 2 h after transfection. The cells were incubated for 72 h, harvested and analyzed by immunoblotting and confocal laser microscopy. Immunoblot analyses showed that the level of GFP-CL1 was decreased significantly when cells were treated with purpurogallin or myricetin (polyphenols), but not when they were treated with ferric-dehydroporphyrin IX (porphyrin) (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). Cells treated with purpurogallin or myricetin displayed significant decreases in GFP-CL1 fluorescence by confocal microscopy (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B).

We further observed that these small molecules did not affect &#x003b1;-synuclein expression (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A).

In these reports, proteasome activity was measured in a cell-free system using fluorescent peptide substrates, and little is known about the effects of &#x003b1;-synuclein expression on proteasome activity in cultured cells. To examine this question, we tried to establish a sensitive and convenient method to measure proteasome activity using cultured cells transfected with a GFP-CL1 reporter plasmid. We further applied this system to show that transient coexpression of &#x003b1;-synuclein inhibits the proteasome activity of SH-SY5Y cells.</p><p>The GFP-CL1 reporter is a useful tool for the detection of proteasome activity in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). Recently, Link et al. reported that the expression of GFP-CL1 in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> muscle or neurons causes deposition of GFP-CL1 and leads to rapid paralysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). In this study, we also found that uncleaved GFP-CL1 was largely recovered in TX-insoluble fractions of SH-SY5Y cells transfected with GFP-CL1 and &#x003b1;-synuclein, while &#x003b1;-synuclein was recovered in TS- and TX-soluble fractions (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B and Figure S1 in <xref rid="s1"/>), indicating that uncleaved GFP-CL1 was deposited, but &#x003b1;-synuclein was still soluble in transfected cells. Cell death was not detected in either cells transfected with GFP-CL1 alone or cells transfected with both GFP-CL1 and wild-type &#x003b1;-synuclein or mutants thereof, although Link et al. found that GFP-CL1 is toxic when expressed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). The discrepancy might be due to differences in the cell type used. Further studies are required in this regard. It is surprising that a relatively short addition of 16 residues to the C terminus of GFP can convert this normally soluble protein into a protein that strongly aggregates. We suggest that the C-terminal 16 residues may directly interfere with GFP folding, resulting in misfolded (but still fluorescent) forms that are prone to aggregate.</p><p>How does &#x003b1;-synuclein suppress intracellular proteasome activity? Several reports have described that &#x003b1;-synuclein may directly interfere with the proteasome. It was shown that &#x003b1;-synuclein binds to S6&#x02032; or S6a, a component of the 19S subunit in the 26S proteasome in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). It was also reported that aggregated &#x003b1;-synuclein, but not its monomer, effectively inhibited the 26S proteasome activity <italic>in vitro</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>). Interestingly, we have shown that two pathogenic &#x003b1;-synuclein mutants, A30P and A53T, which are liable to form fibrils or oligomers <italic>in vitro</italic>, inhibited proteasome activity more strongly than did wild-type &#x003b1;-synuclein, while &#x00394;73-83 mutant and &#x003b2;-synuclein, neither of which assemble into filaments <italic>in vitro</italic>, did not inhibit proteasome activity. Although we failed to detect any sarkosyl-insoluble aggregates of &#x003b1;-synuclein in cells transfected with wild-type or mutant &#x003b1;-synuclein (data not shown), these results raise the possibility that soluble prefibrillar intermediates, such as misfolded monomers, oligomers or protofibrils, may inhibit proteasome activity in transfected cells. Additional studies are needed to explore oligomers and protofibrils of &#x003b1;-synuclein in our cell model.</p><p>Phosphorylation seems to be a common mechanism controlling the neurotoxicity of aggregation-prone toxic proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>), &#x003b1;-synuclein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>), and TDP-43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>). We suggested that phosphorylation of &#x003b1;-synuclein may play a role in suppression of proteasome activity in cells. It was reported that expression of S129D mutant &#x003b1;-synuclein in <italic>Drosophila</italic> significantly enhances the toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). However, the mechanisms through which phosphomimetic S129D mutant causes cell death in the fly remain unknown. Phosphorylated &#x003b1;-synuclein at Ser129 is known to be more prone to aggregate than wild-type &#x003b1;-synuclein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>), and this may be related to its toxicity. Alternatively, inhibitory effects of the S129D mutant on intracellular proteasome activity, as shown in this study, may be involved in cell death.</p><p>Importantly, we have shown that intracellular &#x003b1;-synuclein may be toxic to neuronal cells because the protein causes proteasome dysfunction. It was previously reported that duplication and triplication of &#x003b1;-synuclein gene causes familial PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>), indicating that overproduction of &#x003b1;-synuclein protein could lead to the onset of PD. It is reasonable to speculate that proteasome activity may also be affected in neurons of these patients in a manner similar to that shown in this study. It may be important to prevent &#x003b1;-synuclein-induced inhibition or decrease of proteasome activity. In this study, we screened for compounds protecting cells from the &#x003b1;-synuclein-mediated proteasome dysfunction and found that purpurogallin, myricetin, exifone, and gossypetin (polyphenols from plants) prevented proteasome impairment by &#x003b1;-synuclein. These compounds are thought to inhibit <italic>in vitro</italic> &#x003b1;-synuclein filament formation by stabilizing soluble prefibrillar intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>). We speculate that these small molecules may interact with oligomeric forms of &#x003b1;-synuclein in cultured cells, although we can not exclude the possibility that these compounds directly regulate the activity of the proteasome. The precise mechanisms by which these polyphenols prevent &#x003b1;-synuclein-mediated proteasome dysfunction remain unknown. However, these compounds may be novel drug candidates for neurodegenerative diseases. Our cellular model system using coexpression of GFP-CL1 and &#x003b1;-synuclein should be a sensitive and useful tool for screening of compounds and drugs for the prevention and treatment of these disease.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Drs.
