Each requires Mg<sup>++</sup> and is not stimulated by ATP or S-adenosylmethionine. A<sub>3</sub> is strongly inhibited by Fe<sup>+++</sup> and weakly inhibited by ATP, S-adenosylmethionine, and DPN, whereas B is inhibited by caffeine. Each can be purified free of exonuclease or DNA-3&#x02032;-phosphatase. A<sub>1</sub> (molecular weight approximately 72,000) cleaves single-stranded, circular fd DNA to form 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl termini and introduces nicks and breaks in the closed, double-stranded replicative form DNA of fd (fd RFI). A<sub>2</sub> (molecular weight approximately 46,000) cleaves fd DNA and introduces nicks and breaks in RFI, forming 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl- and 5&#x02032;-phosphoryl termini. A<sub>3</sub> (molecular weight approximately 38,000) cleaves fd DNA to form 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl termini and introduces only nicks in fd RFI. Irradiation of the RFI with ultraviolet light markedly increases the rate of hydrolysis by A<sub>3</sub>. B appears to form 3&#x02032;-phosphoryl termini with fd DNA, but its characterization is highly preliminary due to its instability.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00510-0006.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00510-0007.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00510-0008.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00510-0009.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00510-0010.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00510-0011.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00510-0012.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00510-0013.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00510-0014.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00510-0015.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00510-0016.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="11"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00510-0017.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="12"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00510-0018.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="13"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00510-0019.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="14"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00510-0020.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="15"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00510-0021.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="16"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00510-0022.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="17"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
