In the present study, we show dynamic localization of NPM throughout the cell cycle of HeLa cells. Using a combination of RNAi (RNA interference) and three-dimensional microscopy we show that NPM is localized at the chromosome periphery during mitosis. We also demonstrate that depletion of NPM causes distortion of nucleolar structure as expected and leads to unexpected dramatic changes in nuclear morphology with multiple micronuclei formation. The defect in nuclear shape of NPM-depleted cells, which is clearly observed by live-cell imaging, is due to the distortion of cytoskeletal (&#x003b1;-tubulin and &#x003b2;-actin) structure, resulting from the defects in centrosomal microtubule nucleation. These results indicate that NPM is an essential protein not only for the formation of normal nucleolar structure, but also for the maintenance of regular nuclear shape in HeLa cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>HeLa cell</kwd><kwd>nuclear structure</kwd><kwd>nucleolar structure</kwd><kwd>nucleophosmin (NPM)</kwd><kwd>RNA interference (RNAi)</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>DIC, differential interference contrast</kwd><kwd>FBS, fetal bovine serum</kwd><kwd>GFP, green fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>NE, nuclear envelope</kwd><kwd>NPM, nucleophosmin</kwd><kwd>PNB, pre-nucleolar body</kwd><kwd>RNAi, RNA interference</kwd><kwd>NPMr, RNAi-refractory GFP-NPM</kwd><kwd>siRNA, small interfering RNA</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><ref-count count="26"/><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The most active and dynamic nuclear domain, the nucleolus, plays a prominent role in the organization of various components of the nucleus and is considered as plurifunctional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In addition to ribosome production, maturation and assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], the nucleolus plays important roles in the regulation of numerous cellular processes, including cell-cycle regulation, apoptosis, telomerase production, RNA processing monitoring and response to cellular stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. NPM (nucleophosmin), a major nucleolar protein continuously shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. NPM acts as an oncogene and is required for the development of the mouse embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Other reports have shown that NPM acts as a tumour supressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Thus the role of NPM in oncogenesis still remains controversial. Moreover, its roles in the structure of the nucleolus and nucleus are still unknown.</p><p>It is reasonable that depletion of nuclear or related proteins causes abnormal nuclear morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Interestingly, depletion of nucleolar protein fibrillarin also showed aberrant nuclear morphology and growth inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Thus the nucleolus has been reported to function in cell survival and to contribute in the general nuclear function and architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we show that NPM is dynamically localized throughout the cell cycle and interacts with other major nucleolar proteins, fibrillarin and nucleolin. Using RNAi (RNA interference), we demonstrate that NPM is localized at the chromosome periphery. We also demonstrate that depletion of NPM leads to distortion of nucleolar and nuclear structures with micronuclei formation. Moreover, NPM knockdown abolishes centrosomal microtubule nucleation, resulting in the distortion of cytoskeletal elements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL</title><sec><title>Cell culture, siRNA (small interfering RNA) transfection and rescue assay</title><p>HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Gibco BRL) supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS (fetal bovine serum) at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

An siRNA sequence specific for GL2 luciferase gene was used for control RNAi (mock) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The siRNA sequences for fibrillarin and nucleolin have been published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. siRNA transfection was performed according to manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). For the siRNA rescue assay, we constructed an NPMr [RNAi-refractory GFP (green fluorescent protein)-NPM] vector by introducing three silent mutations into the vector through changing the nucleotide sequence (residues 671&#x02013;682) of NPM to GA<underline>C</underline>GATGA<underline>C</underline>GA<underline>C</underline> (the underlined nucleotides indicate silent mutations). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR and confirmed by sequencing.

In the present study, we examined the localization of NPM throughout the cell cycle of fixed HeLa cells by double immunostaining. NPM is dynamically localized from interphase to telophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). In interphase, NPM is mainly located in the dense fibrillar components and granular components of nucleoli, and also in the nucleoplasm as scattered foci. In prophase, NPM is dispersed due to nucleolar disintegration. In prometaphase, NPM moves towards the chromosome periphery where it remains until anaphase. The localization of NPM at the chromosome periphery was confirmed using an RNAi method. Chromosome-spread and immunostaining experiments showed that NPM signals were robust at the chromosome periphery of mock-treated cells, whereas those were absent in the case of NPM-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). NPM is also distributed throughout the cytoplasm during mitosis. In telophase, NPM is concentrated into PNBs (pre-nucleolar bodies) and is involved in the eventual establishment of daughter nucleoli before NE (nuclear envelope) formation. Thus NPM actively shuttles from the nucleolus to perichromosomal region and cytoplasm only after NE breakdown at the end of prophase, and returns back to the PNBs and nucleoplasm at the end of telophase. These results indicate that NPM is a highly dynamic protein throughout the cell cycle.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>NPM is a highly dynamic protein and interacts with fibrillarin and nucleolin in the cell cycle</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HeLa cells fixed with paraformaldehyde were stained for NPM (red) and &#x003b1;-tubulin (green).

Previously, we showed that fibrillarin and nucleolin were also localized at the chromosomal periphery and in the PNBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Nucleolin interacts with fibrillarin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and NPM directly interacts with nucleolin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Taken together, our results indicate that fibrillarin, nucleolin and NPM are co-localized at the chromosome periphery and PNBs where they interact with each other during the cell cycle.</p><p>To understand the functional importance of NPM in the nucleolus, endogenous NPM was specifically depleted by RNAi in HeLa cells. Depletion of NPM levels was revealed by both Western-blot analysis and immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A&#x02013;2C</xref>). DIC (differential interference contrast) imaging showed that mock-treated cells presented, at best, three large, spherical intranuclear masses corresponding to nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). In contrast, the nucleolar masses appeared distorted and fragmented in several small spots in NPM-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). Moreover, immunofluorescence showed that nucleolar marker proteins, such as fibrillarin, nucleolin and Ki-67, were associated with nucleoli in mock-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2E&#x02013;2G</xref>), whereas they were associated with remnants of the nucleolar compartment in NPM-depleted cells, exhibiting the disorganized pattern of the nucleolar structure with a relatively reduced size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2E&#x02013;2G</xref>). Western-blot analysis showed that NPM depletion did not significantly affect the expression level of nucleolin and fibrillarin as compared with mock-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Moreover, single depletion of nucleolin or fibrillarin did not show any effect on the localization of each other and of NPM (Supplementary Figure S1 at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/415/bj4150345add.htm">http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/415/bj4150345add.htm</ext-link>). NPM depletion caused distortion of the nucleolar structure in other cell lines, such as HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293T and NHDF (normal human dermal fibroblast) cells (Supplementary Figure 2 at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/415/bj4150345add.htm">http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/415/bj4150345add.htm</ext-link>). These results indicate that endogenous NPM generally plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the structural integrity of the nucleolus, with an exception in the case of U2OS cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Depletion of NPM leads to a disorganized nucleolar structure in HeLa cells</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western-blot analysis at 48-h post-transfection of mock and NPM RNAi cells.

Approx. 50% of NPM-depleted cells had defective nuclear morphologies of various types,&#x000a0;such as irregular, ruffled, lobulated morphologies, and more than 12% of cells formed multiple micronuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C), whereas more than 98% of mock-treated cells had the regular nuclear structure with almost no micronuclei formation. More than a 25- and 10-fold higher number of NPM-depleted cells had the aberrant nuclear morphology and multiple micronuclei respectively, compared with mock-treated cells. Obviously, the effect of NPM depletion at 48-h post-transfection on the nuclear structure is &#x0223c;2-fold higher than that of fibrillarin depletion (approx. 35% of cells with nuclear defects at 72-h post-transfection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]). These results indicate that NPM plays a more effective role on the nuclear morphology than fibrillarin. To rule out the potential off-target effects, we performed the rescue assay, which showed that these morphological changes were significantly recovered by introducing the NPMr plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). An abnormal nuclear shape would develop from defects in mitosis or cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Moreover, down-regulation of NPM delays mitotic entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We then checked whether NPM depletion led or not to mitotic defects. Depletion of NPM caused accumulation of mitotic cells when HeLa cells were synchronously released from cell-cycle arrest at the G<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;S-phase boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). Moreover, at 24-h post-transfection of NPM-siRNA there was an accumulation of aberrant mitotic chromosomes in asynchronous cells, which were recovered by the rescue experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>F, and results not shown). Further transfection of NPM-siRNA until 48&#x000a0;h resulted in micronuclei formation at cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>G). These results indicate that the defects in mitosis and/or cytokinesis in the absence of NPM would lead to the formation of an abnormal nuclear shape and micronuclei.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Depletion of NPM causes abnormal nuclear morphology and mitotic defects in HeLa cells</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative nuclear morphologies in mock (cells treated with control siRNA) and NPM RNAi cells.

Cells not entering mitosis showed defects in the nuclear shape. These observations indicate that nuclear abnormality also occurs independently from mitosis. Thus nuclear shape defects in NPM-depleted cells are dependent and/or independent of mitosis.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Defective nuclear structure in NPM-depleted cells is due to defects in microtubule polymerization and cytoskeletal structure in HeLa cells</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mock and NPM RNAi cells were immunostained for lamin A/C (red) and DNA (blue).

More than 66% of NPM-depleted cells had defects in the cytoskeletal structure (&#x003b1;-tubulin and &#x003b2;-actin elements became shrunken; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D), but the expression level of both cytoskeletal elements remained unaffected by NPM depletion compared with mock treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). The defects in cytoskeletal structure were remarkably recovered by the rescue experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). Although treatment with the microtubule-modifying agent nocodazole did not affect nuclear morphology in a way similar to NPM depletion (results not shown), we observed a marked defect in centrosomal microtubule re-polymerization after recovery from cold treatment in NPM-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E). Taken together, these observations indicate that aberrant nuclear morphology induced by NPM depletion is due to defects in microtubule polymerization and thus in cytoskeletal structure.</p><p>In summary, in the present study we explore the functional importance of NPM in the structural integrity of the nucleolus and nucleus in HeLa cells. We observed that depletion of NPM, rather than nucleolin or fibrillarin, results in disorganized localization of the major nucleolar proteins. Although NPM, nucleolin and fibrillarin interact with each other during the cell cycle, among them only NPM would play a crucial role in maintaining the nucleolar integrity by keeping nucleolar proteins compact at the nucleoli. Moreover, we observed that cells have an aberrant nuclear structure in the absence of NPM. Although the exact reason why fibrillarin depletion causes abnormal nuclear shape is still unknown, NPM depletion leads to defective centrosomal microtubule nucleation and cytoskeletal structure, which may result in aberrant nuclear shape. Thus NPM would maintain the normal nuclear structure by maintaining the cytoskeletal structure through tubulin/actin fibres. From the results of the present study, we conclude that NPM is essential for the formation and structural integrity of the nucleolus and also for the maintenance of normal nuclear structure. These novel functions would further support the hypothesis that NPM is a multifunctional protein. NPM can bind nucleic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and appears to be involved in different aspects of DNA metabolism and chromatin regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Although the exact mechanism of how NPM maintains nuclear structure is unknown, we speculate that the interactions of NPM with either chromatin/DNA or with the inner membrane in early G<sub>1</sub>-phase are involved in providing the structural basis for a normal shaped nucleus. Moreover DIC imaging showed that cells with distorted nuclear shape also had distorted cellular structure (Supplementary Figure S3 at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/415/bj4150345add.htm">http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/415/bj4150345add.htm</ext-link>), suggesting that cells with aberrant nuclear morphology eventually underwent apoptosis. Studies into the mechanism of how the changes in nuclear and cytoskeletal structures are connected with apoptosis will be important to understand the carcinogenic role of NPM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Online data</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" content-type="local-data" position="float" xlink:type="simple"><caption><title>Supplementary Figures S1-S3</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bj4150345add.pdf" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SD2" content-type="local-data" position="float" xlink:type="simple"><caption><title>Supplementary Movie 1</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="mov" xlink:href="bj4150345add1.mov" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SD3" content-type="local-data" position="float" xlink:type="simple"><caption><title>Supplementary Movie 2</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="mov" xlink:href="bj4150345add2.mov" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Xin Wei Wang [Liver Carcinogenesis Section, Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis, Center for Cancer Research, NCI (National Cancer Institute), NIH (National Institutes of Health), Bethesda, MD 20892, U.S.A.] for the GFP-tagged NPM vector.
