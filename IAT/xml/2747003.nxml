To address this, we developed a bitransgenic mouse that inducibly expresses Myc under the control of the cardiomyocyte-specific MHC promoter. In adult mice the induction of Myc expression in cardiomyocytes in the heart led to the development of severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy followed by ventricular dysfunction and ultimately death from congestive heart failure. Mechanistically, following Myc activation, cell cycle markers and other indices of DNA replication were significantly increased suggesting that cell cycle-related events might be a primary mechanism of cardiac dysfunction. Furthermore, pathological alterations at the cellular level included alterations in mitochondrial function with dysregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and defects in electron transport chain complexes I and III. These data are consistent with the known role of Myc in several different pathways including cell cycle activation, mitochondrial proliferation, and apoptosis, and indicate that Myc activation in cardiomyocytes is an important regulator of downstream pathological sequelae. Moreover, our findings indicate that the induction of Myc in cardiomyocytes is sufficient to cause cardiomyopathy and heart failure, and that sustained induction of Myc, leading to cell cycle re-entry in adult cardiomyocytes, represents a maladaptive response for the mature heart.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>c-Myc (Myc) is highly expressed in fetal, proliferating cardiac myocytes. However, soon after birth, myocytes cease to divide corresponding with the downregulation of Myc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Komuro1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, while Myc is expressed at very low levels in the adult myocardium under normal physiological conditions, it is upregulated rapidly in response to virtually all hypertrophic stimuli and leads to hypertrophy rather than hyperplasia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Izumo1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Pollack1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Myc encodes a transcription factor that, as part of a heterodimeric complex with MAX, regulates the expression of a multitude of genes involved in regulating cellular proliferation and growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Johnston1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Pelengaris1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, overexpression of Myc is commonly associated with the activation of cell cycle machinery and tumorigenesis. Myc exerts its neoplastic function by inducing autonomous cellular proliferation and cellular growth, blocking differentiation, and inducing genomic instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Grandori1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Karlsson1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In various animal models of cardiomyopathy, the upregulation of Myc is a consistent and early change. For instance, Myc mRNA is dramatically increased several hours after the imposition of pressure overload in animal models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Komuro1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Pollack1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Notably, similar changes in Myc expression have been reported under other pathological circumstances including myocardial infarction and hypertrophy induced by pharmacological stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Robbins1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Reiss1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In humans, Myc mRNA is increased in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Kai1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. While the ability to detect chronological changes in humans is limited because samples are obtained postmortem or at biopsy, the consistent detection of Myc expression raises the question of whether the early expression of Myc is necessary or sufficient to induce disease. Moreover, if Myc expression is sufficient to cause disease, it is unclear which Myc-related downstream mechanisms, such as cell cycle re-entry, contribute to cardiomyopathy. In this regard, given that mitochondrial alterations are directly linked to the development of cardiomyopathy and heart failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Loeffen1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Lucas1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, it is interesting to note that Myc also plays a role in the maintenance of mitochondrial function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Li1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. While the mechanism of Myc-regulated mitochondrial function is unclear, the regulation of PGC-1&#x003b1; (PPAR&#x003b3; coactivator-1&#x003b1;) appears to be a key factor in this process since Myc induced the biogenesis of mitochondria through a PGC-1&#x003b1;-related pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Li1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. PGC-1&#x003b1; is a major regulatory molecule of mitochondrial proliferation and induces synthesis of both mitochondrial DNA-encoded and nuclear-encoded mitochondrial peptides. Importantly, the expression of PGC-1&#x003b1; is directly associated with the development of cardiomyopathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Lehman1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Russell1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, Myc may induce hypertrophic cardiomyopathy though reactivation of the cell cycle machinery and by negatively affecting mitochondrial function. To test this hypothesis, using a newly developed inducible transgenic mouse model, we examined the effect of Myc on the development of cardiomyopathy and heart failure and mechanistically evaluated alterations in cell cycle and mitochondria.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Establishment of MHC-Myc mice</title><p>Traditional transgenic mouse models have significant limitations for studying the pathogenic mechanism(s) of cardiomyopathy due to adverse effects of the transgene in development and also limitations in studying the temporal effect of a given transgene in mice that constitutively overexpress the transgene. To circumvent both of these problems and to study the importance of Myc-driven cell cycle re-entry in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy, we used a tetracycline-controlled system to generate bitransgenic mice (MHC-Myc) that inducibly overexpress Myc under the control of the &#x003b1;MHC gene promoter that drives high transgene expression specifically in cardiomyocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Valencik1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

One of the most conserved features of cardiac hypertrophy is the re-activation of genes that are normally limited in their expression to the embryonic stage of heart development and these are often used as molecular markers for cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, we examined hypertrophic changes at the molecular level by measuring two well known marker genes, atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007172-g004">Figure 4</xref>, the expression of both atrial and brain natriuretic peptides was significantly increased after 1 week induction and then decreased after 2 weeks induction.

Since Myc is only expressed temporally during development, not in adult, in cardiomyocytes, the ability to regulate the expression of Myc after development was especially important in this study. In MHC-Myc mice, the expression of Myc is tightly regulated by doxycycline and no significant phenotype is observed until Myc was induced. However, induction of Myc (Myc-ON) for two weeks led to dramatic changes in the heart including an ectopic reactivation and expression of cell cycle markers in cardiomyocytes and mitochondrial perturbations that culminated in severe hypertrophy and, ultimately, death. These results strongly support the notion that increased Myc in adult cardiomyocytes induces cell cycle re-entry that leads to cardiomyopathy and is consistent with a previous report showing that the conditional inactivation of Myc attenuates cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload and other hypertrophic stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Zhong1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in contrast to a previous Myc inducible mouse model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Xiao1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, induction of Myc in MHC-Myc animals ultimately causes heart failure resulting in death in a relatively short duration (2&#x02013;3 weeks). This difference is likely a consequence of mouse strain and expression level of Myc (Robb MacLellan, personal communication). While our MHC-Myc mouse is derived from FVB strain, the transgenic mouse line used by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Xiao1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Hayashi1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> is derived from C57Bl/6 and C3H mixed background. Since the effect of genetic background on the development of cardiomyopathy and heart failure is well documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Barrick1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, it is likely that genetic factor(s) affect subsequent phenotypes. In addition, our MHC-Myc mouse studies here appear to have significantly higher levels of Myc expression and, consequently, a more robust phenotype than previous models. Supporting this, the number of cardiomyocytes re-entering the cell cycle in our MHC-Myc animals is much greater than reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Zhong1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Xiao1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the different phenotypes observed between transgenic mice is likely a consequence of the extent to which cardiomyocytes re-enter the cell cycle and progress into S phase, leading to the development of hypertrophy and consequent heart failure. Supporting this, recent studies have suggested that the adult myocardium is capable of limited cell division in certain pathological conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Kajstura1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Beltrami1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. For instance, heart regions adjacent to a myocardial infarction show a significant increase of Ki-67 proliferation index, while no changes were noted distant from the lesion. Additionally, mitotic activity in cardiomyocytes is increased nearly 10-fold increase in end-stage ischemic heart disease and in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Kajstura1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, our data, in addition to other studies, strongly suggests that the reactivation of cell cycle in adult cardiomyocytes plays an important role in the development of cardiomyopathy and heart failure. This said, further study into the relationship to cell cycle re-entry as an adaptive or maladaptive process is clearly necessary.</p><p>Another important finding of our study is that Myc induces the morphological and functional alterations of mitochondria in MHC-Myc mice.

In support of this, cardiac-specific overexpression of PGC-1&#x003b1;, driven by the &#x003b1;-myosin heavy chain promoter, leads to marked mitochondrial proliferation, severe cardiomyopathy and death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Lehman1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Further, of more physiologic relevance, is a model of inducible PGC-1&#x003b1; overexpression in the adult mouse, which leads to a more subtle increase in mitochondrial number and the development of a reversible cardiomyopathy, with both systolic and diastolic functional impairment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Russell1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The potential mechanism(s) of mitochondrial-mediated cardiac dysfunction by PGC-1&#x003b1; overexpression likely involves defects in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism or the increased production of reactive oxygen species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Russell1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with this notion, the increase of PGC-1&#x003b1; in our MHC-Myc mice was concomitant with an increase in mitochondrial number, a decrease in mitochondria size, and a reduction in the activity of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. While the mechanistic basis for PGC-1&#x003b1;-mediated cardiomyopathy is unclear, it is likely that dysregulated mitochondrial metabolism and/or morphological alteration play an important role in the development of cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated an increased level of PGC-1&#x003b1;, but not activity, in failing human hearts suggesting that, despite the increase of PGC-1&#x003b1;, downstream pathways were disturbed by other mechanisms to induce mitochondrial pathologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Sihag1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Our observations in MHC-MYC mouse are consistent with these data from human patients as we also observed an increase of level of PGC-1&#x003b1; accompanied by functional deficits in mitochondrial energy metabolism.</p><p>Notably, it is well established that defects in electron transport chain complexes I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Loeffen1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, complex III <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Jarreta1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> and IV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-VanCoster1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> lead to dilated cardiomyopathy in human patients. Moreover, the enzyme activity of electron transport chain complexes is decreased in hearts explanted from patients with end-stage heart failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Jarreta1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Buchwald1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Raje1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> and, importantly, end-stage heart failure also results in re-expression of Myc as well as decreases in complexes I, III, and IV, and mutations in mtDNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-MarinGarcia1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-MarinGarcia2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the functional defect in mitochondrial energy metabolism in MHC-Myc mice is likely a key mechanism for the development of cardiac phenotypes such as hypertrophy and heart failure. Regarding this, the smaller size of mitochondria may also explain the defect in mitochondrial function coupled with an increase of mitochondrial number. In fact, our biochemical analyses show that citrate synthase, amount and activity, is decreased in MHC-Myc mice. Since citrate synthase is a mitochondrial matrix marker enzyme, reflecting relative mitochondrial abundance and purity, these results suggest that Myc may increase the number of immature mitochondria. The decrease in cytochrome content and multiple defects in the electron transport chain further supports the notion that mitochondrial development may be incomplete in Myc-ON mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007172-Lucas1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Collectively, these findings could explain increased mitochondrial number coupled with decreased activities of citrate synthase, complex I, and complex III.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings using a novel transgenic mouse with cardiomyocyte-specific expression of Myc (MHC-Myc mice) clearly demonstrate that increased expression of Myc can induce hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and heart failure <italic>in vivo</italic>. Mechanistically, dysregulation of cell cycle and concomitant mitochondrial alteration are likely key pathogenic mechanisms for subsequent hypertrophy-induced heart failure. As such, therapeutics targeted toward Myc, cell cycle re-activation, and/or mitochondrial dysfunction may provide opportunities for the treatment and management of cardiomyopathies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>We used the reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) system to generate bi-transgenic mice that inducibly overexpress human c-Myc cDNA under the control of &#x003b1;-myosin heavy chain (MHC) promoter to drive high transgene expression specifically in the cardiomyocyte.

Anti-PCNA mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Myc rabbit monoclonal antibody (Epitomics, Burlingame, CA), anti-Ki67 mouse monoclonal antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), anti-PGC-1&#x003b1; rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-Cyclin D1 rabbit antibody (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) were used. Antibody reactivity was localized using 3-3&#x02032;-diaminobenzidine as a chromogen (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). To exclude the possibility of non-specific reaction, all the immunocytochemistry experiments contained at least one sample without a primary antibody. Haemotoxylin and eosin staining and Trichrome staining were also performed for routine histochemical and morphological analyses. Quantification of Ki67- and BrdU-positive cardiomyocytes was performed on slides stained and counterstained with haematoxylin. Four areas of kleft venticles were randomly selected on an Axiophot microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) and at least 100 positive cardiomyocytes were counted per area.
