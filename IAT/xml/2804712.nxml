Epigenetic alterations in cancer include changes in chromatin structure and in methylation of cytosine residues in the DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In comparison with normal cells, the cancer cell genome is hypomethylated which leads to genomic instability through the activation of mobile genetic elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Concurrently, CpG-rich regions located in many gene promoters may become hypermethylated. The hypermethylation of these 5'-CpG islands may cause transcriptional silencing of genes, including tumor suppressor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Indeed, promoter hypermethylation often acts as second hit in the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, e.g. when the first allele is deleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The causes of aberrant DNA methylation in cancer are not fully understood. There are hints that overexpression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) may be involved, such as aberrant activity of DNMT3b promoted <italic>de novo </italic>methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Moreover, higher levels of <italic>DNMT1 </italic>mRNA have been detected in colorectal and stomach cancers as compared to the corresponding non-neoplastic mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Recently, a model has been proposed to explain the phenomenon why some genes become methylated during carcinogenesis while others do not. A targeting mechanism may predispose genes that are repressed by polycomb proteins in normal cells to aberrant DNA methylation in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>In many tumors, DNA methylation changes tend to accumulate with tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The profiling of diverse cancer specimens has shown that each tumor type bears a specific DNA methylation pattern. Such a pattern may be used for diagnostic or prognostic purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Moreover, aberrant DNA methylation patterns in cancer have been used for the discovery of candidate tumor suppressor genes; e.g. the <italic>HIC-1 </italic>(<italic>hypermethylated in cancer</italic>) gene was identified on chromosomal band 17p13.3, which had been described to be aberrantly methylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Subsequently, the role of <italic>HIC-1 </italic>in carcinogenesis as a transcriptional repressor has been elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A variety of methods for the genome-wide screening of methylation differences between tumor and normal cells have been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and many aberrantly methylated genes have been identified in different tumor types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. As there are additional mechanisms of epigenetic gene regulation, DNA methylation is sometimes not tightly associated with transcriptional silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Some genes even become repressed upon demethylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Thus, after identification of a gene differentially methylated in cancer versus normal tissue, its functional role in carcinogenesis remains to be proven by additional molecular and functional analyses.</p><p>In the course of a DNA methylation screening in sarcoma cells using a methylated CpG island amplification coupled with representational difference analysis (MCA-RDA) approach, we identified the <italic>ECRG4 </italic>gene at 2q12.2 as a gene showing aberrant promoter methylation in tumor but not in normal cells. Previous studies reported on promoter hypermethylation and reduced expression of <italic>ECRG4 </italic>in advanced esophageal and prostate carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and on a tumor suppressor function of ECRG4 in eosophageal cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Here, we report on a further molecular and functional characterization of <italic>ECRG4 </italic>as a potential tumor suppressor gene in different types of cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tumor tissue samples</title><p>Thirty-one tissue samples of colorectal carcinoma and neighboring normal muscosa were analyzed.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], using soft tissue sarcoma and control tissues (data not shown). Among several candidate sequences, a fragment of the <italic>ECRG4 </italic>promoter was cloned.</p><sec><title>ECRG4 promoter methylation and expression in tumor cell lines</title><p>To elucidate the role of <italic>ECRG4 </italic>hypermethylation in human tumor cells, we analyzed the methylation of its promoter in eleven cancer cell lines from colorectal, lung, cervix, hepatocellular and breast carcinoma, fibrosarcoma and glioblastoma (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). COBRA analysis of the upstream promoter fragment showed either full or partial methylation in all cell lines. To confirm these results, sodium bisulfite sequencing of PCR products from HCT116 and SW480 cells was carried out and also showed dense promoter methylation in both colorectal carcinoma lines (data not shown). However, we wondered if the methylation of the <italic>ECRG4 </italic>promoter extends further downstream towards the transcription start site. We therefore analyzed a second promoter fragment by COBRA and found that all three colorectal carcinoma and all three glioblastoma cell lines, as well as HepG2 and MCF7 were methylated whereas A549, HeLa and HT1080 were not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>).</p><p>We analyzed the panel of tumor cell lines for expression of <italic>ECRG4 </italic>using RT-PCR. In these analyses, the <italic>ECRG4 </italic>transcript was not detected even after 40 cycles of amplification. <italic>ECRG4 </italic>was re-expressed in the colon cancer cell lines SW480, HCT116, HT-29 and the fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 after treatment with the demethylating agent AZA. Treatment with TSA alone had no effect. Combined treatment with AZA and TSA induced strong expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref> and data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>ECRG4 promoter methylation and expression in colon carcinoma</title><p>As the three analyzed colon cancer cell lines showed <italic>ECRG4 </italic>hypermethylation, we asked whether <italic>ECRG4 </italic>methylation also can be found in primary colorectal tumors. We therefore analyzed 31 samples from colon carcinoma and 10 corresponding normal tissues by COBRA (downstream fragment). While tumor samples showed a high methylation frequency (19 of 31; 61%), control tissues lacked detectable methylation (0/10; 0%) (Fisher's exact test; p = 0.023) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Results of selected samples were validated using the Epitect Sequencing Service (Qiagen). Eight methylated samples displayed methylation levels ranging from 15% to 79%, seven unmethylated samples showed methylation levels ranging from 2% to 8% and four normal colon tissues showed methylation levels of 3% to 5% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). Thus, qualitative and semiquantitative methylation analysis revealed a significantly higher methylation frequency in colon carcinoma as compared to neighboring colorectal mucosa (unpaired t-test; p = 0.0166). To determine if <italic>ECRG4 </italic>promoter methylation is correlated to gene expression, we analyzed relative expression levels of <italic>ECRG4 </italic>by semiquantitative RT-PCR in eight tumor and nine normal tissues. Of the eight tumor tissues, six were hypermethylated and two were of unknown methylation status. We found significantly lower expression of <italic>ECRG4 </italic>in tumor tissues as compared to control tissue (BI = 0.33 vs. BI = 1.44; unpaired t-test; p = 0.0018) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold><italic>ECRG4 </italic>promoter methylation and mRNA expression in primary colorectal carcinoma samples</bold>. a) COBRA analysis of <italic>ECRG4 </italic>methylation in colorectal carcinoma and normal colon tissue samples.

The proliferation rate of <italic>ECRG4 </italic>transfected HCT116 cells, as assessed by the BrdU assay, was significantly reduced to 33% (&#x000b1; 13%; one sample t-test; p = 0.0133) relative to the mock-transfected control cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>).

To eliminate the influence of the transfection on tumor cell growth, we measured cell viability after treatment of cells with ECRG4 containing medium and medium from transfection with pCI Neo.

Western Blotting with an eGFP antibody detected the ECRG4-eGFP fusion protein as three distinct bands of ~40 kDa, ~35 kDa and ~28 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). The highest molecular weight (MW) band would fit to the MW of the ECRG4-eGFP fusion protein (eGFP: 26 kDa + ECRG4 without signal peptide: 14 kDa).

This staining pattern was also obtained after transfection of cells with a GFP tagged construct of the golgi resident protein &#x003b2;-1,4-galactosyltransferase. Thus, it could be concluded that ECRG4 was localized to the Golgi apparatus which would be in accordance with the secretory pathway of proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion and Conclusions</title><p>The data reported in this study implicate <italic>ECRG4 </italic>as a candidate tumor suppressor gene at 2q12.2 that is frequently hypermethylated and transcriptionally down-regulated in colon carcinomas and other types of human cancers. Cancer cells are characterized by extensive epigenetic DNA alterations, including global hypomethylation as well as focal hypermethylation at CpG islands in gene promoters. DNA hypermethylation constitutes a major cause of aberrant gene silencing in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, not all aberrantly silenced genes also play functional roles in tumor development. In analogy to somatic mutations in tumor cells, which in part are neutral passenger mutations, some methylation events might be epigenetic passengers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Therefore, each candidate tumor suppressor gene identified by methylation screening methods has to be carefully evaluated for its role in tumor development and progression.</p><p>In the course of a methylation screening approach, we identified <italic>ECRG4 </italic>as a gene differentially methylated in sarcoma versus normal cells. Previously, <italic>ECRG4 </italic>had been found to be hypermethylated in esophageal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. To investigate its possible role in human cancer, we (1) analyzed different tumor entities for <italic>ECRG4 </italic>promoter methylation, (2) revealed a correlation between the methylation and gene silencing, (3) measured the effect of <italic>ECRG4 </italic>re-expression on the proliferation of colon cancer cells, and (4) determined the cellular localization of the ECRG4 protein.</p><p>Initially, we found the <italic>ECRG4 </italic>promoter to be frequently hypermethylated in a broad spectrum of human tumor cell lines. To exclude that hypermethylation is limited to tumor cells in culture we carried out qualitative and semiquantitative methylation analysis of primary cancer samples. In colorectal carcinomas, we found a high frequency of methylation, but, as the analyzed samples were all from advanced staged tumors, correlations to clinical features were not possible. We also found frequent methylation in astrocytic gliomas, in which the methylation frequency increased with advancing tumor grade, being particularly common in glioblastomas. This result is consistent with recent reports that <italic>ECRG4 </italic>methylation is associated with advanced disease and poor prognosis in esophageal and prostate cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Our findings of frequent <italic>ECRG4 </italic>methylation in various cancer cell lines may suggest that <italic>ECRG4 </italic>might be methylated in even other tumor types. Hence, <italic>ECRG4 </italic>might belong to the set of genes that are frequently methylated in multiple types of cancer. Another example is the pro-apoptotic gene <italic>RASSF1A</italic>, which is rarely mutated but often hypermethylated in various kinds of epithelial, mesenchymal and neuroectodermal tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Such genes often regulate processes that are crucial for cancer development, such as apoptosis or cell cycle progression.</p><p>Our data also indicate that <italic>ECRG4 </italic>promoter methylation strongly correlates with transcriptional silencing. None of the methylated cancer cell lines showed expression of <italic>ECRG4 </italic>transcripts. Furthermore, the expression level of <italic>ECRG4 </italic>was significantly lower in colon cancer samples than in normal mucosa, which agrees with the recent result that <italic>ECRG4 </italic>expression is lower in esophageal cancer than in surrounding normal epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It should be noted that two normal colon tissues also showed weak <italic>ECRG4 </italic>expression. This could be due to a methylation field effect in normal tissue surrounding tumor tissue. Alternatively, it cannot be ruled out that <italic>ECRG4 </italic>silencing might be regulated by other mechanisms than DNA methylation. Then again, <italic>ECRG4 </italic>expression could be reactivated by demethylating treatment, which is a known feature of epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>By <italic>ECRG4 </italic>overexpression or ECRG4 treatment, we demonstrate an inhibitory effect of this protein on colorectal carcinoma cell growth. Using two independent assays of cell viability and cell proliferation, we found reduced growth rates after <italic>ECRG4 </italic>transfection or culturing of cells in ECRG4 containing medium. An additional hint supporting a growth suppressive effect of <italic>ECRG4 </italic>in tumor cells comes from stabile transfection experiments, in which we observed that the expression of the transgene rapidly declined, presumably by <italic>de novo </italic>methylation (data not shown). Recent findings show that ECRG4 acts as a tumor suppressor in esophageal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Our data provide first hints that ECRG4 may serve a tumor suppressor function also in colorectal carcinoma cells.</p><p>Finally, we demonstrate that ECRG4 is a secreted protein. The <italic>ECRG4 </italic>gene codes for a small protein of 148 aa (17 kDa) of yet unknown function and without significant homology to other known proteins, except for a 31% homology to the mouse IgG V region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. A putative N-terminal signal peptide suggests that ECRG4 might be a secreted protein. We found that an ECRG4-eGFP fusion protein localized to the Golgi apparatus within the cell, which would be consistent with the secretory pathway of proteins. In addition, we detected the ECRG4-eGFP fusion protein in the cell culture medium of transfected cells. Recently, the ECRG4 protein was renamed in the Uniprot database <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org">http://www.uniprot.org</ext-link> as "augurin", a protein which had been identified in a bioinformatics approach as a putative new peptide hormone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Mirabeau et al. showed that augurin is a secreted protein which is processed from its prepro-form. However, only limited augurin expression was found in murine endocrine tissues. In addition to its potential expression in endocrine glands, <italic>ECRG4 </italic>is expressed in normal epithelium of the colon and esophagus and in fat tissue as shown here and in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The findings of Mirabeau et al. (2007) support the hypothesis that ECRG4 functions as an extracellular signaling molecule. Interestingly, unlike other peptide hormones, the signaling of ECRG4 is not growth promoting but rather growth limiting.</p><p>In conclusion, we show that the <italic>ECRG4 </italic>gene is frequently hypermethylated in a variety of human cancer cells. Hypermethylation associates strongly with transcriptional silencing in colorectal carcinomas. Furthermore, ECRG4 displays growth-inhibitory effects on colon cancer cells <italic>in vitro </italic>and may function as a secreted extracellular signaling molecule. Thus, restoring ECRG4 expression in the tumor, either by epigenetic therapy or application of recombinant protein, may represent a promising novel therapeutic approach in various types of cancers.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AZA: 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine; <italic>ECRG4</italic>: esophageal cancer related gene 4; TSA: trichostatin A;</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SG carried out the DNA methylation and gene expression studies and drafted the manuscript, VF carried out the cloning and the functional characterization experiments, TT analyzed colon carcinoma samples, MW and GR analyzed and interpreted the results of the glioblastoma samples and drafted the manuscript, AT analyzed colon carcinoma samples and drafted the manuscript, CK and DM analyzed colon carcinoma samples, OM participated in the design of the study and drafted the manuscript, SS conceived of the study, participated in its design and coordination and drafted the manuscript.
