This family of proteins which forms the largest class of cell surface receptors found in animal genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], has an early evolutionary origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and serves a wide variety of functions including reproduction. Structurally, all known GPCRs share a common architecture of seven membrane-spanning helices connected by intra- and extracellular loops.</p><p><italic>C. elegans </italic>is a simple, highly reproductive, multicellular model organism appropriate to the investigation of innumerable signaling pathways at the organismal level. Despite our knowledge of the reproductive physiology of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the molecular endocrinology regulating reproduction in <italic>C. elegans </italic>is unknown. The <italic>C. elegans </italic>genome is known to code for at least 1149 GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] but the GPCR(s) critical to the regulation of reproduction in this nematode are not yet known. The characterization of membrane receptors related to the regulation of reproduction within this model nematode organism is very important for both the study of evolutionary biology as well as the study of the molecular endocrinology of reproduction in multicellular organisms.</p><p>In mammals, reproduction is controlled by hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and hostile environmental conditions are known to suppress HPG axis hormones, thereby decreasing or preventing reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The hypothalamus acts as a sensor of the environment to regulate the production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH1). GnRH1 released from hypothalamic neurons into the hypophyseal bloodstream binds to GnRH receptors (GnRHR1) on gonadotropes of the anterior pituitary signaling for the synthesis and secretion of gonadotropins. Gonadotropins in turn bind to receptors on the gonads leading to the production of the sex steroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The presence of a complex endocrine axis that regulates reproduction in <italic>C. elegans </italic>has not been contemplated, since central components of this axis &#x02013; gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR) and its ligand(s) &#x02013; have not been reported.</p><p>In this study we demonstrate that <italic>C. elegans </italic>contains a GnRHR (Ce-GnRHR) orthologous to GnRHR1 in humans and to the adipokinetic hormone receptors (AKHRs) of insects, and that Ce-GnRHR specifically localizes to the nuclei of germline and intestinal cells, and to the myofilament lattice of the pharyngeal musculature. Our results support the presence of an evolutionarily conserved GPCR possibly involved in reproduction and metabolism in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Sequence analysis</title><p>Sequence similarity searches using the sequences of the principal GPCR signaling components of the human HPG axis were performed against the <italic>C. elegans </italic>genome. This analysis indicated the presence of two proteins, one of 401 amino acids [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NP_491453">NP_491453</ext-link>] and another of 379 amino acids [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NP_506566">NP_506566</ext-link>] sharing 46.9% and 44.7% nucleotide similarity to that of human GnRHR1 and GnRHR2, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In addition, a leucine-rich GPCR previously reported in <italic>C. elegans </italic>[GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_073147">NM_073147</ext-link>] has 47.6% nucleotide similarity to human follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This paper is primarily focused on the 401 amino acid protein [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NP_491453">NP_491453</ext-link>] orthologous to human GnRHR1. Amino acid sequence alignment of human GnRHR1 with the <italic>C. elegans </italic>orthologue (Ce-GnRHR) and 3 other class A GPCRs demonstrated considerable sequence similarity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Like its human orthologue, 3 separate prediction algorithms used to analyze the structure of Ce-GnRHR predicted a GPCR belonging to the rhodopsin family (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>; See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">additional file 1</xref>: TM_predictions.eps; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]). These prediction programs indicate that Ce-GnRHR contains several structural motifs similar to that of human GnRHR1, including 7 transmembrane domains, 3 intracellular and extracellular loops, and amino acid residues representing PKC phosphorylation sites and G-protein coupling sites (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>; See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">additional file 1</xref>: TM_predicitions.eps; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]). As has been reported for all non-human GnRHR1s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], the Ce-GnRHR has a long C-terminal tail (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) characteristic of a gene ancestral to GnRH and AKH receptors. Although the overall amino acid sequence identity between <italic>C. elegans </italic>and human GnRHR1 was only ~21%, closer analysis revealed that 56% of the functionally important amino acid residues (FIRs) of human GnRHR1 were conserved in Ce-GnRHR (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The highest degree of conservation was observed in those amino acids involved in receptor activation (83%), and G<sub>q11 </sub>coupling (62%; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Lesser conservation was observed in amino acids important to binding pocket formation (54%), G<sub>s </sub>coupling (50%), and PKC phosphorylation (50%). Ligand binding sites were least conserved (36%), indicating the possibility that the ligand of Ce-GnRHR is significantly different from that of human GnRHR1. Indeed, in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, a cloned GnRHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] was subsequently identified as AKHR from ligand binding studies indicating AKH was the binding partner of this receptor in insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In this connection, Ce-GnRHR had the highest overall sequence similarity (45%) and the highest FIR similarity (66%) with <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>AKHR (Dm-AKHR; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]), a receptor involved in metabolism (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). In comparison, there was less conservation of overall sequence and FIRs in two other human class A GPCRs, rhodopsin (12% and 41%; respectively) and vasopressin receptor type 1A (18% and 44%; respectively) when compared with <italic>C. elegans </italic>(21% and 56%; respectively; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). This comparative analysis suggests Ce-GnRHR is orthologous to insect AKHR and human GnRHR. The relatively greater conservation of FIRs observed between Ce-GnRHR, Dm-AKHR and human GnRHR1 (56&#x02013;66% similarity; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), suggests these proteins are <italic>all </italic>derived from a single ancestral GPCR, and, are thus orthologous to each other.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of GnRHR orthologue in <italic>C. elegans</italic></bold>.

The coding region of each gene contains a different number of exons: 6 in Ce-GnRHR, 5 in Dm-AKHR, and 3 in human GnRHR1. Intronic sequence length is also variable. While the 2 introns of human GnRHR1 total more than 10 kilobases, the 4 introns of Dm-AKHR only amount to ~1 kilobase. Additionally, sequence corresponding to the 3' end of Ce-GnRHR exon 5 and all of Ce-GnRHR exon 6 is absent from human GnRHR. In order to deduce the genomic organization of a gene ancestral to all three of these GnRHR(-like) genes, a considerably larger number of genes would have to be analyzed. Yet, at least one coincidental feature of the gene maps shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> might be indicative of ancestral gene structure: exon 1 of human GnRHR and exon 3 of DM-AKHR terminate at the same point.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification and immunolocalization of Ce-GnRHR</title><p>To determine whether Ce-GnRHR was transcribed in the worm, we isolated RNA, and, using two gene-specific primers, amplified the region depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>. The expected 946 bp cDNA fragment encompassing exons 2 through 6 was detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).

The affinity purified anti-Ce-GnRHR antibody recognized a 46-kDa band (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), the calculated molecular weight of Ce-GnRHR, as well as higher molecular weight (116-kDa, 237-kDa) variants that might represent mature or otherwise post-translationally modified species and lower molecular weight (27-kDa and 23-kDa) variants that might represent truncated protein products, as we have reported for human GnRHR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Despite limited similarity between the N-terminus of the human and <italic>C. elegans </italic>receptor, a monoclonal antibody raised against the N-terminus of human GnRHR1 identifies a single band of 46-kDa in the <italic>C. elegans </italic>homogenate (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"/>: Immunoblot 1.eps) and produces similar immunolocalization (see below); however, it remains unclear whether this antibody is detecting Ce-GnRHR.

Additionally, comparison of the amino acid sequences and genomic organization of Ce-GnRHR and orthologue 2 revealed limited similarity between the two genes, especially at the C-terminus of Ce-GnRHR &#x02013; against which the anti-Ce-GnRHR antibody was raised (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">additional file 3</xref>: Ortho.eps).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of Ce-GnRHR</bold>.

Evidence that this GPCR [WormBase: F54D7.3] is orthologous to the human GnRHR1 and Dm-AKHR is supported by the findings that, 1) the next closest potential orthologue to human GnRHR1 (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase; [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_073809">NM_073809</ext-link>]) has considerably less identity (amino acid = 13.8%, E-score = 7.1) to human GnRHR1 than F54D7.3 (amino acid = 22.2%, E-score = 0.45). Likewise, the next closest potential orthologue to Dm-AKHR (hypothetical protein Y116A8B.5; [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CAA16290">CAA16290</ext-link>]) has less identity (amino acid = 21.8%, E-score = 2e-18) to Dm-AKHR than F54D7.3 (amino acid = 28.7%, E-score = 2e-45); 2) the alignment of F54D7.3 with human GnRHR1 and two other Class A GPCRs, rhodopsin and vasopressin receptor type 1A, showed that the functionally important amino acids of F54D7.3 were significantly more similar to the same sites in human GnRHR (56%; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Likewise, the alignment of F54D7.3 with Dm-GnRHR also indicated significant similarity between the functionally important amino acids (66%; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), and 3) this GPCR was actively transcribed in the adult worm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) and its translated protein was localized to the germline, fertilized eggs, intestine, and pharynx (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Likewise, in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>AKHR was most highly expressed in ovaries, digestive system, brain, tracheae and fat body cells, although immunoreactivity appeared to be more cytoplasmic in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Phylogenetic analysis supports the idea that the evolutionary relationships of Ce-GnRHR place it somewhere between the vertebrate GnRHRs and insect AKHRs, though it is more closely allied with AKHRs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The strict consensus tree of select Class A and B GPCRs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) provides minimal bootstrap support for many of the deeper nodes, but three conservative conclusions relevant to our study of Ce-GnRHR may be drawn from the phylogenetic analysis: (1) Ce-GnRHR is more closely related to insect AKHRs than to chordate GnRHRs or corazonin receptors, (2) vertebrate GnRHRs comprise a distinct group of receptors, separate from all other GnRHR-like receptors, including Ce-GnRHR, and, (3) the classification of Ce-GnRHR [F54D7.3] as a GnRHR-like receptor (as opposed to another class of GPCR) is supported.</p><p>The Ce-GnRHR ligand has not been identified. Intriguingly, though, we have shown that human GnRH increases both egg laying (17%) and viable offspring (42%) in <italic>C. elegans </italic>(Vadakkadath Meethal et al., 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and unpublished data), although it is unclear at this stage whether human GnRH1 binds Ce-GnRHR. GnRHR and GnRH/GnRH-like oligopeptides have been identified in all mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrate species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] studied to date, as well as other vertebrates and invertebrates (octopus, tunicates, lamprey, fish, frogs, etc) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. While a variety of invertebrate species, including numerous insects and the oyster, <italic>Crassotrea gigas</italic>, have been shown to possess GnRHR orthologues, insects bind a distinct, non-GnRH-like peptide (AKH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In insects, AKHs are secreted from endocrine cells of the corpora cardiaca into the hemolymph [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and mobilize energy reserve from storages (from fat body) and regulate energy homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] by signaling through AKHRs.</p><p>Molecular phylogenetic analyses of the past decade have garnered increasingly strong support for the group Ecdysozoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], the major phyla of which are Arthropoda and Nematoda. Under this phylogenetic hypothesis, it is not unreasonable to expect a nematode GnRHR will bind an AKH-like peptide. Yet, an invertebrate GnRH peptide has been biochemically characterized in the mollusk <italic>Octopus vulgaris</italic>. Given the placement of Ce-GnRHR in the topology of our phylogenetic hypothesis &#x02013; between the AKHRs and the molluscan GnRHR (oyster), whose ligand is unknown, but may very well be GnRH &#x02013; another possibility is that Ce-GnRHR is a receptor capable of binding AKH- <italic>and </italic>GnRH-like ligands. A final, equally plausible possibility is that Ce-GnRHR binds an altogether different hormone specific to nematodes, which is supported by the relatively low conservation of ligand binding amino acid residues for both human GnRHR and Dm-AKHR (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><p>Ce-GnRHR localized to the nucleus of germline and intestinal cells, as well as to the myofilamant lattice of the pharyngeal musculature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Although GnRHR1 is traditionally thought of as a plasma membrane receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], it is becoming increasingly evident that GnRHR1 can be internalized from the plasma membrane to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Indeed, the nuclear localization of GnRHR1 has been reported in rapidly proliferating cells such as pancreatic and breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Ligand binding to GnRHR may be the stimulus for the nuclear internalization of the receptor since GnRH has been shown to be rapidly internalized to the nuclear membrane prior to entry into the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Although we did not detect intense Ce-GnRHR staining in germline and intestinal plasma membranes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), it remains to be determined whether Ce-GnRHR localized to the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) is from <italic>de novo </italic>receptor synthesized in the cytosol or from Ce-GnRHR translocalization from the plasma membrane. Nevertheless, the localization of Ce-GnRHR to the nucleus provides an exceptional molecular marker of nuclear growth as germ cells progress through the gonadal arm prior to fertilization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>In vertebrates, GnRH neurons originate from the olfactory placode during organogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. GnRH secretion from hypothalamic neurons is tightly influenced by environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], and this environmental sensing mechanism regulates reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that GnRH1 increases the excitability of olfactory receptor neurons, that the terminal nerve functions to modulate the odorant sensitivity of olfactory receptor neurons and that this signaling is tightly linked to reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The localization of Ce-GnRHR to the germline, pharynx, and intestine (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) is suggestive of a role in modulating reproductive function in accordance with environmental conditions. Like the human, the nematode also regulates reproduction dependent upon environmental signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and it is well demonstrated that reproduction in <italic>C. elegans </italic>is strictly controlled by environmental cues such as food and temperature. Under adverse conditions (starvation, high population densities and high temperature), <italic>C. elegans </italic>can enter a reproductively inactive alternative third larval stage called dauer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The decision to enter the developmentally arrested dauer larval stage is triggered by a combination of signals from sensory neurons in response to environmental cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Although signaling between olfactory neurons and the reproductive system has been demonstrated in <italic>C. elegans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], it is unclear what signaling pathways are involved. It does however suggest the presence of an endocrine system that regulates reproduction in response to environmental conditions.</p><p>We propose a model whereby a putative signaling peptide (GnRH, GnRH-like peptide, and/or AKH) in <italic>C. elegans </italic>may be released into the body of the worm from neurons in the head during favorable conditions, where it can then act to signal through Ce-GnRHR located on the pharyngeal musculature, intestine and germ cells (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In this way, this peptide signaling can simultaneously initiate both pharyngeal pumping and reproduction when food is plentiful. Interestingly, the dauer-inducing pheromone detected by sensory neurons in <italic>C. elegans </italic>signals by a complex pathway to the germline, pharynx, intestine, and the ectoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Indeed, it has recently been shown that octopus GnRH (oct-GnRH) has a contractile effect on the radula retractor muscle which expresses oct-GnRHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and that oct-GnRH mRNA-expressing cell bodies and immunoreactive fibers are present on the superior buccal lobe suggesting that oct-GnRH is involved in feeding behavior generated by contractions of the muscle of the buccal mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. The coupling of food intake to reproduction by such a mechanism would allow for the rapid development and subsequent reproduction of the worm. It is intriguing that Ce-GnRHR is closely related evolutionary with human GnRHR and insect AKHR, involved in regulating reproduction and metabolism, respectively. Ce-GnRHR may provide a molecular link between reproduction and metabolism.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The sequence similarity, structural organization and localization of Ce-GnRHR provide evidence of an evolutionarily conserved GnRHR orthologue in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.

Regardless, our identification of an evolutionarily conserved GnRHR in <italic>C. elegans </italic>opens the way to using this organism as a model system to study reproductive endocrinology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Nematode strain</title><p>The wild type N2 Bristol (Caenorhabditis Genetics Center, National Institutes of Health, National Center for Research Resources, MN) strain was cultured at 22&#x02013;24&#x000b0;C under standard conditions on <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>GnRHR1 monoclonal antibody (F<sub>1</sub>G<sub>4</sub>) raised against the N-terminus 1&#x02013;29 amino acids of human GnRHR1 was a kind gift from Dr. Anjali Karande of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against C-terminus amino acids 386 to 401 (Ac-GIDKRNHNVQLEIIDFC-OH) of Ce-GnRHR (The New England Peptides Inc., Gardner, MA), a region not found in human GnRHR1. This sequence was chosen based on antigenicity and to limit cross-reactivity with other proteins. The C-terminus included a cysteine for coupling purposes and the N-terminus was blocked by acetylation. Rabbits were immunized with this HPLC-purified antigen (structural confirmation was determined by mass spectrometry) using standard procedures (The New England Peptides Inc., Gardner, MA). Titer levels were monitored periodically in the animals and the animals bled after 60 days. The serum was then affinity purified (The New England Peptides Inc., Gardner, MA) for use in immunodetection assays. Secondary antibodies including goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (sc-2055; for the GnRHR1 monoclonal antibody), goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (sc-2054; for the Ce-GnRHR antibody) as well as the Western blotting luminal reagent were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence analyses and structural prediction</title><p>A BLASTp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] search was performed against the <italic>C. elegans </italic>genome using human GnRHR1 and GnRHR2 as query sequences. For each query, the hit with the lowest E-value was aligned with human GnRHR1 using ALIGN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Transmembrane regions of Ce-GnRHR were predicted using the following programs: TMHMM V.2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], DAS-TMfilter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] and PSIPRED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. In order to determine the level of conservation of functionally important amino acid residues, Ce-GnRHR was aligned with human GnRHR1 [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NP_000397">NP_000397</ext-link>], Dm-AKHR [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AAC61523">AAC61523</ext-link>], human vasopressin receptor type 1A [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NP_000697">NP_000697</ext-link>], and human rhodopsin [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NP_000530">NP_000530</ext-link>]. Homologous FIRs were identified through comparison to a previously reported structural prediction of human GnRHR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In pairwise comparisons, FIRs were scored as 'similar' based on the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix &#x02013; i.e., if the two residues belonged to any one of the following groups of similar amino acids, which have positive scores in the BLOSUM62 matrix: [WYF], [ST], [AS], [RKQ], [NSHD], [DE], [QKE], [YH], or [VIML]. Percent similarity for each type of FIR was calculated using the formula: (identical comparisons + (0.5 * similar comparisons))/total comparisons) * 100. Comparative genomic organization of Ce-GnRHR, human GnRHR1, and Dm-AKHR was deduced from comparison of our sequence alignment with the exon and intron lengths retrieved from GenBank sequence annotations.</p></sec><sec><title>RT-PCR analysis</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from 10 adult worms using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Ce-GnRHR cDNA was synthesized and amplified using the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

Briefly, slides were frozen on dry ice for 30 min., the cover slip was quickly removed using a razor blade and the slide then immersed in cold methanol followed by cold acetone (5 min. each). Immunostaining was performed as per standard procedures. Briefly, worms were washed in 1% NGS (in TBS) for 10 min., 10% NGS for 30 min. and 1% NGS for 1 min. Slides were incubated with the anti-human GnRHR1 antibody F<sub>1</sub>G<sub>4 </sub>(dilution: 1:250) or with the affinity purified anti-Ce-GnRHR antibody (1:125) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Slides were then rinsed in 1%, 10% and 1% NGS for 10 min. each prior to incubation with secondary antibody for 30 min. at room temperature. Slides were washed with 1% NGS three times prior to DAB staining and mounting with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc. Burlingame, CA). Controls treated with secondary antibody alone were similarly processed. Images were acquired using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope connected to a Fluo Arc light source and an Axio Cam MRC-5 camera.

Sequences were aligned in ClustalX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] using default gap penalties, and any positions of the initial alignment represented by less than half of the sequences were excised in BioEdit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Excision resulted in a 422 amino acid dataset centered on the seven transmembrane domains and the intervening intra- and extracellular domains. Maximum parsimony analysis (1000 random sequence addition replicates with TBR perturbation) of the dataset was performed in PAUP*4.0b10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. An unrooted, strict consensus tree was constructed from the most parsimonious trees.
