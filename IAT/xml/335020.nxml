The protein coding region of the gene was cloned into a multicopy expression vector to obtain high yields of the enzyme (approximately 0.2% of total protein) which was purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity, molecular exclusion and reverse-phase chromatography. Good correlation was found between the determined and predicted amino acid compositions. The ability of the purified protein to act on O6-methylguanine (O6-MeG), O6-ethylguanine (O6-EtG) and O4-methylthymine (O4-MeT) in self-complementary dodecadeoxyribonucleotides was compared to that of 19 kDa fragment of the related ada-protein. With both proteins the rate order was O6-MeG greater than O6-EtG greater than O4-MeT, however, the ogt protein was found to repair O6-MeG, O6-EtG and O4-Met, 1.1, 173 and 84 times, respectively, faster than the ada protein.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0084-a" xlink:role="8479"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0080.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8475"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0081.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8476"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0082.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8477"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0083.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8478"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0084.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8479"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0085.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8480"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0086.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8481"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0087.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8482"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8483"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0089.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8484"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
