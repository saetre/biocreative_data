The zebrafish is a fascinating vertebrate model for studying this process since unlike mammals, direct exposure of most of its tissues to light leads to local clock entrainment. Importantly, light induces the expression of a set of genes including certain clock genes in most zebrafish cell types in vivo and in vitro. However, the mechanism linking light to gene expression remains poorly understood. To elucidate this key mechanism, here we focus on how light regulates transcription of the zebrafish <italic>period2</italic> (<italic>per2</italic>) gene. Using transgenic fish and stably transfected cell line&#x02013;based assays, we define a Light Responsive Module (LRM) within the <italic>per2</italic> promoter. The LRM lies proximal to the transcription start site and is both necessary and sufficient for light-driven gene expression and also for a light-dependent circadian clock regulation. Curiously, the LRM sequence is strongly conserved in other vertebrate <italic>per2</italic> genes, even in species lacking directly light-sensitive peripheral clocks. Furthermore, we reveal that the human LRM can substitute for the zebrafish LRM to confer light-regulated transcription in zebrafish cells. The LRM contains E- and D-box elements that are critical for its function. While the E-box directs circadian clock regulation by mediating BMAL/CLOCK activity, the D-box confers light-driven expression. The zebrafish homolog of the thyrotroph embryonic factor binds efficiently to the LRM D-box and transactivates expression. We demonstrate that <italic>tef</italic> mRNA levels are light inducible and that knock-down of <italic>tef</italic> expression attenuates light-driven transcription from the <italic>per2</italic> promoter in vivo. Together, our results support a model where a light-dependent crosstalk between E- and D-box binding factors is a central determinant of <italic>per2</italic> expression. These findings extend the general understanding of the mechanism whereby the clock is entrained by light and how the regulation of clock gene expression by light has evolved in vertebrates.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Light is the principal signal used by animals to synchronize their circadian clocks with the day/night environment. Central to this vital property is the ability of light to trigger changes in gene expression. However, we still lack a complete understanding of how this occurs. The zebrafish is particularly interesting in this regard since direct light exposure induces the expression of clock genes in most of its tissues and in turn adjusts the phase of the intrinsic clocks. Here, by studying the promoter of one key light-regulated zebrafish clock gene, <italic>per2</italic>, we have identified a Light Responsive Module (LRM) that is necessary and sufficient for light controlled expression. Interestingly, the LRM is also highly conserved in the <italic>per2</italic> genes of other vertebrates that lack widespread light-sensing tissues. In addition, the human LRM can substitute for its zebrafish counterpart to confer direct light regulation of gene expression in zebrafish cells. The LRM contains E- and D-box enhancers critical for its function. While the E-box is a target of clock regulation, the D-box directs light driven expression. We show that the expression of the D-box binding transcription factor, <italic>tef</italic>, is itself induced by light and is essential for normal light-induced <italic>per2</italic> expression. These results advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying entrainment by light and how light-regulated clock gene expression has evolved in vertebrates.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Essentially all organisms demonstrate daily rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behaviour that are controlled by the circadian clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000223-Dunlap1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

The principal external cue that entrains circadian rhythmicity is light <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000223-Sancar1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In mammals, photic signals from the eyes are communicated via the retino-hypothalamic tract (RHT) to the master circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and thereby they synchronize rhythmic neuronal activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000223-Dunlap1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The SCN in turn coordinates an array of peripheral oscillators, hence driving a diversity of rhythmic processes such as locomotor activity, metabolism, and hormonal secretion. One extensively studied SCN-driven process is the rhythmic production of melatonin in the pineal gland. Via a multisynaptic pathway, SCN neurons stimulate the production of melatonin at night by activating cAMP production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000223-Takahashi1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In non-mammalian vertebrates, the circadian timing system appears to perceive light through a more distributed photoreceptive system. Thus, outside of the retina, dedicated photoreceptors are also encountered in the pineal gland, the parietal eye, as well as deep brain structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000223-Falcon1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The pineal gland of non-mammalian vertebrates contains a photoreceptive circadian oscillator that directly drives rhythmic melatonin production. Consequently, cultured pineal glands are capable of autonomously generating a melatonin rhythm that can be entrained by light <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000223-Falcon1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000223-Falcon2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

An important step towards exploring the mechanisms whereby light regulates expression of this gene is to isolate and characterize its promoter. A genomic fragment incorporating the putative promoter (1.8 kb 5&#x02032; flanking genomic DNA) and the first exon (164 bp) of <italic>per2</italic> was subcloned upstream of an EGFP reporter gene creating the &#x02212;<italic>1.8per2:EGFP</italic> construct.

Our in vivo analyses have defined the minimal <italic>per2</italic> promoter fragment that is light induced both in transgenic embryos and also in cell lines.

An LRM within the promoter was identified and shown to be both necessary and sufficient for light-induced expression and clock regulation. We show that the zebrafish LRM is evolutionarily conserved and indeed can be functionally replaced by the LRM from the human <italic>per2</italic> gene. Our mutational analyses indicate that adjacent D-box and E-box elements underlie the LRM function. We demonstrate that the D-box contributes to light-driven transcriptional control while the E-box mediates circadian clock control.

Moreover, a circadian rhythm of expression is also observed under LL. Clues as to the origin of this clock-regulated expression come from our studies of the regulation by the individual E- and D-box elements. Both elements direct a circadian rhythm of expression under LL conditions.

In the mouse and chicken models, the elements that mediate these activities are located outside of the conserved LRM and also separated from each other in terms of linear DNA sequence. Thus, the E-box is situated in the proximal promoter region of the mouse <italic>per2</italic> gene, and the identified D-box is situated in a distal promoter region and first intron of the chicken and mouse <italic>per2</italic> genes, respectively. The presence of E-box and D-box sequences within the conserved LRM was mentioned in the mouse and chicken studies, but this D-box was not shown to bind E4BP4.</p><p>Importantly, the findings of the chicken and mouse studies concern the effects of light perceived by dedicated photoreceptor cells and then relayed indirectly to responsive cells. However, the findings of the current study reveal the effects of direct exposure of cells to light, made possible by the use of zebrafish cell lines. Although the experimental systems that were used in the chicken and mouse studies failed to assign functionality to the LRM and its constituting elements, the remarkable evolutionary conservation of the LRM and the fact that the human LRM sequence functioned as a light-regulated enhancer in the context of the zebrafish cells suggests that mammalian LRMs may well also play an important regulatory role in entrainment. Alternatively, during evolution, ancestral light-responsive mechanisms may have been subverted to respond to signals other than light. It would therefore be interesting to determine whether TEF binds the D-box in LRMs of chicken and mice. Our data demonstrate that proximally spaced D- and E-boxes are sufficient to confer the light- and clock-regulated expression pattern as shown by the <italic>per2</italic> promoter. This expression pattern represents a combination of the regulation exerted by the two separate enhancers. It is likely that the E-box confers the anticipatory rise in expression prior to &#x0201c;lights on&#x0201d; and the decline in expression prior to &#x0201c;lights off&#x0201d; under LD conditions and the low amplitude cycle observed during the first few cycles after transfer to LL. The D-box confers the strong up-regulation of expression after &#x0201c;lights on&#x0201d; and the rapid attenuation of expression in DD conditions as well as contributing to rhythmic expression under LL conditions. We thus propose the following model for the LRM function and regulation by the E-box and D-box binding factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000223-g016">Figure 16</xref>). Interaction between the E- and D-box enhancer elements confers a hierarchic control in which light enables circadian clock regulation. The D-box represents the binding site for a family of bZIP transcription factors; the current results implicate the light-inducible D-box-binding factor TEF as a key player in activating <italic>per2</italic> expression. Thus in the proposed model, at the onset of the day, light exposure activates TEF and thereby results in a D-box-mediated transcriptional activation of <italic>per2</italic>. D-box regulatory factors in turn interact with the CLOCK/BMAL heterodimer through the proximal E-box. The clock-driven daily changes in CLOCK/BMAL transcriptional activation contribute to the elevation of <italic>per2</italic> mRNA levels in the beginning of the light phase and result in the anticipatory reduction of <italic>per2</italic> during the light phase. Clock-regulated changes in <italic>tef</italic> gene expression may further contribute to the rhythms of <italic>per2</italic> expression observed under LD and LL conditions. Importantly, previous results have demonstrated that upon blocking of de novo protein synthesis, <italic>per2</italic> light-induced expression persists although with a delay in the arrival at peak expression levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000223-Hirayama1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000223-Santoriello1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. This is consistent with TEF already being expressed in the cell prior to light exposure and that light may also serve to activate TEF via post-translational mechanisms.</p><fig id="pbio-1000223-g016" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000223.g016</object-id><label>Figure 16</label><caption><title>Light and clock-directed regulation of the LRM.</title><p>A model is proposed where the <italic>per2</italic> LRM E- and D-boxes represent a convergence point for both clock and light-driven transcription control mechanisms. The core clock mechanism regulates the E-box enhancer (E) via CLOCK (Clk) and BMAL (Bml) heterodimer, while light exposure predominantly drives expression from the D-box by regulation of the D-box binding factor, TEF. In addition to resetting the phase of the clock mechanism (block arrow), light exposure induces transcription via TEF in two possible ways. In one mechanism, light exposure triggers post-translational modification of existing TEF protein. In another mechanism, light induces the <italic>de novo</italic> expression of the <italic>tef</italic> gene that in turn contributes to an increase in transcriptional activation by the D-box. Interaction between the E- and D-box binding factors ultimately defines the precise kinetics of light-regulated <italic>per2</italic> expression.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.1000223.g016"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>A General Mechanism for Light-Regulated Gene Expression in Zebrafish?</title><p>In the intact animal, <italic>per2</italic> expression increases ubiquitously following light exposure and is mainly enhanced in the pineal gland. Furthermore, <italic>tef</italic> mRNA appears to be widely expressed with high levels in the pineal gland, where its light-induced expression slightly precedes that of <italic>per2</italic>. The proposed mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000223-g016">Figure 16</xref>) that is based on experiments in cell lines that represent peripheral clock-containing tissues may therefore be applicable to the increased ubiquitous expression. The enhanced expression in the pineal gland is in accordance with the fact that it constitutes a dedicated photoreceptive organ and a central clock tissue in fish. The relevance of the proposed mechanism to light entrainment of the central clock in the pineal gland remains to be determined.</p><p>Several other genes have been shown to be light inducible in zebrafish cells and tissues. These include the clock gene <italic>cry1a</italic>, suggesting that light may entrain the circadian clock mechanism by regulating the transcription of multiple clock gene elements. Interestingly however, unlike the case of <italic>per2</italic>, treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, completely abolishes light-induced <italic>cry1a</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000223-Hirayama1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. This result implies that there may be more than one mechanism whereby light regulates gene expression. Other non-clock-related genes such as <italic>6-4 DNA photolyase</italic> have also been demonstrated to be inducible by acute exposure of zebrafish cells to light <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000223-Tamai1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. The induction of genes involved in the repair of UV damaged DNA by visible wavelengths of light seems likely to represent part of an adaptive strategy to optimize the cellular response of DNA damage repair during exposure to sunlight when it is most needed. It will therefore be fascinating to determine whether the LRM sequences or even D-box elements also play a more general role in light-dependent changes in zebrafish cell physiology.</p><p>In summary, our study has revealed a novel mechanism that combines light-induced and clock-regulated transcriptional control. The proposed mechanism may lead to a better understanding of the phenomenon of gated light entrainment of the circadian clock and possibly other general photic cellular responses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fish Maintenance</title><p>Adult zebrafish were raised in a recirculation water system under 12 : 12 h LD cycles at 28&#x000b0;C and fed twice a day.
