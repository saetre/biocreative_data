We describe a strategy for the generation of cko targeting plasmids by employing two successive Mu transposition reactions to introduce a loxP site on one side of the exon of interest and a marker gene flanked by loxP sites and FRT sites on the other side of that exon. Initially, we constructed a universal cloning vector (pHTH22) suitable for essentially any cko project in mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004341-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). For negative selection in mouse ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-Hogan1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, it contains the HSV TK gene flanked by the mouse PGK promoter and terminator. For cloning and linearization, it contains an array of unique restriction sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004341-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), including several 8-cutter sites, and a homing endonuclease site (PI-SceI). We also constructed two selectable marker-containing mini-Mu transposons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004341-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The first transposon, Kan/Neo-loxP-Mu, contains a bacterial promoter, the SV40 early promoter, the Kan/Neo resistance-encoding gene from Tn<italic>5</italic>, and the polyadenylation signal from HSV TK gene. This resistance cassette is flanked by two loxP direct repeats and embedded between two 50-bp inverted repeat Mu R-end sequences. The second transposon, Kan/Neo-loxP-FRT-Mu, contains two additional FRT sites as direct repeats. The functionality of the transposons, particularly Mu R-ends, was confirmed by <italic>in vitro</italic> transposition into an external target plasmid (data not shown). The functionality of the Cre/loxP and Flp/FRT recombination systems was tested by introducing appropriate transposon-containing plasmids into <italic>E. coli</italic> strains expressing Cre or Flp recombinase.

As the initial transposition reaction target DNA, we used a KpnI digest of the identified BAC clone (110 kb), which contained the exon 3 of the mouse <italic>Cdh22</italic> gene in a 9 kb fragment. As the donor DNA, we used Kan/Neo-loxP-Mu transposon, containing the selectable Kan/Neo gene cassette between two loxP sites. Using selection for ampicillin and kanamycin resistance, transposition reaction products were cloned into the targeting vector as a pool, generating a plasmid library of &#x0223c;3,100 Amp<sup>R</sup>/Kan<sup>R</sup> clones. We pooled 300 transformant clones in six pools, each containing 50 colonies, isolated plasmid DNA from these pooled samples, and screened the DNA by PCR for suitably located transposon insertions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004341-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Three of these pools produced a prominent PCR product, the length of which fell within the desired size range (100&#x02013;1,000 bp). Original clones from these three pools were then analyzed individually by colony PCR. Three clones, one from each pool, generated a PCR product that matched in size those products observed with pooled samples, indicating the presence of the transposon in the vicinity of the exon 3 in these three clones.</p><fig id="pone-0004341-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004341.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Flowchart for the construction of conditional knockout vectors.</title><p>Part A.

(iii) The fragment pool is subsequently ligated into a suitable vector plasmid, and those clones that include transposon-containing BAC fragments are selected using both the transposon marker and vector marker. Next, (iv) a plasmid clone that contains a transposon insertion in a desired location is identified by a PCR screen with appropriate primers, one transposon specific and the other target specific.

Site-specific recombination <italic>in vivo</italic> removed the selection cassette, leaving behind the Mu R-ends and one loxP site; and this was confirmed by sequencing. Sequencing also identified the exact location of the insertion in the selected three plasmid clones: 211, 368, and 462 bp upstream from the exon 3.</p><p>Next, the second transposon, Kan/Neo-loxP-FRT-Mu, with two additional FRT sites (&#x0201c;floxed&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;flrted&#x0201d; Kan/Neo gene cassette) was integrated <italic>in vitro</italic> into the construct that contained remnants of the first transposon 368 bp from the exon 3. In this case, we first assembled DNA transposition complexes by incubating the transposon with MuA transposase and then included the target DNA, followed by the addition of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions. The assembly of Mu transposition complexes is a slow process when compared to target capture and strand transfer steps of transposition. Thus, the use of pre-assembled complexes with a short incubation time thereafter prevents the target DNA from acting as a transposon, a formal possibility, as the target plasmid contains two Mu R-ends left over from the first integrated transposon. Transposition reaction products were then electroporated into <italic>E. coli</italic> DH10B cells, and proper clones were selected on plates containing ampicillin and kanamycin. We screened 80 transformants by colony PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004341-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), and six of the clones apparently contained a suitably located transposon, as indicated by a PCR product of appropriate size.

In the initial transposition reaction, we used an NsiI restriction digest of the BAC clone containing exons 2 and 3 as the target DNA, and Kan/Neo-loxP-Mu transposon as the donor. The desired NsiI fragment was 15.1 kb in length, containing the exons 2 and 3 with an intervening 2.8 kb intron and 5.2 kb upstream and 6.6 kb downstream regions. The reaction products were cloned into the targeting vector as a pool, generating a plasmid library of &#x0223c;6,700 Amp<sup>R</sup>/Kan<sup>R</sup> transformants. The library was divided into forty pools (&#x0223c;170 colonies per pool), and these pools were screened by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004341-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In this case, two of the pools generated a PCR product of appropriate size. Next, individual clones from one of the identified pools were analyzed by colony PCR for the respective transposon integration. A proper candidate clone was found; sequencing verified the transposon orientation and confirmed its location 1,220 bp upstream from the exon 2. Most of the transposon was again removed in the Cre-expressing <italic>E. coli</italic> strain. Next, the other transposon, Kan/Neo-loxP-FRT-Mu, was introduced by <italic>in vitro</italic> transposition as described for <italic>Cdh22</italic>. A total of 150 transformants were analyzed for PCR products as pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004341-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), each pool containing ten transformants, and one of the pools generated a PCR product of appropriate size.

To validate the methodology, we used the strategy to construct targeting vectors for <italic>Cdh22</italic> and <italic>Drapc1</italic> genes. These vectors were used for gene targeting in mouse ES cells, and the resulting conditional alleles were transmitted through the germ line.</p><p>The strategy includes a cloning vector with several desirable characteristics. For the selection against random integration in mouse ES cells, it contains the HSV TK gene. The array of multiple restriction endonuclease sites provides versatile possibilities for the choice of the genomic restriction fragments utilized and for the final linearization procedure prior to the delivery into ES cells. In addition, a homing endonuclease site is included for the linearization, and it can be used if none of the restriction enzyme sites is acceptable for that. The multicopy nature of the vector ensures a convenient plasmid production.</p><p>The strategy also includes two transposons, both of which contain the antibiotic-resistance cassette (Kan/Neo), selectable both in bacteria and mammalian cells and removable by Cre recombination. One of the transposons also contains a pair of FRT sites, enabling the excision of the resistance cassette by Flp-mediated recombination. Since the first report of the phage Cre/loxP system functioning in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-Sauer1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, both the Cre/loxP system and later the yeast Flp/FRT system have been shown to be effective in removing selectable markers in several types of mouse cells, including ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-Lakso1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-Rodrguez1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. As the presence of a selectable marker within the modified locus can potentially influence the expression of the targeted gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-Meyers1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-Nagy1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, a marker removal system is essential in any gene targeting strategy. In the described system, the most straightforward option to remove the positive selection cassette is the utilization of Flp recombination, as only two FRT sites are present in the modified locus. Although Cre recombination may also be used for the marker removal, the presence of three loxP sites necessitates a somewhat more meticulous screening phase. A marker removal in this system leaves behind a DNA segment that contains a pair of 50 bp Mu R-end sequences as an inverted repeat and an intervening sequence of 67 bp (Kan/Neo-loxP-Mu) or &#x0223c;120 bp (Kan/Neo-loxP-FRT-Mu) including the recombination signal(s). As these segments are relatively short, and they do not contain detectable splicing signals or polyadenylation sites, their presence in an intron is expected to have no or negligible effects on the level of gene expression from the modified loci. However, a degree of caution with this respect is warranted, as unpredictable locus-specific differences may possibly exist. We have shown that the marker-removed configurations are stable in plasmids, as no secondary rearrangements were observed in those plasmids that were isolated from recombinase-expressing <italic>E. coli</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004341-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We have also shown that Cre-recombined alleles are stable in the mouse, as clear signals of stable loci were seen in the Southern analyses of the deletion allele mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004341-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004341-g008">8</xref>). Given that Flp-recombined configurations are stable in plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004341-g004">Figure 4</xref>), and because the respective alleles in mice would be very similar to those rearranged by Cre, we believe that Flp-recombined alleles are stable in mice, although this has not been verified experimentally.</p><p>In general, the use of DNA transposition strategies alleviates the requirement of finding appropriate restriction sites close to an exon of interest. In addition, with transposon strategies several constructions aimed at targeting different exons can be generated simultaneously. In Mu transposition, the target DNA sites are selected with a low stringency of sequence specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-HaapaPaananen1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, yielding essentially random distribution of integrations along longer regions of DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-Haapa1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-Haapa2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Accordingly, the target site selection of Mu transposition is optimally suited for the purpose established in this study.</p><p>In contrast to several published transposon protocols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-Liu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-Zhang2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-Aoyama1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, the manipulation in our strategy is initiated directly from a BAC clone, and no prior subcloning of a particular restriction fragment is needed. During the transposon-assisted cloning step, a convenient double selection for the transposon (Kan<sup>R</sup>) and vector (Amp<sup>R</sup>) markers ensures that all cloned fragments surely contain the transposon. The probability of obtaining plasmid clones with two or more transposon insertions is very low because, in the reaction conditions used, most of the target DNA fragments do not experience even a single transposon integration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-Haapa1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-Haapa2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, because double integrations would be detrimental to the strategy, appropriate restriction analysis, or preferably sequencing with transposon-specific outwards-reading primers, should be used to ensure single-copy transposon integration. As illustrated in our study, sequencing also indicates the exact site of the transposon integration.</p><p>Following the initial transposon-assisted cloning step, the most convenient means to identify transposon-containing recombinant clones for further manipulation is arguably the use of PCR-based screening with sample pooling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-Zwaal1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-Koes1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Even in cases where the exon of interest resides in a sizeable restriction fragment, a suitable clone can be identified with a reasonable effort. In this study the targeted exon of the <italic>Cdh22</italic> gene was in a 9 kb KpnI fragment, a medium size fragment among those produced by the respective BAC clone. In this case, the screening of 300 colonies identified three suitable clones for further manipulation. In the <italic>Drapc1</italic> BAC clone, the two exons of interest were resident in a 15.1 kb NsiI fragment, which is one of the largest NsiI fragments of this BAC, generating a more challenging test case for the utility of the strategy. Even with this large fragment, two potentially suitable integrant clones were identified among 6,700 colonies with relative ease by the use of 40 pooled samples in the initial screening phase. Thus, it is straightforward to obtain desired transposon-containing recombinant plasmids with genomic inserts of 10&#x02013;15 kb, a size range typically used for standard gene targeting projects. As a last step during the screening phase, we successfully used colony PCR, and this method proved to be highly effective and fast in identifying the final targeting constructions. The size range of PCR products that would identify a suitably located transposon is critically dependent on the resolution of the gel used and the performance of the DNA polymerase applied. In our study, PCR products ranging in size from 285 bp to 1,934 bp identified suitably located transposons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004341-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Our strategy complements other targeting vector construction methods and offers certain key advantages: <bold>(1)</bold> The cloning vector and two transposons are generally usable and can be applied to modify any mouse gene. <bold>(2)</bold> No prior subcloning of BAC clone fragments or PCR amplification of marker cassettes flanked by homology regions is needed. <bold>(3)</bold> The first transposon can be integrated in one reaction into different locations over the entire length of the BAC clone, yielding a variety of possibilities for the choice of the targeted exon. <bold>(4)</bold> Both positive and negative selection markers are included. <bold>(5)</bold> Only one protein, MuA transposase, is needed. <bold>(6)</bold> Both loxP and FRT sites are present in the final gene targeting construct, allowing versatile possibilities for the gene modification in a variety of tissues and/or during different developmental stages.</p><p>Recently, two groups have applied transposon techniques for gene-targeting vector construction. Zhang <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-Zhang2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> used mini-Mu transposons, and Aoyama <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-Aoyama1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> used a combination of two transposons, Tn<italic>5</italic> and Tn<italic>7</italic>. Many features in these two strategies do share similarities with our strategy. However, important differences also exist. For example, in the abovementioned two strategies, the modified gene region is initially subcloned into a plasmid vector. Negative selection was not employed in the Mu methodology, and two different transposon systems were used in the Tn<italic>5</italic>/Tn<italic>7</italic> methodology.</p><p>One of the advantages in our strategy, avoiding laborious initial cloning steps in gene-targeting vector construction, has been achieved also with recombineering, i.e. the use of homologous recombination in <italic>E. coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-Muyrers1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. This method has been used to introduce loxP and FRT sites, and selection markers into genomic DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-Liu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Compared to transposon strategies, because of the PCR amplification step to insert homology regions, recombineering requires relatively long specific primers for each individual targeting construct. However, the advantage is that each particular locus can be modified very accurately as desired.</p><p>We have developed a fast and efficient Mu <italic>in vitro</italic> transposition-based procedure to construct targeting vectors directly from BAC clones without the need for prior subcloning. A general-purpose cloning vector and two custom-designed transposons provide a tool set for any conditional knockout project in mouse. The data indicate that the strategy described here is an easy, efficient, and versatile method for generating conditional knockout alleles. Furthermore, the procedure should be readily suitable for high-throughput targeting vector production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All the experiments involving animals were approved by the committee of experimental animal research of the University of Helsinki.</p><sec id="s4a1"><title>DNA techniques</title><p>Standard enzymes for DNA work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-Sambrook1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> were from New England Biolabs.

Reaction was carried out for 4 h at 30&#x000b0;C. The resulting transposon-containing fragment pool, purified by phenol and chloroform extractions and ethanol precipitation, was ligated to 4 &#x000b5;g of the plasmid pHTH22 linearized with the same enzyme as was used for the initial BAC digestion. The ligation mixture was purified by phenol and chloroform extractions and ethanol precipitation, and dissolved in 20 &#x000b5;l of water. Several aliquots (4 &#x000b5;l) were electroporated into electrocompetent DH10B cells (50 &#x000b5;l) prepared as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-Haapa1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> using Genepulser II (Bio-Rad) and 0.2 cm electrode spacing cuvettes (Bio-Rad) as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-Haapa1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Insert-containing plasmid clones were selected on LB/ampicillin/kanamycin plates and screened by colony PCR for the presence of the transposon in the desired DNA region using a pair of appropriate primers, one transposon-specific and one locus-specific. The exact location of each identified transposon was confirmed by initial restriction analysis and subsequent sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4a5"><title>Removal of Kan/Neo selection marker</title><p>The selected plasmid was electroporated into strain 294-Cre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004341-Buchholz1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> for <italic>in vivo</italic> recombination, after which the plasmid was reisolated; recombination between the two loxP sites was confirmed by restriction analysis and sequencing.

Note! PCR-based DNA sequencing strategies may not yield sequencing reads across two Mu ends in inverse relative orientation, possibly due to intramolecular hybridization problems. Good quality reads can be obtained by linearizing the DNA between Mu ends prior to sequencing reactions (e.g. using EcoRI or XbaI).</p></sec><sec id="s4a6"><title>Introduction of Kan/Neo-loxP-FRT-Mu</title><p>Mu transposition complexes were initially assembled at 30&#x000b0;C in a 20 &#x000b5;l reaction volume for 2 h.

The resulting complexes (1 &#x000b5;l) were added to the mixture (18 &#x000b5;l), containing 0.55 pmol plasmid DNA as a target, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 110 mM NaCl, 0.05&#x00025; Triton X-100 (w/v), 10&#x00025; glycerol, and incubated for 5 min at 30&#x000b0;C to allow target capture. MgCl<sub>2</sub> (1 &#x000b5;l) was then added to the final concentration of 10 mM and incubation was continued for 2 min in a total volume of 20 &#x000b5;l. The transposition reaction mixture was electroporated into <italic>E. coli</italic> DH10B electrocompetent cells, and transposon-containing clones were selected on LB/ampicillin/kanamycin plates and screened by colony PCR.
