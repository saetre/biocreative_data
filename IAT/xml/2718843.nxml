The most common genetic route to resistance involves sequence changes in the gp120 V3 region, a pathway followed when the primary isolate CC1/85 was cultured with the AD101 inhibitor <italic>in vitro</italic>, creating the CC101.19 resistant variant. However, the D1/86.16 escape mutant contains no V3 changes but has three substitutions in the gp41 fusion peptide. By using CCR5 point-mutants and gp120-targeting agents, we have investigated how infectious clonal viruses derived from the parental and both resistant isolates interact with CCR5. We conclude that the V3 sequence changes in CC101.19 cl.7 create a virus with an increased dependency on interactions with the CCR5 N-terminus. Elements of the CCR5 binding site associated with the V3 region and the CD4-induced (CD4i) epitope cluster in the gp120 bridging sheet are more exposed on the native Env complex of CC101.19 cl.7, which is sensitive to neutralization via these epitopes. However, D1/86.16 cl.23 does not have an increased dependency on the CCR5 N-terminus, and its CCR5 binding site has not become more exposed. How this virus interacts with the inhibitor-CCR5 complex remains to be understood.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the causative agent of AIDS. HIV-1 entry into target cells is triggered by the interaction of the viral envelope glycoproteins with a cell-surface receptor (CD4) and a co-receptor (CCR5), and culminates in fusion of the viral and cell membranes. Small molecule inhibitors that bind to CCR5 are a new class of drug for treating HIV-1-infected people. However, HIV-1 can evolve ways to become resistant to these compounds, by acquiring mutations that alter how its envelope glycoproteins (gp120-gp41) interact with CCR5. In this study, we investigated how two resistant viruses gained the ability to use the inhibitor-bound form of CCR5 through two different mechanisms. In the first virus, four amino acid substitutions in the V3 region of gp120 created an increased dependency on interactions with the CCR5 N-terminus. These changes altered the configuration of gp120, increasing the exposure of antibody epitopes in the V3 region and the CD4i epitope cluster associated with the CCR5 binding site. In contrast, the second virus, which became resistant via three sequence changes in the gp41 subunit, did not become more dependent on the CCR5 N-terminus and remained resistant to neutralization by antibodies against elements of the CCR5 binding site.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Small molecule drugs or drug candidates bind to the cell surface CCR5 protein and prevent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) from using it as a coreceptor for entry into CD4-positive target cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Kuhmann1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Ray1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. These compounds, which include the licensed drug maraviroc (MVC) and the clinical candidate vicriviroc (VVC, also known as SCH-D), bind within the transmembrane helices of CCR5 and stabilize the protein in a conformation that cannot be recognized efficiently by the HIV-1 gp120 surface glycoprotein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Kondru1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Watson1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The interaction between gp120 and CCR5 is considered to involve two structural elements. The CCR5 N-terminus (NT) interacts with a site on gp120 that involves the 4-stranded bridging sheet region and the base of V3, which assembles upon CD4 binding, while the second extracellular loop (ECL-2) of CCR5 interacts with a second region of V3 located near its tip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Cormier1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Rizzuto1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Viruses resistant to the small molecule CCR5 inhibitors can be generated <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Tsibris1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;. The dominant route to resistance involves the acquisition of sequence changes that render gp120 capable of recognizing the inhibitor-CCR5 complex, without losing its ability to also interact with the free coreceptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Westby1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Pugach1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence the escape mutants become inhibitor-tolerant, but not inhibitor-dependent. The most common genetic route to resistance is the acquisition of multiple sequence changes in V3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Tsibris1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Westby1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Baba1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Ogert1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. This pathway was followed when the primary R5 isolate CC1/85 was cultured with the AD101 inhibitor <italic>in vitro</italic>, creating the CC101.19 resistant variant. However, we have described a V3-independent route to the same phenotype that was taken by the same input virus under the selection pressure of a similar compound, VVC, to yield the D1/86.16 escape mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Marozsan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Anastassopoulou1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. We have recently shown that this alternative pathway involves three sequence changes in the fusion peptide (FP) region of the gp41 transmembrane glycoprotein. These changes exert broadly similar effects to the more conventional V3 changes, in that the resistant virus was able to use the inhibitor-CCR5 complex for entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Anastassopoulou1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>By using CCR5 point-mutants and gp120-targeting agents, we now seek to learn more about how the parental and both resistant viruses interact with the coreceptor. A small molecule that interacts with gp120 at the V3 region, IC9564, had differential activities against the various viruses, as did monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and polyclonal Abs directed against the V3 region and MAbs to the CD4-induced epitopes associated with CCR5 binding. We conclude that the V3 sequence changes in CC101.19 create a variant that is more dependent than its parent on interactions with the CCR5 NT. Elements of the CCR5 binding site associated with the V3 region and the CD4i epitope cluster in the bridging sheet have become more exposed on the native Env complex of this virus, and hence accessible to neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). However, the D1/86.16 variant with changes in the gp41 FP has followed a different pathway to resistance that does not involve an increased dependency on the CCR5 NT, and in which the CCR5 binding site has not become more exposed. How this virus interacts with the inhibitor-CCR5 complex therefore remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Differential usage of CCR5 mutants by parental and escape mutant viruses</title><p>Isolates CC101.19 and D1/85.16 are resistant variants derived from the primary R5 isolate CC1/85 after selection with the small molecule CCR5 inhibitors AD101 and VVC, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Marozsan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Kuhmann2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. As the emphasis of the present study was to gain a better understanding of how resistant variants interact with CCR5, we used infectious, Env-chimeric clonal viruses CC101.19 cl.7 and D1/85.16 cl.23, derived from the above resistant isolates, and compared their properties with inhibitor-sensitive clones of the parental isolate, CC1/85. A multiple sequence alignment based on the Env amino-acid sequences of seven parental clones derived from the CC1/85 isolate shows that CC1/85 cl.7 and CC1/85 cl.6 were the most similar to CC101.19 cl.7 and D1/85.16 cl.23, respectively (data not shown). For simplicity, we have summarized these results in a tree based on the percent similarity between the four clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000548-g001">Fig. 1A,B</xref>). The majority of the amino-acid differences between the two pairs of viral clones are in the V4 and V5 regions of gp120. Taking into account also the replication properties of the various parental clones, we chose to use CC1/85 cl.7 for comparisons with CC101.19 cl.7, and CC1/85 cl.6 as a comparator for D1/85.16 cl.23. Clones CC101.19 cl.7 and D1/85.16 cl.23 contain amino acid changes that have been shown to be necessary and sufficient to confer resistance to small molecule CCR5 inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Kuhmann2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Anastassopoulou1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

Similarly, the parental clones CC1/85 cl.7 and CC1/86 cl.6 were each completely inhibited by VVC concentrations &#x02265;10 nM (10-fold lower then that needed for complete inhibition of the isolate). In contrast, replication of the resistant clones in PBMCs was either modestly enhanced (for CC101.19 cl.7) or unaffected (for D1/85.16 cl.23) by VVC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000548-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).

The CCR5 mutants were all expressed at comparable levels on the cell surface as determined by FACS (data not shown). The relative level of entry via each mutant, compared to wild-type CCR5, was calculated for each test virus, to identify coreceptor variants that were used with different efficiency under the conditions of this single-cycle assay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000548-t001">Table 1</xref>). As expected, none of the Env-pseudotyped viruses could use the &#x00394;18 mutant that lacked the first 18 residues of the CCR5 NT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Farzan1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Platt1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The tyrosine residues at NT positions 10 and 14 are sulfated, a modification known to be important for HIV-1 entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Farzan2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Farzan3">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Accordingly, none of the viruses utilised the Y10A/Y14A double mutant efficiently, although D1/85.16 cl.23 was able to use it for low-level entry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000548-t001">Table 1</xref>). Three other mutations adversely affected entry of all four viruses to a meaningful extent (&#x0003c;50&#x00025; entry compared to wild-type): D11A in the NT, C178A and F189A in ECL2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000548-t001">Table 1</xref>). This outcome is consistent with previous studies on the same mutants with different test viruses, and arises because these residues (particularly D11 and C178) are important for maintaining the appropriate CCR5 conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Genoud1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Dragic3">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. The entry of various viruses via certain other mutants was reduced to a lesser extent (25&#x02013;50&#x00025;). Such reductions may be biologically relevant but can be difficult to distinguish from background variation with confidence.</p><p>Several mutations differentially affected entry of the four Env-pseudotyped viruses. Thus, CC101.19 cl.7 was particularly affected by NT mutations Y10A, Y14A, Y14F, Y14Q and C20A (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000548-t001">Table 1</xref>); depending on the mutation, the entry of this virus was reduced to &#x02264;26&#x00025; of the extent conferred by wild-type CCR5. The identity of the substituted residue at position 14 was an additional variable; more specifically, CC101.19 cl.7 could use the Y14Q mutant with low efficiency (&#x0223c;20&#x00025;), but not Y14A or Y14F (&#x0003c;1&#x00025; entry). In contrast, D1/85.16 cl.23 could enter via all three of the residue-14 mutants at &#x0003e;70&#x00025; of the level mediated by wild-type CCR5; indeed, this escape mutant and its parent, CC1/85 cl.6, were little affected by the identity of the residue at position 14 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000548-t001">Table 1</xref>). These observations, taken together, suggest that the tyrosine residues at positions 10 and 14 were both required for efficient entry of CC101.19 cl.7, whereas the presence of either sulfated-tyrosine was sufficient to mediate entry of the other three viruses to at least some extent. Conversely, the ECL2 mutations F182A and P183A impaired entry of both resistant viruses a little more than they did the two parental clones, while the Y187A and F193A changes selectively, although modestly, affected entry of D1/85.16 cl.23 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000548-t001">Table 1</xref>). The triple Ala mutants with changes at residues 184&#x02013;186 and 187&#x02013;189 were, however, used by all four viruses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000548-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the pattern of entry via the various CCR5 mutants suggests that the two resistant viruses differ markedly in how they interact with the coreceptor. Thus, CC101.19 cl.7 is particularly reliant on the sulfated tyrosine residues at positions 10 and 14 in the NT, but this is not the case for D1/85.16 cl.23. The latter virus is somewhat more affected by some substitutions within ECL2, but not dramatically so. Their differential sensitivity to CCR5 mutations suggests that the two escape mutants differ in how they interact with the coreceptor. A corollary of the increased dependence of CC101.19 cl.7 on the CCR5 NT might be that the region near the tip of V3 is now less involved in gp120-CCR5 binding, compared to both of the parental clones and D1/85.16 cl.23. If so, the 4 amino acid changes in the V3 region of CC101.19 cl.7 might be acting to change the orientation of V3 with respect to the rest of gp120, disrupting its ability to interact with ECL2 while increasing the accessibility of the bridging sheet to the NT. This argument would not apply to D1/85.16 cl.23, which has followed a different route to resistance that is less apparent from the studies using the CCR5 mutants. To gain information on what changes in Env conformation took place as resistance developed, we measured the responses of the two resistant viruses to compounds that interact with different regions of gp120.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Sensitivity to inhibitors of gp120-CD4 binding does not correlate with VVC resistance</title><p>We first used various inhibitors of the gp120-CD4 interaction to assess whether there are differences in the CD4-binding events of the VVC-sensitive and -resistant clones that could influence the subsequent conformational changes in gp120 involved in creation of the CCR5 binding site. When the four clones were incubated with a range of sCD4 concentrations before infection of PBMCs, CC1/85 cl.7 and CC101.19 cl.7 were both highly sensitive, with IC<sub>50</sub> values &#x0223c;0.1 &#x000b5;g/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000548-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000548-t002">Table 2</xref>). In contrast, D1/85.16 cl.23 was &#x0223c;100-fold less sensitive to sCD4 and CC1/85 cl.6 was almost completely resistant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000548-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000548-t002">Table 2</xref>). Of note is that CC1/85 cl.7 and CC101.19 cl.7 are unusually sensitive to sCD4, compared to the corresponding isolates (IC<sub>50</sub> values &#x0223c;5 &#x000b5;g/ml) and to typical primary isolates, which typically have IC<sub>50</sub> values &#x0003e;10 &#x000b5;g/ml <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Pugach2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Daar1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. The same data pattern was observed with CD4-IgG2 (PRO542); again CC1/85 cl.7 and CC101.19 cl.7 were much more sensitive than D1/85.16 cl.23 and all three of the isolates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000548-t002">Table 2</xref>). Hence the sCD4 and CCR5 inhibitor sensitivity profiles of these four clones are not correlated; one parental and one VVC-resistant clone are sCD4-sensitive, the other two are sCD4-resistant. In contrast to what was observed using sCD4 and CD4-IgG2, the four clones (and the corresponding isolates) did not differ markedly in their sensitivities to MAb b12 against the CD4-binding site on gp120 or to the anti-CD4 MAb RPA-T4 that inhibits gp120-CD4 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000548-g004">Fig. 4B,C</xref> and data not shown).</p><fig id="ppat-1000548-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000548.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Sensitivity of parental and VVC-resistant clones to inhibitors of the gp120-CD4 interaction.</title><p>Chimeric molecular clones CC1/85 cl.7 (squares), CC1/85 cl.6 (diamonds), CC101.19 cl.7 (triangles) and D1/85.16 cl.23 (circles) were used to infect PBMCs in the presence of the indicated concentrations of (A) sCD4, (B) MAb b12, (C) MAb RPA-T4 or (D) BMS-806.

Variation of this magnitude could directly affect the binding sites for MAbs, limiting their value as probes for V3 accessibility.

The epitopes for V3 MAbs 19b, 2.1e, 447-52D and F425-B4e8 were, however, still present on CC101.19 cl.7 gp120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000548-g008">Fig. 8</xref>).

In contrast, although the V3 MAbs 2.1e, 447-52D and F425-B4e8 did bind detectably to CC101.19 cl.7 gp120, they did so to greatly reduced extents compared to the gp120 from the other three viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000548-g008">Fig. 8B,C,D</xref>). Note that each MAb bound equally well to the gp120s from the two parental clones and D1/85.16 cl.23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000548-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). This observation is consistent with these three gp120s having isogenic V3 sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000548-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).

The increased neutralization sensitivity of CC101.19 cl.7 to 2.1e and, to a lesser extent, 447-52D, was particularly striking given the reduced binding of these MAbs to the corresponding gp120s (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000548-g008">Figs. 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000548-g009">9</xref>). Presumably, the four sequence changes must increase the exposure of the V3 region at the quaternary structural level (i.e., on the CC101.19 cl.7 virus) to an extent that is more than sufficient to overcome any locally adverse impact they may have on the epitope itself (i.e., on gp120). Of note is that the V3 peptide-binding profiles were a better neutralization predictor than the gp120-binding profiles for MAbs 2.1e, 447-52D and F425-B4e8.</p><fig id="ppat-1000548-g009" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000548.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Sensitivity of parental and VVC-resistant clones to V3 MAbs.</title><p>Chimeric molecular clones CC1/85 cl.7 (squares), CC1/85 cl.6 (diamonds), CC101.19 cl.7 (triangles) and D1/85.16 cl.23 (circles) were used to infect PBMCs in the presence of the indicated concentrations of (A) MAb 19b; (B) MAb 2.1e; (C) MAb 447-52D; (D) MAb F425-B4e8.

In template 1, V3 protrudes from the gp120 core and has three distinct structural regions: (i) a conserved base connected by a disulfide bridge. This &#x003b2;-sheet is part of a 6-stranded &#x003b2;-barrel that forms the core of the gp120 outer domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Sanders1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>; (ii) a flexible stem that extends away from the core; and (iii) a &#x003b2;-turn tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000548-g011">Fig. 11B</xref>). In template 2, the tyrosine-sulfated residues bind to the bridging sheet-V3 interface and induce a structural rearrangement in V3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000548-g011">Fig. 11B</xref>). As a result, the N- and C-terminal constituents of the V3 stem are brought into proximity to form a 2-stranded &#x003b2;-sheet that replaces the unstructured V3 stem from the first template. In addition, the V3 tip is displaced by 16 &#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000548-g011">Fig. 11B</xref>).</p><p>We then inspected where the V3 amino acid changes between CC1/85 cl.7 and CC101.19 cl.7 were located on the two templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000548-g011">Fig. 11D&#x02013;F</xref>). Two of the substitutions in CC101.19 cl.7, K305R and G321E, are on opposite strands of the &#x003b2;-sheet that is present in the gp120 complex with the tyrosine-sulfated 412d MAb (template 2) but not in the X5 complex (template 1). Both these changes increase the local propensity for forming a &#x003b2;-sheet (Gly, in particular, is accommodated poorly in &#x003b2;-sheets). Moreover, the E321 and R305 side chains in the CC101.19 cl.7 V3 protrude from the same lateral side of the &#x003b2;-sheet and are positioned close enough to form a salt-bridge that could contribute to inter-strand stability. Although the model was based on a V3 conformation derived from a CD4-bound gp120 model, it is possible that a salt bridge could form between E321 and R305, prior to gp120 engagement with CD4 or CCR5. Circular dichroism experiments suggest that a CC101.19 cl.7 V3 peptide has more secondary structure than the corresponding peptide from CC1/85 cl.7 (our unpublished observations). Moreover, and as noted previously, the H308P may facilitate a bend in the V3 structure of CC101.19 cl.7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Kuhmann2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, which may contribute to a relocation of the V3 tip and affect its ability to interact with CCR5.</p><p>Thus, the characteristics of the amino acid changes and the available structural data are consistent with a model, based on template 2, in which the CC101.19 cl.7 V3 region constitutively assumes a stabilized conformation that is compatible with binding to the Tyr-sulfated CCR5 NT. In this conformation, the V3 region is more structured, accommodating the binding of the tyrosine-sulfate moieties while at the same time displacing its V3 tip away from the CCR5 ECL2. Whether this model is valid is the subject of ongoing experimental and structural studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Mapping V3 MAb epitopes on the V3 structure</title><p>To assist the interpretation of the V3 MAb binding experiments, we mapped the epitopes for MAbs 447-52D, 2.1e, F425-B4e8 and 19b on the V3 crystal structures represented by templates 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000548-g011">Fig. 11G</xref>).

By studying how these two viruses accomplished the same task in such radically different ways, we reasoned that we might learn something useful about inter-domain interactions within the HIV-1 Env complex. For example, do changes in the fusion peptide have the same effect on Env topology as ones in the V3 region of an entirely different subunit?</p><p>We used infectious chimeric viruses and Env-pseudotyped viruses based on clones from the parental and each resistant isolate.

The phenotypic properties of these clones are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000548.s003">Table S1</xref>. A multiple sequence alignment analysis showed that the amino-acid sequence of CC1/85 cl.6 is more related to that of D1/85.16 cl.23 whereas CC1/85 cl.7 more resembles CC101.19 cl.7, although it is not possible to prove evolutionary relationships. Of note is that CC1/85 cl.7 is much more sensitive than CC1/85 cl.6 to sCD4, the V3-targeting compound IC9564 and NAbs against V3. Thus, CC1/85 cl.7 behaves more like a T-cell line-adapted virus than a primary virus in this regard. The genetic determinants of this clone's sensitivity to NAbs and CD4-targeted inhibitors must lie outside its V3 region, which is identical to those of the more resistant clones CC1/85 cl.6 and D1/85.16 cl.23.</p><p>This atypical phenotype of CC1/85 cl.7 underlies its use as a comparator virus for CC101.19 cl.7, which is also unusually sCD4-sensitive. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that this property of CC101.19 cl.7 is relevant to its VVC-resistance phenotype, we strongly suspect otherwise. Instead, we think that CC101.19 cl.7 evolved from a sCD4-sensitive parental virus that shares certain Env characteristics with CC1/85 cl.7. The parental virus for D1/85.16 cl.23 was, in contrast, probably one of the more prevalent sCD4-resistant variants that resemble CC1/85 cl.6.

The genetic determinants of the sCD4 sensitivity of CCcon.19 lay within the gp120 V2 loop: substitutions I165K and D167N, and an SN deletion at positions 188&#x02013;189 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Pugach3">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

Most of the amino acid differences between the comparator pairs (CC1/85 cl.7 vs. CC101.19 cl.7 and CC1/85 cl.6 vs. D1/85 cl.23) lie within the V4 and V5 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000548-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Of note is that the differences in sCD4 sensitivity between the various parental and resistant clones were not attributable to variation in binding of the gp120 monomer to CD4. Thus, as is usually the case, the efficiency of sCD4 neutralization is determined by the quaternary structure of the native Env complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Moore1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Sattentau1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Parren1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The BMS-806 sensitivity profiles of the parental and resistant clones (and isolates) were the inverse of those seen using sCD4, which is consistent with a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Peters1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus D1/85.16 cl.23 was simultaneously the clone most resistant to sCD4 but the most sensitive to BMS-806, and conversely for CC101.19 cl.7. However, as seen with sCD4, BMS-806 sensitivity also varied markedly between the two parental clones; CC1/85 cl.6 behaved akin to D1/85.16 cl.23 while CC1/85 cl.7 again resembled CC101.19 cl.7. Moreover, the pattern of infection-inhibition data for BMS-806 and the four clones was reflected in the outcome of a gp120-CD4 inhibition assay using the corresponding monomeric gp120s. Hence, as with sCD4 sensitivity, we do not believe the different responses of the various clones to BMS-806 are causally related to CCR5 inhibitor resistance. The increased BMS-806 sensitivity of CC1/85 cl.6 and D1/85.16 cl.23 compared to the other two clones may simply reflect how gp120 sequence variation affects BMS-806 binding, although none of the four clones contained any amino acid changes known to be associated with BMS-806 resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Madani1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The current model of how gp120 interacts with CCR5 posits that two different structural elements of each protein are involved: the tip of V3 region of gp120 binds to ECL2 of CCR5, the base and stem of V3 and the bridging sheet to the NT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Cormier1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Rizzuto1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. To allow multi-point attachment, the twin-elements of each protein must be folded into an appropriate geometry. It seems a reasonable assumption that the binding of a small molecule inhibitor alters the orientation between the ECL2 and NT regions, disrupting the multi-point binding site for gp120 and thereby impeding the gp120-CCR5 interaction. Hence the simplest hypothesis for how the resistant viruses recognize both the inhibitor-bound and &#x02013;free forms of CCR5 is that they use a single-point attachment mechanism. In other words, their Env complex interacts with either ECL2 or the NT, and does so in a way that is unaffected, or little affected, by a small molecule CCR5 inhibitor. Our experiments with CCR5 point-mutants were designed to test this hypothesis. We observed that the two escape mutants do indeed differ in their usage of ECL2 and the NT, when compared both to each other and to parental clones. Thus, CC101.19 cl.7 was highly dependent on residues in the CCR5 NT, namely Y10, Y14 and C20; in contrast, D1/85.16 cl.23 was markedly less affected by changes in the NT but was slightly more sensitive to some ECL2 substitutions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000548-t001">Table 1</xref>). It is also noteworthy that CC101.19 cl.7 and CC1/85 cl.7 were comparably sensitive to some ECL2 mutations. Overall, both resistant viruses were somewhat less tolerant of CCR5 mutations than their comparator clones, which may reflect their acquired capacity to also use the inhibitor-CCR5 complex. That constraint might reduce the robustness and promiscuity of the normally rather plastic Env-CCR5 interaction; we have hypothesized that resistant viruses preferentially use certain conformational subspecies or isoforms of both free and inhibitor-complexed CCR5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Anastassopoulou1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We next used MAbs and a small molecule that interact with the different elements of the CCR5 binding site on gp120, as additional probes of differences in the CCR5 interactions of the two resistant clones. The VVC-resistant clone CC101.19 cl.7 was markedly the most sensitive of the four clones to five different MAbs against the CD4i epitope cluster on gp120 that is an important element of the CCR5 binding site, the bridging sheet. The sensitivity of CC101.19 cl.7 to CD4i MAbs was significantly greater than its comparator parental clone CC1/85 cl.7, suggesting it was relevant to the VVC-resistance phenotype and not just a general property of this particular clonal lineage. Of note is that the binding of CD4i MAbs to the various gp120 proteins was not correlated with how the same MAbs neutralized the corresponding viruses. Hence the increased neutralization sensitivity of CC101.19 cl.7 to CD4i MAbs must be determined by the quaternary structure of the native Env trimer, not the topology of the gp120 monomer. Overall, we suggest that at least one major element of the CCR5 binding site, the CD4i epitope cluster, has become constitutively exposed on the native Env complex of CC101.19 cl.7. Alternatively, the geometry of the interaction between the mutant Env complex and the target cell surface may be one in which the normal steric constraint on the binding of CD4i NAbs has become relaxed. However, D1/85.16 cl.23 remains highly resistant to CD4i MAbs, irrespective of whether they are tyrosine-sulfated (47e, 412d, CM51 and E51) or not (48d and 17b), implying that the fusion peptide changes and the V3 changes affect Env topology differently.</p><p>The IC9564 small molecule binds to positively charged residues in the V3 stem, N-terminal to the tip. It competes with MAbs 39F and 447-52D that target the same region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Lai1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. However, IC9564 resistance is associated with amino acid changes in the bridging sheet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Yuan1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. The binding of IC9564 to V3 has been proposed to lock gp120 into a CD4-induced conformation in which CD4i epitopes become more exposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Huang3">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. We observed that CC101.19 cl.7 was the most sensitive of the four clones to IC9564, again significantly more so than the comparator parental clone, CC1/85 cl.7. Hence either the V3 binding site for IC9564 is significantly more accessible on CC101.19 cl.7 than on CC1/85 cl.7, or the interaction between the V3 region of CC101.19 cl.7 and the CCR5 NT is more vulnerable to disruption by the small molecule ligand. In comparison, D1/85.16 cl.23 and CC1/85 cl.6 were highly resistant to IC9564. Because the V3 sequences of D1/85.16 cl.23 and CC1/85 cl.7 are identical, sequence changes elsewhere in Env must underlie the &#x0223c;100-fold difference in their IC9564 sensitivities, presumably by affecting how well its V3 binding site is exposed on the Env complex.</p><p>Similar results were obtained using several MAbs to the V3 region of the four clones. Again, CC101.19 cl.7 was markedly the most sensitive virus, even compared to CC1/85 cl.7. This is particularly remarkable given that the four sequence changes in its region V3 actually reduce the binding of some of the MAbs to the corresponding gp120 monomer (and destroy the epitopes for other V3 MAbs). Taken together with the data on IC9564 sensitivity, these observations suggest that the V3 region of CC101.19 cl.7 is well exposed on the native Env complex. But, as with the CD4i epitope cluster, this is not the case with D1/85.16 cl.23; the V3 region of this clone remains sequestered, perhaps even more so than on the comparator parental clone. The increased exposure of V3 on CC101.19 cl.7 Env presumably facilitates interactions with the CCR5 NT, but a side effect is to render the virus highly sensitive to NAbs that target V3. Other studies have also shown that deletions or other radical changes in V3 disrupt the interaction between this region of gp120 and ECL2 of CCR5, and thereby render HIV-1 more dependent on the CCR5 NT for binding and entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Nolan1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Laakso1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In summary, we propose that the structural change created by the four amino acid substitutions in CC101.19 cl.7 impairs the interaction of the V3 tip with ECL-2, while promoting the binding of the V3 base and bridging sheet to the NT; the latter outcome would account for the increased dependence of CC101.19 cl.7 on sulfated tyrosine residues 10 and 14 and its enhanced sensitivity to MAbs that bind to CD4i epitopes associated with the bridging sheet. We have depicted the four sequence changes on the conformation of V3 in the context of the gp120 monomer, using structural templates that may represent the V3 structures that exist before and after binding to the tyrosine-sulfated CCR5 NT. One outcome of the model is that, in the CD4-bound form of gp120 (template 2), the K305R and G321E changes may create an inter-strand salt-bridge that stabilizes this V3 configuration in CC101.19 cl.7 Env and perhaps facilitates its interaction with the CCR5 NT. Furthermore, the H308P change introduces a kink into the V3 region that may affect the geometry of the tip and impair its ability to interact with ECL2. These suppositions are, of course, speculative pending additional structural information.</p><p>A similar substitution pattern, R305K&#x0002b;G321E, at the same V3 residues occurred when escape mutants to VVC emerged in a different viral context <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Tsibris1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The R305K change is the inverse of what happens in CC101.19 cl.7, but preserves a cationic residue at this position; the G321E substitution is identical to the one arising in CC101.19 cl.7 and introduces an anionic amino acid. Perhaps in the different genetic contexts, the two changes together create the same salt bridge and have the same effect of stabilizing a V3 conformation that is better able to interact with the CCR5 NT.</p><p>There were differences between the various V3 MAbs in how they neutralized the various clones, and in how they bound to the corresponding gp120s and V3 peptides. Of particular note is that MAb 19b bound markedly better to gp120 and the V3 peptide from CC101.19 cl.7, and neutralized the corresponding virus much more potently, compared to the other gp120s, peptide and viruses. Thus the four sequence changes that created CCR5 inhibitor resistance must have had a substantial effect on the topology of at least part of the V3 region of CC101.19 cl.7 that is apparent at the levels of both the gp120 monomer and a simple V3 peptide. MAbs 2.1e, F425-B4e8 and 447-52D, however, bound less well to CC101.19 cl.7 gp120, but still neutralized the corresponding virus more potently than the comparator clone, CC1/85 cl.7. The IC<sub>50</sub> differentials between CC101.19 cl.7 and CC1/85 cl.7 also varied from MAb to MAb, being much lower for F425-B4e8 and 447-52D than for 19b and 2.1e. Some sub-regions of V3 may therefore be more exposed than others on the CC101.19 cl.7 Env complex. Consistent with this idea, the epitopes for 19b, 2.1e, 447-52D and F425-B4e8 are located in different regions of V3. The X-ray crystal structure of the 447-52D complex with a V3 peptide shows that the side chains of six amino acid residues upstream of the GPGR turn are arranged into a &#x003b2;-hairpin and form a &#x003b2;-sheet with the side chains of a corresponding strand of the MAb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Stanfield2">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. F425-B4e8, on the other hand, interacts with the V3 crown, particularly with Arg-315 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Bell1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Of note is that F425-B4e8 was the only V3 MAb able to neutralize D1/85.16 cl.23, so perhaps the region around Arg-315 is the only part of V3 exposed on D1/85.16 cl.23, and hence accessible to F425-B4e8. Structural information is not available for 19b and 2.1e, but mutagenesis and phage display data suggest that 19b recognizes flanking region in V3 upstream to the crown while 2.1e sees elements of the crown and downstream flanking residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Patel1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Pantophlet1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Moore3">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. If our interpretation of the V3-gp120 modelling data is correct, then MAbs 19b (in particular), 447-52D and 2.1e, but not F425-B4e8, may preferentially recognize the V3 configuration that is stabilized by the salt bridge between Arg-305 and Glu-321 in CC101.19 cl.7 gp120.</p><p>The V3 region of CC101.19 cl.7 is also a neo-epitope, in that a peptide containing the four amino acid changes was immunogenic in rabbits, inducing Abs that were able to neutralize the corresponding virus via its exposed V3 region. We reported previously that both the CC101.19 and D1/85.16 isolates are more sensitive than the parental isolate to various anti-Env MAbs and sera from HIV-1 infected people, albeit usually not to a dramatic extent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Pugach2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. The present results confirm and extend those findings. Hence, variants that arise <italic>in vivo</italic> under the selection pressure of maraviroc or VCV might be more vulnerable than wild type viruses to NAbs raised against both existing and neo-epitopes on their Env complexes, particularly the V3 region. In other words, to resist the CCR5 inhibitors, HIV-1 will need to adapt in a way that also preserves its existing defences against humoral immunity. The twin constraints on the Env complex might therefore create variants with interesting and informative properties. We do not yet know, but are investigating, whether the increased exposure of V3 and other neutralization epitopes is obligatorily linked to the sCD4-sensitivity of a subset of parental clones. The parental isolate was derived from a patient with chronic HIV-1 infection in whom X4 viruses were detected a year later and has considerable quasispecies diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Connor2">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.

They are similar in that both can use the inhibitor-CCR5 complex and free CCR5 for entry, but they differ in how they do so. The four V3 sequence changes in CC101.19 cl.7 have constitutively exposed elements of the CCR5 binding site on the native Env complex of this virus, both within V3 and associated with the CD4i epitope cluster. These changes facilitate interactions of the Env complex with the tyrosine-sulfated CCR5 NT. It remains a mystery, however, how the three fusion peptide changes in D1/85.16 cl.23 render this virus CCR5 inhibitor-resistant. The V3 and bridging sheet elements are no more exposed, and perhaps even less well exposed, on D1/85.16 cl.23 than on the comparator parental clone, and there is no compelling evidence from the CCR5 mutant panel as to how the virus-coreceptor interactions differ. We note, however, that even mutations in the gp41 cytoplasmic tail can enhance interactions with CCR5, allowing the mutant virus to infect cells that express only trace amounts of the coreceptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Taylor1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>.

The CCR5-triggered conformational changes in Env that drive fusion may have different quantitative and qualitative requirements for the fusion peptide- and cytoplasmic tail-gp41 mutants, compared to wild type viruses. Additional studies will need to be performed to address such concepts and thereby enable us to better understand the D1/85.16 cl.23 resistance mechanism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and cell culture</title><p>U87-CD4 and U87-CD4-CCR5 cells, contributed by Dr. HongKui Deng and Dr. Dan Littman, were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (ARRRP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Bjorndal1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. 293T cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA).

Different amounts of the CCR5-WT plasmid were transfected and the MFI value for CCR5 expression was calculated under each condition, to generate a dose-response curve. The extent of entry mediated by each mutant CCR5 plasmid was then compared to that mediated by wild-type CCR5 at the same MFI value.</p><p>The remaining cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> cells per well in 100 &#x000b5;l of media for one more day. Then, freshly harvested Env-pseudoviruses were pre-incubated with magnetic beads (ViroMag R/L; OZ Biosciences, Marseille, France) for 15 min, added to the transfected cells at a volume of 100 &#x000b5;l and placed on a Super Magnetic Plate (Oz Biosciences) for 10 min, as recommended by the manufacturer. The cultures were then maintained for 72 h at 37&#x000b0;C. A 100 &#x000b5;l aliquot of culture supernatant was then removed and replaced with 100 &#x000b5;l of Bright-Glo Luciferase Substrate (Promega Inc). After 5 min, the plates were analyzed in a Victor3 1420 plate-reading luminometer (Perkin Elmer, Wellesly, MA). There was no measurable luminescence from uninfected cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>HIV-1 infection of U87-CD4-CCR5 cells and inhibition by rabbit sera</title><p>For studies with rabbit sera, Env-pseudoviruses were incubated with the same volume of media containing twice the required dilution of sera for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C, then the mix was added to U87-CD4-CCR5 cells for 72 h before measurement of luciferase expression. The percent neutralization by rabbit sera was calculated as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Beddows1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>. To correct for any interference from rabbit serum components, a pre-immune serum sample from the same animal was processed identically to the post-immune samples in each experiment, to enable the determination of the percent neutralization at each serum dilution. Percent neutralization was defined as &#x0005b;1&#x02212;(RLUpostimmune/RLUpreimmune)&#x0005d;&#x000d7;100. The effect of this adjustment was, in most cases, negligible; neutralization titers derived using the pre-immune serum correction were usually very similar to those obtained using the standard control wells, containing only Env-pseudoviruses and cells, as a reference. Non-linear sigmoidal dose-response curves were generated using Prism (Graphpad software, San Diego, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>gp120 capture ELISA</title><p>MAb binding to gp120 was quantified essentially as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Moore1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000548-Binley2">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>.

The plates were washed three times with TSM (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), and then blocked with TSM/1&#x00025; BSA for 30 min. MAbs diluted in TSM were then added for 2 h. The plates were washed five times with TSM/0.05&#x00025; Tween, before addition of an appropriate HRP-labeled secondary Ab in TSM/0.05&#x00025; Tween for 1 h. The colorimetric endpoint at 450 nm was determined 10 min after the addition of the substrate solution (0.1 M sodium acetate, 0.1 M citric acid, 1&#x00025; TMB (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 0.01&#x00025; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>).
