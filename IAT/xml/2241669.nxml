VRK1 is the most characterized member <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001642-Lazo1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and it phosphorylates several proteins such as p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001642-LopezBorges1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, c-Jun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001642-Sevilla1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, ATF2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001642-Sevilla2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> among transcription factors, or Baf, a protein required for nuclear envelope assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001642-Nichols1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001642-Gorjanacz1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Several additional lines of evidence suggest that VRK1 might be playing a role in relation with cell cycle progression. In normal human squamous epithelium, VRK1 protein presents a pattern of expression that overlaps that of the Ki67 proliferation marker, and coincides with the transit amplification compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001642-Santos1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. A similar correlation with this marker has been also detected in human head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, where it was correlated with other markers related with the proliferation phenotype, such as CDK2, CDK6, cyclin A and B1, topoisomerase II and survivin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001642-Santos1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

For this aim the timing of the temporal accumulation of VRK1 transcripts was correlated with the sequential expression of cyclin genes, since this is a cell line with a rather slow growth. Cyclin C, cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin A1 and cyclin B1 were consecutively expressed in the expected and sequential corresponding order with a start of their accumulation at 2, 6, 12, 16 and 17 hours respectively after serum readdition to starved cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001642-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). The best characterized cyclin D1 starts to be detected between four to six hours after serum readdition. The accumulation of VRK1, FOS and MYC RNA coincided, or started slightly sooner, than the time point of cyclin D1 accumulation, but these three RNA continue to accumulate, while those of cyclins peaked and drop sequentially in the correct sequential order within the G1 phase of the cell cycle.

For this aim WS1 cells were transfected with either siControl or siVRK1, and different proteins that sequentially change during the cell cycle were also determined by immunoblot analysis.

The proliferation was slowed down as shown by a reduction in cell number when they were treated with siVRK1, but not in the control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001642-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>); a similar finding was detected when the total amount of protein was determined. After three days there was noticeable drop in endogenous VRK1 protein levels that was almost complete by day five, which was accompanied by an almost complete reduction in cell division as shown, both, by cell number or total mass. In the culture there were fewer cells after five days of specific siRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001642-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0001642-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001642.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Effect of siRNA on endogenous VRK1 and cell proliferation.</title><p>(A).

Since VRK1 is induced by exit of G0, its expression should increase as a consequence of the first cell division. The expression of these two proteins, p63 and VRK1, was determined by immunohistochemistry in the human squamous epithelium of the pharynx. As expected the p63 signal strongly stains the first basal layer of cells and its intensity gradually decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001642-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>). VRK1 is weakly positive in the basal layer of the epithelium, although some individual cells present a stronger staining (arrow), and then suddenly increases reaching its highest intensity in the second layer of cells, consistent with the entry of these cells in the amplification compartment. Then VRK1 staining decreases till it disappears and differentiated cells become negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001642-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>). The timing of the epithelial differentiation is in agreement with the half-life of VRK1 and its disappearance. The two proteins were also detected in immunofluorescence in pharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001642-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>), VRK1 overlaps with p63, but interestingly in the basal layer, the compartment where stem cells are located, only few cells have overlapping signal of VRK1 and p63, reflecting the higher level of VRK1 in these cells, and identifying a subpopulation within the basal layer of the epithelium that represents approximately five per cent of the cells in this compartment.</p><fig id="pone-0001642-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001642.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Localization of VRK1 and p63 in the squamous epithelium of the human pharynx.</title><p>(A).

However, in mammals, the cell is within a complex environment and its division can be affected by interactions with neighboring cells, both homotypic and heterotypic, the extracellular matrix as well as by the availability of growth factors; all of them sending signals that can control cell proliferation. This means that in mammalian cells there must be additional proteins implicated in cell cycle regulation that mediate its adaptation to its environment, and thus control tissue homeostasis.</p><p>In this context we have shown that VRK1 protein is necessary for cell division. VRK1 is likely to play different roles depending on the stage of cell cycle progression. It has to play a role in the exit from G0, since it is immediately expressed after readdition of serum to starved cells, and expression is turned on and off by serum. <italic>VRK1</italic> thus responds as an early response gene like <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>FOS</italic>, two prototypical early serum-response genes. Once in the cell cycle is likely to contribute to activation of proteins needed for cell cycle progression, or its control, since this effect is mediated by phosphorylation of transcription factors, some of which have been identified, such as c-Jun, ATF2 or p53. Its requirement for cell cycle progression is supported by two observation, <italic>VRK1</italic> gene expression is inhibited as a downstream target of the p16INK4A-pRB-E2F pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001642-Vernell1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>; and overexpression of p16 in combination with non phosphorylated retinoblastoma also inhibit <italic>VRK1</italic> expression, since they block cell cycle progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001642-Santos1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In cells without retinoblastoma, that functionally mimic its phosphorylation, there is an overexpression of <italic>VRK1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001642-Semizarov1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, consistent with the permanence of these cells in a cycling state.</p><p>But VRK1, which is a very stable protein, might have additional roles during cell cycle, as would be expected for a regulatory kinase. Thus in cells that are growing in a continuous way, as it occurs in cell culture o in the transit amplifying compartment of normal epithelium, where VRK1 levels are high and colocalize with the Ki67 proliferation markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001642-Santos1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In this situation, cells do not enter the G0 phase, VRK1 is necessary, since its loss will result in stoppage of cell division, as it occurs in fibroblasts (this work) or the HCT116 cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001642-Vega1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> when they were treated with siRNA in the presence of serum. Among these roles for VRK1, there are two for which some evidence is already available. First VRK1 can contribute to maintain a level, albeit low, of p53 molecules in a readiness state so that it can respond immediately to suboptimal DNA damage in a dividing cell, without the need for induction of <italic>TP53</italic> gene expression, which requires hours. This action is mediated by the specific phosphorylation of p53 in Thr18 by VRK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001642-LopezBorges1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001642-Vega1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001642-Barcia1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001642-Kwon1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact an autoregulatory mechanism between these two proteins has been identified, in this process VRK1 can not induce a permanent block of cell cycle progression by accumulation of a stabilized p53, because p53 induces proteolytic degradation of VRK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001642-Valbuena1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, a mechanism that is disrupted in lung carcinomas with <italic>TP53</italic> mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001642-Valbuena2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>; therefore in tumors with mutations in p53 there is an accumulation of a protein, VRK1, necessary for cell division, and thus might contribute to tumor cell expansion. This mechanism should be active before DNA replication takes place, thus it is necessary in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Secondly, another moment in which VRK1 might be necessary during cell cycle progression occurs late in the cycle, just after chromosome segregation in mitosis, since VRK1 has been shown to regulate the Baf protein, which is necessary for assembly of the nuclear envelope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001642-Nichols1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001642-Gorjanacz1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>; and it is also required for chromatin condensation, detected as phosphorylation of histone 3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001642-Kang1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to these roles, it is likely that additional roles for VRK1 are identified in the future.</p><p>Thus we have reported that VRK1 protein is necessary for exit of the G0, and maintenance of cell cycle progression where it can play different roles depending on the phase of the cycle, and associated to its regulatory activity as a kinase. These roles will be defined by the future identification of specific VRK1 phosphorylation substrates in each phase of the cell cycle. The requirement of VRK1 for cell division indicates that it might be a suitable target for development of specific inhibitors aiming to control cell proliferation, which might be of therapeutic use in oncology as an alternative to current and more toxic inhibitors of cell division.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell lines and tissue culture</title><p>The human fibroblast WS1 cell line (CRL-1502) was obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA).
