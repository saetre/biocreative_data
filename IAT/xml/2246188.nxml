We have previously used the markers 33A10, CD24 and Sca-1 to identify mouse mammary epithelial cell subpopulations. We now investigate the relationship between cells expressing these markers and use gene expression microarray analysis to identify genes differentially expressed in the cell populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Freshly isolated primary mouse mammary epithelial cells were separated on the basis of staining with the 33A10 antibody and an &#x003b1;-Sca-1 antibody. The populations identified were profiled using gene expression microarray analysis. Gene expression patterns were confirmed on normal mouse and human mammary epithelial subpopulations and were examined in a panel of breast cancer samples and cell lines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Analysis of the separated populations demonstrated that Sca-1<sup>- </sup>33A10<sup>High </sup>stained cells were estrogen receptor &#x003b1; (Esr1)<sup>- </sup>luminal epithelial cells, whereas Sca-1<sup>+ </sup>33A10<sup>Low/- </sup>stained cells were a mix of nonepithelial cells and Esr1<sup>+ </sup>epithelial cells. Analysis of the gene expression data identified the gene <italic>Rgs2 </italic>(regulator of G-protein signalling 2) as being highly expressed in the Sca-1<sup>- </sup>33A10<sup>Low/- </sup>population, which included myoepithelial/basal cells. RGS2 has previously been described as a regulator of angiotensin II receptor signalling. Gene expression analysis by quantitative real-time RT-PCR of cells separated on the basis of CD24 and Sca-1 expression confirmed that <italic>Rgs2 </italic>was more highly expressed in mouse myoepithelial/basal mammary cells than luminal cells. This expression pattern was conserved in normal human breast cells. Functional analysis demonstrated RGS2 to be a modulator of oxytocin receptor signalling. The potential significance of RGS2 expression in breast cancer was demonstrated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis, data mining and quantitative real-time RT-PCR approaches, which showed that <italic>RGS2 </italic>was expressed in the majority of solid breast cancers at much higher levels than in normal human mammary cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Molecular analysis of prospectively isolated mammary epithelial cells identified RGS2 as a modulator of oxytocin receptor signalling, which is highly expressed in the myoepithelial cells.

Estrogen receptor signalling is the best characterised aberrant signalling pathway in the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], but others include the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), prolactin receptor and oxytocin receptor pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A striking feature of these receptors and their downstream pathways is that they are important determinants of the growth, development and function of the normal breast epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It is likely that the competence of mammary epithelial cells to respond to these signalling pathways in normal development leads to selective pressure to recruit these molecules into the process of tumourigenesis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie normal cell growth and functional differentiation in the normal mammary gland is therefore critical to developing new therapeutic approaches that target these signalling pathways. A key step in developing such an understanding must be knowledge of genes expressed in the different cellular compartments of the mammary epithelium and their relationship to the function(s) of that compartment.</p><p>The adult mouse mammary epithelium consists of a network of ducts together with (in the pregnant/lactating gland) milk-producing alveoli, the latter being equivalent to the terminal ductal lobulo-alveolar units in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Both of these structures consist of two basic cell layers: an inner luminal epithelial layer and an outer basal epithelial layer. Luminal cells line the ducts, form the differentiated milk-secreting cells in the alveoli, and are the principal target for estrogen and prolactin. The basal layer is mainly composed of myoepithelial cells, which contract in response to oxytocin released during lactation to force milk from the alveoli down the ducts to the nipple. The basal cell layer also contains the stem cell compartment, which maintains the epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>We have previously used a variety of cell surface markers to isolate and characterize these populations. These have included a mouse luminal epithelial milk fat globule membrane antigen (recognized by the 33A10 antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]) to isolate mouse mammary luminal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]; CD24 to isolate both basal/myoepithelial and luminal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]; and Sca-1 and Prominin-1 (the mouse homologue of CD133), which both recognize estrogen receptor-&#x003b1; positive (Esr1<sup>+</sup>) luminal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We have shown that the basal epithelial compartment is enriched for epithelial stem cell activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and confirmed that this activity can be further purified on the basis of high CD49f expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In our previous studies, however, we confined molecular analysis of these populations to characterizing their function on the basis of expression of genes with known or predicted cell-type specific distributions.</p><p>The aim of the present study, therefore, was to identify genes that have not previously been characterized as being differentially expressed in mammary epithelial cell populations, with particular focus on genes with dysregulated expression in breast cancer. As a result of this analysis we have identified the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) regulator <italic>RGS2 </italic>(which encodes the regulator of G-protein signalling 2 [RGS2]) as being differentially expressed in the various breast epithelial populations. Furthermore, this gene is over-expressed in the majority of breast cancers, making it a potential new target for the development of therapeutics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>Anti-mouse Sca-1-PE antibody (clone D7; used at 0.1 &#x003bc;g/ml), mouse adsorbed anti-rat IgG-FITC (used at 1 &#x003bc;g/ml) and nonspecific rat IgG control antibodies were obtained from Southern Biotechnology (Cambridge Bioscience, Cambridge, UK). 33A10 rat IgG antibody supernatant (used undiluted) was a kind gift from Professor A Sonnenberg (Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).

A data mining approach was first used to examine <italic>RGS2 </italic>expression in a set of gene expression data from normal breast samples (10 pooled isolates of freshly separated normal luminal cells) and breast cancers (15 freshly isolated infiltrating ductal carcinomas of grade 2 or 3, from which cells expressing the desmosplastic fibroblast antigen F19 had been removed) analyzed by four different gene expression microarray platforms and massively parallel signature sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The data from all four microarray platforms showed that <italic>RGS2 </italic>was significantly upregulated in malignant breast cancers compared with normal luminal cells (Affymetrix: 3.2-fold increase, <italic>P </italic>= 3.77 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-10</sup>; Agilent: 2.49-fold increase, <italic>P </italic>= 1.25 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-6</sup>; CodeLink: 3.02-fold increase, <italic>P </italic>= 2.14 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-10</sup>; brk IMAGE: 2.71-fold increase, <italic>P </italic>= 1.35 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-6</sup>). The massively parallel signature sequencing analysis quantified the tumour pool as having 96 <italic>RGS2 </italic>transcripts per million and the normal luminal pool as having 0 transcripts per million (the gene was not detected in two independent sequencing runs).</p><p>We next compared expression of <italic>RGS2 </italic>in the tumour pool with the pooled normal human myoepithelial cells on the Affymetrix, Agilent and Codelink platforms. These data showed that the RGS2 expression was also significantly upregulated in the tumour pool compared with the normal myoepithelial pool (Affymetrix: 3.48-fold increase, <italic>P </italic>= 2.23 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-10</sup>; Agilent: 2.85-fold increase, <italic>P </italic>= 4.71 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-5</sup>; CodeLink: 12.9-fold increase, <italic>P </italic>= 1.14 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-4</sup>).</p><p>To validate these findings, a panel of samples including normal breast cells, breast cancer cell lines (including ESR1<sup>+ </sup>cell lines, estrogen nonresponsive cell lines, ERBB2 over-expressing cell lines and 55 primary tumour samples, some of which had been depleted of F19-expressing fibroblasts) were analysed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR for <italic>RGS2 </italic>expression. The samples were also analysed for <italic>OXTR </italic>expression levels. The results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>) confirmed the <italic>in silico </italic>analysis, with <italic>RGS2 </italic>expression seen in the majority of samples, being particularly strong in the solid tumour and F19-depleted samples. In contrast, <italic>OXTR </italic>expression in cell lines and primary tumours was variable, with only two out of four ESR1<sup>+ </sup>breast cancer cell lines, one of three ERBB2 over-expressing cell lines, one basal origin tumour cell line, eight out of 17 (47%) estrogen nonresponsive cell lines, and 23 out of 56 (41%) primary tumours having detectable oxytocin receptor gene expression.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>RGS2 is expressed in human myoepithelial and luminal cells and in breast cancers. <bold>(a) </bold>RNA isolated from normal primary breast cells, normal and breast cancer cell lines and primary breast cancers was analysed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR for expression at the transcriptional level of <italic>RGS2, OXR </italic>and a housekeeping gene <italic>B2M</italic>. <bold>(b) </bold>Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of RGS2 expression levels in a selection of primary human cells, human breast cancer cell lines, solid breast cancers and F19-depleted cancers.

The results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>) showed that compared with normal primary cells (either myoepithelial or luminal epithelial cells, breast fibroblasts, or endothelial cells) most cell lines had a much reduced level of <italic>RGS2 </italic>expression. One exception was the 1089M immortalized normal myoepithelial cell line, which had high levels of <italic>RGS2 </italic>expression. However, <italic>RGS2 </italic>expression was significantly increased in the solid tumours compared with the normal primary cells. It was increased still further in the F19-depleted cancers compared with all samples (including the 1089M cell line), some of which had levels of <italic>RGS2 </italic>expression 1,000-fold or more times that of the comparator. This suggests that <italic>RGS2 </italic>mRNA expression is strongly upregulated specifically in the epithelial cells of the majority of primary breast cancers.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In our previous studies, we found that the mouse mammary epithelium could be separated into total luminal or myoepithelial fractions by using the 33A10 and JB6 antibodies respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and, more recently, that anti-CD24 staining identifies three distinct mammary cell populations, namely CD24<sup>- </sup>nonepithelial cells, CD24<sup>Low </sup>basal/myoepithelial cells and CD24<sup>High </sup>total luminal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The CD24<sup>High </sup>total luminal fraction could be further subdivided into Sca-1<sup>+ </sup>Prominin<sup>+ </sup>Esr1<sup>+ </sup>and Sca-1<sup>- </sup>Prominin-1<sup>- </sup>Esr1<sup>- </sup>fractions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In the present study we expected that, because the mouse mammary luminal fraction can be isolated with both 33A10 and anti-CD24 staining, both the CD24<sup>High </sup>Sca-1<sup>+ </sup>and CD24<sup>High </sup>Sca-1<sup>- </sup>cells would have identical 33A10 staining patterns. Instead, we found that the 33A10 antibody differentially stained the luminal epithelial populations. We were able initially to identify the Sca-1<sup>- </sup>33A10<sup>High </sup>population as being identical to CD24<sup>High </sup>Sca-1<sup>- </sup>cells on the basis of patterns of gene expression. Subsequent flow cytometric analysis confirmed that 33A10 staining differentiated between the two luminal epithelial populations we previously identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. CD24<sup>High </sup>Sca-1<sup>- </sup>(Esr1<sup>-</sup>) luminal epithelial cells had a 33A10<sup>High </sup>staining pattern whereas CD24<sup>High </sup>Sca-1<sup>+ </sup>(Esr1<sup>+</sup>) luminal epithelial cells were 33A10<sup>Low</sup>. As expected, CD24<sup>Low </sup>Sca-1<sup>- </sup>basal/myoepithelial cells were 33A10<sup>-</sup>. This new differential staining pattern of the 33A10 antibody was most likely observed because of advances in flow cytometry technology and analysis software since our early observations, although mouse strain differences in the pattern of expression of the antigen recognized by the 33A10 antibody (most likely a milk fat globule membrane antigen) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] cannot be excluded.</p><p>With these data, we were able to extend our analysis of the mouse mammary epithelium, confirming that there are two distinct populations of luminal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, we used the gene expression array data that formed the basis for defining the identity of the Sca-1<sup>- </sup>33A10<sup>High </sup>population to identify <italic>Rgs2 </italic>as a gene highly differentially regulated between the epithelial populations of the mammary gland. Remarkably, <italic>RGS2 </italic>is over-expressed in the majority of breast cancer cell lines and primary breast tumours. RGS2 and the pathways it regulates are therefore important new candidate therapeutic targets for the treatment of breast cancer.</p><p>RGS2 is a regulator of GPCRs, which acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), primarily (although not exclusively) downregulating signalling from the G&#x003b1;<sub>q </sub>subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. GPCRs are the largest family of cell-surface molecules involved in signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. They all have a core of seven transmembrane &#x003b1;-helices and, after agonist binding, interact with the &#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b3; G-protein heterotrimers. This catalyzes the dissociation of G&#x003b1;-bound GDP and its replacement with GTP, leading to dissociation of the G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; from the G&#x003b1; subunits. The G&#x003b1;&#x02022; GTP and G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunit complexes then both stimulate downstream effectors until the GTP is hydrolyzed back to GDP and the signal switched off [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. GTP hydrolysis is regulated by the RGS proteins, which act as GAPs for G&#x003b1; subunits, although they can also have GAP-independent regulatory functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>The diverse signalling roles of GPCRs in cancer were recently reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In breast cancer, these include potential roles in growth, metastasis, angiogenesis and hormone therapy resistance. Given this diversity, determination of the specific function(s) of RGS2 in the context of the breast and breast cancer is extremely difficult. <italic>Rgs2 </italic>knockout mice were viable and had normal reproduction, although mammary phenotypes and lactation were not examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The mice did, however, exhibit a hypertensive phenotype, with renovascular abnormalities, persistent constriction of resistance vasculature and prolonged response of vasculature to vasoconstrictors. These effects were mediated through angiotensin II signalling and &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors and the hypertensive phenotype could be blocked with AT1 receptor antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Analysis of the mice also demonstrated that Rgs2 plays role in T-cell activation, synapse development in hippocampus and emotive behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The involvement of the gene in mediating vascular constriction and its strong over-expression in the basal mammary cell compartment suggested that at least one role for RGS2 in the breast is as a regulator of oxytocin signalling in the mammary gland, regulating myoepithelial cell contraction during lactation. Indeed, the data presented here confirm that RGS2 modulates signalling of the oxytocin receptor to p44/42 MAPK but not oxytocin receptor-mediated calcium signalling, suggesting that it does indeed regulate signalling of this receptor in the myoepithelial cells.</p><p>Remarkably, <italic>RGS2 </italic>gene expression was also upregulated in the majority of breast cancers examined, suggesting that dysfunction in the pathway or pathways regulated by RGS2 in the breast is an obligate event in breast cancer development. <italic>RGS2 </italic>and <italic>OXTR </italic>expression levels were not correlated in breast cancer, suggesting that <italic>RGS2 </italic>modulates a different GPCR pathway(s) in breast tumours. Exactly which pathway remains unclear. A number of GPCRs have been previously reported to be overexpressed in breast cancer, including CCR1, Opsin-3, CXCR4, PAR1, PAR2, EP2, EP4, GPR30 and the C3A anaphylatoxin chemotactic receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], although whether any of these are regulated by RGS2 remains unknown. One clue to the pathways involved may be that RGS2 was upregulated in the solid breast cancers, and in particular in the F19-depleted cancers, but tended to be less strongly expressed in cancer cell lines than in the normal tissue. This suggests that <italic>RGS2 </italic>expression in tumours is a consequence of interactions with the tumour microenvironment.</p><p>Identification of the GPCR pathway(s) regulated by RGS2 in breast cancer will be key to assessing whether it has a critical function in cancer biology and whether this pathway is of value as a therapeutic target. GPCRs can have tumour suppressor activity, as has been noted for GPR54 and metastasis in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], and tumour development would lead to selective pressure to block such pathways. Mechanisms for blocking the activity of tumour suppressor GPCR pathways could include upregulation of negative regulators of GPCRs, such as RGS2. Alternatively, GPCRs can provide cellular proliferation and survival signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], possibly in response to interactions with the tumour microenvironment, and RGS2 upregulation may be the result of a negative feedback mechanism. This would be consistent with its high expression in <italic>in situ </italic>cancers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). In this case, alternative survival signals might be selected for in tumour development to bypass the RGS2 block. Identifying and blocking alternative survival signals may enable a 'synthetic lethality' approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] to treating breast cancers with high levels of RGS2. Such an approach is attractive because direct targeting of RGS2 itself may prove problematic because of possible side effects resulting from its role in the regulation of vasoconstriction. However, the very large difference in <italic>RGS2 </italic>expression between F19-depleted tumours and normal endothelial cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>) suggests that a pronounced therapeutic window for RGS2 targeting exists.</p><p>Activity of p44/42 MAPK tends to be high in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], and so it is perhaps counterintuitive that RGS2, which suppresses p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation in oxytocin signalling, is highly expressed in breast cancers and cancer cell lines. However, RGS2 acts at the level of the G protein in the signalling pathway, not on p44/42 MAPK itself. RGS2 could suppress GPCR signalling even if p44/42 MAPK is activated via alternative routes. Furthermore, intracellular signalling is compartmentalized by spatial restriction mechanisms such as immobilization in lipid rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] or attachment to scaffold proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], and RGS2 could block phosphorylation of the GPCR signalling-associated p44/42 MAPK pool without affecting other pools. Thus p44/42 MAPK activity could be high in a tumour, even if the GPCR-associated activity is low.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have confirmed and extended our previous analyses of prospectively isolated mouse mammary epithelial subpopulations by demonstrating that different levels of 33A10 antibody staining identify different luminal epithelial subpopulations. Furthermore, molecular analysis of prospectively isolated mammary epithelial cells has identified Rgs2 as a modulator of oxytocin receptor signalling that is expressed most strongly in the myoepithelial cell layer. The <italic>RGS2 </italic>gene, but not the <italic>OXTR </italic>gene, was also shown to be over-expressed in the majority of breast cancers, identifying the product of this gene, or the pathway(s) it regulates, as potentially significant therapeutic targets. However, because the function of RGS2 is unlikely to be mediated through oxytocin receptor signalling in breast cancer, its role in the pathogenesis of the disease remains to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>EGFR = epidermal growth factor receptor; FCS = foetal calf serum; GAP = GTPase-activating protein; GPCR = G-protein coupled receptor; HER = human epidermal growth factor receptor; MAPK = mitogen-activated protein kinase; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline; qPCR = quantitative real time PCR; RGS2 = regulator of G-protein signalling 2; RT-PCR = reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; SSC = sodium chloride/citrate.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no completing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MJS designed the study, isolated mouse mammary cell populations, conducted biochemical analysis of RGS2 function, analyzed and interpreted the data, and drafted the manuscript.
