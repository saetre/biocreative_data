Unexpectedly, however, its physiological role in intact muscle has not yet been established in spite of the fact that the role of the more complex tetrameric hemoprotein, hemoglobin (Hb), in red cells is well established. Here, I report my new findings on an overlooked property of skeletal Mb.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>I directly observed the oxygenation of Mb in perfused rat skeletal muscle under various states of tissue respiration. A computer-controlled rapid scanning spectrophotometer was used to measure the oxygenation of Mb in the transmission mode.

The dissociation curve was shifted toward the right and became more sigmoid with an increase in tissue respiration activity. These observations indicate that an increase in O<sub>2 </sub>demand in tissues makes the O<sub>2 </sub>saturation of Mb more sensitive to O<sub>2 </sub>pressure change in the capillaries and enhances the Mb-mediated O<sub>2 </sub>transfer from Hb to cytochrome oxidase (Cyt. aa<sub>3</sub>), especially under heavy O<sub>2 </sub>demands.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The virtual cooperativity and O<sub>2 </sub>demand-dependent shifts of the ODC may provide a basis for explaining why Mb has been preserved as monomer during molecular evolution.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Mb is a monomeric hemoprotein with a molecular weight of 17 kDa, carrying a single oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)-binding site per molecule. It is located near the contractile elements and cell membranes in the red skeletal and cardiac muscles of vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Previously, Millikan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] proposed the following three possible physiological functions for Mb: (a) an O<sub>2 </sub>store during temporary deficits in O<sub>2 </sub>supply, (b) an intracellular O<sub>2 </sub>transport agent and (c) an intracellular catalyst. Among them, the first function has traditionally been accepted. In the muscles of a beating heart and exercising skeletal muscles, Mb acts as a short-term O<sub>2 </sub>store (i.e., an O<sub>2 </sub>buffer), tiding the muscles over from one contraction to the next. The rich Mb content in skeletal muscles in aquatic mammals is considered to provide a long-term O<sub>2 </sub>store during diving. However, this role of Mb, at least in human, is not significant because its oxygen storage capacity is so low that the total oxygen bound to Mb is exhausted within ca. 5.5 s after being cut off from the O<sub>2 </sub>supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The second function, called "facilitated O<sub>2</sub>-diffusion by Mb", was based on findings in <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The conditions required for this facilitated diffusion to occur are [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]: (a) existence of deoxygenated Mb in a certain fraction (or certain low intracellular partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub>), (b) existence of a spatial gradient of oxygenated Mb concentration as a driving force for translational diffusion of Mb, and (c) sufficient mobility of the oxygenated Mb to permit diffusion. Although this mechanism has been widely accepted, several discrepancies remain unresolved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. As for the third function, Doeller and Wittenberg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] proposed the occurrence of Mb-mediated oxidative phosphorylation in heart myocytes under aerobic conditions. However, Mb concentration is not closely related to the oxidative capacity of muscles, that is, the concentration is higher in skeletal muscles (~0.5 mmole/kg wet wt.) than in heart muscles (~0.25 mmole/kg wet wt.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Thus, the physiological roles of Mb have not yet been established. Recently, alternative functions of (d) O<sub>2 </sub>sensing and (e) nitric oxide scavenging were proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Another recent paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] seemed to have totally scrambled the past long-term disputes about the physiological significance of Mb. It was shown using gene-knockout technology that mice without Mb are fertile, exhibit normal exercise capacity, and have a normal ventilatory response to low O<sub>2 </sub>levels, suggesting that Mb is not essential for apparently normal cardiovascular and musculoskeletal function in a terrestrial, homoiothermic mammal. However, it has been reported that the disruption of Mb results in the activation of multiple compensatory mechanisms such as increases in Hb concentration, hematocrit, coronary flow, coronary reserve, and capillary density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Further, a Mb-like hemoprotein, neuroglobin, has been found in the vertebrate brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] contrary to the long-held belief that Mb is restricted to vertebrate cardiomyocytes and oxidative skeletal myofibers. These studies imply that further investigations are required to reveal the physiological role of Mb in intact organs.</p><p>In contrast to Mb, which shows a rectangular hyperbolic ODC, the vertebrate Hb, a tetramer carrying four O<sub>2 </sub>binding sites, shows a sigmoid ODC that is described in terms of a four-step cooperative O<sub>2 </sub>binding. It is widely accepted that the sigmoid ODC enables Hb to transport O<sub>2 </sub>with high efficiency: it is nearly fully saturated with O<sub>2 </sub>in the lungs and it unloads O<sub>2 </sub>sensitively depending on decreases in the partial pressure of oxygen (PO<sub>2</sub>) in peripheral tissues. Here, no convincing explanation has been given for the question: does the hyperbolic ODC of Mb have any physiological adequacy or reasonability? The Bohr effect of Hb (pH dependence of O<sub>2 </sub>affinity) has physiological significance, in that it enhances O<sub>2 </sub>unloading from Hb in the capillaries where pH tends to decrease and in that it increases the solubility of CO<sub>2 </sub>as bicarbonate in the venous blood through deoxygenation-induced uptake of protons by Hb. In contrast, Mb lacks the Bohr effect and it had long been believed that Mb was a totally non-allosteric protein, although recently lactate, a metabolic product, was found to cause a right-shift of the ODC for horse and sperm whale Mbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>It is well established that the O<sub>2 </sub>affinity of Mb is higher than that of Hb but lower than that of Cyt. aa<sub>3</sub>, as known from the relative positions of the ODCs for Mb and Hb and the oxidation curve for Cyt. aa<sub>3 </sub>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This fact led one to the idea that Mb acts as an intracellular O<sub>2 </sub>transfer agent from Hb (vascular space) to Cyt. aa3 (mitochondria). Here, one must not overlook an important fact. The three curves in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> are drawn with the same PO<sub>2 </sub>scale. Therefore, they give O<sub>2 </sub>saturation (Y) or the degree of oxidation for the individual proteins when dissolved in the same solution and are in equilibrium with oxygen at the given PO<sub>2 </sub>value. However, <italic>in vivo</italic>, they sense different PO<sub>2 </sub>values due to the presence of a PO<sub>2 </sub>gradient along the path from the inside of red cells to the mitochondria in myocytes. Thus, the relative positions of the three curves in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> must be considered with this precaution, and direct <italic>in vivo </italic>observations of Y or the degree of oxidation for these three individual proteins are required to get insight into their ensemble functional roles. Recently, using <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Mole et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and Richardson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] directly observed Y for Mb in human skeletal muscles under exercise of different intensities or during breathing of air with different O<sub>2 </sub>contents. In these studies, Mb was used as an indicator of intracellular PO<sub>2</sub>, and no attention was paid to the relation between Mb saturation and capillary PO<sub>2</sub>.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Oxygen dissociation curves (ODCs) for Hb (whole blood) and Mb and oxidation curve for Cyt. aa<sub>3 </sub>(at 37&#x000b0;C).

We plotted the Y values as a function of buffer PO<sub>2 </sub>and found that the apparent ODC thus plotted for skeletal muscle Mb was rectangular hyperbolic under a suppressed metabolic activity condition but it became sigmoid under enhanced metabolic activity conditions, realizing virtually cooperative O<sub>2 </sub>binding by monomeric Mb.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Muscle perfusion</title><p>All experimental procedures were performed according to the institutional guidelines for animal care and use of the Committee for Animal Care of Osaka University and the Japanese Physiological Society. Male Wistar rats (250 to 300 g body weight, N = 12) fed on a commercial diet were used. Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg body wt., intraperitoneal injection). Preparation of the isolated rat hindlimb and the perfusion apparatus were described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Surgery was modified from those of Ruderman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and Shiota et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. After a midline abdominal incision, the superficial epigastric vessels were ligated. The abdominal wall was then incised from the pubic symphysis to the xiphoid process. The spermary, testis, and inferior mesenteric arteries and veins were ligated, and the spermaries, the testises, and part of the descending colon were excised, together with contiguous adipose tissue. The caudal artery and internal iliac artery and vein were also ligated. Ligature were placed around the neck of the bladder, the coagulating gland and the prostate gland. While carefully removing the skin covering the lower half of the animal, the vessels that supply the subcutaneous region were ligated. Then, the inferior epigastric, iliolumbar and renal arteries and veins were ligated as well as the coeliac axis and portal vein. Further, a ligature was also placed around the tail. A hemoglobin-free Krebs-bicarbonate buffer (NaCl, 115 mM; KCl, 5.9 mM; MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 mM; NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 mM; Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 mM; NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 mM; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 mM; glucose, 10 mM; pH 7.4) containing 4% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-40T; average M.W., 40,000; Sigma) was perfused from the abdominal aorta in the flow-through mode at a constant flow rate of 1.0 ml/min/g muscle. Perfusate and muscle temperature were maintained at 25 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x000b0;C. The effluent was collected from the inferior vena cava in order to measure the O<sub>2 </sub>uptake rate. PO<sub>2 </sub>in the influent and the effluent buffers was monitored with an oxygen electrode. The rate of O<sub>2 </sub>uptake was calculated from the flow rate and the difference in O<sub>2 </sub>concentration between the influent and the effluent buffers. Before each measurement, the rat hindlimb was perfused with the buffer equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2 </sub>+ 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 30 min. Then, the O<sub>2 </sub>concentration in the perfusate was decreased stepwise by mixing a buffer equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2 </sub>+ 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>and another equilibrated with 95% N<sub>2 </sub>+ 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and the measurement was started. As required, potassium cyanide or 2,4-dinitrophenol was infused to modify the O<sub>2 </sub>uptake rate of the perfused muscle. During each measurement of about 60 min, the perfusion pressure remained nearly constant at 73&#x02013;78 mmHg. All chemicals used were of analytical reagent grade.</p></sec><sec><title>Spectrophotometric measurement of myoglobin oxygenation</title><p>A computer-controlled rapid scanning spectrophotometer (USP-501, Unisoku, Osaka, Japan) was used to measure the oxygenation of Mb in the transmission mode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The light beam was focused on the thigh (quadriceps) through a 5-mm-diameter light guide. The transmitted light was conducted to the spectrophotometer through another 5-mm-diameter light guide. Visible difference spectra in the range of 500&#x02013;650 nm were recorded when O<sub>2 </sub>uptake in the hindlimb muscle reached a constant value after every stepwise change in the O<sub>2 </sub>concentration of the buffer.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of data</title><p>Changes in the O<sub>2 </sub>uptake rate were analyzed using a rectangular hyperbolic curve equation: V = V<sub>max</sub>(PO<sub>2</sub>/P<sub>V50</sub>)/{1 + (PO<sub>2</sub>/P<sub>V50</sub>)}. Here, the maximal rate of O<sub>2 </sub>uptake (V<sub>max</sub>) and effluent buffer PO<sub>2 </sub>at half maximal O<sub>2 </sub>uptake (P<sub>V50</sub>) were obtained from the slope (1/V<sub>max</sub>) and the ordinate intercept (P<sub>V50</sub>/V<sub>max</sub>) of the Hanes-Woolf plot (effluent PO<sub>2</sub>/V vs. effluent PO<sub>2</sub>). Changes in oxygen saturation of Mb (Y) were analyzed using the Hill equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], Y = PO<sub>2</sub><sup>n</sup>/(PO<sub>2</sub><sup>n </sup>+ P<sub>Y50</sub><sup>n</sup>), where P<sub>Y50 </sub>is PO<sub>2 </sub>at half saturation of Mb (Y<sub>50</sub>) and n is the Hill coefficient. In the original Hill equation, n was treated as a constant. This equation expressed the ODC of Mb well but not the ODC of Hb because the Hill plot for Hb deviated from a straight line at both extremes. To make the Hill plot applicable to Hb, Wyman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] extended the equation by linearizing it in the form: log {Y/(1 - Y)} = n (log PO<sub>2 </sub>- log P<sub>Y50</sub>) where n was treated as a variable. This extension allowed cooperativity measured by n to vary depending on Y.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Oxygen uptake by perfused muscle in different respiration states</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows the steady-state O<sub>2 </sub>uptake rate (V) of a perfused muscle. The respiration rate of the muscle was varied by controlling mitochondrial respiration activity by about 7.5-fold (compare the V<sub>max </sub>values described below) from a suppressed state with an inhibitor (KCN) of mitochondrial respiration to enhanced states with two levels of an uncoupler (2,4-dinitrophenol) of mitochondrial respiration. Three preparations of muscle were used for the experiments in each mitochondrial activity state. The actual PO<sub>2 </sub>values of the influent and effluent buffers at the maximal O<sub>2 </sub>inflow rate are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Changes in the value of V were well expressed by a rectangular hyperbolic curve as a function of effluent buffer PO<sub>2 </sub>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> also gives the estimated V<sub>max </sub>and P<sub>V50 </sub>obtained from these data as described in Materials and Methods. V<sub>max </sub>and P<sub>V50 </sub>became larger by approximately 7.5-fold and 2-fold, respectively, for the maximal increase in respiration activity. With elevation of respiration activity, the critical PO<sub>2</sub>, at which O<sub>2 </sub>uptake of perfused hindlimb muscle starts to decrease, increased to higher values. This indicates that, under higher respiration activity, O<sub>2 </sub>supply to the perfused muscle was limited even at very high influent PO<sub>2 </sub>(~700 mmHg). This situation occurred because the flow rate of the perfusate and the capillary PO<sub>2 </sub>were controlled independently of the respiration activity state so that the PO<sub>2 </sub>gradient between the perfusate and the mitochondria became larger at higher respiration states.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Steady-state O<sub>2 </sub>uptake rate (V) of perfused rat hindlimb muscles as a function of effluent buffer PO<sub>2</sub>.

It is assumed that capillary PO<sub>2 </sub>may be approximated by effluent PO<sub>2 </sub>in the present experiment, and I plotted the Y values as a function of effluent buffer PO<sub>2</sub>. Thereby, I expected that this treatment enabled a meaningful comparison of the ODCs for Mb and Hb. I found that thus plotted apparent ODC for skeletal muscle Mb was hyperbolic under a suppressed metabolic activity condition whereas it became sigmoid under enhanced metabolic activity conditions, realizing virtually cooperative oxygenation of the monomeric Mb.</p><p>It is generally accepted that cooperative O<sub>2 </sub>binding by Hb is advantageous for efficient O<sub>2 </sub>transfer from the alveolar gas to red cells and from red cells to peripheral tissues. Based on the Hill equation, Graby and Meldon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] showed that an <italic>n </italic>value (here, <italic>n </italic>is a constant) of 1.5 to 2.0 is more favourable for minimizing the change in blood flow under resting conditions than the normal <italic>n </italic>value of 2.5 to 3.0, whereas an <italic>n </italic>value as large as 3 is beneficial for a large amount of O<sub>2 </sub>extraction under vigorous exercise. Kobayashi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] showed that, under resting conditions, O<sub>2 </sub>release from Hb becomes most sensitive to PO<sub>2 </sub>change at Y = 38% where cooperativity measured by <italic>n </italic>(here, <italic>n </italic>is a variable of PO<sub>2</sub>) is not maximal, whereas it becomes less sensitive at the mixed venous blood PO<sub>2 </sub>where Y is around 70% and cooperativity is nearly maximal. These reports indicate that, under resting conditions, the blood reserves an O<sub>2 </sub>transport capacity to meet possible increases in O<sub>2 </sub>demand, e.g. under exercise conditions, and the sigmoid character of ODC becomes more important under such conditions. This situation is realized by maintaining Y at a rather high level (70%) below which the Y value drops sharply upon PO<sub>2 </sub>decrease within the very steep middle portion of ODC.</p><p>The present study has clearly shown that the apparent ODC for Mb in intact skeletal muscle is sigmoid, the n<sub>app </sub>value being 1.46 under the control condition (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) and 2.23 under the maximal respiratory condition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These n<sub>app </sub>values greater than unity imply that the muscle Mb binds O<sub>2 </sub>in a virtually cooperative manner with variation of effluent buffer PO<sub>2</sub>. This phenomenon implies that the sensitivity of Y for Mb to vessel PO<sub>2 </sub>change becomes higher for increased O<sub>2 </sub>demands than for normal O<sub>2 </sub>demand. In addition to this effect, the rightward shift of the ODC upon increases in oxygen demand will undoubtedly enhance O<sub>2 </sub>unloading from Mb. These effects will facilitate Mb-mediated O<sub>2 </sub>transfer from Hb to Cyt. aa<sub>3</sub>, especially for heavy O<sub>2 </sub>demands. Based on the Hill equation, the O<sub>2 </sub>transport efficiency of Mb in the perfused muscle is estimated to increase ca. 4-fold under the control condition and ca. 11-fold under maximally respiring condition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> inset).</p><p>The Mbs isolated from body wall or radular muscle of a limited number of annelidan and molluscan species are dimers and show some cooperativity in oxygen binding (1 &#x0003c; n &#x0003c; 2) but no Bohr effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The physiological significance of these dimeric Mbs is unknown. As shown in the present study, the ODC of monomeric Mb can exhibit virtual cooperativity and O<sub>2 </sub>demand-dependent shifts. The virtually cooperativity and O<sub>2 </sub>demand-dependent shifts of Mb oxygenation <italic>in vivo </italic>are probably common features at least for vertebrate Mbs, and this may provide a basis for explaining why the vertebrate Mb has been preserved as a monomer during molecular evolution.</p><p>The virtual cooperativity in Mb oxygenation observed in the present study is explained in terms of the PO<sub>2 </sub>gradient along the O<sub>2 </sub>diffusion path. If the tissue O<sub>2 </sub>demand was null, then the PO<sub>2 </sub>gradient would be absent and the apparent ODC for Mb would be identical with the real ODC for Mb in solution. At a steady state with a certain level of O<sub>2 </sub>demand a PO<sub>2 </sub>gradient develops across red cell membrane, blood plasma, capillary wall, sarcolemma and sarcoplasm, making the PO<sub>2 </sub>sensed by Mb lower than the capillary PO<sub>2</sub>. Then, the apparent ODC will be shifted toward the right because a capillary PO<sub>2 </sub>value higher than the PO<sub>2 </sub>value sensed by Mb is needed to maintain the same Y value as that which occurs in the absence of a PO<sub>2 </sub>gradient. When the tissue O<sub>2 </sub>demand is kept constant, the ratio of capillary PO<sub>2 </sub>to sarcoplasm PO<sub>2 </sub>will become larger at low capillary PO<sub>2 </sub>than at high capillary PO<sub>2</sub>. This will cause a more extensive rightward shift of the apparent ODC in the low saturation range than in the high saturation range, making the curve steeper than the real one. Increase in tissue oxygen demand will enhance this mechanism and make the curve more right-shifted and sigmoid. All the apparent ODCs observed in the present study are shifted toward the right compared to the real one measured for Mb in solution (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>At present, detailed explanations for this cooperative mechanism is difficult. However, it could be argued that heterogeneous oxygenation in tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and in single myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] might be responsible in part for the shift and the shape change of the Mb ODC, and might also enhance intercellular O<sub>2 </sub>transfer, i.e., re-distribution of O<sub>2 </sub>among adjacent myocytes, although we adopted high and constant flow rate perfusion conditions (i.e., about 50 times higher than normal blood flow) and, thus, the perfused vessels of muscle were always passively dilated.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is not practical to use a Hb solution or a red cell suspension as the perfusate in our experiments because the absorption spectra for Hb and Mb are too similar and independent observations of Mb oxygenation are not feasible, especially when the concentration of Hb is much higher than that of Mb. To overcome the problem that the O<sub>2 </sub>solubility of the buffer is much smaller than that of a Hb solution or a red cell suspension two strategies were employed: one was to make the PO<sub>2 </sub>of the influent buffer as high as that of water vapor-saturated O<sub>2 </sub>(ca. 700 mmHg) and the other was to use a high flow rate for the buffer, which was about 50 times higher than that of normal blood flow. As a result, the inflow of O<sub>2 </sub>was about 5 times larger than that of the tissue O<sub>2 </sub>consumption at the control metabolic rate. The large O<sub>2 </sub>diffusion barrier (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) and the high PO<sub>2 </sub>of the influent buffer (and consequently, the high capillary PO<sub>2</sub>) are an additional (and probably, major) cause for the rightward shift of the apparent ODC of Mb. The apparent ODCs of Mb in the control and enhanced respiration activity states (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) are right-shifted compared to the whole blood ODC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). One may suppose that Mb cannot work when the capillary PO<sub>2 </sub>is in the physiological range (40 to100 mmHg) because its O<sub>2 </sub>saturation is too low to function, as judged from Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>. However, the actual apparent ODCs for Mb in muscles with blood circulation will be shifted much more toward the left compared to those shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, and Mb can be saturated with O<sub>2 </sub>to practical levels. The important point is that the difference in <italic>in vivo </italic>O<sub>2 </sub>saturation between Hb and Mb is not so large as that expected from the ODCs in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. In fact, Y for Mb in working muscles is less than around 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Red blood cell (RBC) in perfusion buffer appears to exert considerable effects on intracellular oxygenation in the beating heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], probably due to the facilitated O<sub>2 </sub>transfer by RBC motion within capillary lumen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Therefore, the virtually cooperative oxygenation of Mb might be only demonstrated in organs perfused with RBC-free medium. However, it is well known that the blood flow in the capillary bed is not constant and frequently only plasma flow is observed. In this case, the virtually cooperative oxygenation of Mb may play a significant role for O<sub>2 </sub>transfer from capillary to mitochondria.</p><p>In summary, I found that the ODC for Mb in intact skeletal muscle is sigmoid and right-shifted. This virtually cooperative O<sub>2 </sub>binding by Mb and the right-shift of ODC become more marked as tissue respiration activity is increased. Hence, increase in O<sub>2 </sub>demand in tissues makes the O<sub>2 </sub>saturation of Mb more sensitive to capillary PO<sub>2 </sub>change and enhances Mb-mediated O<sub>2 </sub>transfer from red cell to motochondria. The virtual cooperativity and O<sub>2 </sub>demand-dependent shifts of ODC may give a basis for explaining why Mb has been preserved as a monomer during molecular evolution. Preservation of a monomeric structure may be required to retain multi-functional role of Mb <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported in part by a research grant from the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture of Japan.</p></sec></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kagen</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name></person-group><source>Myoglobin</source><year>1973</year><publisher-name>New York, London: Columbia University Press</publisher-name></citation></ref><ref id="B2"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Millikan</surname><given-names>GA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Experiments on muscle haemoglobin in vivo; the instantaneous measurement of muscle metabolism</article-title><source>Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci</source><year>1937</year><volume>123</volume><fpage>218</fpage><lpage>241</lpage></citation></ref><ref id="B3"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Millikan</surname><given-names>GA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Muscle hemoglobin</article-title><source>Physiol Rev</source><year>1939</year><volume>19</volume><fpage>503</fpage><lpage>523</lpage></citation></ref><ref id="B4"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wyman</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Facilitated diffusion and the possible role of myoglobin as a transport mechanism</article-title><source>J Biol Chem</source><year>1966</year><volume>241</volume><fpage>115</fpage><lpage>121</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">5901042</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B5"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wittenberg</surname><given-names>JB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Oxygen transport: a new function proposed for myoglobin</article-title><source>Biol Bull</source><year>1959</year><volume>117</volume><fpage>402</fpage><lpage>403</lpage></citation></ref><ref id="B6"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Scholander</surname><given-names>PF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Oxygen transport through hemoglobin solutions</article-title><source>Science</source><year>1960</year><volume>131</volume><fpage>585</fpage><lpage>590</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14443421</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B7"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wittenberg</surname><given-names>JB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Myoglobin-facilitated oxygen diffusion: Role of myoglobin in oxygen entry into muscle</article-title><source>Physiol Rev</source><year>1970</year><volume>50</volume><fpage>559</fpage><lpage>636</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">4922928</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B8"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>DP</given-names></name><name><surname>Kennedy</surname><given-names>FG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Intracellular O<sub>2 </sub>gradients in cardiac myocytes.
