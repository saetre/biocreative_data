BRIT1 mutations or aberrant expression are found in primary microcephaly patients as well as in cancer patients. Recent <italic>in vitro</italic> studies suggest that BRIT1/MCPH1 functions as a novel key regulator in the DNA damage response pathways. To investigate its physiological role and dissect the underlying mechanisms, we generated <italic>BRIT1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and identified its essential roles in mitotic and meiotic recombination DNA repair and in maintaining genomic stability. Both <italic>BRIT1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were hypersensitive to &#x003b3;-irradiation. <italic>BRIT1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs and T lymphocytes exhibited severe chromatid breaks and reduced RAD51 foci formation after irradiation. Notably, <italic>BRIT1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were infertile and meiotic homologous recombination was impaired. <italic>BRIT1</italic>-deficient spermatocytes exhibited a failure of chromosomal synapsis, and meiosis was arrested at late zygotene of prophase I accompanied by apoptosis. In mutant spermatocytes, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were formed, but localization of RAD51 or BRCA2 to meiotic chromosomes was severely impaired. In addition, we found that BRIT1 could bind to RAD51/BRCA2 complexes and that, in the absence of BRIT1, recruitment of RAD51 and BRCA2 to chromatin was reduced while their protein levels were not altered, indicating that BRIT1 is involved in mediating recruitment of RAD51/BRCA2 to the damage site. Collectively, our BRIT1-null mouse model demonstrates that BRIT1 is essential for maintaining genomic stability <italic>in vivo</italic> to protect the hosts from both programmed and irradiation-induced DNA damages, and its depletion causes a failure in both mitotic and meiotic recombination DNA repair via impairing RAD51/BRCA2's function and as a result leads to infertility and genomic instability in mice.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The repair of DNA breaks in cells is critical for maintaining genomic integrity and suppressing tumor development. DNA breaks can arise from exogenous agents such as ionizing radiation (IR) or can form during the process of germ cell (sperm and egg) generation. BRIT1 protein (also known as MCPH1) is a recently identified DNA damage responding protein, and its mutations or reduced expression are found in primary microcephaly (small brain) patients, as well as in cancer patients. To investigate BRIT1's physiological functions and dissect the underlying molecular mechanism, we used a genetic approach (gene targeting technology) to delete BRIT1 gene in mice and generated a mouse model with BRIT1 deficiency (called BRIT1-knockout mice). Here, we showed that BRIT1 knockout mice are more sensitive to IR due to their inability to repair the IR-induced DNA breaks. These mice are also infertile, and their DNA repair during the process of germ cell generation was impaired substantially. Thus, in this study, we generated a novel mouse model (BRIT1 knockout mice) with striking phenotypes related to defective DNA repair and clearly demonstrated the essential role of BRIT1 in DNA repair at organism level.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is critical for maintaining genomic integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000826-Pastink1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000826-Franco1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

The basal chromatin-binding of BRCA2 was also significantly reduced in the BRIT1 null background while the IR-induced BRCA2 association to the chromatin was modest reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000826-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).

Our studies on BRIT1 null mice also provide convincing evidence to identify a novel and important function of BRIT1 in meiotic recombination DNA repair. <italic>BRIT1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed significant genomic instability, exemplified by chromosomal aberrations in T lymphocytes and MEFs.

Our data presented here clearly reveal that BRIT1 is essential for meiotic recombination DNA repair in spermatocytes. We first demonstrated that the male infertility in null mice was caused by catastrophic meiosis failure in spermatocytes and accordingly, no spermatids could be generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000826-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). We also showed that <italic>BRIT1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> spermatocytes exhibited aberrant chromosomal synapsis, and meiosis was arrested before or at the transition of zygotene to pachytene of meiotic prophase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000826-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In addition, we found that localization of RAD51/BRCA2 to meiotic chromosomes was severely impaired in the mutant spermatocytes while their protein levels were not altered due to loss of BRIT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000826-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000826.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Thus, these data together indicate that the DSB generated by SPO11 at leptotene can not be repaired properly and as a result, leads to aberrant chromosomal synapsis and meiosis arrest at late zygotene stage. Interestingly, unlike MDC1 or H2AX whose deficiency only leads to male infertility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000826-Celeste1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000826-Lou1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, loss of BRIT1 also lead to female infertility with much smaller ovary (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000826.s002">Figure S2</xref>), suggesting that BRIT1 may also function as a key regulator in oocyte meiotic recombination.</p><p>During meiosis, DSB is generated by SPO11 that leads to the initiation of meiotic recombination (HR DNA repair) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000826-Keeney1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. In the null mice, <italic>BRIT1</italic> deficiency only affected foci formation of RAD51/BRCA2, but not those of SPO11 and &#x003b3;-H2AX, at leptotene/zygotene stages, Thus, our data support a model in which BRIT1 functions downstream of the SPO11-mediated DSB formation but upstream of RAD51/BRCA2-midiated DSB repair during meiotic recombination. In addition to meiosis, we also found that in response to DSBs induced by IR, the association of RAD51/BRCA2 to chromatin and their foci formation was impaired in MEFs with BRIT1 deficiency while their protein levels were not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000826-g006">Figure 6</xref>). All these <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies together therefore demonstrate that Brit1 is critical for DNA repair during both meiosis and mitosis. The impaired RAD51 foci formation in both <italic>BRIT1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs and spermatocytes is not due to the changes of RAD51 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000826-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000826-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Although BRIT1 has been reported to regulate RAD51 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000826-Yang1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, we observed no altered RAD51 protein levels in either <italic>BRIT1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs or the <italic>BRIT1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse testes which is consistent with our previous studies in BRIT1 knockdown human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000826-Peng1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The mechanisms mediating BRIT1's function on DNA repair may be through multiple levels. Firstly, BRIT1 can be indirectly involved in DNA repair process via regulation of chromatin structure. We recently found that BRIT1 was associated with Condensin II, which modulates BRIT1-mediated HR repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000826-Wood1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, we demonstrated BRIT1 being involved in chromatin remodeling via interacting with SWI/SNF, and this interaction relaxes the chromatin structure and increases the access of the repair proteins, including RAD51, to the DNA damage sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000826-Peng1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, this chromatin remodeling function of BRIT1 may also contribute to the increased accessibility of many other DNA damage responsors, such as ATM, ATR, NBS1, MDC1, 53BP1, RPA as we previously observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000826-Rai1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to the generally increased affinity of DNA damage responsors and DNA repair proteins to chromatin, BRIT1 may further directly participate into DNA repair via interacting and recruiting RAD51/BRCA2 complex to the damage sites. Here, we observed that BRIT1 can physically associate with RAD51 or BRCA2 and in the absence of BRIT1, recruitment of RAD51 and BRCA2 to chromatin was remarkably reduced while their protein levels were not altered, suggesting that BRIT1 being directly involved in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000826-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Consistently, in the course of our study, a very recent report also shows that BRIT1 binds to BRCA2/RAD51 complex and this binding is required for recruitment or retention of BRCA2/RAD51 complex at the DNA repair sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000826-Wu1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, BRIT1 also functions directly in DNA repair via directing BRCA2/RAD51 foci to the DSBs. In consistent with the role of BRIT1 in regulating the DNA repair function of BRCA2/RAD51, the meiotic phenotypes in <italic>BRIT1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are virtually the same as those observed in mice with deficiency of BRCA2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000826-Sharan1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref> and DMC1 (a homologue of RAD51) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000826-Pittman1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000826-Yoshida1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. In these mice, spermatocytes are also arrested before or at the transition of zygotene to pachytene with aberrant chromosomal synapsis. In fact, like <italic>BRIT1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> spermatocytes, <italic>BRCA2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> spermatocytes also form DSBs without the consequent recruitment of RAD51 to the meiotic chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000826-Sharan1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our previous studies show that BRIT1 deficiency is correlated with genomic instability and breast cancer development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000826-Rai1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Although our BRIT1 knockout mice within one and half years old did not develop any tumor, when we crossed BRIT1 knockout mice to the p53 null background, we found a significant effect of BRIT1 deficiency in enhancing cancer susceptibility (unpublished data). Notably, our very recent preliminary data indicate that low dosage of irradiation can readily induce breast tumors in the mice with conditional knockout of BRIT1 in the mammary gland but not in the control littermates. It will be very interesting to investigate if and to what extent BRIT1 deficiency may contribute to the initiation and progression of cancer with the existence of oncogenic or genotoxic stress. For example, we can assess whether crossing an activated Ras or HER2 allele into the BRIT1 deficient background will result in increased genomic instability and tumorigenesis compared to either mouse strain alone. Thus, our BRIT1 null mouse will be a very valuable model for further assessing BRIT1's role in genome maintenance and tumor suppression in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of <italic>BRIT1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and MEFs</title><p>We isolated <italic>BRIT1</italic> BAC clones from a 129/SvEv genomic library to construct the conditional targeting vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000826-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).
