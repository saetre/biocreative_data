As the combination of E2 and E3 dictates the type and biological consequence of ubiquitination, it is important to understand the basis of specificity in E2:E3 interactions. The E3 ligase CHIP interacts with Hsp70 and Hsp90 and ubiquitinates client proteins that are chaperoned by these heat shock proteins. CHIP interacts with two types of E2 enzymes, UbcH5 and Ubc13-Uev1a. It is unclear, however, why CHIP binds these E2 enzymes rather than others, and whether CHIP interacts preferentially with UbcH5 or Ubc13-Uev1a, which form different types of polyubiquitin chains.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The 2.9 &#x000c5; crystal structure of the CHIP U-box domain complexed with UbcH5a shows that CHIP binds to UbcH5 and Ubc13 through similar specificity determinants, including a key S-P-A motif on the E2 enzymes. The determinants make different relative contributions to the overall interactions between CHIP and the two E2 enzymes. CHIP undergoes auto-ubiquitination by UbcH5 but not by Ubc13-Uev1a. Instead, CHIP drives the formation of unanchored polyubiquitin by Ubc13-Uev1a. CHIP also interacts productively with the class III E2 enzyme Ube2e2, in which the UbcH5- and Ubc13-binding specificity determinants are highly conserved.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The CHIP:UbcH5a structure emphasizes the importance of specificity determinants located on the long loops and central helix of the CHIP U-box, and on the N-terminal helix and loops L4 and L7 of its cognate E2 enzymes. The S-P-A motif and other specificity determinants define the set of cognate E2 enzymes for CHIP, which likely includes several Class III E2 enzymes. CHIP's interactions with UbcH5, Ube2e2 and Ubc13-Uev1a are consistent with the notion that Ubc13-Uev1a may work sequentially with other E2 enzymes to carry out K63-linked polyubiquitination of CHIP substrates.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Ubiquitination is a key posttranslational modification that is involved in most aspects of cellular homeostasis, signalling and regulation. In ubiquitination, sequential action of E1 (ubiquitin-activating), E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating) and E3 (ubiquitin ligase) proteins act sequentially to promote attachment of the 76 amino-acid polypeptide ubiquitin to a substrate protein[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Ubiquitin is attached to the substrate through an isopeptide bond between the C-terminus of ubiquitin and the &#x003b5;-amino group of a substrate lysine. E1 enzymes transfer ubiquitin to the active site cysteine of an E2 enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. E2 enzymes, in turn, bind to E3 ligases, which contain either HECT domains or a member of the structurally similar RING, PHD-like and U-box domain superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. E3 ligases also contain other domains that directly or indirectly bind substrate proteins. E3 ligases thus bring together ubiquitin-conjugated E2 enzymes and particular substrates, and also catalyze ubiquitin transfer to substrate lysines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In the absence of substrates, some E3 ligases can promote the attachment of ubiquitin to one of their own lysines, in a process termed "autoubiquitination" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Ubiquitination can result in the addition of a single ubiquitin (monoubiquitination) but also in the addition of successive ubiquitins to the first (polyubiquitination) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Successive ubiquitins are linked through one of the seven ubiquitin surface lysines. Modification by a K48-linked polyubiquitin chain targets the substrate for proteasomal degradation, the intracellular fate commonly associated with ubiquitination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Other polyubiquitin chains and monoubiquitin play roles in trafficking, DNA repair, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation and other processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>E2 enzymes exhibit high similarity in sequence and structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. There are several dozen E2 enzymes and hundreds of E3 ligases, which carry out ubiquitination in different combinations. As the identity of the E2 enzyme recruited by an E3 ligase to a particular substrate crucially influences the type and consequences of the ubiquitination, it is important to characterize the structural and biochemical parameters that govern the specificity of E2:E3 interactions.</p><p>The C-terminus of Hsp70 interacting protein (CHIP) is a homodimeric ubiquitin ligase that links chaperone function with the degradation of misfolded or unstable proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. As such, CHIP plays a key role in protein quality control, serving as a disposal mechanism for conformationally intractable proteins that might otherwise overwhelm the chaperone system. CHIP binds to C-terminal motifs found in the chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90. CHIP has three domains: an N-terminal TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat) domain through which it binds Hsp70 or Hsp90, a middle helical domain that mediates CHIP dimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and a C-terminal U-box domain that binds specific E2 enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. By recruiting a cognate E2 enzyme, CHIP promotes ubiquitination of numerous labile client proteins that are chaperoned by Hsp70 or Hsp90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These clients include proto-oncogene products, kinases, nuclear hormone receptors, and aggregation-prone proteins, such as &#x003b1;-synuclein and tau, that are involved in neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Two E2 enzymes, UbcH5 and Ubc13, have been identified as cognates for CHIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. "UbcH5" refers collectively to three highly homologous E2 enzymes, UbcH5a, b and c (88% identical, 95% similar). While the UbcH5 enzymes were previously thought to carry out K48-linked ubiquitination exclusively, recent studies have shown that they can form mixed-linkage polyubiquitin chains <italic>in vitro </italic>with several E3 ligases, including CHIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Recently, Pearl and coworkers showed that CHIP also interacts with Ubc13-Uev1a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], a heterodimeric E2 enzyme that exclusively forms K63-linked chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. K63-linked chains are primarily associated with trafficking and substrate regulation (through the mediation of new protein-protein interactions) rather than degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The crystal structure of Ubc13-Uev1a bound to the U-box of CHIP shows that Ubc13 interacts with the CHIP U-box, while neither subunit of the Ubc13-Uev1a heterodimer contacts the CHIP-TPR or dimerization domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Interaction between CHIP and these two different E2 enzymes likely results in different types of polyubiquitination and different biological outcomes. As UbcH5 and Ubc13 are similar in sequence and structure, it is unclear whether and how CHIP distinguishes between these E2 enzymes. To obtain additional insights into CHIP specificity, we solved the crystal structure of Zebrafish UbcH5a bound to the CHIP U-box domain. Despite an overall structural similarity, CHIP exhibits differences in the details of individual interactions in the UbcH5a and Ubc13-Uev1a complexes, as well as in the ability of the respective enzymes to carry out CHIP autoubiquitination (self-ubiquitination of CHIP in the absence of Hsp70 or Hsp90). The structures of the two complexes allow us to further define a set of specificity determinants required for interaction with CHIP. Based on these determinants, we identify several class III E2 enzymes as an additional, third group of cognate E2 enzymes for CHIP. As the first E3 ligase to be structurally characterized in complex with two different E2 enzymes, CHIP may serve as a useful model for understanding the basis of specificity in other E2:E3 interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Structure of the CHIP U-box: UbcH5a complex</title><p>We previously investigated the interaction between CHIP and UbcH5b using NMR and site-directed mutagenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This allowed us to identify respective binding interfaces on each protein and to propose a model for the CHIP U-box:UbcH5b complex. The model, however, was ambiguous with respect to specific interactions mediated by particular main-chain and side-chain groups, especially those involving the prominent L4 and L7 loops on the E2 enzyme. To obtain a more accurate understanding of how CHIP binds to members of the UbcH5 family, we screened full-length human and Zebrafish CHIP, as well as their respective U-box domains, for cocrystallization with human and Zebrafish UbcH5a, UbcH5b and UbcH5c. We crystallized a complex of the Zebrafish CHIP U-box and UbcH5a and solved its structure to 2.9 &#x000c5; resolution by molecular replacement (see Methods).

The U-box conformation and dimerization mode are essentially identical to those in previously described structures of free CHIP (rms<sub>d </sub>&#x0003c; 0.4 &#x000c5;), emphasizing that the U-box undergoes negligible conformational change upon binding to an E2 enzyme. The CHIP U-box structure is characteristic of the RING/PHD-like/U-box fold superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It consists of a small &#x003b2;-sheet, a central &#x003b1;-helix (termed CHIP-&#x003b1;9, as the other two domains of CHIP contain eight other alpha helices) and a C-terminal helix (CHIP-&#x003b1;10) that participates in U-box dimerization. The U-box also has two prominent loops, CHIP-L1 and CHIP-L2, which, together with CHIP-&#x003b1;9, comprise the interaction site for E2 enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Structure of the CHIP:UbcH5a complex</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

UbcH5a adopts the characteristic fold exhibited by all E2 enzyme catalytic cores, consisting of a central &#x003b2;-sheet flanked by 4 helices. The N-terminal &#x003b1;-helix (UbcH5a-&#x003b1;1) and two prominent loops, UbcH5a-L4 and UbcH5a-L7, comprise most of one side the protein and interact with the CHIP U-box (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), contacting a hydrophobic groove formed by the interface of CHIP-L1, CHIP-L2 and CHIP-&#x003b1;9. The interface buries ~700 &#x000c5;<sup>2 </sup>of solvent-accessible surface area. The overall CHIP U-box:UbcH5a complex resembles the structures of the CHIP U-box: Ubc13-Uev1a complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and the complex of the c-Cbl RING domain with the E2 enzyme UbcH7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Full-length CHIP is an asymmetric homodimer, in which the conformation of one monomer is such that its TPR domain occludes the U-box domain of the same monomer; the CHIP dimer thus contains only one E2 binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We superimposed the U-box:UbcH5a complex onto the structure of full-length mouse CHIP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The model of the CHIP:UbcH5 complex reemphasizes that E2 interactions with CHIP are mediated only through the U-box domain, while no contacts are made between the E2 and the helical or TPR domains of the CHIP dimer.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of interface between CHIP U-box and UbcH5a</title><p>Key interactions between the CHIP U-box and UbcH5a are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. (For compatibility with our <italic>in vitro </italic>ubiquitination assays, which were carried out using human rather than zebrafish CHIP, we refer to all CHIP residues according to the numbering in the human protein). The interactions are arranged around a central hydrophobic patch, in which the sidechain of UbcH5a-F62 protrudes into a concave surface formed by aliphatic portions of sidechains from both loops and helix &#x003b1;9 of the U-box (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The phenyl ring of UbcH5a-F62 also stacks against the guanidinium group of CHIP-R263, which is held in position by a salt bridge with CHIP-E259 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). These two large sidechains thus form the "back wall" of a primarily hydrophobic dimple in the CHIP U-box surface, into which UbcH5a protrudes. UbcH5a-F62 is flanked by other aliphatic residues (UbcH5a-P61, P95, A96), which contribute to the hydrophobic interaction area. An additional interaction is formed by planar stacking of the aromatic sidechain of CHIP-F237 against the guanidinium group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] of UbcH5a-R5, which leaves the arginine sidechain free to participate in an extensive <italic>intra</italic>-UbcH5a polar network (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Details of the interaction between UbcH5a and the CHIP U-box</bold>.

Several additional interactions, such as the one between UbcH5a-K8 and the CHIP-F237 carbonyl oxygen, are likely to be weak, as they are present in one of the U-box: UbcH5a complexes in the crystal asymmetric unit but not in the other. In addition, there are several charged residues on UbcH5-&#x003b1;1 and CHIP-L1 (labelled with question marks in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) that are near enough to each other to potentially engage in salt bridge interactions. The relevant sidechains, however, exhibit suboptimal interaction geometries or actually point away from their putative partner residues, suggesting that the corresponding salt bridges are weak or disfavoured.</p><p>In the absence of Hsp70/Hsp90 and a chaperone-bound client, CHIP itself is ubiquitinated by UbcH5 family E2 enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. CHIP autoubiquitination is an effective reporter of a productive interaction between CHIP and UbcH5 enzymes. We previously mutagenized the surface of the CHIP U-box to identify residues important for its interaction with UbcH5 family E2 enzymes, as gauged by <italic>in vitro </italic>CHIP autoubiquitination assays and western blotting with anti-ubiquitin antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We have now carried out ELISA-based assays (see Methods) in Nickel-NTA coated microplates to quantitate autoubiquitination of His-tagged human CHIP by human UbcH5b (which is identical to UbcH5a in the CHIP-interacting region). Our results confirm the key importance of the hydrophobic CHIP residues lining the intersection of the L1 and L2 loops and helix &#x003b1;9, including CHIP-I235, H260 and V264, as CHIP is autoubiquitinated poorly or not at all by the corresponding alanine mutants (see below). Similarly, flanking interactions mediated by F237 and R272 are crucial for productive CHIP:UbcH5 interactions, as the corresponding alanine mutants also eliminate CHIP autoubiquitination (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison between CHIP:UbcH5a and CHIP:Ubc13-Uev1a complexes</title><p>Many of the interactions shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> are also conserved in the complex between CHIP and Ubc13-Uev1a (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Superimposition of the UbcH5a:CHIP U-box and Ubc13:CHIP U-box complexes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) suggests that the interaction surfaces in the two complexes are similar, though there are several detailed differences that may influence the relative strengths of the interactions. The &#x003b1;1 helices of the two E2 enzymes are the most divergent in terms of overall structure, but this difference does not translate into large differences in the locations of the CHIP-interacting residues, such as UbcH5a-R5/Ubc13-R7, on these helices (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Interaction between Ubc13 and the CHIP U-box</bold>.

We initially tried to detect autoubiquitination of His-CHIP by Ubc13-Uev1a in Nickel-NTA plates as described above for UbcH5, but observed no CHIP autoubiquitination above background (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, column marked "*Ubc13-Uev1a"). Several previous studies have suggested that CHIP catalyzes the formation of unanchored K63-linked polyubiquitin chains by Ubc13-Uev1a, but that these chains are not conjugated to CHIP itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].

We therefore carried out a second assay using a mixture of His- and Flag-tagged ubiquitins to detect polyubiquitin chains that were not conjugated to CHIP. Our results indeed confirm that CHIP catalyzes Ubc13-Uev1a-mediated formation of unanchored, mixed Flag- and His-tagged ubiquitin chains that were readily quantified (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). However, despite the structural similarity between the CHIP:UbcH5a and CHIP:Ubc13 interfaces (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), several mutations that do not catalyze ubiquitination with UbcH5b are substantially active with Ubc13-Uev1a. Of the mutants tested, only CHIP-I235A is inactive with both E2 enzymes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).</p><p>To explore why Ubc13-Uev1a is less sensitive to many of the mutations that eliminate productive interactions between UbcH5 and CHIP, we investigated the two most obvious differences in the CHIP:UbcH5a and CHIP:Ubc13 interfaces (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). First, Ubc13-M64 is located in the same position as UbcH5-F62. Second, a salt bridge between Ubc13-R14 and CHIP-D229 is not conserved in the CHIP:UbcH5a complex; instead, UbcH5a-D12 is the equivalent of Ubc13-R14. We mutagenized these sites to investigate their importance for CHIP:E2 interactions. Surprisingly, Ubc13 is largely insensitive to mutations at the M64 position. In contrast, UbcH5a does not tolerate a methionine at the F62 position (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). The interaction between R14 and CHIP-D229 also contributes to binding between Ubc13 and CHIP, as Ubc13-R14D is inactive in polyubiquitin chain formation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Similarly, the CHIP-D229A mutant is less active in polyubiquitin chain formation by Ubc13-Uev1a than any CHIP mutants other than CHIP-I235A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). In contrast, the D229A mutation has little effect on CHIP autoubiquitination by UbcH5b.</p><p>Thus, M64 is not required to anchor the hydrophobic interface between Ubc13 and CHIP, possibly because Ubc13 has at an additional compensating salt bridge to buttress its interaction with CHIP. Indeed, the hydrophobic interface is less important overall for the Ubc13:CHIP interaction, and the CHIP-H260A and CHIP-V264A mutants also exhibited partial activity with Ubc13-Uev1a. These data suggest that the detailed binding energetics differ between the CHIP:UbcH5a and CHIP:Ubc13-Uev1a complexes, in terms of the relative importance of individual interactions for overall binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Influence of S-P-A motif in E2 enzymes on interaction with CHIP</title><p>One of the points of most intimate contacts between CHIP and UbcH5a or Ubc13-Uev1a is located at the interface of the CHIP U-box and loop L7 of the E2 enzymes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). On this loop, the motif S-P-A (residues 94&#x02013;96 of UbcH5a or residues 96&#x02013;98 of Ubc13) makes a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of CHIP-P269 and van der Waals contacts with CHIP-H260, V264 and V270. As previously noted by Pearl and coworkers, the first position within this motif is unlikely to tolerate bulkier sidechains than serine, as these would clash with the surface of the CHIP U-box [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].

The Ube2e1-3 enzymes, which contain 40&#x02013;50 residue N-terminal extensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], undergo nuclear translocation after being charged with ubiquitin from E1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].

Like UbcH5, Ube2e2cat autoubiquitinates CHIP.

While there are numerous structures of isolated E2 enzymes and E3 ligases, there are relatively few structures of E2:E3 complexes. The structures of two RING/U-box domains in complex with E2 enzymes have been solved previously: the Cbl-RING domain with UbcH7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and the CHIP U-box domains with Ubc13-Uev1a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].

The CNOT4:UbcH5 complex structure was not solved explicitly but modeled based on NMR structures of CNOT4 and UbcH5 and on experimental restraints derived from NMR data and mutagenesis [34].</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The central hydrophobic interface, formed between aliphatic groups from loops L4 and L7 of the E2 enzyme and a cluster of aliphatic groups from both structured loops and the central helix of the RING/U-box domains, is likely present in all complexes formed between E2 enzymes and RING/PHD-like/U-box ligases. A ring of primarily hydrophobic residues from the L1 and L2 loops and the central helix of the RING/U-box ligase domains define the walls of a concavity into which the tip of E2-L4 protrudes. These include a hydrophobic residue on loop L1 (such as CHIP-I216) that is an isoleucine, leucine or valine in essentially all RING/U-box domains.</p><p>The conformations of the interacting loops on both partners are strongly influenced by the positions of highly conserved proline residues, which interact directly with the rim of the hydrophobic concavity on the ligase domain. These prolines also help to position other E2 residues such as the large hydrophobic sidechain at the tip of loop L4 (such as UbcH5-F62). Correspondingly, a highly conserved proline residue on loop L2 of the RING/U-box type ligases (such as CHIP-P269) helps to position both hydrophobic and polar residues on this loop for interactions with E2 enzymes. This proline also directly interacts with the serine and alanine of the E2 S-P-A motif (which contains a third key proline residue) through its mainchain carbonyl group and through hydrophobic contacts respectively. It may be difficult to directly test the importance of these prolines by mutagenesis, as the corresponding mutants are likely to be improperly folded or insoluble in bacterial expression systems (data not shown).</p><p>The central hydrophobic interface is flanked by polar interactions contributed by sidechains from the E2-&#x003b1;1 helix and loop L7. A significant number of these determinants involve sidechain-mainchain interactions. Interestingly, several stacking interactions between arginine guanidinium groups and aromatic sidechains are present in the CHIP complexes, and likely play a role in the UbcH5:CNOT4 complex as well. In addition, an arginine on loop L2 of the ligase domains (R272 in CHIP) extends to interact with mainchain groups on loop L7 of the E2 enzymes. Overall these flanking interactions are less conserved among the E2:E3 interactions of known structure, and likely among E2:E3 complexes in general, than the central hydrophobic interaction surface. For example, no aromatic or hydrophobic residues corresponding to CHIP-F237 are present in c-Cbl or many other RING/U-box type ligases. Aromatic residues appear at this position in only a third of such ligase domains. Similarly, the flanking arginine (such as CHIP-R272) is conserved in only some U-boxes and RING domains, although there are often other polar residues with long sidechains at this position.</p><p>The relative importance of individual interactions in determining the overall affinity differs among E2:E3 complexes. For example, the CHIP-R272A and F237A mutants promote polyubiquitin formation by Ubc13 but do not interact productively with UbcH5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Similarly, Ubc13 retains its interaction with CHIP even when M64, the hydrophobic residue on loop Ubc13-L4 that points into the hydrophobic pocket of the CHIP U-box, is mutated to alanine. This residue is a tyrosine or phenylalanine in approximately half of E2 enzymes, and hydrophobic in another 25%, but polar in the remaining E2 enzymes. This residue is somewhat less conserved than is the hydrophobic character of its binding pocket on the RING/U-box domain surface. This suggests that several other residues, such as the conserved prolines on E2-L4 and L7, can provide enough hydrophobic interaction area to support some E2:E3 interactions, depending on whether other supporting interactions are present.</p><p>CHIP binds 3- to 5-fold more strongly to uncharged Ubc13 than UbcH5a in isothermal titration calorimetric measurements, although both affinities are in the micromolar range ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]; Z.X. and S.M., unpublished data). This suggests that the total binding energies are similar in the two complexes but are distributed differently among individual interactions in the binding interfaces. For example, a salt bridge is present between Ubc13-&#x003b1;1 and CHIP-L1 that has no counterpart in the UbcH5:CHIP complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The relative insensitivity of Ubc13-Uev1a to single mutations in the CHIP hydrophobic interface may also reflect the slightly higher affinity of this E2:E3 complex. It remains to be seen whether the affinity of CHIP for the ubiquitin-loaded forms of Ubc13 and UbcH5 are similar. We will also be investigating whether we can disrupt Ubc13:CHIP interactions by combining two Ubc13 mutations that, by themselves, do not disrupt interaction with CHIP.</p><p>A preponderance of hydrophobic and sidechain-mainchain interactions, rather than sidechain-sidechain interactions, promotes the close apposition of the interacting surfaces in the CHIP:UbcH5a and CHIP:Ubc13 complexes. This highlights the role that the avoidance of steric clashes may play in E2:E3 interaction selectivity. The S-P-A motif, which appears to be required for interaction with the CHIP U-box, provides an example of both negative steric selectivity and positive interaction selectivity, since the serine side chain forms a key hydrogen bond with a mainchain proline carbonyl group from the U-box. Substitution of the serine with an alanine, as in Ubc1, prevents the E2 enzyme from productively interacting with CHIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Other E2 enzymes that have bulky residues at positions equivalent to the S-P-A motif are also unable to interact with CHIP (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).</p><p>In the Cbl:UbcH7 complex, a lysine residue replaces the serine, and the local conformations of the UbcH7-L7 and Cbl-L2 loops are different than those in the UbcH5a:CHIP complex, contributing to different polar interactions and accommodating the larger lysine side chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The N-terminal helix and loops L4 and L7 have slightly different conformations in UbcH7 than their counterparts in UbcH5a and Ubc13, possibly preventing them from orienting the relevant groups correctly to partner with the CHIP U-box. For example, the key E2-&#x003b1;1 arginine residue (such as UbcH5a-R5) interacts with a different loop L1 mainchain carbonyl in the Cbl:UbcH7 and CNOT4:UbcH5b complexes than in the CHIP complexes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). An inability to form this hydrogen bond may be the reason why the UbcH7-K96S mutant did not interact productively with CHIP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Superimposition of UbcH7 onto the UbcH5a:CHIP U-box structure also suggests that UbcH7-R6, the equivalent of UbcH5a-R5, would clash with CHIP-F227, while Cbl has an alanine residue at the position corresponding to CHIP-F227 (data not shown). Interestingly, Cbl has been shown to interact with both UbcH7 and UbcH5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In addition, Cbl engages E2 enzymes not only through the RING domain but also through a secondary binding site between a helical region and the N-terminal helix of the E2 enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This may compensate for the absence of an interaction equivalent to the UbcH5a-R5: CHIP-F227 interaction.</p><p>The number and similarity of some of the specificity determinants among the known E2:E3 complexes suggests that many E3 ligases interact with more than one type of E2 enzyme. This has several potential functional consequences. One possibility is that an E3 ligase interacts with different E2 enzymes in different intracellular contexts. We found that CHIP interacts <italic>in vitro </italic>with a representative Class III E2 enzyme, Ube2e2. Ube2e2 and its close homologues Ube2e1 and Ube2e3 undergo nuclear import after they are charged with ubiquitin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. CHIP is partially localized to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], suggesting that CHIP may be a partner for these Class III E2 enzymes in the ubiquitination of nuclearly localized substrates.</p><p>Another rationale for the ability of an E3 ligase to interact with multiple E2 enzymes is specific to Ubc13. Ubc13 is the only E2 enzyme that exclusively synthesizes K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, in a manner dependent on its heterodimerization with a UEV (Ubiquitin E2 variant) protein, such as Uev1a, Uev1b or Mms2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. UEVs have an E2-like fold but lack a catalytic cysteine. Instead, they bind ubiquitin noncovalently and position K63 of the noncovalently bound ubiquitin for conjugation to the thioester-linked ubiquitin on Ubc13, thus forming K63-linked polyubiquitin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Ubc13/UEV heterodimers may be unable to directly ubiquitinate some substrates, instead forming free K63-linked chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Accumulating evidence, however, suggests that Ubc13/UEV heterodimers may also bind to a substrate-conjugated ubiquitin moiety through the UEV subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. This could allow Ubc13 to attach additional ubiquitins to the initial ubiquitin, forming a substrate-conjugated K63-linked chain. Ubc13/UEV heterodimers may thus rely on other E2 enzymes, which must be compatible with the E3 ligase participating in the ubiquitination reaction, to "preubiquitinate" a given substrate. Ubc13-Uev1a and Ubc13-Mms2 participate in distinct intracellular processes with different intracellular localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Intracellular localization may further limit which preubiquitinating E2 enzymes are available. If the preubiquitinating E2 enzyme is itself capable of polyubiquitination, the relative affinities of the preubiquitinating E2 enzyme and Ubc13 for the E3 ligase may also regulate the type of polyubiquitin chain that is added to the substrate, as both E2 enzymes may compete for binding to the E3 ligase.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this article, we describe the structural basis for the interaction of the U-box of CHIP with its cognate E2 enzyme UbcH5a. Binding of CHIP to UbcH5a and Ubc13 enzymes is mediated by a similar set of interacting groups, which resemble those observed in other structurally characterized RING:E2 enzyme complexes. The CHIP:UbcH5a complex forms through close packing of complementary hydrophobic surfaces, surrounded by polar interactions. The S-P-A motif, located on loop L7 of UbcH5a and Ubc13 acts as an important specificity determinant; E2 enzymes lacking this motif are not cognate enzymes for CHIP. Based on the conservation of the S-P-A motif, the Class III E2 enzyme Ube2e2 and its homologues Ube2e1 and Ube2e3 are also cognate E2 enzymes for CHIP. CHIP may have to interact sequentially other E2 enzymes and Ubc13-Uev1a in order to attach K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on substrates, as CHIP only stimulates the formation of free K63-polyubiquitin by Ubc13-Uev1a. This provides one functional rationale for the ability of CHIP and other E3 ligases to interact with multiple E2 enzymes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>For crystallization trials, Zebrafish (<italic>Brachydanio rerio</italic>) CHIP residues 204&#x02013;284 (encompassing the U-box) and UbcH5a were cloned into pHis||2 vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and expressed as His-tagged fusion proteins in <italic>E. coli </italic>Rosetta2(DE3) cells (Novagen) at 20&#x000b0;C for 16 hours after induction with 0.5 mM IPTG. The proteins were purified by Nickel affinity chromatography in 50 mM Sodium Phosphate pH 7.7, and 300 mM NaCl. After overnight cleavage with Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease, cleaved His-tags were removed using a second round of Nickel-affinity chromatography.

Submilligram quantities of His-tagged CHIP were purified using a protein miniprep kit (His-Spin kit, Zymo Research) and used for subsequent assays without removal of the His-tags. Larger quantities of His-tagged CHIP, Ubc13 and UbcH7 were purified by Nickel affinity chromatography as described above, except that buffers were at pH 7.4 (CHIP and Ubc13) or pH 7.8 (UbcH7). Human UbcH5b and Uev1a were cloned into pGST||2 vector, expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, and purified by glutathione-sepharose chromatography in 150 mM NaCl and 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.8.

His-tagged CHIP mutants were bacterially expressed similarly to the wild type protein and purified at small scales using the His-spin protein miniprep kit (Zymo Research). E2 enzyme mutants were expressed as GST-fusions and purified like GST-tagged Uev1a with appropriately adjusted buffer pH values.

The complex was crystallized at 20 mg/mL by hanging-drop vapor-diffusion over 1.65 M Ammonium Sulfate, 90 mM Bis-Tris (pH 6.7) at 20&#x000b0;C. Oblong crystals grew to a size of 1 &#x000d7; 0.2 &#x000d7; 0.2 mm<sup>3 </sup>after 4&#x02013;5 days.
