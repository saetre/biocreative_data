Tat stimulates formation of full-length transcripts from the HIV-1 promoter by promoting efficient transcript elongation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). Tat interacts with the bulge of transactivation response (TAR) RNA, a hairpin-loop structure at the 5'-end of all nascent viral transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Tat induces elongation of HIV-1 transcription by recruiting transcriptional co-activators that include Postive Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb), an RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and histone acetyl transferases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Whereas P-TEFb induces HIV-1 transcription from non-integrated HIV-1 template [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], histone acetyl transferases allow induction of integrated HIV-1 provirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Tat may also increase initiation of HIV-1 transcription by enhancing phosphorylation of SP1, a transcription factor involved in the basal HIV-1 transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In addition to its function in HIV-1 transcription, Tat may contribute to HIV-1 pathogenesis by regulating signal transduction in endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]; functioning as a secreted growth factor for Kaposi sarcoma and endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]; and inducing apoptosis in T-cells by binding to microtubules and delaying tubulin depolymerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Tat induces apoptosis through BIM, a pro-apoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family that antagonizes Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The effect of Tat is similar to the effect of Taxol, a drug that stabilizes microtubules and induces apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Mutations in the glutamine-rich region of Tat protein (residues 60&#x02013;72) were found to correlate with rapid progression of HIV disease, and with induction of apoptosis and binding to tubulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We previously showed that microtubules polymerization is facilitated by LIS1 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], a causative factor for Lissencephaly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], a severe brain disorder resulted from inefficient neuronal migration during early stages of brain development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. LIS1, a 45 kDa protein, contains seven repeating units called WD (Trp-Asp) repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] that form antiparallel sheets making up a toroidal propeller structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. WD repeats containing proteins are confined to eukaryotes and participate in protein-proteins interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In addition to being a microtubule binding protein, LIS1 is also a subunit of platelet-activating factor acetyl hydrolase (PAF-AH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. LIS1 interacts with dynein motor, NudC and Dynactin, a complex that regulates microtubule dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. LIS1 in addition associates with Nudel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], also a component of the dynein motor complex, and this interaction affects dephosphorylation of microtubules by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Thus, LIS1 may function as a scaffold that help to assemble dynein motor and serve to regulate proper microtubule dynamics.</p><p>In the present paper, we fractionated extracts of Jurkat T-cells using HIV-1 Tat as an affinity bait and RNAPII CTD activity of the Tat-associated proteins as a selection criteria. We identified by mass-spectrometry and immunoblotting components of the partially purified protein fraction and found LIS1, CDK7, cyclin H, and MAT1. We analyzed interaction of Tat with the identified individual proteins and found that Tat interacts with LIS1. We confirmed this finding by co-immunoprecipitating Tat and LIS1 from HeLa cells that were expressing Tat. And we also confirmed binding of Tat to LIS1 in a yeast two-hybrid system. Our results indicate that HIV-1 Tat interacts directly with LIS1, and therefore this interaction might contribute to the effect of Tat on microtubules formation in the cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>LIS1, CDK7, cyclin H, and MAT1 co-purify with Tat-associated RNAPII CTD kinase activity</title><p>We reported previously that HIV-1 Tat associates with two distinct protein kinase complexes purified from mitogenically stimulated human primary T-lymphocytes; one complex containing CDK2 and the other one CDK7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The CDK2-containing protein complex was previously purified and characterized by us [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and we showed that CDK2 regulates HIV-1 transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In the present paper, we purify and characterize the CDK7-containing protein elution peak. Whole-cell lysate from Jurkat T cells was prepared and subjected to (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>fractionation as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In accord with our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], the 40% (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>cut contained Tat-associated CTD kinase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The 40% (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>cut was subsequently fractionated on DEAE-Sepharose (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). As we previously reported, separation of the ammonium sulphate cut on DEAE-Sepharose resulted in the appearance of Tat-associated CTD hyperphosphorylating activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, fractions 34 to 36). Hyperphosphorylated CTD (CTDo) migrated on SDS-PAGE with a high degree of retardation, because of SDS repelling effect. Immunoblotting of the DEAE-Sepharose fractions 34 to 36 showed the presence of CDK7, CDK9 and a PSTAIRE-motif containing kinase, but not TFIIH (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional File 1</xref>) in accordance with our previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Further resolution of DEAE fractions 34&#x02013;36 on SP-Sepharose column showed that part of the Tat-associated CTD kinase activity was retained by the column and we previously identified this activity as containing CDK2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The other part of the Tat-associated CTD kinase activity was not retained by the column and was eluted as a flow-through fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, flow through fraction). This fraction was collected and further resolved on Hi-Trap heparin column (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Immunoblotting of the Hi-Trap heparin fractions showed that Tat-associated kinase activity co-eluted with CDK7 and also with cyclin H, but not with CDK9 or a PSTAIRE-motif containing kinase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Silver staining of the Hi-Trap heparin fractions showed that fractions 22 and 24 contained three protein bands of 35, 40, and 50 kDa which co-eluted with the Tat-associated CTD kinase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>; fractions 22 and 24, protein bands marked by stars). The Hi-Trap heparin fractions 22 to 24 were further analyzed on Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration column to determine whether CDK7, cyclin H and unknown protein bands comigrate as a single macromolecular mass. Following gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300, the Tat-associated CTD kinase activity was found in the fractions corresponding to the eluted proteins with a mass of 350 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, fraction 16&#x02013;18). Immunoblotting analysis showed that CDK7, cyclin H (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) and MAT1 (not shown) co-eluted with the Tat-associated CTD kinase activity. Fractions 16&#x02013;18 contain 32, 35, 40, 50 and 60 kDa protein bands (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, protein bands marked by stars). To determine composition of unknown protein bands, fractions 22 to 24 were combined, concentrated on Centricon-10 spin column (Amicon), recovered in SDS-loading buffer and resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following staining with colloidal Coumassie blue, only two protein bands of 35 and 50 kDa were visualized and subjected to tryptic digestion and nanoelectrospray MS (described in Experimental procedure section). The 35 kDa protein contained peptides vpflPGDSDlDqltr and YPilENPEilr (lower case letters indicate residues observed with less than full confidence) with sequence identity to CDK7 and cyclin H, respectively. The 50 kDa protein contained a peptide VWDYETGDfER with sequence identity to LIS1.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Purification of Tat Associated CTD Kinase. <italic>A</italic>, Ammonium sulfate fraction of T-cell extract. </bold>Whole cell extract of Jurkat T cells was fractionated by ammonium sulfate added sequentially to 10%, 20%, 40% and 80% saturation as described in <italic>Experimental procedures</italic>.

We expected that CDK7 might bind to Tat as their interaction was previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. We incubated fractions 18 to 24 with GST-fused Tat 1&#x02013;72, then precipitated GST-Tat with glutathione-agarose beads and analysed associated proteins on SDS-PAGE followed by a silver staining. We found that a 50 kDa protein associated with GST-Tat in fractions 20 and 22 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional file 2</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). We then asked whether LIS1, a candidate for a 50 kDa Tat-interacting protein, binds to Tat. We translated LIS1 and also translated as controls CDK7, cyclin H and MAT1, in reticulocyte lysate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) and performed GST pull down assays using GST-fused Tat 1&#x02013;72 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). LIS1 bound to Tat (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lane 4). In contrast, almost no binding was detected for CDK7, cyclin H or MAT1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lanes 1 to 3). These results contrasted with the previous report in which recombinant Tat interacted with CDK7 immunopurified from reticulocyte lysate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The main difference of our study was that we used programmed lysates rather than purified proteins. Immunoaffinity analysis showed that reticulocyte lysate contains substantial amount of endogenous LIS1 which is comparable to the amount of LIS1 in the LIS1-programmed lysate (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">Additional file 3</xref>, compare lanes 1&#x02013;3 to lane 4). Thus the excess of LIS1 might compete for the binding to Tat and prevent CDK7 interaction with Tat. To analyze whether WD domains of LIS1 might associate with Tat, we expressed each of WD domain, except domain 2 as well as the N-terminal part of LIS1, which contains a coiled-coiled motif and which is devoid of WD domains. The WD domain 1, 4, 5 or 7 bound to Tat (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lanes 6 to 11). Also the N-terminal portion of LIS1 bound weakly to Tat (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lane 5). To analyze specificity of the binding and to determine a domain of Tat that binds LIS1, several Tat mutants were utilized including Tat 1&#x02013;72, Tat 1&#x02013;48, and Tat 37&#x02013;72 and also GST as a control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Full length LIS1 bound with equal efficiency to a full length Tat, Tat 1&#x02013;48 or Tat 37&#x02013;72 but not to GST alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, lanes 2 to 5). In contrast, isolated WD5 domain of LIS1 bound most efficiently to the full length Tat 1&#x02013;72 and less efficiently to Tat 1&#x02013;48 or to Tat 37&#x02013;72 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, lanes 6 to 9). The isolated N-terminal domain of LIS1 bound strongly to GST (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, lane13), and thus its weak binding to GST-Tat (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, lane 12) is likely to be mediated by the binding to the GST moiety.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>LIS1 binds to HIV-1 Tat <italic>in vitro</italic>. </bold>Individual protein components of Tat-associated complex were translated in reticulocyte lysate containing [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine as described in the Experimental procedures section. <italic>A</italic>, Input lysates, resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE. <italic>Lane 1</italic>- CDK7; <italic>Lane 2</italic>-Cyclin H; <italic>Lane 3</italic>-MAT1; <italic>Lane 4</italic>-LIS1; <italic>Lane 5</italic>-the N-terminal domain of LIS1 (LIS NT); <italic>Lane 6</italic>- WD7; <italic>Lane 7</italic>-WD6; <italic>Lane 8 </italic>&#x02013; WD5; <italic>Lane 9 </italic>&#x02013; WD4; <italic>Lane 10</italic>- WD3; and <italic>Lane 11</italic>- WD1. <italic>B</italic>, programmed reticulocyte lysates from panel A precipitated with GST-Tat 72 immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads, and resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-2-6-4"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>WD5 domain of LIS1 interact with HIV-Tat. </bold>LIS1, WD5 domain of LIS1 (WD5) and N-terminal portion of LIS1 (LIS1 NT) were translated in reticulocyte lysate containing [<sup>35</sup>S] methionine as described in the Experimental procedures section.

LIS1, a microtubule binding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] contains WD repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] that are likely to participate in protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. LIS1 regulates microtubule dynamics by interacting with dynein motor, NudC and Dynactin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and also with Nudel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A yeast homologue of LIS1, NudF associates with NudC to regulate dynein and microtubule dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Thus, interaction of Tat with LIS1, a scaffold that assembles dynein motor, may affect microtubule dynamics.</p><p>We purified several candidate proteins that might interact with Tat, and found CDK7, cyclin H, MAT1 and LIS1. We expected that CDK7 might bind to Tat as previously it was shown to interact directly with Tat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In contrast, analysis of the binding of individually translated proteins showed that LIS1 and not CDK7 bound to Tat. We hypothesized that WD domain(s) of LIS1 might bind Tat, as these domains form a planar surface. Correspondingly, domains WD1, WD4, WD5 and WD7 were found to bind Tat but not the N-terminal part of LIS1 that contains coil-coil region, and which is devoid of WD domains. We analyzed whether a particular domain of Tat binds LIS1 or WD5 domain of LIS1. Full length Tat 1&#x02013;72 was most efficient in binding of either LIS1 or WD5 domain of LIS1. It would be interesting to determine whether CDK7 also binds to LIS1, and whether LIS1 promotes activation of the kinase activity of CDK7 by Tat. Although LIS1 is a cytoplasmic protein, it may be required for initial assembly of a protein complex containing CDK7. Our results contrasted with the previous report in which Tat binds to purified CDK7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. We hypothesize that under our experimental conditions, excess of endogenous LIS1 present in the reticulocyte lysate might compete with interaction of Tat with CDK7. Interestingly, Gaynor an colleagues only detect specific interaction of Tat with TFIIH but not with of CDK7 or CAK alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that in a complex protein mixture Tat interacts with CDK7 indirectly through another protein such as LIS1.</p><p>To explore interaction of Tat and LIS1 in cultured cells, Flag-tagged Tat was expressed in HeLa cells and then immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag-antibodies. LIS1 was found to co-immunoprecipitate with Tat. Correspondingly, when LIS1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-LIS1 monoclonal antibodies, Flag-Tat was found in the immunoprecipitates. These results suggest that Tat associates with LIS1 in cultured cells. To confirm that LIS1 and Tat interact <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used yeast two-hybrid system, in which Tat was expressed as a bait and LIS1 as a prey. Again, we found that LIS1 and Tat interacted in this system. Taken together, our <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>results demonstrate that HIV-1 Tat binds to LIS1 and that this binding is likely to occur through one of the WD domains of LIS1.</p><p>Tat contains several functionally important regions, including the N-terminal region I (residues 1&#x02013;21); cystein-rich region II (residues 22&#x02013;37); core region III (residues 38&#x02013;48); basic region IV (residues 49&#x02013;59); glutamine-rich region V (residues 60&#x02013;72); and C-terminal region VI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Zhou and his colleagues showed that Tat interacts with microtubules through parts of region II (residues 35&#x02013;37) and region III (residue 38) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. More recently, Loret and his colleagues showed that the glutamine-rich region of Tat may also interact with microtubules and promote apoptosis in T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In a following study which will appear in the same issue of Retrovirology, Loret and his colleagues show that Tat residues 38&#x02013;72 are sufficient to enhance microtubule polymerization and that the extent of the enhancement correlates with the severity of Tat-induced apoptosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Taken together these studies indicate that residues 35&#x02013;38 of regions II and III and glutamine-rich region of Tat may interact with microtubules. These results correlate well with our finding that full length Tat binds LIS1 better than the isolate domains of Tat. Whether LIS1, a cellular structural protein and also an enzymatic subunit of PAF-AH, plays a role in Tat-induced apoptosis remained to be determined. As Tat-associated proteins include CDK7, Cyclin H, MAT1 and LIS1, it is possible that interaction of Tat with LIS1 might promote binding of CDK7 and ultimately affect viral gene expression through a direct activation of CDK7 or indirectly through activation of a down stream kinase, CDK2, by CDK7. As Tat is shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm, its interaction with LIS1 and CDK7-containing protein complex might allow a temporary activation/modulation of the CDK7 activity. It is remained to be determined whether such interaction has an effect on Tat-induced transcription of HIV-1 genes. LIS1 may also function as an adaptor that brings HIV-1 Tat to microtubules that may release microtubules-associated BIM-1 protein and induce apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. A more detailed future study will address the questions of the regulation of HIV-1 transcription and Tat-mediated apoptosis by LIS1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Jurkat T-cells were purchased from National Cell Culture Center (CELLEX BIOSCIENCES, MN).

Briefly, 100 liters of Jurkat T cell culture at concentration of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml were centrifuged, washed and Dounce-homogenized in Buffer A (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml aprotinin and 10% glycerol) supplemented with 0.1% NP-40. The whole cell extract was prepared and fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. Ammonium sulfate was added to 10% saturation to extract nuclei. After centrifugation, the supernatant, containing approximately 10 g of protein, was further fractionated with ammonium sulfate added to 20%, 40% and 80% saturation. The 40% ammonium sulfate fraction (about 3.5 g of protein) was found to contain the major part of Tat-associated CTD kinase activity. This fraction was diluted with Buffer A until the conductivity was equivalent to 50 mM KCl and then loaded on a DEAE-Sepharose column (about 500 mg of protein per 50 ml column).

Protein bands visible after colloidal Coomassie blue staining and corresponding to the peak of CTD hyperphosphorylating activity after the heparin-agarose column were subjected to in-gel reduction, carboxyamidomethylation and tryptic digestion (Promega, Madison, WI). Multiple peptide sequences were determined in a single run by microcapillary reverse-phase chromatography directly coupled to a Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a custom nanoelectrospray source. The column was packed in-house with 5 cm of C18 support into a New Objective one-piece 75 um I.D. column terminating in a 15 &#x003bc;m tip. Flow rate was 190 nanoliters/min. The ion trap was programmed to acquire successive sets of three scan modes consisting of full scan MS over alternating ranges of 395&#x02013;800 m/z or 800&#x02013;1300 m/z, followed by two data dependent scans on the most abundant ion in those full scans. These data dependent scans allowed the automatic acquisition of a high resolution (zoom) scan to determine charge state and exact mass, and MS/MS spectra for peptide sequence information. MS/MS spectra were acquired with a relative collision energy of 30%, an isolation width of 2.5 Dalton and recurring ions dynamically excluded.
