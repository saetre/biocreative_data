The rat cDNA encodes a protein with 209 amino acid residues. The predicted amino acid sequence of the rat methyltransferase exhibits considerable homology with those of the human, yeast and bacterial enzymes, especially around putative methyl acceptor sites. When the cDNA was placed under control of the lac promoter and expressed in methyltransferase-deficient Escherichia coli (ada-, ogt-) cells, a characteristic methyltransferase protein was produced. The rat DNA methyltransferase thus expressed could complement the biological defects of the E. coli cell caused by lack of its own DNA methyltransferases; e.g. increased sensitivity to alkylating agents in terms of both cell death and mutation induction.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00100-0124-a" xlink:role="5599"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00100-0122.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5597"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00100-0123.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5598"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00100-0124.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5599"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00100-0125.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5600"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00100-0126.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5601"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
