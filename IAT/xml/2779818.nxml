Two groups of corresponding enzymes, histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyl-transferases (HATs) act in concert to maintain the balance between condensed and relaxed chromatin by catalyzing the removing or adding of acetyl groups to specific lysine-rich amino terminal histone residues. Chromatin condensation due to high HDAC activity leads to transcriptional silencing of a subset of genes involved in differentiation and inhibition of proliferation, apoptosis and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, HDACs are able to directly deacetylate tumor relevant non-histone proteins such as p53, GATA-1, &#x003b2;-catenin and NF-&#x003ba;B (RelA/p65) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], which may alter their activity, subcellular localization and interaction partners.</p><p>In humans, four structurally diverse classes of HDACs comprising 18 isoforms have been identified so far with class I HDACs 1, 2 and 3 being the best characterized and most abundantly expressed isoforms in tumor tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Due to the fact that aberrant HDAC activity has been associated with the occurrence of different types of cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], a variety of clinically applicable HDAC inhibitors (HDIs) have been developed and tested during the past few decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>HDIs have shown to suppress tumor growth and to induce differentiation and apoptosis in various studies both, <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Some of them including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and valproic acid (VPA) are in late-phase clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumors and show promising effects with low toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Recently SAHA was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the clinical use in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Due to the high chemoresistance and the fact that only 5-28% of pancreatic carcinomas are surgically resectable at the time of diagnosis the possibilities of curative therapy are highly restricted. Thus, 5-year survival rate is lower than 5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. New strategies for the treatment of pancreatic carcinoma, particularly with regard to the avoiding of chemoresistance are urgently needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Reduced sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents is often associated with a constitutive active Rel/NF-&#x003ba;B pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The Rel/NF-&#x003ba;B family consists of various members of transcription factors, p50/p105 (NF-&#x003ba;B1), p52/p100 (NF-&#x003ba;B2), c-Rel, RelB and p65 (RelA), which are responsible for the regulation of immune and inflammation related genes such as cytokines, cytokine-receptors and cell adhesion molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Overexpression and/or dysregulation of certain regulatory proteins of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, e.g. the heterodimer p65/p50, have been linked to higher tumor grade and poor prognosis in consequence of increased cell proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>NF-&#x003ba;B activation can be regulated at several levels. In resting cells, inactivated NF-&#x003ba;B is sequestered in the cytoplasm by the inhibitory factor I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;. In response to specific pro-inflammatory signals such as tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) and interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;), I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; becomes phosphorylated, ubiquitinylated and subsequently degradated allowing a rapid nuclear translocation and thereby activation of NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Apart from translocation based activation, NF-&#x003ba;B can be regulated by proteolytic procession or posttranslational modifications like HDAC mediated acetylation or deacetylation, suggesting a potential RelA/p65 inhibitory effect of HDIs like SAHA and VPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>In this study we, for the first time, investigated the expression of class I HDACs in a large cohort of human pancreatic carcinomas. Due to the pivotal role of RelA/p65 in the tumorigenesis of pancreatic carcinoma we correlated our findings with RelA/p65 expression status. Based on the fact that RelA/p65 is a putative target of HDIs, we additionally tested the effects of the two well known HDIs SAHA and VPA on RelA/p65 activity <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Population</title><p>Tissue samples from 81 patients who underwent partial pancreaticoduodenectomy for primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma at the Charit&#x000e9; University Hospital between 1991 and 2000 were used in this study.

Immunohistochemistry was done as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Nuclear staining of HDAC isoforms was scored by applying a semiquantitative immunoreactivity scoring (IRS) system, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Briefly, intensity of staining as well as percentage of cells stained was evaluated separately. The IRS for each individual case ranging from 0 to 12 was calculated by multiplication of the intensity and frequency scores. Cases exhibiting an IRS from 0-6 were combined in one group (HDAC negative), cases with an IRS of more than 6 were combined in a HDAC positive group. In addition, the patients were grouped according to their overall class I HDAC expression pattern (all three isoforms negative <italic>versus </italic>one or two isoforms positive <italic>versus </italic>all three isoforms positive).

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma displayed strong nuclear immunoreactivity for HDAC1 (32%), HDAC2 (63%), HDAC3 (79%) and RelA/p65 (45%) in a considerable number of cases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Some expression was also evident in desmoplastic stroma cells and inflammatory cells. Raw expression scores of HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC3 correlated significantly with each other (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), suggesting a shared regulation of these isoforms. High HDAC2 expression was significantly associated with poor tumor differentiation (p = 0.039). No other correlations of HDAC isoforms with clinico-pathological parameters were found (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Interestingly, we found a positive correlation between RelA/p65 expression and HDAC isoform expression. Categorized grouped HDAC scores significantly correlated with the presence of nuclear RelA/p65 (p = 0.028, data not shown). To further elucidate the strength of the relationship, raw expression scores were compared. Here we found that both cytoplasmic as well as nuclear RelA/p65 positivity was significantly linked with the expression of specific HDAC isoforms, the strength of those correlations were weak to moderate. When the grouped HDAC scores were correlated with RelA/p65 expression, only the relation to nuclear RelA/p65 expression was significant (p = 0.024). The correlation with cytoplasmic RelA/p65 expression showed borderline significance (p = 0.059, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This supports a functional relationship between HDAC activity and RelA/p65 expression and nuclear translocation (indicating activation). In contrast to nuclear RelA/p65 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] expression of HDAC isoforms 1, 2 and 3 did not have prognostic impact in univariate survival analyses (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).

Since the amount of activated RelA/p65 was comparatively low under cytokine absence, RelA/p65 activity was enhanced by stimulation with IL-1&#x003b2;. Stimulation of cells with IL-1&#x003b2; led to an increase of RelA/p65 activity of ~40% in PANC-1 cells. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, wild type competitor duplex, but not mutant NF-&#x003ba;B competitor duplex was able to prevent RelA/p65 from binding to the attached consensus sequence. RelA/p65 specific siRNA knockdown, whose efficacy was checked by immunoblotting, reduced RelA/p65 binding activity by ~50% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, treatment with SAHA and to a lesser degree treatment with VPA resulted in a time-dependent reduction of RelA/p65 activity of up to 50%. In PANC-1 cells, 24 h of VPA treatment decreased RelA/p65 activity by approximately 25%, however, this effect could not be intensified by extension of treatment periods and was not statistically significant. Although lesser effects were also seen for SAHA at shorter time points, a strong and significant RelA/p65 inhibitory effect was only seen after 72 h. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, treatment of cells with 8 &#x003bc;M SAHA for 72 hours was able to diminish RelA/p65 binding activity to the same degree as specific RelA/p65 siRNA knockdown did (~50%). In addition, we found an influence of HDIs SAHA and VPA on the subcellular localization of RelA/p65 by exploratory immunofluorescence analysis. The results of RelA/p65 specific immunofluorescence are shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. In untreated (2C) PANC-1 cells we observed a strong signal of RelA/p65 predominantly in the nucleus. Both SAHA (2D) and, to a lesser degree VPA (2E), led to a cytoplasmic retention of the protein after 72 h in stimulated cells.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of HDIs on DNA binding activity and nuclear translocation of RelA/p65 in stimulated PANC-1 cells</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Signal specificity of the transcription factor assay was ensured by the use of Wild Type NF-&#x003ba;B Competitor Duplex (WT) (normalized to Mutant NF-&#x003ba;B Competitor Duplex (Mut.)) as well as by specific RelA/p65 siRNA treatment (72 h, normalized to Control siRNA) (*: p = 0.05; columnar t-test); Western Blot showing specific knockdown of RelA/p65 protein expression by RelA/p65 siRNA treatment in comparison with control siRNA and untreated cells. <bold>(B) </bold>RelA/p65 binding activity as measured in a transcription factor assay was markedly diminished in response to 72 h of HDI treatment (*: p = 0.05; columnar t-test, IL-1&#x003b2; stimulated PANC-1 cells). <bold>(C-E) </bold>RelA/p65 specific immunofluorescence.

Furthermore, we could demonstrate that HDAC inhibitors are effective in inhibiting nuclear activation and binding capability of RelA/p65 in pancreatic cancer cells.</p><p>Although there is strong evidence that aberrant HDAC activity can contribute to the development of cancer, reports on isoform specific expression patterns of HDACs in tumor tissue are sparse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In line with previous studies of our group, which focussed on HDAC expression in malignancies of other organs like prostate and colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], pancreatic tumor tissue displayed a high degree of class I HDAC expression with HDAC3 being the most abundantly expressed isoform. Additionally, our <italic>in vivo </italic>data indicate that a distinct HDAC "high" subgroup is likely to show strong RelA/p65 nuclear translocation/activity, which is of particular interest in pancreatic carcinoma, since activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway is associated with pancreatic cancer development and progression and is an adverse prognosticator for this entity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, unlike RelA/p65, high class I HDAC expression did not attain statistical significance for overall survival in pancreatic carcinoma in our study, which might be explained by the fact that although we see a correlation between those parameters in our <italic>in vivo </italic>data the correlation is not extremely strong. This suggests that RelA/p65 is only partly regulated/activated by strong HDAC expression. Furthermore, nuclear RelA/p65 as well as cytoplasmic (borderline significant) RelA/p65 positivity was linked to increased HDAC expression when comparing the distributions of raw expression data, which suggests at least in part a transcriptional regulation and not only a post transcriptional modification of RelA/p65 activity by HDACs.</p><p>Our survival results are somewhat in contrast to the results reported by Miyake et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], who found a prognostic impact of HDAC1 expression in a moderately large cohort (39 cases) of pancreatic cancers. We cannot exclude that in certain cohorts of pancreatic cancer (e.g. Japanese patients) such a correlation might exist, however, in our Western European cohort which is twice as large (82 cases) as Miyake's cohort, we were not able to confirm these findings and therefore have to conclude that this observed correlation is not universially applicable. Since cut-off values for defining HDAC1 positive/negative cases in Miyake's and our study were different, we repeated our analysis with the cut-offs used by Miyake. However, this did not result in a significant survival difference, either (p &#x0003e; 0.05, data not shown).</p><p>The finding that HDAC activity is linked to the activity of RelA/p65 in pancreatic carcinoma <italic>in vivo </italic>could be also confirmed in an <italic>in vitro </italic>cell culture model, where treatment of cells with the HDI SAHA led to a markedly decrease in nuclear translocation and binding activity of RelA/p65. This is in line with previous studies which reported RelA/p65 inhibitory effects of HDIs like Trichostatin A and SAHA in other cell culture systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In contrast, Chen et. al. reported an increase in nuclear translocation and activation of RelA/p65 in response to HDI treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] which suggests that the impact of enhanced RelA/p65 acetylation is dependent on the tumor entity and the HDI used.</p><p>The underlying mechanisms and the consequences of RelA/p65 acetylation and deacetylation can't be clarified completely within the scope of this translational work. This should be done in future functional studies. One possible mechanism by which RelA/p65 could be inhibited by HDIs might be the loss of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; phosphorylation, which we observe in our <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments and which should lead to an enhanced I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; accumulation and sequestering of RelA/p65 in the cytoplasm.</p><p>Even though treatment with VPA resulted in a partial removal of nuclear translocated RelA/p65 into the cytoplasm in our experiments as well, VPA was less effective in inhibiting DNA binding activity of the transcription factor than SAHA. The different effectiveness of the two HDIs in deactivating RelA/p65 might be explained by the fact that SAHA is known to act on various HDAC isoforms whereas VPA preferentially inhibits class I HDACs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Strong antineoplastic effects of SAHA like growth inhibition, induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest have been demonstrated in various studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Our <italic>in vitro </italic>data on inhibition of RelA/p65 activity indicate that these effects could be partly based on an alteration of the NF-&#x003ba;B signalling pathway. This finding could be of special interest for the development of new treatment strategies for pancreatic carcinoma, since chronic inflammation due to elevated activities of mediators like NF-&#x003ba;B are conductive to pancreatic carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Furthermore, conventional chemotherapeutics like gemcitabine or paclitaxel are often associated with high resistance rates in pancreatic neoplasms, which is partly due to a constitutively activated RelA/NF-&#x003ba;B pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. A combinational treatment with HDIs which are able to inhibit RelA/p65 activity might be of use to overcome such resistances.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that class I HDACs are overexpressed in pancreatic cancer and that high class I HDAC expression is significantly correlated to nuclear translocation of the transcription factor RelA/p65 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
