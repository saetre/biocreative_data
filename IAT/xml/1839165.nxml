Although the key player of retroviral integration is viral integrase, a role for cellular cofactors has been proposed. Lentiviral integrases use the cellular protein LEDGF/p75 to tether the preintegration complex to the chromosome, although the existence of alternative host proteins substituting for the function of LEDGF/p75 in integration has been proposed. Truncation mutants of LEDGF/p75 lacking the chromosome attachment site strongly inhibit HIV replication by competition for the interaction with integrase. In an attempt to select HIV strains that can overcome the inhibition, we now have used T-cell lines that stably express a C-terminal fragment of LEDGF/p75. Despite resistance development, the affinity of integrase for LEDGF/p75 is reduced and replication kinetics in human primary T cells is impaired. Detection of the integrase mutations A128T and E170G at key positions in the LEDGF/p75&#x02013;integrase interface provides in vivo evidence for previously reported crystallographic data. Moreover, the complementary inhibition by LEDGF/p75 knockdown and mutagenesis at the integrase&#x02013;LEDGF/p75 interface points to the incapability of HIV to circumvent LEDGF/p75 function during proviral integration. Altogether, the data provide a striking example of the power of viral molecular evolution. The results underline the importance of the LEDGF/p75 HIV-1 interplay as target for innovative antiviral therapy. Moreover, the role of LEDGF/p75 in targeting integration will stimulate research on strategies to direct gene therapy vectors into safe landing sites.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Viruses have a limited genome and therefore exploit the cellular machinery of infected host cells to complete the replication cycle. Today there is a growing interest to unravel these virus&#x02013;host interactions. Lentiviral integrases use the cellular protein LEDGF/p75 to tether the preintegration complex to the chromosome, although the existence of alternative host proteins substituting for the function of LEDGF/p75 has been proposed. Here, we used virus evolution to investigate the role and importance of LEDGF/p75 in HIV integration and replication. We selected a virus that is resistant against overexpression of the integrase binding domain of LEDGF/p75. This virus displays a reduced affinity for its own cofactor but still depends on the cofactor for replication. We demonstrate the unique and essential role of LEDGF/p75 in HIV replication and support the LEDGF/p75 HIV-1 interplay as target for innovative antiviral therapy. Moreover, elucidation of the role of LEDGF/p75 in targeting integration will stimulate research on strategies to direct gene therapy vectors into safe landing sites.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Hombrouck A, De Rijck J, Hendrix J, Vandekerckhove L, Voet A, et al.

The fusion protein eGFP-&#x00394;325 consists of the C-terminal fragment of LEDGF/p75 (amino acids 325 to 530) fused to the C terminus of eGFP. In WT MT-4 cells, the viral IN associates with LEDGF/p75 and is tethered to the chromatin, facilitating the integration of the viral cDNA in the host genome.

Apparently, the bulky side chain of threonine causes sterical hindrance, thereby forcing the I368 residue of the IBD to adapt a different conformation. This occurs without a drastic influence on the conformation of residues in the LEDGF/p75&#x02013;IN binding interface. Substituting glutamic acid for glycine at position 170 has a more drastic effect. This mutation results in a different conformation of the loop disrupting two interactions. First, the double hydrogen bond between the hydrogens of the loop backbone at residues E170 and H171 and D366, a critical interacting residue on LEDGF/p75, is broken. Second, the electrostatic interaction of E170 (IN) with K364 (LEDGF/p75) is abolished. These effects cause a significant decrease in binding affinity, with an increase in predicted binding energy from &#x02212;68.02 to &#x02212;56.38 kcal/mol.

FCCS measurements suggest that by altering the affinity of IN for the cofactor, HIV-1 may be capable to discriminate between endogenous LEDGF/p75 and the inhibiting C-terminal fragment (eGFP-&#x00394;325). Alternatively, HIV-1 that has become deficient for interaction with LEDGF/p75 may replicate independently from LEDGF/p75, by employing another cofactor. The latter explanation has been put forward recently after analysis of integration sites in LEDGF/p75 knockdown cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030047-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. LEDGF/p75 knockdown only resulted in a modest shift in integration site selection. To address this question, replication of the virus resistant to eGFP-&#x00394;325 overexpression was followed in LEDGF/p75 knockdown cells. Stable polyclonal MT-4 LEDGF/p75 knockdown cells were generated using lentiviral vectors encoding shRNA targeting LEDGF/p75 (MT-4 p75&#x02212;). As a control, four mutations were introduced in the short hairpin against LEDGF/p75, and MT-4 cells were generated (MT-4 mut). Efficiency of knockdown was verified by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030047-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). Infection of these cell lines with WT NL4.3 at an MOI of 0.5 resulted in a 5- to 10-fold reduction in viral replication as measured by p24 antigen production in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030047-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). In the control cells encoding the mutant hairpin (MT-4 mut), no reduction of HIV-1 replication was observed. No breakthrough of the mutant NL4.3 A128T/E170G virus was detected up to 10 d postinfection in MT-4 p75&#x02212; cells (MOI 0.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030047-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). Moreover, viral replication of the NL4.3 A128T/E170G virus was inhibited 10-fold more than that of WT virus in MT-4 p75&#x02212; cells. In the control MT-4 mut cells, both strains showed equivalent viral replication. The inhibitory effect on the WT virus in the MT-4 p75&#x02212; cells could be overcome by using a higher MOI (MOI 2.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030047-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). However, at the same MOI, NL4.3 A128T/E170G replication remained 10-fold lower. The same experiment was performed in the LEDGF/p75 knockdown Jurkat cells p75(&#x02212;) Cl 2 (Jurkat p75&#x02212;) and p75(&#x02212;) Cl 2 backcomplemented (BC) (Jurkat BC) cells that were originally reported by Llano et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030047-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.

We reason that replication of the mutant virus should not be inhibited in cells with highly reduced levels of LEDGF/p75, if this replication occurs independently of LEDGF/p75. To the contrary, our experiments suggest that the virus resistant to eGFP-&#x00394;325 overexpression has a reduced affinity for LEDGF/p75, making it more vulnerable to reduction of LEDGF/p75 levels. It is clear that LEDGF/p75 is still employed by the virus for viral replication in eGFP-&#x00394;325 overexpressing cells.

As biomolecular modelling suggests, mutating these residues compromises the local structure of the IBD&#x02212;IN CCD interface, affecting the interaction with LEDGF/p75 truncation mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030047-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Our data provide a striking example of the power of viral molecular evolution. Not only is the approach apparently more relevant than in vitro mutagenesis, a virus appears to discriminate between a fragment of a critical cofactor and the full-length cofactor itself.</p><p>To overcome inhibition by &#x00394;325, mutations in the IN&#x02013;IBD interface are selected. These mutations cripple the virus considerably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030047-g004">Figure 4</xref>). It has been demonstrated before that mutations associated with antiviral resistance to diketo acids reduce the enzymatic activity of IN &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030047-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030047-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;.

Still, our results show that viral replication is more affected than enzymatic activity. The most plausible explanation for the observed phenotype is that by altering the affinity for the inhibiting C-terminal fragment, interaction with the critical cofactor LEDGF/p75 is also jeopardized. Indeed, poor replication of the double mutant virus in WT cells could be rescued by overexpression of LEDGF/p75 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030047-sg005">Figure S5</xref>B). Although HIV strains have been selected to grow independently of restriction factors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030047-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030047-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;, this is to our knowledge the first example of selection of a virus that is partially defective for binding to its cellular cofactor. Although humans carrying a 32&#x02013;base pair deletion of the <italic>CCR5</italic> gene are resistant to HIV-1 infection, no R5 virus has yet been isolated that overcomes this inhibitory effect; infection is only possible via T-tropic virus that uses the CXCR4 coreceptor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030047-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The reduced replication kinetics of the mutated virus were further analyzed by quantitative PCR analysis of 293T cells infected with VSV-G pseudotyped A128T/E170G virus. We detected a 4-fold decrease in the number of 2-LTR circles and in integrated provirus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030047-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). In previous experiments in which integration was impaired due to partial depletion of LEDGF/p75 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030047-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030047-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; or to the presence of competing C-terminal fragments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030047-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, the amount of 2-LTR circles was either constant or increased. The reduction in 2-LTR circles might indicate that the mutations in IN affect nuclear import of the PIC or the formation of 2-LTR circles. We cannot exclude that reduced interaction with LEDGF/p75 is responsible for this phenotype. Our previous finding that LEDGF/p75 drastically increases the affinity of lentiviral IN for DNA may imply a role of LEDGF/p75 in the formation of the complex between IN and the viral DNA. This is the first experimental evidence suggesting that IN-LEDGF/p75 interaction might affect steps other than chromosomal tethering/targeting. The documented presence of LEDGF/p75 in the cytoplasmatic PIC is consistent with this concept &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030047-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Analysis of DNA formation by the mutant virus in eGFP-&#x00394;325 overexpressing 293T cells revealed that integration of the resistant virus in the 293T eGFP-&#x00394;325 cells was restored (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030047-sg002">Figure S2</xref>F). Whereas the number of 2-LTR circles produced by WT virus increased more than 10-fold in the 293T eGFP-&#x00394;325 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030047-sg002">Figure S2</xref>E) as a result of the defect in integration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030047-sg002">Figure S2</xref>F) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030047-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, the number of 2-LTR circles returned to almost normal levels when the cells were infected with A128T/E170G virus. These data confirm that the C-terminal fragments specifically block the integration and/or targeting step.</p><p>What is the mechanism underlying the resistant phenotype observed? Our in vitro data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030047-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and in vivo confocal microscopy analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030047-sg003">Figure S3</xref>) both reveal experimentally that the mutations that reduce interaction with eGFP-&#x00394;325 also decrease interaction with full-length LEDGF/p75. The available structural data support this result. The fact that A128T/E170G IN displays a reduced affinity for full-length LEDGF/p75 seems to suggest at first sight that HIV can replicate without LEDGF/p75 perhaps using an alternative cofactor. In fact, because of the subtle alterations in target site selection after LEDGF/p75 depletion, the existence of such a secondary targeting cofactor has been proposed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030047-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. However, replication of the resistant virus in LEDGF/p75 knockdown MT-4 cells was inhibited 10-fold more than that of WT virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030047-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). Moreover, replication of A128T/E170G virus was also severely impaired in the Jurkat p75&#x02212; cells, which support normal replication of WT virus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030047-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030047-g007">Figure 7</xref>D). It follows that LEDGF/p75 is still employed by the resistant virus that is capable to grow in eGFP-&#x00394;325 overexpression cells. In fact, poor replication of the double mutant virus in WT cells is rescued by overexpression of LEDGF/p75 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030047-sg005">Figure S5</xref>B), corroborating that the A128T/E170 IN mutant virus still exploits LEDGF/p75 in vivo<italic>.</italic> Although we cannot formally exclude the remote possibility that both mutations also affect binding of the alternative cofactor, its existence has become unlikely. Reduction of the affinity of IN for LEDGF/p75 results in a clear phenotype even in cells with partial depletion of LEDGF/p75. Hence, the failure by Llano et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030047-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d; to detect a replication deficit in Jurkat p75&#x02212; is due to an insufficient knockdown, as proposed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030047-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030047-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Apparently, reduced interaction with LEDGF/p75 is preferred rather than ineffective targeting to the chromatin in the absence of LEDGF/p75.</p><p>Replication of A128T/E170G virus in MT-4 cells overexpressing LEDGF/p75 truncation mutants suggests that its affinity for eGFP-&#x00394;325 is more reduced than for LEDGF/p75, taking into account that eGFP-&#x00394;325 is in excess of LEDGF/p75 (unpublished data). Differential impact of the A128T/E170G mutation on interaction of recombinant IN with full-length LEDGF/p75 or the C-terminal fragment could not be documented in vitro by pull-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030047-g005">Figure 5</xref>A) or AlphaScreen technology (unpublished data). Probably, these assays do not reflect the in vivo situation. In vivo FCCS experiments, however, revealed that mutant IN has a different affinity for the cofactor and the inhibiting C-terminal fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030047-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Domains in LEDGF/p75 other than the C-terminus may contribute to the interaction with IN. Alternatively, the fusion of &#x00394;325 to eGFP may also aid A128T/E170G IN to preferentially bind to LEDGF/p75.</p><p>The importance of LEDGF/p75 for HIV replication has been demonstrated over time using mutagenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030047-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;, RNA interference &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030047-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030047-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, or overexpression of truncation mutants &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030047-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. However, none of these experiments could exclude the existence of other cofactors capable of tethering the PIC to the chromosomes. Our data indicate that HIV is incapable to circumvent the LEDGF/p75 function during integration. Our approach may prove valuable in validating other cellular cofactors of virus replication. Demonstration of the biological relevance of the available LEDGF/p75&#x02013;IN interface, the impaired replication kinetics upon resistance selection to an interaction inhibitor, and the exclusive role in HIV integration all support the attraction of LEDGF/p75 as an antiviral target.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmids and viral vectors.</title><p>The construction of the lentiviral vector transfer plasmids encoding shRNA targeting LEDGF/p75 was described previously (unpublished data).
