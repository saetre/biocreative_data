To test the role of Isn1p <italic>in vivo</italic>, we took advantage of mutants in the <italic>ADE4 </italic>gene increasing the flux in the IMP biosynthesis pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In these mutants, hypoxanthine and inosine are excreted in the growth medium, most probably as a result of degradation of overproduced IMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We therefore used such an IMP overproducing mutant to assay whether IMP degradation would be affected in an <italic>isn1 </italic>mutant strain. A plasmid (P2047) overexpressing a dominant mutant form of <italic>ADE4 </italic>leading to purine excretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] was transformed in wild-type and <italic>isn1 </italic>yeast strains and purine excretion was assayed. Indeed, crossfeeding experiments revealed that hypoxanthine excretion (allowing growth of a halo of hypoxanthine auxotrophic cells) was much lower in an <italic>isn1 </italic>mutant strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Analysis of the purine compounds excreted in the growth medium by isogenic wild-type and <italic>isn1 </italic>mutant strains revealed very different excretion patterns (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). While the P2047-transformed wild-type strain excreted inosine, hypoxanthine and also a significant amount of IMP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) (compared to the non-excreting control, not shown), in the P2047-transformed mutant strain, IMP only was still efficiently excreted, whereas neither inosine nor hypoxanthine were detected in the growth medium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). This result clearly shows that Isn1p plays a critical role in IMP degradation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Excretion of purine compounds in the <italic>isn1 </italic>mutant strain. </bold>(A.)

One possibility is that Isn1p could be involved in scavenging IMP toxic derivatives or analogs. Our attempts to document such an effect were unsuccessful : the <italic>isn1 </italic>knock-out mutant, grown in the presence of several purine analogs (8-azaadenine, 6-chloropurine, 8-azaguanine, 6-mercaptopurine, 2,6-diaminopurine...), did not show any growth alteration compared to the isogenic wild-type strain (data not shown). Alternatively, Isn1p could play some role in DNA repair. Indeed, transcriptome analysis revealed that <italic>ISN1 </italic>transcription increased three folds when cells were treated with methyl methanesulfonate, a DNA damaging agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and furthermore, Isn1p co-purified with Mlh1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], a protein involved in mismatch repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It is therefore tempting to propose that Isn1p could for example be involved in removing dIMP residues resulting from deamination of dAMP. However, while the mutagenic effect of dIMP has been documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], this deoxynucleotide is a poor substrate for Isn1p <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Whatever its involvement in DNA damage response, it is clear that Isn1p activity is present in normally growing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This result together with the extreme substrate specificity of Isn1p argues for a physiological role of Isn1p in IMP metabolism. Deregulation of IMP production leads to excretion of inosine and hypoxanthine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], suggesting that IMP should not normally accumulate, and we have shown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) that Isn1p is clearly required for this process. However, overproduction of IMP in an <italic>isn1 </italic>mutant strain did not result in any obvious growth phenotype that would help us to further understand why yeast cells have developped such an efficient way of degrading IMP to inosine and hypoxanthine. Therefore, while the enzymatic activity of Isn1p is well characterized, its physiological role still remains unclear.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this paper we report the identification of a new yeast gene, <italic>ISN1 </italic>(<italic>YOR155c</italic>), as encoding IMP-specific 5'-nucleotidase activity.

The gel was rehydrated in digestion buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 10% acetonitrile) containing 5 &#x003bc;g/mL of endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche Applied Science). Digestion was carried out for 16 h at 37&#x000b0;C in a minimal volume allowing total immersion of gel pieces and was stopped by addition of 1% (final concentration) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Peptides recovered from the digestion mix and from the gel pieces through three cycles of extraction with 60% acetonitrile, 0.1%TFA in water, were then pooled and concentrated in a Speed-Vac. Finally, a micro-chromatographic separation step of proteolytic digest was performed by means of a C18 ZipTip (Millipore), using a 10 &#x003bc;l sample load. The elution was achieved with 2 &#x003bc;l of 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA in water</p></sec><sec><title>Mass spectrometry</title><p>The matrix assisted laser desorption-ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometer was a Reflex III (Bruker) instrument equipped with a 337 nm laser source, ion gate and ion reflector suitable for Post Source Decay (PSD) experiments. &#x003b1;-Cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (Sigma) was used as a matrix (saturated solution in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% aqueous TFA). The dried droplet method was used for sample loading on stainless steel targets. External mass calibration was achieved with a mixture of eight peptides (angiotensin, bradikynin, bombesin, ACTH clips and oxidized insulin B chain, all from Sigma) covering the m/z 1000&#x02013;3500 range. For PSD analysis, the reflector voltage was stepped down in 10 to 12 steps, starting from 30 kV, in order to collect fragment ions from the precursor down to immonium ions. Data base search was effected by means of the Protein Prospector MS-Fit ans MS-Tag search engines <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://falcon.ludwig.ucl.ac.uk"/>, using a mass tolerance of 0.2 Da for precursor ions, and 0.5 Da for PSD fragment ions.</p></sec><sec><title>Yeast strains and media</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study were purchased from Euroscarf.</p><p>BY4741: <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a </bold><italic>ura3&#x00394;0 leu2&#x00394;0 met15&#x00394;0 his3&#x00394;1</italic></p><p>Y02411: <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a </bold><italic>ura3&#x00394;0 leu2&#x00394;0 met15&#x00394;0 his3&#x00394; yor155c::KanMX4</italic></p><p>SD is 0.17% nitrogen base, 2% glucose and 0.5% ammonium sulfate.

The reaction mixture contained 100 mM imidazole/HCl buffer (pH 6.5), 25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% BSA, 10 mM phosphomonoester substrate and appropriate amount of cell extracts. For IMP-specific 5'-nucleotidase assay IMP was used as a substrate. For assay of non-specific phosphatases, phenylphosphate or 1-glycerophosphate was used as a substrate. One unit of the enzyme activity corresponds to the release of 1 &#x003bc;mol of Pi/min from the substrate.

Separation of purine compounds of the medium was achieved by HPLC on a Supelcosil LC-18 5 &#x003bc;m reversed phase column using a step gradient set up with A buffer (0.01 M KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) and B buffer (20% A buffer &#x02013; 80% methanol). The following proportions of A and B buffers, respectively (indicated in parentheses) were used at the indicated run time : 0 min (97/3), 13 min (89/11), 17 min (75/25), 19 min (30/70) and 27 min (97/3) and the flow rate was 1 ml/min. Excreted purine compounds separation was monitored by following absorbance at 260 nm at the column end and the different peaks obtained were identified by comparison with the retention time of known standards.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RI carried out Isn1p purification and enzymatic activities studies.
