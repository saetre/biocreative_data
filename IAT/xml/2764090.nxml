The discovery of a class of small noncoding RNAs, called microRNAs, implies alternative mechanism of regulation of HIF-1&#x003b1;. Here, we show that miR-20b plays an important role in fine-tuning the adaptation of tumor cells to oxygen concentration. The inhibition of miR-20b increased the protein levels of HIF-1&#x003b1; and VEGF in normoxic tumor cells; the increase of miR-20b in hypoxic tumor cells, nevertheless, decreased the protein levels of HIF-1&#x003b1; and VEGF. By using luciferase reporter vector system, we confirmed that miR-20b directly targeted the 3&#x02032;UTR of <italic>Hif1a</italic> and <italic>Vegfa</italic>. On the other hand, the forced overexpression of HIF-1&#x003b1; in normoxic tumor cells downregulated miR-20b expression. However, HIF-1&#x003b1; knockdown in hypoxic tumor cells caused the increase of miR-20b. The differential expression of miR-20b has important biological significance in tumor cells, either enhancing the growth or favoring the survival of tumor cells upon the oxygen supply. Thus, we identify a novel molecular regulation mechanism through which miR-20b regulates HIF-1&#x003b1; and VEGF and is regulated by HIF-1&#x003b1; so to keep tumor cells adapting to different oxygen concentrations.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypoxia is a common feature in solid tumors as the consequence of poor tumor vascularization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Choi1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Liao1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a key regulator responsible for the induction of genes that facilitate adaptation and survival of tumor cells from hypoxic microenvironment and confer the tumor a worse malignant phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Semenza1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Weidemann1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. As a heterodimeric complex, HIF-1 consists of a hypoxically inducible subunit HIF-1&#x003b1; and a constitutively expressed subunit HIF-1&#x003b2;. The overexpression of HIF-1&#x003b1; was found in various types of cancers of both human and mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Semenza1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Ke1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. To date, the regulation of HIF-1&#x003b1; by oxygen is elucidated well. Under normoxia, hydroxylation of two proline residues and acetylation of a lysine residue of HIF-1&#x003b1; are mediated by oxygen. Such modifications cause tumor suppressor von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL) to bind and degrade HIF-1&#x003b1; through ubiquitin-26S proteasome system. Nevertheless, in hypoxia, the hydroxylation is inhibited by the lack of oxygen, leading to no pVHL binding and the stability of HIF-1&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Semenza1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Ke1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this regard, the mechanisms of regulating HIF-1&#x003b1; might be delicate and complex. Although pVHL-mediated degradation of HIF-1&#x003b1; is an important pathway, phosphorylation of HIF-1&#x003b1; also plays a role by increasing the transcriptional activity of HIF-1&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Richard1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Sodhi1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, cytokines, growth factors, and environmental stimuli seem to be involved in the regulation of HIF-1&#x003b1; under nonhypoxic condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Stiehl1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Haddad1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Besides those, whether other pathway(s) involves the regulation of HIF-1&#x003b1; remains unclear. Recently, the intense studies on a class of small noncoding RNAs, called microRNAs (miRNAs), disclose the regulation of gene expression by miRNAs. The underlying mechanism involves miRNAs annealing to inexactly complementary sequences in the 3&#x02032;-UTR of target mRNAs to suppress translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Ambros1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Brennecke1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In this regard, HIF-1&#x003b1; is possibly regulated by miRNAs. Recently, HIF-1&#x003b1; was reported as the target of miR-17-92 microRNA cluster in lung cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Taguchi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study, we further show a molecular mechanism involving miR-20b regulating HIF-1&#x003b1; and VEGF and being regulated by HIF-1&#x003b1;, through which tumor cells adapt to different oxygen concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Inverse level of miR-20b and <italic>HIF-1&#x003b1;</italic> in tumor cells</title><p>We predicted the candidate mouse microRNAs of targeting <italic>Hif1a</italic> by combinatorial utilization of three different algorithms, including TargetScan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.targetscan.org/">http://www.targetscan.org/</ext-link>), PicTar (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pictar.bio.nyu.edu/">http://pictar.bio.nyu.edu/</ext-link>), and Sanger microRNA target (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://microrna.sanger.ac">http://microrna.sanger.ac</ext-link>. uk/). On the basis of the obtained information, we focused our attention on miR-18a, miR-199b, miR-20b and miR-155. Four murine tumor cell lines from different tissues, including liver cancer H22, breast cancer 4T1, prostate cancer RM1 and melanoma B16, were tested here. In normoxia, miR-18a, miR-199b, miR-20b and miR-155 were expressed in such tumor cell lines with different expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007629-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). However, compared to the normoxic condition, the expression of miR-20b, rather than miR-18a, miR-199b and miR-155, in hypoxia was strikingly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007629-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We also confirmed such expression pattern of miR-18a, miR-199b and miR-155 by quantitative RT-PCR (Supporting information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007629.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In addition, we determined miR-20a and miR-106-363 cluster other members (miR-106a, miR-18b, miR-92-2, and miR-363), since miR-20a is similar to miR-20b and miR-20b belongs to miR-106-363 cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Landais1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the expressions of those genes seemed not to be associated with the change of oxygen concentration (Suupporting information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007629.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We then focused our attention on miR-20b. The analysis by quantitative RT-PCR showed that miR-20b had 64-fold decrease in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007629-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Nevertheless, inverse to the expression pattern of miR-20b, the protein level of HIF-1&#x003b1; was very low in normoxia, but very high in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007629-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, hypoxia seemed not to change HIF-1&#x003b1; mRNA expression of tumor cells, evaluated by real time RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007629-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).

Data from three tumor tissues were presented in this figure.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0007629.g001"/></fig><p>Among the tested tumor cell lines, H22 cells expressed the most difference of miR-20b between normoxia and hypoxia. We therefore validated the above <italic>in vitro</italic> data <italic>in vivo</italic> by inoculating H22 cells to BALB/c mice subcutaneously. When tumors reached to the size of 9&#x000d7;9 mm, we tested the expression of miR-20b in different tumor regions. We found that miR-20b was much lower in the hypoxic central region and much higher in the normoxic marginal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007629-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). In parallel, HIF-1&#x003b1; detection showed much higher in the center and much lower in the margin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007629-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). The low expression of miR-20b in hypoxia was not due to the tumor necrosis. Most tumor cells in the detected tumor mass were not stained by trypan blue and the mRNA levels of either &#x003b2;-actin or GAPDH between central region and marginal region had no significant difference, evaluated by real time RT-PCR (data not shown). Furthermore, we performed the immunohistochemical assay. As expected, the result showed that the central tumor tissues were positively stained with anti-HIF-1&#x003b1; antibody; however, the marginal tumor tissues were stained negatively (Supporting information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007629.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Thus, the expression miR-20b is inversely relative to the level of HIF-1&#x003b1; protein in tumor cells, implying that tumor cell HIF-1&#x003b1; might be a target of miR-20b.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title><italic>HIF-1&#x003b1;</italic> is targeted by miR-20b</title><p>To verify that HIF-1&#x003b1; is targeted by miR-20b, a blocking strategy was adapted here by introducing miR-20b inhibitor to normoxic H22 tumor cells, which indeed increased the protein level of HIF-1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007629-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). This was not due to the more degradation of HIF-1&#x003b1;, since miR-20b inhibitor did not affect the VHL protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007629-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), which binds and degrades HIF-1&#x003b1;. On the other hand, the increase of miR-20b level of hypoxic tumor cells by transfecting miR-20b effectively decreased HIF-1&#x003b1; protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007629-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Similarly, The VHL protein level was not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007629-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In both cases, neither miR-20b inhibitor nor miR-20b affected the mRNA of HIF-1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007629-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that HIF-1&#x003b1; is a target for miR-20b. To confirm the direct interaction, a reporter vector system was used here. Transfection of HIF-1&#x003b1; 3&#x02032;-UTR-containing luciferase reporter vector into CHO cells resulted in the decent fluorescence production. However, the cotransfection of miR-20b and reporter vector resulted in a significant decrease of luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007629-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).

We then further asked whether the decrease of miR-20b contributed to a more malignant phenotype of cancer cells, such as the enhanced resistance to apoptosis, the feature of HIF-1&#x003b1; in tumor. To verify this, miR-20b inhibitor was transfected to normoxic H22 tumor cells. 24 hr later, the cells were treated with UV irradiation or chemodrug mytomycin C. The flow cytometric result showed that inhibition of miR-20b increased the apoptosis resistance of tumor cells, compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007629-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Nevertheless, cotransfection of HIF-1&#x003b1; siRNA completely abolished the effect of miR-20b inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007629-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that the decrease of miR-20b enhances the resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy through increasing the HIF-1&#x003b1; level.

Finally, we tested the role of miR-20b in hypoxia. Normoxic H22 cells were transfected with miR-20b. 24 hr later, 1&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells were cultured in hypoxia for 12 h for apoptosis detection by flow cytometry. The result showed that miR-20b transfection significantly increased the proportion of apoptotic cells, compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007629-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). In addition, by combinatorial utilization of different algorithms, such as TargetScan, PicTar, and Sanger microRNA target, we searched all the candidate target genes for miR-20b. The result showed that Bcl-xL and Bax were not in the list of candidate genes, suggesting miR-20b indirectly regulating these genes. Taken together, these data suggested that HIF-1&#x003b1;-mediated downregulation of miR-20b is required for H22 cells to adapt the hypoxia.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The current concept on the adaptive responses to changes in tissue oxygenation is mainly formed from the study on pVHL-mediated degradation of HIF-1&#x003b1;. Here, we provide alternative mechanism that a single microRNA, miR-20b, by virtue of its differential expression in normoxic and hypoxic microenvironment, can finely tune the expressions of HIF-1&#x003b1; and VEGF in tumor cells, making them to adapt to different oxygen concentrations.</p><p>microRNAs are endogenous non-coding small RNAs of 19&#x02013;23 nucleotides in length. The biological functions of microRNAs are involved in numerous cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, and motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Miska1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Hobert1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Coincidently, all these cellular processes can also be influenced by a transcription factor HIF-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Carmeliet1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Iyer1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, implying possible connection of HIF-1 and microRNAs. HIF-1 activity is controlled by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL), a recognition component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase. Under normoxic condition, pVHL binds hydroxylated proline residues within HIF-1&#x003b1; and thereby targets HIF-1&#x003b1; to the 26S proteasomal degradation system (4&#x02013;6). However, during hypoxia, proline hydroxylases are inactive and can not catalyze the hydroxylation of proline residues of HIF-1&#x003b1;, leading to the accumulation of HIF-1&#x003b1; in the cell. Besides this classical regulation machinery, in the present study, we additionally demonstrate that HIF-1&#x003b1; and VEGF is regulated by miR-20b in tumor cells. Intriguingly, miR-20b is also regulated by HIF-1&#x003b1;; VEGF can be transcriptionally activated by HIF-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Forsythe1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Such multiple regulation relationship among miR-20b, HIF-1&#x003b1; and VEGF therefore keep tumor cells to adapt different oxygen concentration for survival.</p><p>HIF-1&#x003b1; is a master regulator of oxygen homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Semenza1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Unusually, its response to oxygen alteration happens at the protein level rather than mRNA level. The reason maybe is that the cells can immediately translate the preexisted mRNA into the protein so to adapt the hypoxia promptly. On the other hand, the degradation of HIF-1&#x003b1; protein through pVHL-mediated pathway is also extremely rapid with a half-life estimated to be less than 5 minutes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Semenza1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Such regulation model for HIF-1&#x003b1; is efficient but too rigid in some physiological conditions. For instance, the formation of hypoxia in tissues such as embryo or tumor is a gradual process. Therefore, to reconcile this, a complementary mechanism may be required. Our findings of the reciprocal regulation of miR-20b and HIF-1&#x003b1; may be such a paradigm. Interestingly, VEGF is also targeted by miR-20b directly. Based on these findings, we propose that miR-20b cooperates with pVHL-mediated degradation pathway to effectively repress HIF-1&#x003b1; in normoxia. In order to adapt the gradual onset of hypoxia, inactivation of pVHL pathway is an initial response, which ceases the degradation of HIF-1&#x003b1; and leads to the increase of HIF-1&#x003b1; protein. However, to further increase of HIF-1&#x003b1; and VEGF proteins, tumor cells have to remove the inhibition of miR-20b on HIF-1&#x003b1; and VEGF by downregulating miR-20b. Such regulation model confers tumor cells to sense precisely the alteration of oxygen by the dynamic equilibrium between miR-20b and HIF-1&#x003b1;.</p><p>miR-20b has been reported to accumulate in tumor cells and might play an oncogenic role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Landais2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Sun1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Beyond consistence with these reports, our data here at least partially elucidate the mechanism underlying miR-20b-promoting tumorigenesis. We confirm the differential expression of miR-20b in different tumor regions in a mouse liver cancer model. Such differential expression of miR-20b may have different roles in tumor cells. High expression of miR-20b favors tumor cell growth in normoxia; low expression of miR-20b inhibits tumor cell growth but confers tumor cell more resistance to apoptosis in hypoxia. Although we show that the down-regulated miR-20b leads to an increase in the levels of the anti-apoptotic factor, BcL-xL and a decrease in the levels of the pro-apoptotic factor, Bax, the informatics analysis indicate that neither BcL-xL nor Bax as a candidate target gene for miR-20b.

Regardless of the important role of VEGF in tumor hypoxia, our data show that miR-20b downregulates VEGF expression in tumor cells. Thus, the accumulation of miR-20b in tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Landais2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007629-Sun1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> raises the question of how tumor cells adapt the hypoxia when the expression of VEGF is inhibited. A possible reason is that tumor stromal cells may act as the cellular source of VEGF. On the other hand, the downregulation of miR-20b may upregulate VEGF expression in tumor cells, which impairs the inhibitory effort on tumor cells by the decrease of miR-20b. Therefore, although our findings and others suggest that miR-20b may be a potential target in tumor therapy, the combination of targeting miR-20b and VEGF might be a better choice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal work was conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines.
