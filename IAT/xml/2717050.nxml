Dysregulation of the PIns signalling pathway has been implicated in the pathophysiology of the disorder by magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, commonly prescribed drugs used to treat the illness (lithium, valproic acid and carbamazepine) alter neuronal growth cone morphology, a phenotype that is reversed by addition of extracellular <italic>myo</italic>-inositol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Brain inositol levels are regulated by: a) transport from blood, b) recycling of intracellular inositol phosphates, and c) synthesis from glucose-6-phosphate to <italic>myo</italic>-inositol-1-phosphate (MIP) by the enzyme MIP-synthase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. MIP-synthase expression in the brain appears to be confined to the vasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], suggesting that inositol synthesis may not play a key role in neuronal inositol signalling. Rather, an uptake system seems to be required to transport inositol across the plasma membrane into neurones, which may play a role in the regulation of signalling. Three <italic>myo</italic>-inositol transporters have been identified to date &#x02013; the sodium <italic>myo</italic>-inositol transporters 1 and 2 (SMIT1 and SMIT2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and the phylogenetically distant H<sup>+</sup>/<italic>myo</italic>-inositol transporter (HMIT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. mRNA expression studies identified HMIT, but not SMIT1 or SMIT2, transcripts in rat neurones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Also, HMIT expression appears highest in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, areas which are implicated in mood disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>HMIT is a glycosylated protein containing three conserved internalisation signals: an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal in the N-terminal region, a dileucine internalisation signal and a tyrosine based internalisation motif at the C-terminal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Mutation of the retention signals is required for plasma membrane localisation of the recombinant protein in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes and mammalian cells, and this surface localisation correlated with functional inositol uptake into the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, HMIT is a symporter of <italic>myo</italic>-inositol and protons, since inositol uptake was only evident under acidic extracellular conditions and was associated with an inward electrical current and decreased intracellular pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It has been proposed that translocation of recombinant or endogenous HMIT to the plasma membrane may be activity-dependent following, for example, neuronal depolarisation or protein kinase C (PKC) activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Whilst HMIT represents an attractive candidate as a neuronal inositol transporter, it is unclear if HMIT contributes to the inositol-reversible effects of mood stabilisers on neurones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] through transport of inositol into the cell. To address this question, we undertook studies to further characterise the localisation and functional properties of HMIT in recombinant systems and native tissue. We have analysed HMIT expression in rat and human brain tissue using immunohistochemistry and investigated the conditions necessary for its translocation to the plasma membrane in heterologous cells and cultured neurones. Functional expression was probed using [<sup>3</sup>H]-<italic>myo</italic>-inositol uptake, [<sup>3</sup>H]-cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) accumulation and whole-cell electrophysiology assays.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Intracellular <italic>myo</italic>-inositol measurements in rat cortical neurones</title><p>To determine if extracellular <italic>myo</italic>-inositol can be taken up by neurones, we measured intracellular <italic>myo</italic>-inositol concentrations following incubation of cultured neurones with <italic>myo</italic>-inositol (1 mM) for 2 min or 20 h. After cell supernatant removal, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with ice-cold acetonitrile containing ammonium acetate; intracellular <italic>myo</italic>-inositol concentration was measured using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).

The cellular specificity and localisation of HMIT was analysed by confocal microscopy of rat primary cortical cultures co-stained with anti-HMIT:21 antibody and either a neuronal, astrocytic or Golgi marker. We observed no co-localisation of HMIT and the astrocytic marker GFAP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), indicating little or no expression of HMIT in primary astrocytes, which are a cell contaminant in the neuronal preparation. The images in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> show that HMIT co-localised with &#x003b2;III tubulin in the cell body and neurites, indicating neuronal expression. Furthermore, the HMIT antibody co-localised with the Golgi marker 58K Golgi protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), suggesting that HMIT is present in an intracellular compartment associated with the Golgi apparatus.</p><p>To investigate HMIT localisation in the rat brain, immunohistochemistry was performed in sagittal slices from adult rat brain with staining visualised using the Odyssey infra-red detection system (Li-Cor) (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Staining was observed in the hippocampal region, with high expression levels of the HMIT protein in CA2-3 and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). In addition, the immunising peptide effectively competed with the observed signal in rat brain (data not shown). Subsequently, fluorescence and colorimetric immunohistochemistry were performed to investigate the detailed anatomical and cellular distribution of HMIT-like immunoreactivity (HMIT-LI) in rat and human brain. HMIT-LI appeared to be distributed in discrete regions of the rat brain with a strong expression in the hippocampus, particularly in the CA2-3 regions and in the dentate gyrus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Moderate HMIT expression was observed in the cerebral motor cortex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).

It was previously shown that recombinant HMIT is localised in the cytoplasm of HEK293 cells and that expression of an HMIT triple mutant was required to achieve plasma membrane localisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In order to confirm and extend these findings, we transfected HEK293 cells with pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO-HMIT triple mutant and analysed HMIT localisation by immunocytochemistry using the anti-HMIT:21 antibody and an anti-pan cadherin antibody to confirm plasma membrane localisation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). HMIT triple mutant co-localised with pan-cadherin staining, indicating that the HMIT triple mutant is expressed at the plasma membrane, in contrast to the wild-type recombinant HMIT. In the [<sup>3</sup>H]-inositol uptake assay using HEK293T cells transfected with the HMIT triple mutant, inositol uptake activity was observed at pH 6.0 and this was partially reversed by treatment with the non-selective inhibitor phloridzin (53 &#x000b1; 1.4% inhibition with 1 mM phloridzin, 89 &#x000b1; 1.5% inhibition with 3 mM phloridzin; n = 2 independent experiments). In contrast, the activity measured at pH 7.4 was much lower (100 &#x000b1; 1.1 fmol at pH 6.0 versus 8.8 &#x000b1; 0.26 fmol at pH 7.4; n = 2 independent experiments) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).

Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were made from EGFP-positive HEK293 cells transiently co-transfected with the HMIT triple mutant and EGFP plasmids. <italic>Myo</italic>-inositol (2 mM) was applied by fast perfusion for 10 s at 60 s intervals under various conditions. At the holding potential of -60 mV, no current responses were observed at extracellular pH 7.4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). However, when the extracellular pH was 5.2, <italic>myo</italic>-inositol evoked an inward, non-desensitising current. This response was independent of extracellular Na<sup>+ </sup>and showed weak voltage-dependence (data not shown). The magnitude of the inositol-evoked currents increased as the extracellular environment was further acidified and reached a plateau level between pH 6 and pH 5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Characterising the concentration-response relationship of <italic>myo</italic>-inositol gave an EC<sub>50 </sub>of 2.7 mM, with a Hill slope of 1.0 (n = 5&#x02013;9 per data point; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). This contrasts with the affinity constant (Km) of 100 &#x003bc;M as reported by Uldry <italic>et al. </italic>(2001) using oocytes. In this study, the inositol-evoked currents were sensitive to inhibition by phloridzin (1 mM; 64.0 &#x000b1; 3.1% inhibition, n = 4) and a similar level of inhibition was also observed in the absence of extracellular Na<sup>+ </sup>(48.0 &#x000b1; 6.7% inhibition, n = 4; data not shown). In addition we investigated whether inositol triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) is also a substrate for HMIT. In HEK293T cells transiently transfected with the HMIT triple mutant, application of IP<sub>3 </sub>(0.1 mM) did not generate any responses at pH 7.4. When the extracellular pH was set at 5.2, application of IP<sub>3 </sub>evoked an outward current (+91 &#x000b1; 20 pA, n = 4) while <italic>myo</italic>-inositol (2 mM) induced a current of opposite polarity (-120 &#x000b1; 20 pA, n = 8; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). The opposite direction of the net current can be explained by the negatively charged IP<sub>3 </sub>compared with the neutral inositol molecule. We confirmed that these responses were mediated by the HMIT triple mutant as no currents were observed at pH 5.2 when the experiment was repeated using HEK293T cells transfected with EGFP only as a control (IP<sub>3</sub>, -0.7 &#x000b1; 1.8 pA, n = 5; <italic>my</italic>o-inositol, -0.1 &#x000b1; 0.9 pA, n = 5).</p></sec><sec><title>HMIT-mediated currents in rat neurones</title><p>Following characterisation of the HMIT triple mutant, we investigated rat brain tissue for endogenous HMIT-mediated responses.

Application of extracellular <italic>myo</italic>-inositol clearly reversed [<sup>3</sup>H]-CDP-DAG accumulation, at physiological pH in WT neurones. No difference was observed between WT and HMIT null-mutant neurones, thus indicating that inositol enters the cell despite genetic ablation of HMIT (see Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>[<sup>3</sup>H]-CDP-DAG accumulation in HMIT null-mutant (KO) and wild-type (WT) mouse cortical neurones</bold>.

The brain distribution is supported by the data from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brainatlas.org"/> and Northern blot analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The cellular localisation data obtained in the present study, however, contrast with that reported by Uldry <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] which suggested widespread astrocytic localisation. The latter is inconsistent with our immunohistochemical data and also the QPCR data of Cahoy <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], which suggest a neuronal expression (up to mouse postnatal day 30). The discrepancy may be explained by the relative specificity of the antibodies used in the two studies. We confirmed antibody specificity for HMIT using a series of methods including tagged-HMIT and peptide competition assays. Intracellular localisation was investigated both <italic>in vitro </italic>in primary neurones and <italic>ex vivo </italic>in rat brain sections. We showed that HMIT is co-localised with a Golgi marker and is not present at the cell surface or in neuronal processes. The Golgi localisation data support findings by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], who observed intracellular staining as demonstrated by co-localisation with the intracellular ER marker calreticulin. We also demonstrated HMIT expression in several regions of the human brain by immunohistochemistry, with the signal being consistent with an intracellular localisation.</p><p>In agreement with previous studies, triple mutant HMIT is localised at the plasma membrane when overexpressed in HEK293 cells. The triple mutant was functional, as shown by both electrophysiology and inositol uptake assays, and we confirmed the characteristics of HMIT inositol transport &#x02013; pH dependence, sodium independence, phlorizidin sensitivity &#x02013; first reported by Uldry <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We extended our analysis to rat primary neurones and hippocampal tissue slices where we were unable, even after stimulation, to demonstrate inositol-induced currents. We recognised that as pressure application of inositol was aimed at the soma we cannot exclude that translocation of HMIT may occur further away in the processes. However, in our localisation studies there was clear staining in the soma with no indication that HMIT is enriched in the processes. We used acutely prepared brain slices and primary dissociated neurones in contrast to Uldry <italic>et al. </italic>(2004) who showed translocation in rat brain aggregates, and preferential expression in regions of nerve growth and varicosities in primary neurones overexpressing recombinant HMIT. The lack of stimulation-induced HMIT activity was unlikely to be due to insufficient time course as translocation of HMIT was observed after 10 min application of PMA by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], while we did not observe inositol-induced currents even after 30&#x02013;60 min stimulation of slices. Although experiments were performed at room temperature, we did not observe any difference when slices were incubated at 30&#x000b0;C for more than 2 h suggesting that function was not affected by lower temperature.</p><p>Our data on localisation and function suggest that HMIT is not a plasma membrane transporter. The novel observation that HMIT can also transport IP<sub>3 </sub>provides an interesting alternative function for this protein. We speculate that HMIT may play a role in intracellular regulation of inositol and phosphoinositides, e.g. by sequestering IP<sub>3 </sub>into vesicles, possibly affecting intracellular calcium signalling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, our study has shown that HMIT is expressed at the plasma membrane and is able to transport inositol (at pH 6.0 or below) but only under artificial conditions whereby it lacks intracellular retention motifs. In contrast, the native protein has secondary structural features consistent with intracellular localisation and retention and immunocytochemical analysis confirms its localisation in the ER/Golgi network. We could not demonstrate any activity-dependent inositol transport <italic>in vitro </italic>or <italic>ex vivo </italic>in neurones. These data suggest that HMIT is not involved in the neuronal transport of inositol from the extracellular environment and the mechanism underlying this process remains to be identified.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>All chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were purchased from Sigma.</p><p>All animal experimental procedures were performed according to either the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986 or according to the Italian law (art. 7, Legislative Decree No. 116, 27 January 1992), which acknowledged the European Directive 86/609/EEC, and GlaxoSmithKline policy on the care and use of laboratory animals and related codes of practice.
