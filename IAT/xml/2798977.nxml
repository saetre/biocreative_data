It is characterized by aberrant patterns of eating behavior and weight regulation which result in weight loss and endocrine abnormalities such as amenorrhea, disturbances in attitude and perception about weight and shape, and an intense fear of gaining weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>).</p><p>Other symptoms, such as perfectionism, obsessive-compulsive behavior, and social anxiety are observed in many but not all patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">Piran et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">Casper and Jabine, 1996</xref>). In addition, a proportion of AN patients (31&#x02013;80%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">Hebebrand et al., 2003</xref>) displays abnormally high physical activity levels and overexercises. Almost all patients show a constant, agitated restlessness when they are emaciated but before they become lethargic in the final stages of starvation. The exact nature of hyperactivity in anorexia nervosa remains to be clarified. It appears that neurobiological factors and conscious attempts to burn calories in order to loose more weight coexist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">Casper, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>).</p><p>Animal models mimicking AN weight loss and hyperactivity, such as the activity based anorexia (ABA) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">Routtenberg and Kuznesof, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">Kas et al., 2003</xref>) or the semistarvation induced hyperactivity (SIH) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">Pirke, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">Exner et al., 2000</xref>) have been helpful in the search for a possible biological drive or changes in physiological parameters that trigger food restriction and hyperactivity. Studies using these preclinical models showed that anorectic rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">Kas et al., 2003</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">Gelegen et al., 2007</xref>) have reduced plasma leptin levels and that treating food restricted rats with leptin suppresses the development of hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">Exner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">Hillebrand et al., 2005a</xref>).</p><p>Leptin is an adipocyte secreted hormone, product of the ob gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">Zhang et al., 1994</xref>), which plays a pivotal role in starvation situations with regard to energy homeostasis as well as other physiological processes, including reproductive functioning (Cioffi et al., 1996; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">Moschos et al., 2002</xref>). Plasma leptin levels rapidly decrease during weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">Ahima et al., 1996</xref>) and are extremely low in AN patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">Calandra et al., 2003</xref>). However, leptin levels in recently weight recovered patients have been found to be higher than in BMI-matched controls, and are thought to contribute to difficulties with further weight restoration and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">Eckert et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">Holtkamp et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">Mantzoros et al., 2006</xref>). Holtkamp et al. have shown that patients leptin levels are negatively correlated with motor restlessness scores (2003) and with physical activity in acutely ill AN patients (2006). Thus, pre-clinical and clinical observations suggest that hypoleptinemia is an important factor underlying excessive physical activity in AN. The meaning of these findings for recovery have however not been studied in detail to date.</p><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between hyperactivity, serum leptin levels, and recovery in AN patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Patients were included in the study after they and/or their parents gave informed consent. The sample was recruited in two specialized eating disorder treatment centers (clinics), one for adolescents 12&#x02013;17 years (the University Medical Center Utrecht [UMCU], 31 subjects) and one for adults older than 17 years (Rintveld, 30 subjects). The clinical research protocol for this prospectively designed, cohort follow-up study was approved by the UMCU Ethics Review Committee.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were: (1) AN diagnosed according to the DSM-IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>) on the basis of a structured interview using the Eating Disorders Examination (Cooper et al., 1989); (2) comorbidity restricted to depression or anxiety disorders; (3) secondary amenorrhea; (4) no use of steroid contraceptives; (5) no clinical history of concurrent illnesses.

Weight gain was targeted at 0.5&#x02013;1.0 kg/week in accordance with clinical guidelines. Weight recovery was defined as a weight within the normal range for age (&#x0003e;SD &#x02212;1.5 corresponding with a body mass index [BMI] of approximately 19 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for adults) and target weight as the weight at which patients resumed a regular menstrual cycle, defined as three menstrual periods at three to five week intervals.

In an earlier study using actometer measurement as gold standard we established the reliability and validity of nurse observations of patient activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">Van Elburg et al., 2007</xref>). Nurses were instructed to observe activity, defined as the amount of motor restlessness (inability to sit still or moving arms or legs while seated, walking through the ward without reason), abnormal motor activity, and excessive exercise, and to score their observations on a visual analogue scale (0&#x02013;10).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Leptin assay</title><p>Plasma samples were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C prior to determination.

Data are presented as the mean &#x000b1; SD if distributed normally, otherwise as the median and range. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used if data were not normally distributed. In case data were normally distributed ANOVA was used. Linear multiple regression analysis (backward elimination) was also carried out to predict physical activity using BMI z scores and log 10 leptin levels as predictor variables. A p-value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p><p>To determine the associations of weight, leptin and physical activity levels with the rate of recovery as defined by the menstrual cycle at end point, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed. This method of analysis estimates a linear regression model of parameters against the logarithm of the hazard (or instantaneous risk) of the menstrual cycle recovery during follow-up. Initial values of parameters were used as potential predictors. Parameters with univariate <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.30 were candidate predictors for the multivariate model; backward elimination of parameters (with <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 for inclusion) was used to determine the set of most predictive parameters. Because of potential differences in prognosis averages between the two treatment centers, the analysis was stratified by clinic. The analysis was first performed with initial values of weight, leptin and physical activity levels as predictors and subsequently with longitudinal values, using Cox regression with time-dependent covariates. A further analysis of longitudinal data focused on the evolvement of the association between leptin levels and activity levels during the course of treatment. A linear mixed model was used, predicting physical activity from log 10 leptin levels, follow-up time measured in weeks and final recovery status as predictor variables. A potential difference between the recovered and nonrecovered group in the evolvement of the association between leptin levels and activity levels over time was tested by an interaction of (log 10 leptin) *week* group.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS forWindows (release 11.5, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and S-plus software (MathSoft Inc., Seattle, WA, version 2000).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The mean age of the whole patient group was 18.2 &#x000b1; 3.1 (SD) years, 15.9 &#x000b1; 1.2 years for the adolescent group and 20.6 &#x000b1; 2.9 years for the adult group.

In our adult group we found a U shaped correlation between activity and plasma leptin levels, which suggests that hyperactivity is age-related. Over time however, physical activity did not predict outcome and no major relationship between physical activity levels and the course of recovery could be detected for neither the adolescent nor the adult group.</p><p>Contrary to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">Holtkamp (2003)</xref> we rated activity during treatment and observed by nurses instead of relying on anamnestic reports of physical activity in the months before admission or during the acute stage of the illness. In an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">Van Elburg et al., 2007</xref>) we showed that nurses can reliably rate physical activity levels of anorexia nervosa patients. Measurements of a patient&#x02019;s physical activity levels by nurses correlate with activity scores from actometers, the gold standard reference. Patient self-reports did not correlate with the actometer scores. In clinical practice a variety of methods has been used to evaluate hyperactivity, but based on our previous findings conclusions drawn from studies using self-report or expert report not based on observation should be considered only with caution.</p><p>Once patients were divided into different outcome groups at the end of the study period differences in levels of physical activity and leptin were found, even though initial levels were not significantly different. Initial plasma leptin levels for all groups were clearly below normal values. Only the WCR-group reached average levels in the normal range at the end of the study period. WR patients clearly responded to treatment and recovered in weight, however, their subnormal leptin levels most probably did not permit them to recover at the level of the gonadal axis.</p><p>Several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">Haupt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">Wang et al., 2006</xref>) have discussed the relationship between leptin and the use of atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine, so far only in normal weight schizophrenic or psychotic patients. The results show that olanzapine in the first weeks of treatment may cause a surge in circulating leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">Wang et al., 2006</xref>) but that elevated plasma leptin levels in chronically treated patients with schizophrenia are strongly predicted by adiposity, similar to untreated healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">Haupt et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">Hillebrand, 2005b</xref>), we demonstrated that olanzapine reduces activity levels in AN patients without affecting body weight and plasma leptin levels. In our current study, 57% of patients used antipsychotics (neuroleptics), which might have influenced the relationship between leptin and activity scores. However, Cox regression analysis with medication as predictor showed no correlation (univariate: neuroleptics: <italic>p</italic> = 0.6, SSRIs: <italic>p</italic> = 0.3). Holtkamp et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2006</xref>) unfortunately do not report use of neuroleptics in their study populations.</p><p>In summary, our study replicates earlier findings in both rodents and humans that hypoleptinaemia and high physical activity levels are related in acutely ill AN patients of a young age, but we did not find the same relationship in an older patient group. The negative correlation between leptin and activity that exists in the acute phase of the illness changes over the course of 16 weeks to become a positive correlation in the second half of the treatment period, as a result of recovery. In the non recovered patients the negative correlation continues. Furthermore, our data indicate that plasma leptin level is a good predictor of recovery in AN, however, we could not detect any major relationship between physical activity levels and the course of recovery. The latter indicates that leptin and physical activity levels during the recovery process are, in contrast to the acute stage of the disease, dissociated.
