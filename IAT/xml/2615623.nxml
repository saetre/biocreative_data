Here, we show that the biochemical composition and stoichiometry of the human RNase H2 complex is consistent with the properties previously deduced from genetic studies. The catalytic subunit of eukaryotic RNase H2, RNASEH2A, is well conserved and similar to the monomeric prokaryotic RNase HII. In contrast, the RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C subunits from human and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> share very little homology, although they both form soluble B/C complexes that may serve as a nucleation site for the addition of RNASEH2A to form an active RNase H2, or for interactions with other proteins to support different functions. The RNASEH2B subunit has a PIP-box and confers PCNA binding to human RNase H2. Unlike <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNase HII, eukaryotic RNase H2 acts processively and hydrolyzes a variety of RNA/DNA hybrids with similar efficiencies, suggesting multiple cellular substrates. Moreover, of five analyzed mutations in human RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C linked to Aicardi-Gouti&#x000e8;res Syndrome (AGS), only one, R69W in the RNASEH2C protein, exhibits a significant reduction in specific activity, revealing a role for the C subunit in enzymatic activity. Near-normal activity of four AGS-related mutant enzymes was unexpected in light of their predicted impairment causing the AGS phenotype.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Formation and resolution of RNA/DNA hybrids created during DNA replication and repair is central to the maintenance of genome stability. RNases H are the only known enzymes that degrade the RNA strand of RNA/DNA hybrids in a sequence nonspecific manner, and therefore, are essential for DNA integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). There are two types of RNases H in eukaryotes that differ by sequence, biochemical properties and substrate specificity: (i) RNase H1, which is homologous to prokaryotic RNase HI and the RNase H domain of retroviral reverse transcriptase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>); and (ii) RNase H2, which is a monomeric enzyme in prokaryotes, and is composed of three different proteins in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> the RNase H2 heterotrimeric complex contains the catalytic subunit, similar to prokaryotic RNase HII and two other subunits that have no prokaryotic counterparts and whose functions remain unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>Crow <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) defined the composition of the heterotrimeric human RNase H2 complex when they identified pathogenic mutations in the three gene orthologs of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> RNase H2 (<italic>Sc</italic>-RNase H2) subunits as being causative of Aicardi-Gouti&#x000e8;res Syndrome (AGS). AGS is a genetic neurological disorder with symptoms similar to those of congenital viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). It is characterized by loss of brain white matter, intracranial calcifications, high levels of the cytokine interferon-&#x003b1; in the cerebrospinal fluid and elevated number of white cells, suggesting activation of both the innate and adaptive immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Mutations in the gene encoding the 3&#x02032;-exonuclease TREX1 have also been found in AGS patients indicating nucleic acid accumulation as an inducer of AGS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In fact, TREX1-deficient cells accumulated single-stranded DNA molecules about 60 nt long, which induced chronic activation of the DNA damage response-signaling network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Most of AGS-related mutations in TREX1 have been shown to abrogate its 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), although heterozygosity for certain mutations can result in other autosomal dominant disorders, such as chilblain lupus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). A C-terminal truncation that results in mis-localization of TREX1, without affecting its enzymatic activity, is the cause of retinal vasculopathy and cerebral leukodystrophy (RVCL), an autosomal-dominant degenerative disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>Unlike for TREX1, very little is known about human RNase H2 alterations and no other disorders have been associated with defects in RNase H2. All of the AGS-related mutations found in the three subunits of RNase H2 are missense mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), perhaps an indication that they are essential genes. One mutation found in RNASEH2A (G37S) has been described to decrease significantly the RNase H2 activity of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). However, the effect of other mutations in RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C subunits remains to be examined. A larger number of AGS-related mutations have been found in RNASEH2B than in other proteins. These mutations usually have a later onset and decreased phenotypic severity than mutations in other subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Because the roles of the B and C subunits are not known, it is difficult to assess the defects associated with mutations in the genes for these two proteins. Studying the functions of the RNase H2 B/C subunits and their interactions with the A subunit and other proteins would aid our understanding of how the heterotrimeric RNase H2 complex works, and how AGS is induced.</p><p>In addition to a structural role in supporting the activity of the RNASEH2A catalytic subunit, the RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C proteins may be involved in interactions with other proteins. Genetic interactions have been reported for all three genes encoding RNase H2 and <italic>SGS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), <italic>RAD27</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and <italic>ESC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) in yeast. SGS1p is a DNA helicase, RAD27p is the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Fen1 protein involved in removal of RNA primers and ESC2p affects recombination frequencies. These studies suggest a function for RNase H2 in Okazaki fragment processing during chromosomal DNA replication/repair, although its exact role has not yet been determined. Chromosomal DNA replication in eukaryotes is orchestrated by the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a protein responsible for bringing to the replication fork and coordinating the activities of the elongating polymerase and other factors involved in Okazaki fragment processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Most proteins that interact with PCNA share a sequence, which physically contacts PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Recently, such a sequence has been reported in an archaeal RNase HII, and the interaction with PCNA was described as negatively affecting the enzymatic activity of RNase HII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>In this study we determine PCNA interaction and other contributions of the two accessory subunits, RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C, to the activity and properties of the human RNase H2 complex, and examine the effect of several AGS-related mutations, particularly those present in the B and C subunits of RNase H2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>HeLa cells expression system and immunopurification</title><p>HeLa-XZ cells can grow both in a suspension and in an adherent state.

However, both eukaryotic RNases H2 require two additional subunits to constitute an active enzyme. In this report, we describe a role for the RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C subunits in providing a structural support for the catalytic RNASEH2A subunit to become active, and hydrolyze its RNA/DNA hybrid substrate in a processive manner. The RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C subunits also act as a platform for interactions with other proteins, such as PCNA, which in this work was found to bind human RNase H2 through the PIP-box located in the RNASEH2B subunit.</p><sec><title>Role of RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C subunits</title><p>Tagged-RNASEH2A in stably transfected HeLa cells permitted purification of the three-subunit complex in a 1:1:1 ratio, with little or no excess RNASEH2A suggesting that any protein not interacting with the RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C proteins did not survive as a separate protein. Unless RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C were present during expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>, RNASEH2A was found only in the insoluble fraction. Thus, it seems that RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C provide a means to generate an active enzyme by forming a scaffold on which the catalytic RNASEH2A can assume its appropriate configuration.</p><p>Human RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C subunits share little amino acid sequence similarity with their <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> homologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), however, both human and <italic>Sc</italic>-RNase H2 B and C subunits can be purified as soluble dimers after expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>)], suggesting that B/C complex formation may be important in both organisms. Such B/C complexes could serve as a platform that incorporates additional proteins to support functions other than RNase H2. Direct protein&#x02013;protein assessments in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> showed that RNASEH2A interacts exclusively with RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C. In contrast, RNASEH2B has been reported to interact with BUD32 and INP52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) in affinity capture-MS studies. This method also uncovered the binding of RNASEH2C to KSS1 and TOP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In our assays we found that RNASEH2B interacts with PCNA when is part of a functional complex containing A/B/C subunits or as part of the inactive B/C complex.</p><p>In our human RNase H2 A/B/C coexpression system in <italic>E. coli</italic>, only the A/B/C complex was present in a soluble form, while in the case of <italic>Sc</italic>-RNase H2, coexpression of the three subunits in <italic>E. coli</italic> resulted in accumulation of both A/B/C and B/C complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Coexpression of the human proteins produced a large (&#x0223c;10-fold) excess of the RNASEH2A subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), while in the <italic>Sc</italic>-RNase H2 expression system the amount of RNASEHA subunit was much lower than that of RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C. These results suggest that the ratio of expression of the three subunits may be regulated to produce A/B/C or B/C complexes. The mRNAs encoding the three subunits of <italic>Sc</italic>-RNase H2 are most abundant during the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Coincident changes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mRNAs could indicate that all the proteins that interact with B/C complex, including the A subunit, are involved in processes that occur in S and G2/M phases. The data of mRNAs encoding the human RNase H2 subunits are not clearly consistent but there does appear to be some change in amounts during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Physical interaction between RNase HII/2 and PCNA is evolutionally conserved</title><p>One important contribution of RNASEH2B is to provide a PIP-box for interaction with PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). PCNA functions as a platform to recruit interacting proteins at the &#x02018;right time and place&#x02019; during DNA replication and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In some cases, PCNA has been shown to stimulate the enzymatic activity of the interacting protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) most likely by facilitating substrate binding. In our assays, using linear substrates of various lengths, addition of PCNA showed no effect on the enzymatic activity of RNase H2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>), although PCNA could be required for loading RNase H2 into certain substrates, such as circular nucleic acids, or RNA/DNA hybrids with blocked ends, substrates similar to the ones found <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Recently, it was shown that <italic>Pab</italic>-RNase HII interacts with PCNA through its C-terminal tail, which contains a PIP-box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). We searched a NCBI database and found that many archaeal RNases HII possess putative PIP-boxes at their C-termini (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn913/DC1">Supplementary Table S3</ext-link>). It was reported that the enzymatic activity of <italic>Pab</italic>-RNase HII was inhibited by 80% in assays using equimolar amounts of RNase HII, a DNA<sub>7</sub>-RNA<sub>1</sub>-DNA<sub>7</sub>/DNA<sub>15</sub> hybrid substrate and PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), a result quite different from our observation with the human enzyme. The archaeal enzyme has the PIP-box directly attached to the single protein comprising the enzyme. Perhaps the more complex human RNase H2 has adapted a different approach to interact with PCNA that does not interfere with its activity. These results suggest that physical interaction between RNase HII/2 and PCNA is conserved from archaea to eukaryotes, although the effect on enzymatic activity needs further studies.</p><p>During lagging strand synthesis, PCNA brings together and coordinates the proteins involved in DNA elongation and maturation, such as DNA polymerase &#x003b4;(Pol &#x003b4;), the flap cleavage endonuclease, FEN1 and the nick closure ligase, Lig1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The nick translation activity of Pol &#x003b4; in cooperation with FEN1 and DNA2 nucleases has been shown to be the main pathway for Okazaki fragment maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). However, several yeast genetic studies have indicated that deletion of RNase H2 in combination with defects in DNA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) or RAD27 (FEN1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) has synthetic lethal or sickness phenotypes, suggesting functional overlapping of RNase H2 with these Okazaki fragment maturation enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The fact that RNase H2 binds to PCNA also suggests that RNase H2 is involved in replication and repair.

RNase H1/I, the other class of RNases H follows the same pattern: they are processive enzymes in eukaryotic cells while their prokaryotic counterparts are not.

However, several prokaryotic RNases HII prefer hydrolyzing the embedded ribonucleotide hybrid, and in a recent report, it was described that the RNase HII homologue from a highly thermophilic bacterium, <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic>, cleaved the embedded ribonucleotide hybrid and the ribonucleotide adjacent to the DNA in a model Okazaki fragment hybrid, but it did not hydrolyzed the usual RNA/DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Moreover, bacterial RNase HIII, which is a type 2 RNase H and structurally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) very similar to archaeal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) and bacterial RNases HII (PDB:2etj), would not hydrolyze a single embedded ribonucleotide DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).</p><p>The ability of human RNase H2 to act in a processive manner and hydrolyze a variety of RNA/DNA hybrids with similar efficiencies suggests that it may participate in many cellular processes (e.g. as a surveillance mechanism to find and cleave single ribonucleotides in DNA, leading to their removal by repair enzymes, or acting to remove R-loops that may be generated during transcription).</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of AGS-related mutation</title><p>Mutations in the three subunits of RNase H2 and TREX1, a ssDNA exonuclease, have been found as causative of AGS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), suggesting that accumulation of DNA and RNA by-products is a main factor that induces virus infection-like phenotypes in AGS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>The earliest appearance and most severely affected AGS patients have mutations in the RNASEH2A and RNASEH2C subunits (RNASEH2A G37S and RNASEH2C R69W) whereas phenotypic presentation of AGS in children with RNASEH2B mutations occurs significantly later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In addition, patients with RNASEH2B mutations tend to live longer than those with mutations in other genes.</p><p>Of all the AGS-related mutations examined in this study, only the RNASEH2A G37S substitution exhibited a severe decrease in the enzymatic activity of the complex, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). RNASEH2C R69W mutant enzyme was about 35% as active as wild-type RNase H2, which may account for the severity of AGS-phenotype in patients with this mutation. However, the other mutant proteins, RNase H2B-K162T, -A177T and -V185G and RNase H2C-K143I had almost normal levels of RNase H activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). A recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) describes the effect of AGS-causing mutations on the activity of RNase H2 from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Thermococcus kodakaraensis</italic>. While G37 is clearly conserved in these different organisms, and consequently mutations of this amino acid have similar effects, the great divergence of the B and C subunits between human and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> make it difficult to assess the effects of AGS-related mutation in the yeast system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). However, it is clear that RNase HII activity of <italic>T. kodakaraensis</italic> is impaired when the conserved Gly is changed to other amino acids with bulkier side chains, presumably limiting access to the active site.</p><p>The failure to note differences in activity in our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies does not preclude small defects in enzymatic activity that would induce the accumulation of unprocessed hybrids over long periods of time. Perhaps the mutations that give rise to later onset of AGS symptoms, such as those found in the RNASEH2B, are not related to specific activity per se but to stability or complex formation. If our suggestion that the RNASEH2B/C heterodimer is the platform on which the RNASEH2A subunit is properly assembled, some of the mutations in the RNASEH2B or RNASEH2C subunits may be defective in assembly/stability.</p><p>The 13 missense mutations present in the <italic>RNASEH2B</italic> gene are in exons 2&#x02013;8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).

Thus, the PIP-box of RNASEH2B is normal in all of the examined AGS-related mutant proteins, and consequently they showed normal PCNA interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C). Interaction with PCNA, which is required to participate in DNA replication and repair, may be essential for RNase H2 function and therefore mutations in the PIP-box of RNASEH2B may not be viable.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn913/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>The Intramural Research Program of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health; Human Development, <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor>; and the <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>GM32431</grant-num> to P.M.B.).
