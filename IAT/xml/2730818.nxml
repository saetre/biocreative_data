It plays important roles in mitochondrial fusion, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ATP production. Mutations of <italic>OPA1</italic> result in autosomal dominant optic atrophy (DOA). The molecular mechanisms by which link OPA1 mutations and DOA are not fully understood. Recently, we created a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model to study the pathogenesis of optic atrophy. Heterozygous mutation of <italic>Drosophila OPA1</italic> (<italic>dOpa1</italic>) by P-element insertion <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">results</xref> in no obvious morphological abnormalities, whereas homozygous mutation is embryonic lethal. In eye-specific somatic clones, homozygous mutation of <italic>dOpa1</italic> causes rough (mispatterning) and glossy (decreased lens deposition) eye phenotypes in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In humans, heterozygous mutations in <italic>OPA1</italic> have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, which is predicted to affect multiple organs. In this study, we demonstrated that heterozygous <italic>dOpa1</italic> mutation perturbs the visual function and an ERG profile of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> compound eye. We independently showed that antioxidants delayed the onset of mutant phenotypes in ERG and improved larval vision function in phototaxis assay. Furthermore, heterozygous <italic>dOpa1</italic> mutation also caused decreased heart rate, increased heart arrhythmia, and poor tolerance to stress induced by electrical pacing. However, antioxidants had no effects on the dysfunctional heart of heterozygous <italic>dOpa1</italic> mutants. Under stress, heterozygous <italic>dOpa1</italic> mutations caused reduced escape response, suggesting abnormal function of the skeletal muscles. Our <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">results</xref> suggest that heterozygous mutation of <italic>dOpa1</italic> shows organ-specific pathogenesis and is associated with multiple organ abnormalities in an age-dependent and organ-specific manner.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>OPA1 is encoded by a ubiquitously expressed nuclear gene and localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006867-Alexander1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006867-Misaka1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Mitochondrial dysfunction can cause decreased ATP production and/or increased ROS production, and either outcome can lead to cardiac cellular damage. Mutations affecting mitochondrial function have been shown to cause Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), MERRF, MELAS, Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), Kearns-Sayre Syndrome (KSS), and various other pediatric and adult cardiomyopathies. In Friedreich ataxia, mutations occur in the nuclear frataxin gene. Frataxin encodes a mitochondrial inner membrane protein, which transports iron out of the mitochondrial matrix. In the absence of frataxin, iron accumulates in the mitochondria, stimulating the Fenton reaction and ROS production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006867-Campuzano1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006867-Rotig1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

The time between the ends of two consecutive diastolic intervals gave the heart period, and the difference between the heart period and the diastolic intervals gave the systolic interval.
