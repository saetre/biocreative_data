The causative agent is <italic>Orientia tsutsugamushi</italic>, an obligate intracellular bacterium belonging to the family <italic>Rickettsiaceae</italic> of the subdivision alpha-Proteobacteria. In this study, we determined the complete genome sequence of <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> strain Ikeda, which comprises a single chromosome of 2 008 987 bp and contains 1967 protein coding sequences (CDSs). The chromosome is much larger than those of other members of <italic>Rickettsiaceae</italic>, and 46.7% of the sequence was occupied by repetitive sequences derived from an integrative and conjugative element, 10 types of transposable elements, and seven types of short repeats of unknown origins. The massive amplification and degradation of these elements have generated a huge number of repeated genes (1196 CDSs, categorized into 85 families), many of which are pseudogenes (766 CDSs), and also induced intensive genome shuffling. By comparing the gene content with those of other family members of <italic>Rickettsiacea</italic>, we identified the core gene set of the family <italic>Rickettsiaceae</italic> and found that, while much more extensive gene loss has taken place among the housekeeping genes of <italic>Orientia</italic> than those of <italic>Rickettsia</italic>, <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> has acquired a large number of foreign genes. The <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> genome sequence is thus a prominent example of the high plasticity of bacterial genomes, and provides the genetic basis for a better understanding of the biology of <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> and the pathogenesis of &#x02018;<italic>Tsutsugamushi</italic>&#x02019; disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd><italic>Orientia tsutsugamushi</italic></kwd><kwd>genome sequencing</kwd><kwd>obligate intracellular bacterium</kwd><kwd>repetitive sequence</kwd><kwd>IS element</kwd><kwd>integrative and conjugative element</kwd><kwd>gene amplification</kwd><kwd>genome reduction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Orientia tsutsugamushi</italic>, a causative agent of scrub typhus or &#x02018;<italic>Tsutsugamushi</italic>&#x02019; disease, is a Gram-negative bacterium belonging to the order <italic>Rickettsiales</italic> from the alpha-subdivision of Proteobacteria. The bacterium had been classified into the genus <italic>Rickettsia</italic>, but has recently been transferred to the genus <italic>Orientia</italic>, a genus newly created in the family <italic>Rickettsiaceae</italic>, based on the differences in the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequence (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dsn011/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link>) and in several morphological and biochemical features.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C1">1</xref></sup></p><p>Like other members of the order <italic>Rickettsiales</italic>, <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> is an obligate intracellular parasite. In nature, the bacterium lives in trombiculid mites, which are called &#x02018;<italic>tsutsugamushi</italic>&#x02019; in Japanese. In infected mites, the bacterium is found in the host cell cytosol of various organs including the oocytes, and is efficiently passed on to the offspring via transovarial transmission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C6">6</xref></sup> Trombiculid mites suck the tissue fluid of mammals only once in their life cycle at the larval stage, when the bacterium is transferred to the animal to induce scrub typhus. Reverse transfer, from infected animals to mites, occurs inefficiently,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C8">8</xref></sup> and the bacterium transmitted in such a way is rarely passed on to the offspring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C9">9</xref></sup> Accordingly, limited numbers of mite lines retain <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic>. However, <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> or mites carrying this bacterium are widely distributed in Asia and the Western Pacific islands; one billion people are estimated to be at risk for scrub typhus, and one million cases occur annually.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C10">10</xref></sup></p><p>In infected animals and humans, <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> invades the macrophages and vascular endothelial cells, escapes from the phagosomes, and propagates in the cytosol like other <italic>Rickettsiaceae</italic> family members, inducing an acute febrile state. It often causes a deadly illness if not treated with appropriate antibiotics, but the molecular pathogenicity is still poorly understood and no vaccine is currently available.</p><p><italic>Orientia tsutsugamushi</italic> strains are serologically classified into several subgroups based on the antigenic variations of a major surface protein called &#x02018;56-kDa protein&#x02019;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C11">11</xref></sup> The results of our pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis indicate that the genome size of <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> is much larger than those of other members of the order <italic>Rickettsiales</italic>, and that the genome exhibits a significant strain-to-strain size variation, ranging from 2.0 to 2.7 Mb (Tamura <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished data). However, no known techniques for genetic manipulation are applicable to this bacterium, and only a few pieces of genetic information have so far been accumulated; only the DNA sequences of the genes for the 56-kDa protein from various serotypes have been intensively analyzed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C13">13</xref></sup> In order to better understand the genetic features of this bacterium, we determined the complete genome sequence of <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> strain Ikeda. Here, we present the genomic features of the microorganism revealed by genome sequence analysis of the strain Ikeda and genomic comparison with other sequenced members of the family <italic>Rickettsiacea</italic>. Some of our results obtained by genomic comparison of the strain Ikeda and other recently sequenced <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> strain Boryong<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C14">14</xref></sup> are also presented.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1.</label><title>Bacterial strain</title><p><italic>Orientia tsutsugamushi</italic> strain Ikeda was originally isolated from a patient in 1979 in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. The strain belongs to the Japanese Gilliam serotype and is highly virulent in mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C15">15</xref></sup> The mite vector of the strain was not identified, but Japanese Gilliam serotype strains are usually carried by <italic>Leptotrombidium pallidum</italic> or <italic>Leptotrombidium scutellare</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C18">18</xref></sup> The strain has been kept in the laboratory by repeated propagation on L929 cells and passages in mice since the initial isolation, which may have generated multiple sub-strains containing some genomic alterations. To avoid the usage of heterogeneous genomic DNA derived from such sub-strains for genome sequencing, we performed single plaque purification on L929 cells as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C19">19</xref></sup> The cloned strain was propagated in L929 cells, and bacterial cells were purified on a percoll gradient as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C20">20</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s2b"><label>2.2.</label><title>DNA preparation and sequencing</title><p>Bacterial DNA was obtained from the purified cells by standard procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C21">21</xref></sup> A single batch of DNA preparation was used for all the experiments described hereafter. The genomic DNA was randomly sheared by means of a Hydroshear (GeneMachines) and used for the construction of genomic libraries. We prepared two pUC18-based random genomic libraries with insert sizes of 1&#x02013;1.5 or 4&#x02013;5 kb. A BAC library with an insert size of 11&#x02013;15 kb was also constructed using the pIndigoBAC-5 vector (Epicentre). Sequencing was carried out using the BigDye v3.1 chemistry on ABI370 or ABI3730 sequencers (ABI), or the ET chemistry on MegaBACE4500 sequencers (GE Healthcare).</p><p>Because the genome sequence of <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> was extremely rich in repetitive sequences, we employed a sequencing strategy comprising the following four steps. We first produced 32 000 shotgun reads from the 1&#x02013;1.5 kb library and 14 000 reads from the 4&#x02013;5 kb library using the forward sequencing primer. The Phred/Phrap software package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C22">22</xref></sup> was used for base-calling, quality assessment, and sequence assembly. The assemblies were visualized in order to count the base variations and detect misassembly using the Consed software.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C23">23</xref></sup> Based on the assembled data from 46 000 shotgun reads, we selected 6700 informative clones from both libraries, which were predicted to be located at the contig ends. The reverse end-sequences of these clones were determined using the reverse primer, and were assembled with the 46 000 forward sequences. The redundancy of the random shotgun sequences we obtained up to this stage was &#x0223c;13. At the third stage, the end sequences of 2383 BAC clones were determined, and 142 clones which were predicted to bridge the contigs were selected. These clones were individually sequenced and used as scaffolds in the sequence assembly. After re-assembly, 26 additional BAC clones were selected, sequenced individually, and added to the assembly. This assembly yielded 15 major contigs ranging in length from 20.4 to 296.0 kb. Finally, in order to close the 15 gaps, genomic PCR was carried out for five gaps using an LA long PCR kit (Takara), and 14 BAC clones were retrieved to close the remaining 10 gaps. The sequences of the five PCR products (3.7&#x02013;25.4 kb) and the 14 BAC clones were individually determined.

In addition, we designed 18 pairs of PCR primers that amplified the 18-genomic segments that covered a 69-kb region of the chromosome (nucleotide positions: 611 095&#x02013;670 870 bp) and performed a PCR scanning analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C25">25</xref></sup> In this analysis, all primer pairs yielded PCR products of expected sizes (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><label>2. 4.</label><title>Gene identification, sequence annotation, and data analyses</title><p>The identification of potential protein coding sequences (CDSs) and their annotation was done by using GenomeGambler, version 1.5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C26">26</xref></sup> We first identified CDSs longer than 50 amino acids.

This suggests that these mobile elements have been involved in the proliferation of many of these OtRG families. In fact, eight of the 31 OtRG families have a single orthologue in other rickettsial species. These genes may have been trapped in or between these mobile elements, and duplicated along with the amplification of the mobile elements. The eight OtRGs include a unique two-component system sensor histidine kinase/response regulator hybrid protein fused with a sodium/proton transporter domain (OtRG55) and a peroxiredoxin (OtRG59). These proteins may be involved in sensing and/or coping with osmotic or oxidative stresses which the bacterium encounters in the mite cells or during the infection of mammals. Most of the other OtRG families are hypothetical protein families with unknown functions, but their amplification may also have conferred some advantages to <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic>, by adapting them to the host environments. In this regard, of particular interest are several intramolecular repeat-containing proteins that have also been amplified (see Section 3.5).</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><label>3.4.</label><title>Singleton genes and the metabolic capacity of O. tsutsugamushi</title><p>The number of singleton genes (771 genes) identified in the <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> genome is lower than the total number of CDSs (834) in <italic>R. prowazekii</italic>, which has the smallest genome among the <italic>Rickettsia</italic> species so far sequenced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C36">36</xref></sup> As shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="DSN011TB2">2</xref>, the genome comparison of <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> and <italic>R. prowazekii</italic> revealed 542 genes that are shared by the two species.

Unexpectedly, a set of genes required for the biosynthesis and degradation of peptidoglycan was identified in <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic>, although those for LPS biosynthesis were completely missing. In our preliminary proteome analysis, we confirmed that at least 10 of these peptidoglycan biosynthesis-related genes were expressed in the <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> cells grown in L929 cells (data not shown).</p><p>Through the genomic comparison of <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> and <italic>R. prowazekii</italic>, we also identified 195 <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> singleton genes that are absent or degraded in <italic>R. prowazekii</italic> (referred to as &#x02018;<italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic>-specific&#x02019; genes), and 257 <italic>R. prowazekii</italic> genes that are absent or degraded in <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> (referred to as &#x02018;<italic>R. prowazekii</italic>-specific&#x02019; genes) (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="DSN011TB2">2</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dsn011/DC1">Supplementary Table S4</ext-link>). Of the 195 <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic>-specific genes, 161 are absent in all other sequenced <italic>Rickettsia</italic> species, and 94 genes exhibit no significant homology to known proteins. This finding suggests that a significant portion of the <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic>-specific genes have foreign origins. It is noteworthy that these genes are often clustered in the <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> genome (data not shown), suggesting that they have been brought into <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> as blocks. A prominent example is a genomic region about 19 kb in size located around the 550-kb position in the <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> chromosome (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN011F1">1</xref>). This region exhibits a higher G + C composition than the average of the <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> genome, and 23 <italic>Orientia</italic>-specific genes are accumulated. Two major surface antigens of <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic>, i.e. the 56- and 22-kDa proteins (OTT_0945 and OTT_1548, respectively), and a 56-kDa protein-like protein (OTT_0946) are also <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> specific.</p><p>Among the 257 <italic>R. prowazekii</italic>-specific genes, 178 are conserved in all the <italic>Rickettsia</italic> species so far sequenced. Of the 178 genes, 139 have their orthologues in a wide range of alpha-Proteobacteria. Thus, at least these 139 genes can be regarded as genes that have been deleted or degraded in the lineage leading to <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> after separation from the <italic>Rickettsia</italic> family. It is noteworthy that they include a significant number of genes for various housekeeping functions, such as the formation of a cell envelope, energy metabolism, fatty-acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and DNA recombination and repair (indicated by red arrows in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN011F5">5</xref>; see also <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dsn011/DC1">Supplementary Table S3</ext-link>). Several genes for RNA synthesis and modification, such as the RNA polymerase omega subunit and RNA helicase RhlE, those for stress response, such as the HslUV protease, ClpB chaperone, BipA GTPase and the OsmY protein, and those for drug sensitivity, such as the EmrA and EmrB proteins, are also specifically missing in <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic>. In addition, the genes for hemolysin A and patatin-like phospholipase, both of which are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of <italic>Rickettsia</italic> species, are missing in <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic>.</p><fig id="DSN011F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Metabolic pathways of <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> and <italic>R. prowazekii</italic>.

The genes for CTP synthase and cytidylate kinase are additionally missing in <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic>. This may have rendered the bacterium more dependent on the host cell functions for the pyrimidine nucleotides. All these defects are probably compensated by the presence of five types of nucleotide transporters, as shown in <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C50">50</xref></sup> This may also be the case for the nicotinamido adenine dinucleotide (NAD) metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C51">51</xref></sup></p><p>DNA recombination and repair systems are relatively well conserved in <italic>Rickettsia</italic> species (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN011F5">5</xref>). But a significant number of genes for these functions have specifically been deleted in <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic>, such as those for the UvrB, UvrC, RecN and RecG proteins and the transcription-repair coupling factor Mfd. This may be related to the acquisition and amplification of mobile genetic elements, as well as to the maintenance of an extremely repeat-rich genome.</p><p>Of particular interest is the lack of pyruvate dehydrogenase due to the deletion of the <italic>pdhABC</italic> genes and a second copy of <italic>pdhD</italic>. Other pathways generating acetyl-CoA are also missing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN011F5">5</xref>). Thus, the bacterium appears to be unable to synthesize acetyl-CoA. This defect is probably linked to the incomplete tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle of the bacterium, where the citrate synthase and aconitate hydratase genes are inactivated by an authentic frame shift mutation and a premature stop codon, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN011F5">5</xref>). However, these defects may be bypassed by asparate aminotransferase, which catalyzes the oxaloacetate/alpha-ketoglutarate interconversion. Pyruvate may also be introduced into the TCA cycle by malate oxidoreductase. In addition, the glycoxylate cycle is missing in <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic>, as in <italic>Rickettsia</italic> species.</p><p>The inability to synthesize acetyl-CoA probably is further linked to the deletion of the genes for acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which catalyzes the transfer of carboxyl groups to acetyl-CoA to generate malonyl-CoA, the first step in fatty-acid biosynthesis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN011F5">5</xref>). The genes for biotin-apoprotein ligase (<italic>birA</italic>) and biotin transporter (<italic>bioY</italic>), which are required for the formation of biotin carboxyl carrier protein, are also specifically missing in <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic>. In addition, the <italic>fabH</italic> gene encoding KAS III, which catalyzes the condensation of the acetyl-CoA starter unit with malonyl-ACP to yield acetoacetyl-CoA, the first step in the fatty-acid elongation pathway, is missing. Although the gene for KAS I is also absent as in <italic>Rickettsia species</italic>, the genes for malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase and KAS II (<italic>fabD</italic> and <italic>fabF</italic>) are conserved. It is thus most likely that fatty-acid biosynthesis in <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> is initiated by these two enzymes using host-derived malonyl-CoA.</p><p>Another distinguishing feature of <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> is the lack of genes for lipoprotein biosynthesis. Although a gene for lipoprotein-specific leader peptidase (<italic>lsp</italic>) was identified, other genes for the modification and localization of lipoproteins (<italic>lgt</italic>, <italic>lnt</italic>, <italic>lolA/B/C/E</italic>/<italic>D</italic>) are missing (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dsn011/DC1">Supplementary Table S3</ext-link>). This may raise the possibility that <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> lacks lipoproteins or has a very unique lipoprotein biosynthesis system. Consistent with this, of the five <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> proteins whose homologues have been predicted to be lipoproteins in <italic>Rickettsia species</italic>, none contains the typical lipobox required for processing and lipid-modification of lipoproteins. This finding, together with the absence of LPS, suggests that a simple cell envelope may be advantageous to the intracellular life of <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic>.</p><p>All these genomic features of <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> indicate that high levels of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and gene amplification have occurred in <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> after it diverged from the genus <italic>Rickettsia</italic>. On the other hand, <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> has also undergone further reductive genome evolution and established an intracellular lifestyle that is more dependent on its host cell functions than <italic>Rickettsia</italic> species.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><label>3.5.</label><title>Repeat-containing proteins</title><p>As briefly mentioned in Section 3.3, the <italic>Ot</italic>RG families include eight types of ankyrin repeat-containing proteins (AR proteins), four tetratricopeptide repeat-containing proteins (TPR proteins), and two novel repeat-containing proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN011F6">6</xref>). We additionally identified 11 singleton genes encoding different types of AR proteins and five singleton genes encoding novel repeat-containing proteins. Ankyrin repeats have been found in many eukaryotic proteins and are known to mediate various protein&#x02013;protein interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C52">52</xref></sup> However, they are rarely found in prokaryotes. Several bacteria, most of which are intracellular bacteria, such as <italic>R. felis</italic>, <italic>R. bellii</italic>, <italic>W. pipientis</italic>, <italic>Legionella pneumonia</italic>, and <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic>, are exceptionally enriched in AR proteins (18&#x02013;25 proteins), and these proteins are suspected to be involved in host&#x02013;bacterial interactions. <italic>Orientia tsutsugamushi</italic> contains 20 types of genes for AR proteins, and the total number of copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN011C46">46</xref>) greatly exceeds those of other intracellular bacteria. As all these AR proteins have no signal sequence for the general secretion pathway, they could be candidates for the effecter proteins secreted by T4SS. And they may be involved in the modulation of host-cell functions by <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic>, which is required for the bacterium to develop and maintain a symbiotic relationship in mite cells and/or survive and propagate in mammals. Other repeat-containing proteins also do not possess apparent signal sequences, suggesting that they would also be T4SS effector candidates.</p><fig id="DSN011F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Repeat-containing proteins of <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic>.
