Since these HIV transcripts direct production of progeny virions, Rev is a crucial factor in HIV replication (for overview see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). Rev interacts with HIV mRNAs by binding to a structured RNA element called the RRE (Rev response element). Rev offsets the activities of inhibitory sequences (INS) in HIV-1 mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and promotes their export to the cytoplasm. Once in the cytoplasm, Rev may also stimulate production of viral proteins on translational level (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]).</p><p>Rev characteristically localizes to the nucleus, where it accumulates in nucleoli. However, a proportion of the Rev molecules expressed in a cell continuously shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm by using active transport mechanisms both for entry into and exit from the nucleus.</p><p>Mutational analyses of the Rev protein have identified various functionally important regions, indicating that Rev is organized into modular domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>; reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]). The N-terminal domain of Rev contains an arginine-rich motif (ARM; amino acids 35 to 50) with dual functions as a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and RNA binding domain. Sequences flanking the ARM (amino acid regions 12 to 29 and 52 to 60) direct multimerization of Rev. The C-terminal domain of Rev, also known as activation domain, contains a leucine-rich motif (amino acid region 75 to 83) that functions as a nuclear export signal.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of interaction of 16.4.1 with Rev</bold>.

MI and MII: Regions that direct multimerization of Rev. NLS: nuclear localization signal; NES: nuclear export signal. (B) Identification of amino acid positions in Rev required for interaction with 16.4.1. Bait proteins containing Rev or various mutants of Rev were analysed for interaction with 16.4.1-prey. Numbers indicate positions of amino acid changes in Rev mutants. Mutations are as follows: RevM4: Y<sup>23 </sup>to D<sup>23</sup>, S<sup>25 </sup>to D<sup>25</sup>, N<sup>26 </sup>to L<sup>26 </sup>[45]; Rev M10BL: L<sup>78 </sup>to D<sup>78</sup>, E<sup>79 </sup>to L<sup>79 </sup>and insertion of EDLP between L<sup>81 </sup>and T<sup>82 </sup>[47]; Rev M5: R<sup>38 </sup>to D<sup>38</sup>, R<sup>39 </sup>to L<sup>39 </sup>[45]; RevSLT40: I<sup>59 </sup>to D<sup>59</sup>, L<sup>60 </sup>to D<sup>59 </sup>[46]. Interaction is indicated by growth of yeast transformants under selective conditions (&#x02265; 500 transformants per plate). Results represent four independent experiments. The red box marks the amino acid positions in Rev required for interaction with 16.4.1 and the location of the putative 16.4.1-interaction region of Rev (aa 38 to 60). (C) Identification of regions of 16.4.1 required for interaction with Rev. Prey proteins containing various regions of the 16.4.1 domain were analysed for interaction with Rev-bait. Interaction was analysed by growth of yeast transformants under selective conditions. Results represent three independent experiments. +++ 700&#x02013;1400 transformants per plate; + 200&#x02013;400 transformants per plate; &#x02013; no transformants. 16.4.1 regions comprising amino acids 2 to 133 and 39 to 171 interacted with Rev with similar efficiency as full-length 16.4.1, whereas regions 2 to 73 and 74 to 171 showed weaker interaction. No interaction was observed with regions 2 to 38 and 134 to 171. The red arrow indicates the putative Rev-interaction region of 16.4.1 (aa 39 to 133).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-6-20-1"/></fig><p>Biochemical analyses indicate that Rev directly binds the nuclear transport receptors Importin &#x003b2; and CRM1/Exportin 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Interaction of Rev with CRM1/Exportin 1 was confirmed by two-hybrid assays in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Together with results from various other experimental approaches (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]), these observations have led to the concept that import of Rev into the nucleus is mediated by interaction of the ARM/NLS with Importin <inline-graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-6-20-i1.gif"/> and export of the Rev-RNA complex from the nucleus by interaction of the Rev-NES with CRM1/Exportin 1.</p><p>Various other Rev-interacting cellular factors have been identified by using Rev or segments of Rev for yeast two-hybrid screening of cDNA libraries or for biochemical purification of interacting factors from cell extracts.</p><p>Cellular factors shown to interact with the ARM of Rev include p32 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and B23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Human p32 was recently reported to block splicing of Rev-dependent HIV transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The nucleolar protein B23 was shown to stimulate nuclear import of Rev [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and counteract aggregation of Rev [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]<italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>The C-terminal domain of Rev interacts with various human nucleoporins, including hRIP/hRab, NLP-1, Nup98, and Nup214 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Other factors shown to interact with this domain of Rev are eIF-5A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and the nuclear kinesin-like protein REBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. hRIP/hRab, Nup 98 and eIF-5A interact with CRM1 as well as Rev [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], suggesting that Rev can associate with CRM1 in multifactorial complexes in which CRM1 "bridges" the interaction of Rev with other factors. Rev-CRM1 complexes containing hRIP/hRab or eIF-5A may be crucial for Rev-dependent export of HIV RNAs, since eIF-5A and hRIP/hRab have been shown to be essential for Rev-directed RNA export in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes and in human cells, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Nuclear export of Rev has proven to be exemplary for many viral and cellular factors (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]). Since the discovery of leucine-rich signals in Rev [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and in the cellular regulatory factor PKI&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], these sequences have been shown to mediate the export of numerous factors from the nucleus by CRM1/Exportin1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The drug Leptomycin B (LMB), first shown to block nuclear export of Rev [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], proved to be a potent inhibitor of CRM1-dependent export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and is now widely used to identify transport substrates of CRM1. Elucidating interactions of Rev with cellular factors is highly relevant to understanding pathogenicity of HIV and may have an impact on the design of therapeutic anti-HIV strategies. The functional diversity of Rev and its activities in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the cell suggest the existence of still unidentified Rev-interacting factors. Therefore we reasoned that screening of a human cDNA library with Rev as "bait" should lead to isolation of novel Rev-interacting human factors. Of particular interest would be the identification of unknown human gene products, since their interaction Rev would not only be relevant for Rev function but would also provide a key for biological characterisation of these novel factors.</p><p>Here we identify a human cDNA that encodes a novel protein (16.4.1) that interacts specifically with Rev via sequences in the N-terminal half of Rev. We show that 16.4.1 is exported from the nucleus by CRM1 and localizes to the cytoplasm. In Rev-expressing cells, 16.4.1 is recruited to nucleoli. 16.4.1 has a negative effect on Rev function in a Rev-reporter assay. These results suggest that 16.4.1 can act as a modulator of Rev function.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of novel HIV-1 Rev-interacting proteins</title><p>To identify novel Rev-interacting proteins, we screened a library of cDNAs derived from the human Jurkat T-cell line with full-length Rev as bait in a yeast two-hybrid system. Repeated selection procedures led to isolation of two library plasmids (11.5.1 and 16.4.1) encoding specific interactors of Rev.</p><p>Sequence analyses and data base comparisons revealed that the 936 bp insert in plasmid 11.5.1 is identical with a segment of a 1543 bp cDNA encoding human DNA binding protein B (dbpB; NCBI accession number BC002411) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The predicted coding sequences in the 11.5.1 cDNA comprise the C-terminal 139 amino acids of the dbpB protein (324 amino acids; NCBI accession number M24070). Several biological activities have been attributed to dbpB, including binding to DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and regulation of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>The other library plasmid 16.4.1 contained a 696 bp insert of which a region of over 450 nucleotides showed strong similarity to a sequence within a human fetal heart cDNA (NCBI accession number W67699). In the fetal heart cDNA the matching region encompasses a predicted open reading frame. Alignment of the 16.4.1 and the fetal heart cDNA sequences yielded a sequence encoding a hypothetical 171 amino acid 16.4.1 protein. Since interaction with Rev is the first biological activity associated with this gene product, we analysed interaction of Rev with the 16.4.1 protein in more detail.</p><p>To investigate which regions of Rev contribute to interaction with the 16.4.1 protein, we analysed the capacity of various known mutants of Rev to interact with 16.4.1 in the yeast two-hybrid assay. The amino acid exchanges in these mutants map to regions associated with major biological properties of Rev (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), including multimerization (RevM4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and RevSLT40 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]), RNA binding and nuclear localization/accumulation (RevM5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]) and nuclear export of Rev (RevM10BL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]). Expression of LexA-Rev-mutant bait proteins in yeast transformants was confirmed by Western blot analysis with polyclonal antibodies against Rev (data not shown). As positive control for Rev interaction, interaction analysis was performed with LexA-Rev bait and B42AD-Rev prey, confirming oligomerization of wildtype Rev molecules with each other (data not shown).</p><p>While Rev mutants RevM4 and Rev M10BL were capable of interacting with 16.4.1, no interaction was observed with Rev mutants RevM5 and RevSLT40 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). These results indicate that amino acid residues R<sup>38 </sup>or R<sup>39 </sup>of the ARM and I<sup>59 </sup>or L<sup>60 </sup>of the multimerization region II (MII) are required for interaction of Rev with the 16.4.1 protein. Furthermore, they suggest that the 16.4.1 interacting sequences in Rev are located between aa positions 38 and 60.</p><p>For more detailed study of the interaction of the 16.4.1 protein with Rev, yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed with various segments of the 16.4.1 cDNA as prey and wildtype Rev as bait (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Amino acid regions of 16.4.1 extending from position 2 to 133 and from position 39 to 171 showed similar Rev-binding capacity as full-length 16.4.1 protein. In contrast, both the N-terminal region (2 to 38) and the C-terminal region (134 to 171) of 16.4.1 failed to interact with Rev. While 16.4.1 protein fragments from position 2 to 73 or position 74 to 171 clearly interacted with Rev, interactions were weaker than that of full-length 16.4.1. These results indicate that the Rev-interacting region of the 16.4.1 protein is located between amino acid positions 39 and 133 and that, within this region, sequences N- and C-terminal of position 73 contribute to interaction with Rev.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction of the 16.4.1 protein with Rev, CRM1 and itself in human cells</title><p>The interaction of the 16.4.1 protein with Rev in yeast raises the question whether the 16.4.1 protein can also interact with Rev in human cells. It was also of interest whether 16.4.1 is capable of interacting with human CRM1, since CRM1 has been shown to interact with several Rev-associated factors (see Background).</p><p>We addressed these issues with a mammalian two-hybrid assay, in which the interaction of a protein fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain with a second protein fused to the VP16-activator domain induces transcription of a luciferase reporter gene from a synthetic promoter (for details see Materials and Methods). Rev was fused to VP16 (VP16-Rev) to avoid unspecific interactions between the acidic VP16 domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and the basic Rev protein (estimated pI = 9.93; MacVector calculation). Functionality of VP16-Rev was demonstrated (data not shown) in a Rev-reporter assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. For interaction analysis, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids for VP16-Rev and Gal4-16.4.1 fusion proteins and the reporter plasmid pG5<italic>luc</italic>. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, a &#x02248;11-fold mean induction of luciferase activity was observed in 14 independent transfection experiments.

Self-interaction of the 16.4.1 domain was analysed by coexpressing Gal4-16.4.1 and VP16-16.4.1, resulting in &#x02248;12-fold mean induction of luciferase activity (n = 6).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Interaction of 16.4.1 with HIV-1 Rev, hCrm1 and with itself in human cells</bold>. 16.4.1 interactions in human cells were analysed with a mammalian two-hybrid assay in which the interaction of a protein fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain with a second protein fused to the VP16-activator domain induces transcription of a luciferase reporter gene.

To generate a full-length (171 aa) 16.4.1 coding sequence, nucleotides encoding the first 8 N-terminal amino acids derived from the predicted open reading frame of the fetal heart cDNA were inserted upstream of the 16.4.1 cDNA. To analyse subcellular localization of the 16.4.1 protein, cells were transfected with plasmids directing expression of fusion proteins containing full-length 16.4.1 or various segments of 16.4.1. Those fusion proteins contained either a N-terminal IgG1 tag or a C-terminal GFP tag. The full-length IgG1-16.4.1 fusion protein (IgG1-2-171) was located mainly in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). IgG1 fusion proteins with 16.4.1 regions extending from amino acid position 2 to 133, 39 to 171 and 74 to 171 showed similar predominantly cytoplasmic localization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). In contrast, IgG1 fusion proteins with the N-terminal region (2 to 38) or the C-terminal region (134 to 171) of 16.4.1 were apparent in both nucleus and cytoplasm, similar to unfused IgG1.

Quantitative evaluation of subcellular distribution of GFP fluorescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] revealed that only 25% of total fluorescence was contained in the nuclei of 16.4.1-GFP expressing cells. This localization is comparable to that of GFP fusion proteins containing PKI&#x003b1; (PKI&#x003b1;-GFP) or the carboxyterminal half of Rev (Rev(52&#x02013;116)-GFP), which localize to 23% and 25%, respectively, in the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). PKI&#x003b1; and the carboxyterminal half of Rev contain well-characterized recognition signals for CRM1/Exportin 1-dependent export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Similar cytoplasmic localization of 16.4.1-GFP and interaction of 16.4.1 with CRM1/Exportin 1 in human cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) raised the possibility that cytoplasmic localization of 16.4.1-GFP at steady state may involve nuclear export of 16.4.1 by CRM1/Exportin 1.

Treatment of cells with LMB raised nuclear proportions of GFP fusion proteins with one or two copies of 16.4.1 region 74&#x02013;133 to similar levels as full-length 16.4.1-GFP.

To analyse whether region 86 to 105 of the 16.4.1 protein functions as a nuclear export signal, we compared its translocation capacities with the Rev-NES in a previously described microinjection assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). In this assay, peptides bearing the candidate transport sequences are linked to fluorescently labeled bovine serum albumin (BSA). These potential transport substrates are coinjected into the nucleus with unlinked BSA labeled with a different fluorescent color that serves as injection control. Two hours later, cells are fixed and the percentage of each fluorescent label in the nuclear compartment of individual cells determined. The relative translocation activity signifies the ratio of fluorescence of the transport substrate to the fluorescence of the injection control.

Comparison of the translocation activities of 16.4.1 region 86&#x02013;105 and the Rev-NES in a microinjection-based transport assay [51]. Transport substrates were generated by conjugating peptides containing region 86&#x02013;105 of 16.4.1 or region 73&#x02013;84 of Rev with bovine serum albumin (BSA) labeled with a red fluorescent dye. Transport substrates were coinjected into the nucleus with an injection control consisting of unconjugated BSA labeled with a different fluorescent dye (e.g. green). The proportion of each fluorescent label in the nucleus of the injected cell was determined and the ratio of fluorescence of the transport substrate to fluorescence of the injection control calculated. This ratio represents the relative translocation activity of the transport substrate and is indicated in the graph. Nuclear export activity yields ratios &#x0003c;1 as demonstrated for the Rev NES. Transport substrates containing amino acid region 86&#x02013;105 of 16.4.1 also yielded a relative translocation activity &#x0003c;1, indicating that this region of 16.4.1 can function as a nuclear export signal.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-6-20-5"/></fig><p>To further characterize this nuclear export signal in 16.4.1 we took advantage of a collection of weight matrices (M1-M7) derived for recognition of NES by bioinformatics (Blossom similarity matrix). These matrices recognized 48 out of 75 signals of a published NES database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] at a default threshold of 0.84 in the context of their native proteins. No match was obtained upon scanning of the 16.4.1 amino acid sequence with these matrices at default threshold. This indicates that the 16.4.1 sequence is distinct from the 48 NES represented by the matrices. However, rescanning of the 16.4.1 sequence at a lower threshold (0.74) yielded a single match for matrix M5 (0.78), comprising amino acids 92&#x02013;99 of 16.4.1 (core NES). At default threshold the same matrix recognized a specific group of NES that includes the NES of Stat1 and p65RelA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). However this matrix did not recognize the NES of PKI&#x003b1; or Rev, which were recognized by different matrices.

HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids for expression of GFP fusion proteins containing wild type (16.4.1-GFP) or mutated (16.4.1(NESmut)-GFP) 16.4.1 and subcellular distribution of GFP fusion proteins were evaluated by quantitative fluorescence microscopy.

Images were processed by deconvolution and multichannel unmixing, allowing separate evaluation of the spatial distribution of GFP and CFP signals. Over 25 cells were analyzed. Multichannel unmixing is a recently developed technique for separate detection of fluorochromes that exhibit significant spectral overlap in conventional fluorescence microscopy setups, such as CFP and GFP (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]).

In human cells, 16.4.1 is a substrate for CRM1-dependent export and shows predominant cytoplasmic localization. Colocalization of Rev and 16.4.1 was observed in nuclei, particularly in the nucleoli, of cells expressing both proteins. Overexpression and RNAi experiments indicate that 16.4.1 can influence transactivation function of Rev.</p><sec><title>Comparison of cytoplasmic localization properties of 16.4.1, Rev and PKI</title><p>We demonstrate that 16.4.1 interacts with CRM1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and shows similar Leptomycin B sensitive, cytoplasmic localization behaviour as PKI&#x003b1; and the carboxyterminal half of Rev (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) which are known substrates for CRM1-dependent export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. These results indicate that cytoplasmic localization of 16.4.1 involves CRM1-mediated nuclear export.</p><p>A nuclear export signal was mapped in 16.4.1 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Mutation of the Leucine/Isoleucine residues of the 16.4.1 NES only partially inhibited nuclear export of full-length 16.4.1, whereas leucine/isoleucine residues in the NES have been shown to be essential for export of Rev and PKI&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. This suggests differences in the export functions of the 16.4.1 NES and the NES of Rev and PKI&#x003b1;. This conclusion is supported further by the bioinformatics analysis, which showed that the group of NES sequences recognized by the same matrix as the 16.4.1 transport signal did not include the NES of Rev or PKI&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><p>GFP fusion proteins containing a single copy of the 16.4.1 NES showed weaker cytoplasmic localization than GFP fusion proteins with tandem copies of this region or full-length 16.4.1-GFP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This suggests that cytoplasmic localization of 16.4.1 does not depend solely on the functionality of a single copy of the 16.4.1 NES. The formation of homo-oligomers of 16.4.1, as shown by mammalian two-hybrid analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), could allow cooperative activity of multiple 16.4.1 NES. In addition, sequences beyond the NES could also contribute to cytoplasmic localization, for example by increasing cytoplasmic retention of 16.4.1. Sequences beyond the NES of 16.4.1 could also promote interactions with export-enhancing co-factors, several of which have been identified so far. These include the Ran-binding protein 3 (RanBP3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], NXT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] and eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A). eIF-5A was demonstrated to be involved in export of Rev-like NES but not of the PKI&#x003b1;-NES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], suggesting the existence of substrate-specific export cofactors. Future studies will be directed at identifying cellular interaction partners of the 16.4.1 protein and investigating their influence on its export activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Interactions of 16.4.1 and Rev</title><p>In this study we show that 16.4.1 and Rev are capable of influencing biological properties of one another.</p><p>In cells expressing 16.4.1 and Rev, Rev can alter localization properties of 16.4.1 by recruiting 16.4.1 to the nucleus, in particular nucleoli. This is shown by colocalization of Rev and 16.4.1 in the nucleoli of cells expressing both proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Cytoplasmic localization of 16.4.1 suggests that 16.4.1 interacts with Rev in the cytoplasm and is then translocated together with Rev to the nucleus and to nucleoli. The region of 16.4.1 that mediates interaction with Rev (amino acids 39&#x02013;133, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) contains the 16.4.1 NES (amino acids 86&#x02013;105). Thus CRM1 could "bridge" interaction of 16.4.1 with Rev. CRM1-mediated interaction with Rev has been observed for several cellular proteins proposed to function as cofactors for nuclear export of Rev (see Background). However, amino acid positions of Rev essential for interaction with 16.4.1 are located outside the Rev NES, and an export-deficient NES-mutant of Rev (RevM10Bl) was capable of interacting with 16.4.1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This suggests that 16.4.1 does not function as an essential cofactor for nuclear export of Rev.</p><p>We have demonstrated that overexpression of 16.4.1 inhibits transactivation function of Rev (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). The molecular mechanism underlying this inhibitory effect is unclear. A possible model to explain an inhibitory effect of 16.4.1 on Rev activity is that 16.4.1 recruited to nucleoli by Rev promotes association of Rev and CRM1 in inactive complexes. The strong interaction of 16.4.1 with CRM1 may increase the amount of CRM1 associated with Rev to inhibitory levels. In support of this model, experimental evidence has been obtained demonstrating that (1) Rev associates with CRM1 in nucleoli, influencing its mobility, (2) high levels of CRM1 inhibit Rev activity and (3) Rev is capable of recruiting other CRM1-interacting factors to nucleoli that are capable of inhibiting Rev activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. This model will be investigated in future experiments.</p><p>The RNAi experiments suggest that endogenously expressed 16.4.1 gene products can also affect Rev function. As expected, the stimulatory effect of RNAi-mediated inhibition of 16.4.1 expression was small, since Rev is known to function efficiently in 293T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. We attempted to study the long-term effect of inhibition of endogenous 16.4.1 on Rev function by establishing cell lines stably expressing siRNA against 16.4.1. However, this approach was not feasible because of cell death after 2&#x02013;3 weeks of expression of 16.4.1 siRNAs. This indicates that 16.4.1 gene products are crucial for cell viability. On the other hand, overexpression of 16.4.1 is well tolerated as demonstrated by the establishment of a cell line stably expressing 16.4.1-GFP.</p><p>The physiological role of interaction of Rev with 16.4.1 is not clear yet and may be positive or negative, depending on the levels of expression of 16.4.1. At low levels 16.4.1 proteins may act as a molecular chaperones of Rev, counteracting the strong tendency of Rev to aggregate with itself and/or preventing incorrect interactions with other cellular proteins. The occurrence of cytoplasmic cellular factors that inhibit Rev multimerization is suggested by a recent report demonstrating only weak Rev-Rev interaction in the cytoplasm of living cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. At high concentrations, 16.4.1 may decrease transactivation function of Rev, for example by sequestering Rev in inactive complexes in nucleoli. Inactivation of Rev by 16.4.1 could play a role in protecting the cells from Rev-mediated cytotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>HIV-1 infection of human cells involves various interactions between cellular and viral factors (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]). Some cell types (e.g. astrocytes) can control HIV-1 replication demonstrating the impact of cellular factors on HIV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Identification of cellular factors that are able to interfere with viral replication will contribute to understanding of cellular defence mechanisms against viral intruders and may also lead to identification of new targets for therapeutic approaches for virus restriction. Using HIV-1 Rev as "bait" we were able to identify a previously undescribed cellular interaction partner of an HIV-1 protein, 16.4.1. The 16.4.1 protein is exported from the nucleus by CRM1 and accumulates in the cytoplasm. An important feature of 16.4.1 is its ability to impair transactivation capacity of Rev, although both proteins localize to different cellular compartments. Conversely, Rev is capable of affecting localization of the 16.4.1 protein by recruiting it to the nuclei/nucleoli of eukaryotic cells. Because of its properties we suggest naming the 16.4.1 protein "Risp" (Rev interacting shuttling protein).</p><p>Data base analyses and preliminary studies with a specific monoclonal antibody suggest that human proteins with Risp sequences are expressed in various human cell types including HIV-1 target cells. The objective of future studies will be to characterize Risp proteins, their cellular functions and their influence on Rev activity and HIV-1 replication in different HIV-1 target cells.</p><p>This study represents a further step toward elucidating the network of host cell factors that interact with the HIV-1 Rev protein and influence its functions. This study also illustrates the power of viral proteins as tools for identification and biological characterization of novel cellular factors. Use of similar experimental strategies as presented here will help to gain deeper understanding of virus-cell interactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The inserts of all plasmid constructs used in this study were verified by sequence analysis (Sequiserve, Germany).</p><sec><title>Expression plasmids for yeast two-hybrid analysis</title><p>pEG202 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>] was used to express bait proteins containing various Rev sequences fused to the LexA DNA binding domain in yeast. pEG202 also expresses the yeast selection marker His3.</p><p>For construction of pEG202-sRev, pBsRev [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] was used as template for PCR amplification to generate the <italic>rev </italic>sequence of HIV-1 isolate HXB2; the PCR product was inserted into the EcoRI site of pEG202.

To evaluate the influence of 16.4.1-GFP on Rev-activity, pC16.4.1sg143 (0.5 &#x003bc;g or 1 &#x003bc;g) was added to the transfection mixture. Expression of fluorescent fusion proteins was checked by microscopy 24 hours after transfection and cells were analysed by flow cytometry. Typically 100,000 cells of each transfected well were analysed with a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer equipped with a 488 nm argon laser and controlled by the software CellQuest Pro. GFP-fluorescence was analysed in channel FL-1 and RFP-fluorescence in FL-3. The percentage of reporter positive cells (RFP) in the transfected cell population (GFP) was determined.</p></sec><sec><title>RNAi interference in combination with Rev activity assay</title><p>For down-regulation of gene expression, 16.4.1 specific (siRNA-16.4.1) and non-specific (siRNA-<italic>nsp</italic>) and a GFP-specific siRNA were designed and synthesized by Qiagen. Transfections were carried out using RNAiFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to supplier's protocol. Target cells were seeded one day prior to transfection in 6-well plates, 5 &#x003bc;g siRNA per well were used for each transfection. Silencing effects of GFP-fusion proteins were determined by FACS analyses 48 hours after transfection. For the combined RNAi-Rev activity experiments, siRNA transfection was performed 24 h prior to DNA transfection.</p></sec><sec><title>Bioinformatics</title><p><italic>In silico </italic>identification and analysis of sequences were performed using the databases and bioinformatics tools of NCBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>] and of Genomatix Software GmbH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>].</p><p>Similarities between nuclear export signals in the NES database NESbase 1.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>] were analysed with a set of amino acid weight matrices adapted from the MatInspector algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>] using the BLOSSOM similarity matrix values to account for conserved amino acid substitutions.

Expression of 16.4.1 was detected in HeLa cells transfected with pIgG-16.4.1 (panel a) and in non-transfected HeLa cells (panel b) by indirect immunofluorescence with the monoclonal antibody against 1.6.4.1 and Cy3-labelled secondary antibodies. Panel c shows lack of reactivity of non-transfected HeLa cells with the secondary antibody. All images were taken with the same exposure times (300 ms). (B) Western blot analyses. Additional to 16.4.1-GFP several proteins are detected in HeLa cells expressing 16.4.1-GFP after transfection of pC16.4.1sg143. Proteins in whole-cell lysates were separated by electrophoresis in gradient gels (4&#x02013;12% and 3&#x02013;8%), and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. 16.4.1 proteins were detected with the monoclonal 16.4.1 antibody and a secondary antibody conjugated with horse radish peroxidase (HRP). For detection of the 16.4.1-GFP fusion protein, the membranes were stripped and reprobed with polyclonal antibodies against GFP. Table A2 lists proteins recognized by the monoclonal antibody against 16.4.1 in different human cell lines and primary human tissues by Western blot analyses. HeLa (cervix carcinoma) and 293T (embryonal kidney) cell lines are non-neural cells and U138MG, U251MG and 85HG66 human glioblastoma cell lines.
