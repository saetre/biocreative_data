The purpose of our study was to identify an unique gene that shows cancer-associated expression, and characterizes its function related to human carcinogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We used the differential display (DD) RT-PCR method using normal cervical, cervical cancer, metastatic cervical tissues, and cervical cancer cell lines to identify genes overexpressed in cervical cancers and identified gremlin 1 which was overexpressed in cervical cancers. We determined expression levels of gremlin 1 using Northern blot analysis and immunohistochemical study in various types of human normal and cancer tissues. To understand the tumorigenesis pathway of identified gremlin 1 protein, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen, GST pull down assay, and immunoprecipitation to identify gremlin 1 interacting proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>DDRT-PCR analysis revealed that gremlin 1 was overexpressed in uterine cervical cancer. We also identified a human gremlin 1 that was overexpressed in various human tumors including carcinomas of the lung, ovary, kidney, breast, colon, pancreas, and sarcoma. PIG-2-transfected HEK 293 cells exhibited growth stimulation and increased telomerase activity. Gremlin 1 interacted with homo sapiens tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, eta polypeptide (14-3-3 eta; YWHAH). YWHAH protein binding site for gremlin 1 was located between residues 61&#x02013;80 and gremlin 1 binding site for YWHAH was found to be located between residues 1 to 67.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Gremlin 1 may play an oncogenic role especially in carcinomas of the uterine cervix, lung, ovary, kidney, breast, colon, pancreas, and sarcoma. Over-expressed gremlin 1 functions by interaction with YWHAH. Therefore, Gremlin 1 and its binding protein YWHAH could be good targets for developing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies against human cancers.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The identification of molecular alterations in cancerous and pre-cancerous cells has provided insight into the role of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in tumor initiation and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Oncogenes are derived from highly conserved proto-oncogenes that are altered by chromosomal point mutations, gene amplifications, or gene rearrangements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Structural alteration of proto-oncogenes leads to a quantitative or qualitative change in the expression of the corresponding protein product. The signal transduction pathways subverted by oncoproteins govern fundamental cell functions, including proliferation, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Although genetic characterization of tumor tissues demonstrates that mutation of the <italic>p53 </italic>gene is the most common genetic alteration in human cancers, the mutation ratio of the <italic>p53 </italic>gene in uterine cervical cancer is relatively low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It suggests that there are other oncogenes involved in cervical carcinogenesis. We applied the DDRT-PCR method to discover genes involved in tumorigenesis of human cervical tissue, and identified the new human cervical cancer-related gene, proliferation-inducing gene 2 (<italic>PIG-2</italic>) (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY232290">AY232290</ext-link>), which exhibits close similarity to gremlin 1 cDNA (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_013372">NM_013372</ext-link>) in the database.</p><p>The Drm (also known as gremlin) and its independently isolated Xenopus homolog, gremlin, a 184-aa protein initially identified through differential screening as a transcriptional down-regulated gene in v-<italic>mos</italic>-transformed rat embryonic fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], belongs to the Dan family of secreted glycosylated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], which contains a highly conserved cysteine knot domain shared by the TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily, PDGF, nerve growth factor, and other secreted proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Drm and Dan regulate early development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and renal pathophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Gremlin gene encodes a member of the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) antagonist family. Like BMPs, BMP antagonists contain cystine knots and typically form homo- and heterodimers. The cerberus and dan subfamily of BMP antagonists, to which this gene belongs, is characterized by a C-terminal cystine knot with an eight-membered ring. The antagonistic effect of the secreted glycosylated protein encoded by this gene is likely due to its direct binding to BMP proteins. As an antagonist of BMP, this gene may play a role in regulating organogenesis, body patterning, and tissue differentiation. In mouse, this protein has been shown to relay the sonic hedgehog signal from the polarizing region to the apical ectodermal ridge during limb bud outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The action of Drm and Dan on development and possibly diabetic nephropathy is mediated by heterodimerizing with certain BMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], in particular BMP2, 4, and 7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] to subsequently block the ability of BMPs to bind their receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Chen et al. have previously shown that the capacity of Drm to suppress transformation and tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] is mediated by a mechanism that is independent of BMPs and involves both up-regulation of p21<sup><italic>Cip</italic>1 </sup>and down-regulation of p42/44 MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], suggesting additional target(s) for Drm and other Dan family members.</p><p>To identify additional target proteins for PIG-2 which exhibits close similarity to gremlin 1, we used a yeast two-hybrid screening approach with a PIG-2-LexA fusion construct as the bait to search for potential PIG2-binding partners. This approach identified homo sapiens tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, eta polypeptide (14-3-3 eta; YWHAH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] as one type of the PIG-2-interacting proteins. Thus, the data demonstrate that Gremlin 1 functionally interacts with YWHAH protein to act as an oncoprotein for the genesis of human cancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissues and cell lines</title><p>For Differential display (DD) of mRNA, normal exocervical tissue specimen was obtained from uterine myoma patients during hysterectomy and untreated primary cervical cancer tissues and metastatic lymph node tissues were obtained during radical hysterectomy. Patient consent was obtained from each individual and the use of tissue samples was approved by the ethics committee of our institution. The cervical caner cell line used in DD was CasKi and CUMC-6 which was isolated in our laboratory and maintained as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Mammalian cell lines described below were all obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA): CasKi is a human cervical cancer cell line.

With the use of the differential display kit (RNAimage&#x02122; kit), we performed PCR using oligo-dT primers and arbitrary sequences, each 13 bases in length according to the manufacturer's recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. After cDNAs of 3' termini of mRNAs were generated, the PCR products were separated by electrophoreses on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Bands representing cDNAs of interest were excised from dried sequencing gel. The cDNAs were eluted in distilled water by boiling for 15 minutes and then were reamplified without [&#x003b1;-<sup>35</sup>S]dATP, and with 20 &#x003bc;M dNTPs instead of 2 &#x003bc;M dNTPs. From the films, a 282 bp cDNA (referred to as CC282) was identified that was expressed in primary cervical cancer tissue, metastatic lymph node and cervical cancer cell lines but not in normal cervical tissue. CC282 was identified by the use of 5' arbitrary primer H-AP28 (5' -AAGCTTACGATGC-3') and 3' H-T<sub>11</sub>C anchored primer (5' -AAGCTTTTTTTTTTTC-3') (GenHunter). CC282 was then subcloned into pGEM-T easy vector with the use of the TA cloning system and sequenced with the use of the Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA Sequencing System (United States Biochemical Co., Cleveland, OH).</p></sec><sec><title>Northern blot analysis</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from fresh human tissues and cell lines using RNeasy total RNA kit (Qiagen). Northern blot analysis was carried out, in which 20 &#x003bc;g of denatured total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1.0% formaldehyde agarose gel and transferred to nylon membrane (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The mRNA expression of <italic>PIG-2 </italic>was also assessed in normal human tissues and a variety of human cancer cell lines with the use of prepared membranes obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) and processed as recommended by the supplier. Human &#x003b2;-actin cDNA control probe provided by Clontech was used as a loading control.

To examine cell morphologies, clones of HEK 293 cells stably transfected with the <italic>PIG-2 </italic>gene were grown to approximately 70% of confluency in culture flasks, and photographed by Olympus (Inha, Japan) phase-contrast microscopy (magnification, <bold>&#x000d7; </bold>100).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>For immunohistochemistry, cryosections (5 &#x003bc;m thick) of human normal and cancer tissues were used.

Before incubation with primary antibody, the sections were permeabilized by incubation in 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 minutes and then blocked with normal goat serum for 15 minutes. The sections were incubated with polyclonal anti-Gremlin antibody (IMGENEX, San Diego, CA) for 2 hours at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, the sections were sequentially incubated with biotinylated species-specific secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlington, CA) for 1 hour at room temperature, and then avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Aminoethyl carbozole (AEC) was used as the chromogen. After immunostaining, sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.

All experiments were performed in the yeast strain EGY48 transformed with p8op-lacZ, which expresses lacZ and leu genes as reporters (Clontech). We inserted a PIG-2 cDNA fragment into a yeast two-hybrid vector (pLexA) (Clontech) containing the LexA DNA-binding domain. Yeast cells expressing the LexA-PIG-2 were transformed with a human fetal brain cDNA library (Invitrogen) that expresses B42AD fusion proteins. After library transformation, cells are plated on minimal synthetic dropout non-induction medium (Sigma) that selects for both the bait (PIG-2) and the AD/library plasmids to improve the chances of detecting AD fusion proteins. To confirm the interaction between PIG-2 and binding protein YWHAH, plasmids expressing PIG-2 and YWHAH were co-transformed into yeast cells. &#x003b2;-galactosidase filter lift assays were performed by replica-plating the co-transformants expressing PIG-2 and YWHAH on Trp-, Leu-, His- selection plates. We used a yeast mating assay to eliminate false positive interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>GST-tagged YWHAH protein expression and pull down experiments</title><p>GST-tagged proteins were expressed and extracts were prepared as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). <italic>E.coli </italic>(strain BL21) extracts containing GST alone, GST-YWHAH and PIG-2 deletion mutants or GST-PIG-2 and YWHAH deletion mutants were incubated with 30 &#x003bc;l of glutathione-sepharose in 500 &#x003bc;l of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-1000, containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, and 1.5 mg/ml pepstatin) for 12 hours at 4&#x000b0;C.

The fusion protein-bound beads were washed three times with 500 &#x003bc;l of TEN buffer (20 mM Tris HCl [pH 7.4], 0.1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl). For GST pull down experiments, fusion proteins bound to the beads were incubated with proteins from HEK 293 total cell extracts expressing PIG-2 or YWHAH for 12 hours at 4?. The beads were washed using NETN buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris HCl [pH 7.4], 300 mM NaCl) and eluted with 30 ml of SDS sample buffer (75 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 0.5% glycerol, 1% SDS, 4% mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromophenol blue), and boiled for 3 minutes before separating on an 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Eluted proteins were subjected to western blot analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation and Western blot</title><p>To confirm the interaction between PIG-2 and binding protein YWHAH, HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with pFLAG-CMV (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) encoding the full-length of PIG-2 and pcDNA3.1-Myc-His/YWHAH (Invitrogen). After 48 hours, the cells were harvested and lysed with RIPA buffer (20 mM Hepes [pH 7.2], 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF, 10% glycerol, 10 g/ml leupeptin, 10 g/ml aprotinin, 1 mM phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were precleared with preimmune serum (mouse) and protein A-Sepharose at 4&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes. Protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Aliquots (1 mg) of precleared cell lysates were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of anti-FLAG (Sigma, F3165) or 1:500 dilution of anti-Myc (Santa Cruz, 9E10) monoclonal antibody (mAb) and 40 ml of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads in PBS for 4 hours at 4&#x000b0;C. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation (2,000 &#x000d7; g for 5 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C), washed five times with a buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM Na3VO4, 10% glycerol and 1 % Nonidet P-40), and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%~12%). Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and schuell), blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST buffer (20 mM tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 150 mM NaCl, and 0.5% Tween20) for 2 hours at room temperature.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, among the multiple bands, CC282 was strongly expressed in cervical cancer tissue, metastatic lymph node tissue, and CasKi and CUMC-6 cervical cancer cells, but not normal cervical tissue. Using the partial cDNA CC282 as a probe, we screened normal human lung, normal uterine cervical tissue, and cervical cancer cDNA library to identify the full-length cDNA. One clone with size of 4151 bp was isolated from the human lung cDNA library. This clone, named <italic>PIG-2 </italic>for human proliferation-inducing gene 2 (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY 232290">AY 232290</ext-link>), encoded a polypeptide of 184 amino acids with a predicted relative molecular mass of 21 kDa. <italic>PIG-2 </italic>exhibited 99% homology with the recorded human gremlin 1, cysteine knot superfamily, homolog (Xenopus laevis) (GREM1), mRNA sequence (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_013372">NM_013372</ext-link>).

To explain the possible oncogenic role of <italic>PIG-2</italic>-transfected cells, we determined telomerase activity in PIG-2-transfected HEK 293 cells. Wild-type HEK 293 cells showed detectable telomerase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). <italic>PIG-2 </italic>gene transfection increased telomerase activity up to about 2-fold when compared with HEK 293 wild-type cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PIG-2 interacts with YWHAH in vivo</title><p>To understand the PIG-2 tumorigenesis pathway, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified the YWHAH protein, encoded by the gene <italic>homo sapiens tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, eta polypeptide </italic>(GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_003405">NM_003405</ext-link>), was interacted with PIG-2.

The physical interaction between PIG-2 and YWHAH was examined <italic>in vivo </italic>by co-immunoprecipitation in HEK 293 cells. The FLAG epitope-tagged PIG-2 was transiently overexpressed together with the Myc-tagged YWHAH in HEK 293 cells, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody and detected by western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). We also performed the immunoprecipitation of reverse form of co-expression, YWHAH-Myc and PIG-2-FLAG proteins, <italic>in vivo </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, PIG-2 could be co-immunoprecipitated with YWHAH, indicating that YWHAH is likely to be a binding partner.

Consistent with the yeast-two hybrid results, the GST pull-down assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) showed that two GST-YWHAH constructs, YWHAH (1&#x02013;80) and YWHAH (1&#x02013;100) bind PIG-2, but not GST alone, YWHAH (1&#x02013;60) and YWHAH (81&#x02013;247). To further confirm the direct interaction of PIG-2 and YWHAH <italic>in vitro</italic>, the GST pull-down assays were performed with the GST-tagged PIG-2 proteins and the lysates of HEK 293 cells expressing full-length YWHAH were incubated with the resin-bound GST-PIG-2 proteins, and the pulled down samples were detected using anti-Myc antibodies. The GST pull-down assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) showed that GST-PIG-2 (1&#x02013;67), GST-PIG-2 (1&#x02013;100) and GST-PIG-2 (1&#x02013;147), but not GST alone, selectively pulled down with the full-length YWHAH. The PIG-2 binding site for YWHAH was found to be located between residues 1 to 67, which is not included in the DAN domain, may play an important role in the YWHAH-specific interaction as a novel protein binding domain. Therefore, the binding analysis indicates that the YWHAH binding site for PIG-2 is located between residues 61&#x02013;80, which constructively include in the &#x003b1; helix C-&#x003b1; helix D linker, may play an important role in this intracellular interaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To discover genes involved in human cervical carcinogenesis, we applied DDRT-PCR and identified the candidate human cervical cancer-related gene, proliferation-inducing gene 2 (<italic>PIG-2</italic>) (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY232290">AY232290</ext-link>).

Topol et al. had previously shown that most tumor-derived cells fail to express Drm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and that in fibroblasts Drm expression is inhibited following oncogene-induced transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Human Drm maps to chromosome 15q13-q15, within a region whose loss is associated with metastatic breast cancer and other metastatic carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. These properties suggested that Drm might play an inhibitory role in cell transformation or tumorigenesis. They also demonstrated that overexpression of Drm in the tumor-derived cell lines Daoy (primitive neuroectodermal) and Saos-2 (osteoblastic) significantly inhibited tumorigenesis and provided evidence that Drm can function as a novel transformation suppressor and suggested that this may occur through its affect on the levels of p21<sup><italic>Cip</italic>1 </sup>and phosphorylated p42/44 MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].

In this study, we identified an oncogene that is expressed in multiple different human cancers, and investigated whether the oncogene is responsible for the genesis of human cancer. To understand the PIG-2 tumorigenesis pathway, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified the 14-3-3 eta (YWHAH) protein was interacted with PIG-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>This gene product belongs to the 14-3-3 family of proteins which mediate signal transduction by binding to phosphoserine-containing proteins. This highly conserved protein family is found in both plants and mammals, and this protein is 99% identical to the mouse, rat and bovine orthologs. This gene contains a 7 bp repeat sequence in its 5' UTR, and changes in the number of this repeat has been associated with early-onset schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>The 14-3-3 proteins are a family of conserved regulatory molecules expressed in all eukaryotic cells. A striking feature of the 14-3-3 proteins is their ability to bind a multitude of functionally diverse signaling proteins, including kinases, phosphatases, and transmembrane receptors. This plethora of interacting proteins allows 14-3-3 to play important roles in a wide range of vital regulatory processes, such as mitogenic signal transduction, apoptotic cell death, and cell cycle control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Acronyms14-3-3 family proteins interact with many signaling molecules, such as MAPK kinase kinase, Raf-1, Wee1, Cdc25, cyclin B1, protein kinase C, IGF-I receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1, Bad, and Bcl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], and regulate several signal transduction pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Also, 14-3-3 proteins help two molecules to interact or to interrupt the association between two molecules by functioning as molecular scaffolds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>Binding of a protein to a 14-3-3 protein may result in stabilization of the active or inactive phosphorylated form of the protein, to a conformational alteration leading to activation or inhibition, to a different subcellular localization or to the interaction with other proteins.

Although further investigation with larger number of samples will be needed, these results indicate that increased expression of the PIG-2 may be associated with human tumorigenesis. Our study suggests that over-expressed gremlin 1 functions by interaction with YWHAH in human tumorigenesis. While further studies are needed to characterize cellular functions and regulatory mechanisms, gremlin 1 is a candidate oncoprotein in the development of many types of human cancers, and gremlin 1 and its binding protein YWHAH could be good targets for developing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies against human cancers.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HN and JWK designed the project.
