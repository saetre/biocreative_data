Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain its role in pathogenesis of the gut.

Recasting of the genome is the norm with this bacterium, creating thereby a lot of allelic and phase variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001481-Suerbaum1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, posing difficulties in the development of diagnostics and vaccines.</p><p>Once acquired, the infection persists for years and, elicits detectable immune responses in infected persons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001481-Mgraud1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001481-Mitchell1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> characterized by increased levels of specific IgG and IgA in serum and augmentation of secretory IgA and IgM in stomach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001481-Dunn1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, noninvasive serological tests were recommended and developed for the diagnosis of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection. Among these, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is one of the most extensively used method as it is relatively affordable, fast, simple to perform, and could be easily adopted for screening large number of samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001481-Goossens1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Exploring for anti <italic>H. pylori</italic> antibodies is often prescribed before endoscopy or before initiating treatment. Although due to immunological memory, serodiagnosis may not be preferred to check the success or outcome of eradication treatment, it remains a choice as a sensitive method probably because of its non-invasive nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001481-Glupczynski1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Currently, there has not been any single &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; antigen, which can unambiguously be used across all populations.

The immunoreactivity data were statistically analyzed and compared with connection to both infected and healthy sera.

The metabolic enzymes such as ICD seem to be good candidates to be harnessed for serological test kit development mainly because they do not cross-react with sera from non-infected or healthy individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001481-Banerjee1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The significance of many immunogenic proteins of <italic>H. pylori</italic> including some metabolic enzymes has not been appreciated much in clinical samples in a previous proteomics based study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001481-Kimmel1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

We speculate that the immune response seen in peptic ulcer cases and gastritis could perhaps be due to high loads of bacteria associated with invasive pathology and thereby a higher number of autolysed pathogens or pathogens presenting ICD on the surface.

The entry of <italic>H. pylori</italic> proteins into the gastric submucosal space may have important functional consequences such as promotion of proinflammatory and chemotactic responses through release of cytokines from activated macrophages. Also, the extracellular release and or adsorption or surface localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001481-Phadnis1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> of potentially immunogenic proteins might support a bacterial strategy for diverting an effective local immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001481-Cao1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Keeping these multiple mechanisms in mind, we checked proinflammatory potentials of ICD with the help of an IL-8 ELISA assay.

However, since we did not analyze role of ICD as regards to induction of other proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1; and IL1-&#x003b2;, it will be premature to justly rule out its involvement in gastric inflammation.</p><p>Having shown that <italic>H. pylori</italic> ICD elicits a humoral response, we investigated the basis of immune specificity of this protein as reflected by structure based modelling. Our sequence analyses and molecular modelling of <italic>H. pylori</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> ICDs did not reveal complete structural overlaps between the two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001481-g001">Figure 1</xref>); several regions of structural dissimilarities were discerned which possibly correspond to the putative antigenic epitopes in <italic>H. pylori</italic> ICD. Apart from the issues linked to structural conservation or diversity, we hypothesize that higher reactivity of <italic>H. pylori</italic> ICD as compared to ICD of (commensal) <italic>E. coli</italic> with the host immune system <italic>in vivo</italic> could be associated with 1) different invasiveness of <italic>H. pylori</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> 2) different magnitudes of bacterial load, turnover and autolysis 3) different repertoire of antigen presenting cells (macrophages versus dendritic cells) involved and their relative abundance 4) availability of surface exposed epitopes in <italic>H. pylori</italic> ICD (as those highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001481-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), and 5) presence of active lesions of chronic inflammation, mucosal damage and chemotactic effects of the other <italic>H. pylori</italic> proteins in the <italic>milieu</italic>.</p><p>While considering possible cross-reactivity from other invasive bacteria such as <italic>C. jejuni</italic>, we tested <italic>H. pylori</italic> ICD against 8 samples of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> enteritis patient sera and found that it did not cross-react significantly (data not shown). The <italic>H. pylori</italic> free status of our <italic>C. jejuni</italic> positive patients was determined based on the absence of symptoms of indigestion, stomach pain and heartburn etc. However, since we used only limited sera samples from <italic>C. jejuni</italic> patients, we are not inclined to brand <italic>H. pylori</italic> ICD as a standalone diagnostic antigen. Nonetheless, <italic>C. jejuni</italic> may not always comprise a much competitive background unless <italic>C. jejuni</italic> patients themselves are clinically colonized by <italic>H. pylori</italic> or vice-versa.</p><p>Finally, the promising results we obtained in terms of significant humoral responses to <italic>H. pylori</italic> ICD may not be construed as immediately applicable for field level diagnosis. Nonetheless, it is possible that our findings provide a solid foundation for the development of a sero-diagnostic test for <italic>H. pylori</italic> associated gastroduodenal pathologies. We suggest the potential of this antigen and its epitope specific peptides may further be analyzed by using a large battery of sera samples representing different disease subjects. Similarly, the status and significance of cross-reacting antibodies in sera corresponding to illnesses caused by bacteria such as Salmonella spp., Shigella spp. and other invasive enteropathogens might also be determined. It will be worthwhile to explore in-depth the involvement of ICD in signaling activities in the submucosal space, specially its interaction with the activated macrophages and lymphocytes.
