A 5.6 kb Sal I - Xba I fragment containing the first 4 exons of the alpha 2-macroglobulin gene and 1.3 kb of its 5'-flanking region was sequenced. The putative transcriptional start site was determined by RNase protection and primer extension analysis. TATA- and CAAT-box equivalent sequences were found. A potential glucocorticoid receptor binding site was located on the antisense strand. DNA sequences containing the 5'-flanking region of the rat alpha 2-macroglobulin gene were linked to the gene coding for the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and introduced into Hep G2 cells. In these transfected Hep G2 cells CAT activity could be induced by recombinant human interleukin-6. Deletion analyses have shown that the sequences between -852 and -777 as well as between -404 and -165 relative to the cap site, contain regulatory elements involved in the interleukin-6 dependent induction of the alpha 2-macroglobulin gene.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00212-0304-a" xlink:role="1130"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00212-0305-a" xlink:role="1131"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00212-0305-b" xlink:role="1131"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00212-0295.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1121"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00212-0296.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1122"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00212-0297.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1123"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00212-0298.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1124"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00212-0299.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1125"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00212-0300.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1126"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00212-0301.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1127"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00212-0302.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1128"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00212-0303.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1129"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00212-0304.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1130"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00212-0305.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1131"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00212-0306.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1132"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00212-0307.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1133"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00212-0308.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1134"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00212-0309.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1135"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00212-0310.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1136"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00212-0311.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1137"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00212-0312.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1138"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
