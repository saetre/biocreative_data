Besides the normal expression of Dp71 in a subpopulation of astrocytes, we found that a pool of Dp71 colocalizes with synaptic proteins in cultured neurons and is expressed in synaptic subcellular fractions in adult brains. We report that Dp71-associated protein complexes interact with specialized modular scaffolds of proteins that cluster glutamate receptors and organize signaling in postsynaptic densities. We then undertook the first functional examination of the brain and cognitive alterations in the Dp71-null mice.

Dp71 function is however unclear and complex, as the protein appears to be expressed in both perivascular astrocyte end-feet and neurons. Here, we further characterized this complex pattern of expression and show that Dp71 interacts with specialized modular scaffolds that organize signaling complexes at glutamatergic synapses. We also found that Dp71 loss affects synaptic maturation and function, and results in deficits in selective cognitive functions.</p><p>The data provide evidence for an association of Dp71-DAPC with the multi-protein scaffolds that cluster glutamate receptors and organize signaling proteins required for synaptic transmission and plasticity, including NMDAr and AMPAr subunits, and other PDZ-containing proteins such as PSD-95 and nNOS.

Future studies will determine whether such mechanisms can explain how Dp71-DAPC binds to synaptic proteins.

This suggests cross-linkage between organizing molecules of the PSD and lipid rafts and the possible existence of two distinct pools of Dp71-DAPC in PSD and in perisynaptic regions. In brains of Dp71-null mice, loss of Dp71 resulted in reduced levels of &#x003b2;-dystroglycan and &#x003b1;-syntrophin. This, however, did not prevent the formation of NMDAr complexes, which also maintained stable associations with &#x003b1;-dystrobrevins and &#x003b1;-syntrophin, suggesting that distinct mechanisms are involved in postsynaptic membrane targeting of Dp71, DAPs and members of glutamate-receptor complexes.</p><p>Emerging notion conceptualize DAPC as a scaffold for proteins involved in membrane stabilization and transmembrane signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006574-Albrecht1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Here, we found that cultured primary neurons from Dp71-null mice have abnormally large clusters of PSD-95 protein and a reduced number of mature synapses. Hence, whereas Dp71-DAPC seems dispensable for postsynaptic targeting of glutamate receptor complexes, it may be a key modulator of their organized distribution. At the ultrastructural level in the adult brain, we found that KO mice have a reduced number of excitatory synapses (&#x0223c;11&#x02013;13&#x00025;) with larger cross-sectional PSD length, which parallels our findings in cultured neurons and suggests reduced synapse density and altered morphology of the postsynaptic active zone in Dp71-null mice.</p><p>Using the hippocampal slice preparation, we found that both AMPAr and NMDAr-mediated components of CA1 glutamatergic transmission were drastically enhanced in KO mice. This was associated with reduced LTP levels, yet larger magnitude of LTP could be achieved in KO mice with stronger tetanization protocols, whereas LTD was not affected. Given the range of proteins found to interact with Dp71-DAPC, such alterations could be attributed to several pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms. A presynaptic hypothesis involving increased glutamate release is suggested by the overall increase in neurotransmission and reduced paired-pulse facilitation observed in KO mice. Moreover, in cultured neurons congenital loss of Dp71 was associated with an altered distribution of the presynaptic vesicular transporter VGLUT1. A purely presynaptic account seems however unlikely as PTP under NMDAr blockade was comparable between genotypes. On the other hand, the contribution of postsynaptic mechanisms to enhanced synaptic transmission in Dp71-KO is suggested by the increased PSD length, which may correlate with aggregation of receptors and signaling molecules at the active zone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006574-Cheung1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006574-Martone1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, and by the abnormal accumulation of PSD-95 in Dp71-deficient synapses, which could increase NMDAr gating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006574-Lin1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, promote the delivery of AMPAr to synapses and increase AMPAr currents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006574-ElHusseini1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006574-Ehrlich1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

At this stage, however, the primary mechanisms linking Dp71 loss to altered synaptic function remain uncertain. The observed synaptic alterations indicate that the congenital loss of Dp71 significantly impinges synapse organization and maturation, but does not imply that Dp71 takes part actively to experience-driven synaptic plasticity in the adult brain. Moreover, other factors related to Dp71 function in other cell types might also contribute to the phenotype: The Dp71-DAPC appears to endorse a major role in the clustering of aquaporin (AQP4) channels in perivascular astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006574-Haenggi1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> and its disruption may alter the blood-brain barrier and water and K&#x0002b;homeostasis, which could indirectly affect neuronal function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006574-Nicchia1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The diversity of mechanisms presumably modified as a consequence of Dp71 loss underscores the complex cellular and subcellular distribution of Dp71 in brain.

Impaired navigation in the water maze and spatial alternation in the T-maze suggest an alteration in hippocampus-dependent encoding and/or consolidation of spatial information, in line with the synaptic and neurophysiological alterations observed in Dp71-null mice in this structure. However, the ability of Dp71-null mice to reach a normal level of performance in the navigation task when task difficulty is reduced, the mild deficit in inhibitory avoidance and unaffected retention performance in object recognition and contextual fear conditioning suggest that certain hippocampal functions are preserved.

Synapses were examined in the distal stratum radiatum (&#x0223c;150 &#x000b5;m from the CA1 pyramidal cell bodies).

Extracellular synaptic responses were recorded in CA1 stratum radiatum to monitor PFVs and fEPSPs evoked by electrical stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers at 0.1 Hz. Input/output curves were constructed by measuring the slopes of fEPSPs mediated by AMPAr and NMDAr at different stimulus intensities (100&#x02013;500 &#x000b5;A; 60 &#x000b5;s duration, averages of 3 responses). NMDAr-mediated responses were isolated in the presence of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist, bicuculline (10 &#x000b5;M), and the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist 6,7-Dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX, 10 &#x000b5;M). Addition of D-APV (30 &#x000b5;M) was used to analyze PFVs in the absence of EPSPs. PPF was induced by stimulation with pairs of pulses with a 50-ms interstimulus interval and quantified as the ratio of the second over the first fEPSP slopes. To investigate LTP, the initial slope of 3 averaged fEPSPs was measured for 15 min (baseline) and tetanic stimulation consisted of two trains, 20 s apart, of HFS of either 50 Hz or 100 Hz (duration: 1 s at test intensity).

(A) Dp71 is transcribed from a promoter located between exons 62 and 63 of the DMD gene; it has a unique N-terminus of seven amino acids and contains the cysteine-rich and common C-terminal domain of dystrophins, a region for binding to DAPs complexes. (B) Dp71 alternative spliced transcripts. Dp71d isoform lacks exon 71 and Dp71f isoform lacks exons 71 and 78 (Marquez et al., Neuroscience 118:957&#x02013;966, 2003). Deletion of exon 78 changes the reading frame, resulting in the replacement of the last 13 hydrophilic amino acids of dystrophin with 31 new hydrophobic amino acids in the Dp71 protein. Variants of Dp71 protein with minor expression in brain have also been described (Austin et al., Neuromuscul Disord 10(3):187&#x02013;93, 2000): Dp71&#x00394;110m is derived from Dp71 transcripts deleted for exons 71&#x02013;74 and contains the C-terminal sequence of muscle dystrophin, while Dp71&#x00394;110a contains the alternative 31-amino acid C-terminal sequence due to the splicing of exon 78 (Austin et al., J Biol Chem 277:47106&#x02013;47113, 2002).

This staining pattern confirms that 5F3 detects specifically Dp71 isoforms lacking exon 78 and expressed in neurites. 5F3 also revealed a basal discontinuous granular labeling in the Golgi complex in both control and Dp71-deficient neurons, which may reflect binding to another dystrophin-like protein in the perinuclear region (Ch&#x000e1;vez et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun 274:275&#x02013;280, 2000).
