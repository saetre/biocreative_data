Although its precise role in this process is unclear, Cdc24 forms a complex with Dna2, a conserved endonuclease&#x02013;helicase implicated in the removal of the RNA&#x02013;DNA primer during Okazaki fragment processing. To gain further insights into Cdc24&#x02013;Dna2 function, we screened for chromosomal suppressors of the temperature-sensitive <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> allele and mapped the suppressing mutations into six complementation groups. Two of these mutations defined genes encoding the Pol3 and Cdc27 subunits of DNA polymerase &#x003b4;. Sequence analysis revealed that all the suppressing mutations in Cdc27 resulted in truncation of the protein and loss of sequences that included the conserved C-terminal PCNA binding motif, previously shown to play an important role in maximizing enzyme processivity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Deletion of this motif is shown to be sufficient for suppression of both <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> and <italic>dna2-C2</italic>, a temperature-sensitive allele of <italic>dna2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, suggesting that disruption of the interaction between Cdc27 and PCNA renders the activity of the Cdc24&#x02013;Dna2 complex dispensable.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In all eukaryotic cells, chromosomal DNA replication is achieved by the coordinated action of a large number of protein factors. Replication is a semi-discontinuous process: the leading strand is synthesized continuously, while the lagging strand is synthesized as a series of discrete Okazaki fragments that are later processed to yield a continuous DNA strand. Genetic and biochemical studies in yeast and higher eukaryotic systems, notably the SV40 <italic>in vitro</italic> replication system, have identified &#x0223c;20 polypeptides that are essential for Okazaki fragment synthesis and processing, namely DNA polymerase &#x003b1;-primase (Pol &#x003b1;-primase), replication protein A (RPA), DNA polymerase &#x003b4; (Pol &#x003b4;), replication factor C (RFC), the sliding clamp PCNA, the nucleases Fen1 and Dna2, and DNA ligase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c1">1</xref>). All these factors appear to be conserved in all eukaryotic cells.</p><p>Current models for Okazaki fragment synthesis and processing can be summarized as follows. First, Pol &#x003b1;-primase synthesizes a short RNA&#x02013;DNA primer on the template DNA. Then polymerase switching takes place, resulting in displacement of the non-processive low-fidelity Pol &#x003b1;-primase enzyme and its replacement by Pol &#x003b4;, which is both highly processive when complexed with its processivity factor PCNA and also possesses proofreading activity, ensuring high-fidelity DNA synthesis. Polymerase switching requires the clamp loader complex RFC to recognize the primer-template junction and load the sliding clamp PCNA onto the dsDNA. PCNA encircles the DNA and tethers Pol &#x003b4; to it. The Pol &#x003b4;&#x02013;PCNA complex then continues to synthesize DNA until it encounters the 5&#x02032; end of the previously synthesized Okazaki fragment, at which point displacement synthesis results in the formation of an RNA&#x02013;DNA flap structure. Studies with purified proteins suggest that the extent of displacement synthesis is governed by the binding of the single-stranded binding complex RPA to the displaced flap once the length of the flap has reached &#x0223c;35 nt. RPA binding, and its recruitment of the Dna2 helicase&#x02013;endonuclease, ensures that further displacement synthesis is inhibited. Dna2 then cleaves the flap, most likely removing the entire RNA&#x02013;DNA segment originally synthesized by the non-proofreading Pol &#x003b1;&#x02013;primase complex, leaving a shortened flap structure that can be cleaved by the non-essential Fen1 nuclease. The nicked DNA produced is finally sealed by DNA ligase I.</p><p>In fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, Pol &#x003b4; is composed of four subunits, three of which are essential for cell viability, Pol3, Cdc1 and Cdc27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c2">2</xref>). Orthologues of all four proteins, including the non-essential subunit Cdm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c3">3</xref>), are found as subunits of mammalian Pol &#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c4">4</xref>). Pol3 is the catalytic subunit of the complex. Pol3 binds directly to the B-subunit Cdc1 via a conserved C-terminal zinc finger module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c5">5</xref>). The Cdc1 protein then binds to the C-subunit Cdc27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c6">6</xref>). Cdc27 comprises a globular &#x0223c;160 residue N-terminal domain (NTD), through which it binds Cdc1, and an extended C-terminal domain of &#x0223c;210 residues, at the extreme C-terminus of which is located a PCNA binding motif (PIP box) of the type first identified in the mammalian DNA replication inhibitor p21<sup>Cip1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c7">7</xref>). Also located in the C-terminal region of the protein is a conserved, non-essential binding site for Pol1, the catalytic subunit of Pol &#x003b1;&#x02013;primase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c10">10</xref>). The D-subunit of the complex, Cdm1, is not essential for cell viability and its role in Pol &#x003b4; function is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c3">3</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the conserved proteins mentioned above, the fission yeast Cdc24 protein has also been suggested to have a function in lagging strand DNA synthesis. Cdc24 is a 501 amino acid protein with no significant similarity to proteins in current databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c12">12</xref>). The involvement of Cdc24 in lagging strand DNA synthesis is suggested from genetic and&#x0002f;or physical interactions with RFC, PCNA, Pol &#x003b4; and Dna2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c13">13</xref>). However the precise role of Cdc24 in lagging strand synthesis has not yet been established. In this report, Cdc24 is shown to form a complex with Dna2 in fission yeast protein extracts, extending previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c13">13</xref>) obtained using the two-hybrid system. We also report the isolation and analysis of <italic>cdc24</italic> suppressor mutants. Together with complex formation between Cdc24 and Dna2, we propose that Cdc24 has a role in the processing of flap structures in Okazaki fragment maturation during lagging strand DNA synthesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>General fission yeast techniques and reagents</title><p><italic>S.pombe</italic> genetic techniques and media were as described in reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c14">14</xref>). The <italic>S.pombe</italic> cDNA library used was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c12">12</xref>). The <italic>S.pombe</italic> genomic DNA libraries were constructed by inserting restriction enzyme digested genomic DNA into plasmid pALSK<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Epitope tagging</title><p>For epitope tagging of <italic>cdc24</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>dna2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, plasmid pKSU&#x02013;XHA was first generated by subcloning the genomic <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> HindIII fragment and 3xHA-nmt1 3&#x02032; UTR region NotI-SacI fragment from plasmid pREP2&#x02013;XHA, a version of pREP2 carrying sequences encoding three HA epitopes for C-terminal tagging, into pBluescript II KS&#x0002b; (Stratagene). Next, <italic>cdc24</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> genomic DNA was amplified by PCR, digested with EcoRI and NotI (the sites were present in the oligonucleotides used for PCR) and ligated into pKSU&#x02013;XHA, such that the <italic>cdc24</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> open reading frame (ORF) was fused in frame at its 3&#x02032; end to sequences encoding three copies of the HA mAb epitope. Next, the nmt1 3&#x02032; UTR in this plasmid was replaced with the 3&#x02032; UTR of <italic>cdc24</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> by replacing the BamHI-SacI region with a BamHI-SacI <italic>cdc24</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> fragment generated by PCR, to make pKSU&#x02013;cdc24HAUTR. For <italic>dna2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, plasmid pKSU&#x02013;dna2HAUTR was constructed in a similar fashion by subcloning <italic>dna2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> genomic DNA and <italic>dna2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> 3&#x02032; UTR sequence into pKSU&#x02013;XHA. For construction of pKSU&#x02013;cdc24MycUTR and pKSU&#x02013;dna2MycUTR, the NotI-BamHI 3xHA fragment in the plasmids described above was replaced with a PCR amplified 13xMyc fragment. All DNA sequences amplified by PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The sequences of the primers used will be provided by the authors on request.</p><p>To construct the epitope tagged strains, the pop-in&#x0002f;pop-out homologous recombination method was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c15">15</xref>). The pKSU&#x02013;cdc24HAUTR and pKSU&#x02013;cdc24MycUTR plasmids were linearized by HpaI digestion, while pKSU&#x02013;dna2HAUTR and pKSU&#x02013;dna2MycUTR plasmids were linearized by BglII digestion. The linear plasmid DNAs were then transformed into <italic>ura4-D18 leu1-32</italic> h<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells. After selection of stable ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants, PCR was used to confirm the correct integration (pop-in) of the plasmids at the desired loci. Ura<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells were then selected on 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) plates. Loss of the plasmid (pop-out) was confirmed by PCR and followed by immunoblotting analysis. The tagged strains were backcrossed three times and double <italic>cdc24 dna2</italic> mutants were obtained by crossing the single mutants.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting</title><p>Exponentially growing cells in EMM medium supplemented with uracil and leucine were collected and washed with ice-cold STOP buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM EDTA and 1 mM NaN<sub>3</sub>). Cells were resuspended in Buffer B (10 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 1% Triton X-100, 1mM EDTA and 100mM NaCl) with protease inhibitors, transferred into a tube containing glass beads, and disrupted using a Ribolyser (Hybaid). Cell extracts (2.0 mg or 1.0 mg of proteins in buffer B in panels A and B, respectively) were mixed with anti-HA rat monoclonal antibody (clone 3F10) affinity matrix (Roche) that had been pre-treated with BSA. After incubation for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C with rotation, the immunoprecipitates were washed four times with buffer B. Crude extracts (20 &#x003bc;g in panel A or 10 &#x003bc;g in panel B) and immunoprecipitates from 2.0 mg or 1.0 mg of extract (as above) were separated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE, transferred to membrane and detected by anti-HA (clone 12CA5) or anti-Myc (clone 9E10) mouse monoclonal antibodies (Roche).</p></sec><sec><title>Classification of <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> suppressor mutants</title><p>Spontaneous genetic suppressors of <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> h<sup>&#x02212;</sup> were isolated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c16">16</xref>). Briefly, <italic>cdc24-M38 leu1-32 h<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells were incubated at 36&#x000b0;C for 3 days on YE medium. Spontaneous revertant colonies were then replica-plated to 18&#x000b0;C for 3&#x02013;5 days to test for cold-sensitivity. Following backcrossing, the cold-sensitive suppressor strains were crossed with <italic>leu1</italic> h<sup>&#x0002b;S</sup> to determine whether the suppressing mutations were intra- or extragenic. Subsequently, to group the suppressors into complementation groups, the suppressed <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> h<sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains were crossed to <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> h<sup>&#x0002b;S</sup>, to allow the isolation of suppressed <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> strains of opposite mating type. The different suppressed strains (<italic>cdc24-M38 cstX</italic>, <italic>cdc24-M38 ctsY</italic>, etc.) were then crossed with one another and the progeny analysed by random spore analysis. Where all the progeny were cold-sensitive, the suppressing mutations were assigned to the same complementation group. Otherwise, the suppressors were assigned to different complementation groups. In all, the suppressing mutations fell into six complementation groups, designated <italic>cst1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>cst6</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of <italic>cdc27</italic> mutants</title><p>Three types of <italic>cdc27</italic> deletion mutations were generated by PCR. DNA fragments were digested with EcoRI and NotI, and subcloned into pBluescript II-ura4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> plasmid. The resultant plasmids, pKSU&#x02013;cdc27-D1, pKSU&#x02013;cdc27-D2 and pKSU&#x02013;cdc27-D3, contain 0.5 kb of 3&#x02032; UTR derived from the <italic>cdc27</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene and a varying length of coding sequence depending on the length of deletion (see Results). All DNA sequences generated by PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing. After linearization by PstI digestion, the three plasmids were transformed to <italic>ade6-M210</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>ade6-M216 ura4-D18</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>ura4-D18 leu1-32</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>leu1-32</italic> h<sup>&#x02212;</sup>&#x0002f;h<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> diploid cells. Successful homologous recombinants were selected following PCR analysis of genomic DNA. To test whether the <italic>cdc27</italic> mutants are viable or not, diploid cells were spread on MEA plates to induce meiosis and sporulation. Spores were then plated on YE medium to allow re-growth, and viable colonies analysed to determine their genotypes. All three <italic>cdc27</italic> mutants were viable. These were then plated on 5FOA plates to select for ura<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells, after which PCR analysis was used to confirm the loss of the plasmid sequences.

From each saturated culture, 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> cells per plate were plated onto EMMGL agar containing either 40 &#x003bc;g&#x0002f;ml of filter-sterilized L-canavanine sulphate (Sigma) or thialysine (S-2-aminomethyl-L-cysteine hydrochloride, Sigma). The plates were then incubated at 28&#x000b0;C for 8 days and the number of L-canavanine- or thialysine-resistant clones counted. Plating efficiencies were determined by plating 1000 cells of each strain onto EMMGL plates.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Cdc24 and Dna2 form a complex</title><p>The fission yeast Dna2 and Cdc24 proteins are essential for the completion of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c12">12</xref>). In the course of previous analysis of fission yeast Dna2, an interaction between Cdc24 and Dna2 was observed using a two-hybrid assay, in which the two proteins were expressed to a high level in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> as Gal4 activation domain and Gal4 DNA binding domain fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c13">13</xref>). To determine whether Cdc24 and Dna2 also formed a complex <italic>in vivo</italic> in <italic>S.pombe</italic> when present at their normal cellular levels, fission yeast strains were constructed, in which the endogenous <italic>cdc24</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>dna2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> genes were precisely replaced with the alleles encoding epitope tagged versions of the two proteins (see Materials and Methods), thereby ensuring that the tagged proteins were expressed to a normal level only.</p><p>To test whether Cdc24 and Dna2 were physically associated, co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed. Initially, protein extracts were prepared from <italic>dna2-Myc cdc24-HA</italic> and <italic>dna2-Myc</italic> strains, and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-HA antibodies. The immunoprecipitated material was then resolved on SDS&#x02013;PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f1">1</xref>A shows the results of these experiments: Dna2-Myc could be immunoprecipitated by the anti-HA antibody but only in the presence of Cdc24-HA (compare lanes 3 and 4), that is, only from extracts prepared from the <italic>dna2-Myc cdc24-HA</italic> strain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f1">1</xref>A).</p><p>This result was confirmed with another combination of tags. Native proteins extracts were prepared from <italic>dna2-HA cdc24-Myc</italic> and <italic>cdc24-Myc</italic> strains. After immunoprecipitation using anti-HA antibody and immunoblotting, we found that Cdc24-Myc was specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-HA antibody only in the presence of Dna2-HA, that is, only from extracts prepared from the <italic>dna2-HA cdc24-Myc</italic> strain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f1">1</xref>B, compare lanes 3 and 4). These results indicate that Cdc24 forms a complex with Dna2 in yeast protein extracts, and therefore, most likely <italic>in vivo</italic> also, and suggests that, like Dna2, Cdc24 functions in Okazaki fragment maturation.</p></sec><sec><title>Complementation groups of <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> suppressing mutations</title><p>In order to investigate the function of <italic>cdc24</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> further, and in particular, to question its potential roles during Okazaki fragment synthesis and maturation, extragenic suppressors of the temperature-sensitive <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> allele were isolated as has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c16">16</xref>). Briefly, exponentially growing temperature-sensitive <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> cells were spread onto YE plates and incubated at the restrictive temperature of 36&#x000b0;C for 3 days, in order to allow the growth of spontaneous revertant colonies. In order to facilitate subsequent analyses, cold-sensitive revertants were then selected following replica plating and incubation at 18&#x000b0;C for 3&#x02013;5 days. The suppressing mutants were designated <italic>cst</italic> mutants, for cold-sensitive suppressors of twenty-four. Note that the <italic>cst</italic> mutations confer two properties on cells: cold-sensitivity <italic>and</italic> suppression of the temperature-sensitivity of <italic>cdc24-M38</italic>.</p><p>In total, 37 such mutants were isolated from &#x0223c;3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> plated cells. Subsequent genetic analyses showed that all the <italic>cst</italic> mutant phenotypes were caused by single gene mutations and not by reversion of the <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> allele to wild type. To classify the <italic>cst</italic> mutants into complementation groups, the mutants were crossed to one another and the resulting spores were plated and incubated at 18 and 36&#x000b0;C. Where all the progeny were cold-sensitive, the suppressing mutations were assigned to the same complementation group. Otherwise, the suppressors were assigned to different groups. In all, the 37 mutants were classified into six complementation groups, <italic>cst1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>cst6</italic>, containing between 1 and 17 alleles (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh963tb1">1</xref>).

The mutant cells show cold-sensitivity, in the presence and absence of <italic>cdc24-M38</italic>, as well as the suppression of the temperature-sensitivity of <italic>cdc24-M38</italic>. Microscopic observation of <italic>cst</italic> mutants incubated at 18&#x000b0;C revealed that they could be divided into two groups. Mutants in the first group displayed an elongated morphology at 18&#x000b0;C. This group consisted of mutants of <italic>cst1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, <italic>cst4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, <italic>cst5</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>cst6</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0002f;<italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. In contrast, the second group of mutants, comprising alleles of <italic>cst2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>cst3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, did not show the elongated cell phenotype. The cell elongation phenotype suggested that the <italic>cst1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, <italic>cst4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, <italic>cst5</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>cst6</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0002f;<italic>pfh1</italic> genes could be involved in cell cycle events (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh963tb1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of <italic>cst</italic> genes</title><p>To identify the <italic>cst</italic> genes, two approaches were taken. The first was to examine whether the cold-sensitive phenotype of the <italic>cst</italic> mutants could be rescued by the introduction of known genes. Previously, a variety of genetic interactions between <italic>cdc24</italic> and genes encoding components of the Pol &#x003b4;-RFC-PCNA holoenzyme have been reported. For example, overproduction of PCNA will partially rescue <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c12">12</xref>), as will overproduction of Rfc1, the large subunit of the RFC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c12">12</xref>). Six candidate genes were therefore tested, for their ability to complement the cold-sensitivity of individual <italic>cst</italic> or <italic>cdc24 cst</italic> double mutants, when expressed from multi-copy plasmids. The genes examined were <italic>pol3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0002f;<italic>cdc6</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, <italic>cdc1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>cdc27</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (encoding the catalytic, B and C subunits of Pol &#x003b4;, respectively), <italic>cdc17</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (DNA ligase I), <italic>pcn1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (PCNA) and <italic>rfc1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (encoding the large subunit of RF-C). Among these genes, two were observed to efficiently rescue particular <italic>cst</italic> mutants: <italic>pol3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> rescued <italic>cst4</italic> and <italic>cdc27</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> rescued <italic>cst1</italic> (data not shown). To test whether <italic>pol3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> was isogenic with <italic>cst4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, genetic linkage between these loci was analysed by crossing <italic>pol3</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>cdc6</italic> and <italic>cst4</italic> mutants. The results of these experiments showed that <italic>pol3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>cst4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> are tightly linked, implying that <italic>cst4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is <italic>pol3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. By similar analysis, it was also concluded that <italic>cst1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is isogenic with <italic>cdc27</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. Thus, mutations in genes encoding two different subunits of Pol &#x003b4; were identified as <italic>cst</italic> mutations. This strongly suggests a physiological interaction between Cdc24-Dna2 and Pol &#x003b4;.</p><p>In contrast, none of the six candidate genes suppressed the cold-sensitivity of <italic>cst2</italic>, <italic>cst3</italic> and <italic>cst5</italic> mutants. Therefore, genomic and cDNA libraries were screened for genes that suppressed the cold-sensitivity of these mutants. No suppressors of <italic>cst5</italic> were isolated, and the identity of this gene remains unknown. A single gene, <italic>sup45</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, was identified as a suppressor of <italic>cst2-R11</italic>. This gene (systematic name SPAC1834.01, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_pombe">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_pombe</ext-link> for details) was isolated from both cDNA and HindIII digested genomic DNA libraries and encodes the translation termination factor eRF3. <italic>In vivo</italic>, eRF3 forms a complex with eRF1, which is encoded by <italic>sup35</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c18">18</xref>). Strikingly, <italic>sup35</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (SPCC584.04) was identified as the only suppressor of <italic>cst3-R13</italic>. A single <italic>Hin</italic>dIII DNA fragment was isolated from genomic DNA libraries as a <italic>cst3-R13</italic> suppressor and subsequent deletion analysis revealed that the complementation activity in this plasmid was derived from the <italic>sup35</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene (data not shown). These results suggest that <italic>cst2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>cst3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> correspond to the fission yeast <italic>sup45</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>sup35</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> genes, respectively. To examine this, the <italic>sup45</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>sup35</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> genes in the genomes of <italic>cst2-R11</italic>, <italic>cst3-R13</italic> and wild-type cells were sequenced. A single point mutation in <italic>sup45</italic> was found in <italic>cst2-R11</italic> but not in <italic>cst3-R13</italic> or wild-type strains. The <italic>cst2-R11</italic> allele contains a single C to A (CAA to AAA) point mutation, resulting in a single amino acid change, from proline to lysine, at residue 400 in the predicted Cst2&#x0002f;Sup45-R11 protein. Similarly, a point mutation in <italic>sup35</italic> gene was only found in <italic>cst3-R13</italic> strain. The <italic>cst3-R13</italic> allele contains a single C to A (GAC to GAA) point mutation, resulting in a single amino acid change, from aspartic acid to glutamic acid, at residue 292 in the predicted Cst3&#x0002f;Sup35-R13 protein. Therefore, <italic>cst2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>cst3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> are indeed <italic>sup45</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>sup35</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, respectively. Since the molecular defect in the <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> allele is a nonsense mutation at codon 370, it is probable that this mutant can be suppressed by mutations that suppress premature translational termination at this codon. This interpretation is consistent with our observation that neither <italic>cst2</italic> nor <italic>cst3</italic> mutants displayed an elongated cell phenotype (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh963tb1">1</xref>), suggesting that the mutants do not have a cell cycle phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequencing of <italic>pol3</italic> and <italic>cdc27</italic> mutant alleles</title><p>To gain insights into the type of mutations obtained and the effect of these mutations on the mutant proteins, all the <italic>cdc27</italic> and <italic>pol3</italic> mutant alleles were amplified by PCR and the PCR products were directly sequenced. Among the seventeen <italic>cdc27</italic> alleles, we found six different mutations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f3">3</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh963tb2">2</xref>). Eight of the mutant alleles (<italic>cdc27-R22</italic>, etc.) contained a single nucleotide insertion of a cytosine residue in a stretch of six consecutive cytosines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f3">3</xref>A, indicated by yellow bar). This frame-shift mutation causes truncation of the native Cdc27 protein after amino acid 164, although the mutant protein gains some extra 12 amino acids derived from another reading frame before terminating. All the other <italic>cdc27</italic> mutant alleles contained sequence duplications ranging in size from 16 to 173 bp. Each duplicated sequence is flanked by a short direct repeat, 4&#x02013;7 nt in length, with no apparent sequence specificity. The <italic>cdc27-R3</italic> allele has 16 bp duplication between two GACA sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f3">3</xref>A, green bars), while <italic>cdc27-R39</italic> allele has 22 bp duplication between GACA sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f3">3</xref>A, pink bars). One of the GACA sequence surrounding the duplicated sequence in <italic>cdc27-R39</italic> is identical to that of <italic>cdc27-R3</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f3">3</xref>A). Of the remaining alleles, <italic>cdc27-R40</italic> has 58 bp duplication between AGAAG sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f3">3</xref>A, blue bars), <italic>cdc27-R25</italic> has 121 bp duplication between ACAATCG sequences (red bars) and <italic>cdc27-R5</italic> has a 173 bp duplication between AAAT repeats (orange bars). All these sequence duplications result in truncation of the C-terminal region of the Cdc27 protein due to frame-shift. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh963tb2">2</xref> summarizes these results and the predicted lengths of the mutant proteins.</p><p>The two cold-sensitive <italic>pol3</italic> alleles were also sequenced. The <italic>pol3-R18</italic> allele contains a single C to T point mutation, resulting in a single amino acid change, from histidine to tyrosine, at residue 969 in the Pol3-R18 protein. In <italic>pol3-R37</italic> allele, there is a 27 bp sequence duplication (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f3">3</xref>B, orange bars). This duplication also occurred between short repeat sequences (TGGTGA) and is located only a few bases from the position of the <italic>pol3-R18</italic> mutation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f4">4</xref>). The duplication causes an in-frame nine amino acid insertion (sequence EKASSLLHG) into the Pol3 protein sequence between amino acid 967 and 968. Both mutations are located in a region of the Pol3 protein of unknown function that lies between the catalytic (polymerase) domain and the tandem C-terminal zinc finger modules responsible for the interaction between Pol3 and the B-subunit of the Pol &#x003b4; complex, Cdc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c5">5</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Phenotype of Cdc27 C-terminal deletion mutants</title><p>The Cdc27 protein is essential for complete DNA replication in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c19">19</xref>). Biochemical studies have shown that the 372 amino acid protein has a globular N-terminal domain of &#x0223c;160 amino acids that binds to Cdc1, and a highly extended C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c21">21</xref>). There is a binding site for PCNA at the extreme C-terminus of the protein (amino acids 363&#x02013;372) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c20">20</xref>). Also within the C-terminal region is a short conserved sequence motif that binds to the catalytic subunit of the Pol &#x003b1;-primase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c10">10</xref>).

To confirm this (and to rule out the possibility that sequences encoding the PCNA binding motif might be restored to the 3&#x02032; end of the mutated <italic>cdc27</italic> ORF by some aberrant splicing event), three new mutant alleles were constructed by replacing the endogenous <italic>cdc27</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene with truncated gene sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f4">4</xref>A). Of the encoded proteins, Cdc27-D1 possesses only the N-terminal Cdc1 binding domain (160&#x02013;372), Cdc27-D2 lacks most of the of C-terminal region but retains the PCNA binding motif (160&#x02013;352), while Cdc27-D3 lacks only the PCNA binding motif (353&#x02013;372). By using a two-step homologous recombination method in diploid cells, heterozygous mutant strains were obtained that contained, on one chromosome, the mutant genes under the control of the native <italic>cdc27</italic> promoter. The diploids were then induced to sporulate, the haploid spores were allowed to germinate on rich medium, and the genotypes of the resulting clones analysed by PCR.</p><p>All three haploid <italic>cdc27-D</italic> mutants were viable at 32&#x000b0;C. The mutant strains were then examined for temperature, cold or drug sensitivities (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f4">4</xref>B). All three mutants grew well at 32&#x000b0;C. However, both <italic>cdc27-D1</italic> and <italic>cdc27-D3</italic> showed cold-sensitivity; <italic>cdc27-D3</italic> cells could grow only slowly at 18&#x000b0;C, and <italic>cdc27-D1</italic>, not at all. Cells of both mutants were highly elongated at 18&#x000b0;C, indicating cell cycle delay. In addition to this, <italic>cdc27-D1</italic> and <italic>cdc27-D3</italic> cells were highly sensitive to the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU), the DNA damaging agent methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) and the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (CPT). These results indicated that, while the PCNA binding motif at the C-terminus of Cdc27 is not absolutely required for cell growth, it is required for the efficient growth at low temperature and for cell viability after DNA damage.</p></sec><sec><title>Loss of PCNA binding domain suppresses <italic>cdc24-M38</italic></title><p>Six different <italic>cdc27</italic> alleles were identified as suppressors of <italic>cdc24-M38</italic>, all of which appear to encode truncated proteins (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh963tb2">2</xref>). The longest protein encoded by the mutant alleles, Cdc27-R5, comprises 271 amino acids of Cdc27 sequence, plus an additional 24 amino acids that result from the frame-shift caused by the sequence duplication. Therefore, loss of 101 amino acids from the extended C-terminal part of Cdc27 appears to be sufficient for <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> suppression activity. This region of the protein contains binding sites for Pol1 (amino acids 293&#x02013;332) and for PCNA (amino acids 353&#x02013;372) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c20">20</xref>).</p><p>To test whether loss of the PCNA binding motif alone was sufficient for suppression of <italic>cdc24-M38</italic>, the double mutants <italic>cdc24-M38 cdc27-D1</italic>, <italic>cdc24-M38 cdc27-D2</italic> and <italic>cdc24-M38 cdc27-D3</italic> were constructed by tetrad dissection and examined for temperature-sensitivity at 36.5&#x000b0;C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f5">5</xref>).

The Cdc27-D1 protein lacks the entire C-terminal region of the protein, while Cdc27-D3 protein lacks the C-terminal 20 amino acids, containing PCNA binding domain only. Thus, loss of the PCNA binding domain alone is sufficient to restore growth to <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> cells at the restrictive temperature.

Cells carrying temperature-sensitive mutations in the <italic>cdc24</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene undergo cell cycle arrest when shifted to the restrictive temperature, becoming arrested with incompletely replicated chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c19">19</xref>). In this paper, it is shown that Cdc24 interacts with Dna2 in yeast protein extracts, confirming previous results obtained using the two-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c13">13</xref>). Taken together, these results strongly support a model in which Dna2 and Cdc24 form a functional complex <italic>in vivo</italic>. Dna2 is a helicase&#x02013;nuclease that has been implicated in Okazaki fragment processing through a series of genetic and biochemical studies in budding and fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c32">32</xref>). Dna2 is an essential protein that is conserved throughout eukaryotes. In contrast, homologues of Cdc24 have not been identified in other species, raising the possibility that the protein is unique to <italic>S.pombe</italic>. In budding yeast, the NTD of the Dna2 protein has been shown to have a regulatory function that is mediated via its interaction with the nuclease and helicase domains for the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c33">33</xref>). Whether the N-terminus of the fission yeast Dna2 protein has a similar function or not is not clear. However, it is this region of Dna2 that is responsible for binding to Cdc24, as a C-terminally truncated form of Dna2 comprising the N-terminal 425 amino acids only, Dna2-C425, is able to bind Cdc24 in the two-hybrid system (J. Crossland and S. M., unpublished). Therefore, Cdc24 may have a role in regulating Dna2 activity via the Dna2 N-terminal domain. However, confirmation of this will require detailed biochemical analysis of Cdc24&#x02013;Dna2 interactions. Intriguingly, Dna2 also appears to exist in several forms of differing mobility on SDS&#x02013;PAGE (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f1">1</xref>). Budding yeast Dna2 and probably the fission yeast Dna2 is phosphorylated by both the Rad53 and Cdc7-Dbf4 kinases (Y. -S. S, unpublished data). In the co-precipitation experiments shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f1">1</xref>, Cdc24 appears to bind preferentially to the faster migrating forms of Dna2, perhaps hinting at a role for phosphorylation in regulating the Dna2&#x02013;Cdc24 interaction. Further analysis of this issue is underway.</p><p>Through suppressor mutant screening, genetic interactions have been uncovered between <italic>cdc24</italic> and genes encoding two of the four subunits of Pol &#x003b4;, the catalytic subunit Pol3 and the C-subunit Cdc27 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh963tb1">1</xref>). Previously, it was shown that overproduction of the D-subunit of Pol &#x003b4;, Cdm1, was also able to suppress the <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> and <italic>cdc24-C26</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c3">3</xref>). These results suggest that Cdc24 is intimately involved with Pol &#x003b4; in lagging strand DNA synthesis, consistent with the observation that Cdc24 interacts biochemically with both RFC and PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c12">12</xref>).</p><p>Sequencing of the <italic>cdc27</italic> and <italic>pol3</italic> alleles that suppressed <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> revealed that many of the mutations (10 out of a total of 19) were DNA sequence duplications (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f3">3</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh963tb2">2</xref>). All the <italic>cdc27</italic> alleles, both sequence duplications and insertions, encoded C-terminally truncated proteins lacking the PCNA binding motif. Indeed, loss of the PCNA binding domain was sufficient to suppress the temperature-sensitivity of <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f5">5</xref>). Although loss of the PCNA binding motif could result from either sequence insertions or deletion, it was striking that no deletions were found. Furthermore, all the sequence duplications were flanked by short direct repeats. This pattern of mutation has been observed previously in Fen1 mutants in both budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c34">34</xref>) and fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c22">22</xref>). The nuclease Fen1 also plays an important, albeit non-essential, role in Okazaki fragment processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c35">35</xref>) and Fen1 mutant cells (<italic>rad27</italic> in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>rad2</italic> in <italic>S.pombe</italic>) are thought to accumulate uncleaved flap structures generated during Okazaki fragment processing. Repeat slippages occurring in such a situation are thought to cause duplication mutations. Thus, the propensity for this type of mutation to arise in <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> cells suggests that these cells too have a defect in Okazaki fragment processing. Given the close functional and physical relationship between Cdc24 and Dna2, and the phenotypic similarity between mutants in the two genes, it is to be expected that sequence duplications will also be found with increased frequency in <italic>S.pombe dna2</italic> mutants also, but this has not been tested. In addition, it is unclear whether sequence duplications will be the predominant type of mutation found in <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> cells or whether the selective pressure imposed in the search for suppressors of <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> that are able to grow at 36&#x000b0;C resulted in a bias towards this type of mutation.</p><p>In the course of this study, it was shown that the PCNA binding domain of Cdc27 is not essential for cell viability, contrary to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c36">36</xref>). The reason for this discrepancy is unclear but could relate to the level of expression of the mutant proteins, as in both previous sets of experiments, the mutant proteins were expressed from cloned cDNAs under the control of various forms of the heterologous nmt promoter on multi-copy plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c36">36</xref>).

Both <italic>cdc27-D1</italic> and <italic>cdc27-D3</italic> cells showed cold-sensitivity and sensitivities to the DNA damaging agents HU, MMS and CPT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f4">4</xref>B). The Cdc27-D1 and Cdc27-D3 proteins both lack the PCNA binding motif. PCNA binding by Cdc27 is therefore essential for growth at low temperature and viability after exposure to certain DNA damaging agents. In contrast to <italic>cdc27-D1</italic> and <italic>cdc27-D3</italic>, <italic>cdc27-D2</italic> encodes a protein that lacks most of the C-terminal region (amino acids 160&#x02013;352) but retains the PCNA binding motif. Cells expressing the Cdc27-D2 mutant protein, unlike those expressing either Cdc27-D1 or Cdc27-D3, were neither cold-sensitive nor sensitive to DNA damaging agents (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f4">4</xref>B). Similarly Cdc27-D2 failed to suppress <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> efficiently at 36.5&#x000b0;C, although some suppression was apparent at 35&#x000b0;C, suggesting that simply fusing the PCNA binding motif to the globular N-terminal domain of Cdc27 may not completely restore Cdc27 function to wild-type levels. Whether this is due to the Cdc27&#x02013;PCNA interaction being less than optimal in <italic>cdc27-D2</italic> cells or whether the loss of amino acids 160&#x02013;352 disrupts another important protein&#x02013;protein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh963c10">10</xref>) awaits biochemical investigation. In addition, note that although interaction with PCNA is essential for the processivity of the Pol &#x003b4; enzyme, Pol &#x003b4; interacts with PCNA in at least two ways&#x02014;via Cdc27 and via the Pol3 and&#x0002f;or Cdc1. Thus, disruption of the Cdc27&#x02013;PCNA interaction does not abolish Pol &#x003b4;&#x02013;PCNA interactions altogether, but is likely to have more subtle effects on enzyme function that are manifest in the cold-sensitivity, drug sensitivity and <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> suppression phenotypes displayed by <italic>cdc27-D1</italic> and <italic>cdc27-D3</italic>.</p><p>The left side of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f7">7</xref> shows a model for Okazaki fragment processing in fission yeast. Under normal circumstances, maximal processivity of Pol &#x003b4; is ensured through interactions between Cdc27 and PCNA, and between Pol3 and&#x0002f;or Cdc1 and PCNA. As the polymerase approaches the 5&#x02032; end of the previously synthesized Okazaki fragment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f7">7</xref>A), synthesis continues until a flap structure of at least 35 nt is displaced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f7">7</xref>B and C). At this point, the single-stranded DNA binding factor RPA binds the displaced flap and recruits the Dna2&#x02013;Cdc24 complex. (For clarity, RPA is omitted from the diagram.) Cdc24 may serve to regulate Dna2 or perhaps to link Dna2 to other components of the replication apparatus. Dna2 then cleaves the bulk of the flap, leaving behind a shorter flap that acts as a substrate for the non-essential nuclease Fen1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f7">7</xref>D). Finally, the single-stranded nick is ligated by DNA ligase I, Cdc17 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f7">7</xref>E). Both Cdc24 and Dna2 are essential proteins, implying that the efficient removal of long flap structures is necessary for successful replication. When the processivity of Pol &#x003b4; is reduced by disruption of the Cdc27&#x02013;PCNA interaction (notice the loss of the C-terminal region of Cdc27 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f7">7</xref>F), it is possible that the formation of long flaps is reduced. Under these circumstances, Cdc24&#x02013;Dna2 activity becomes dispensable and the step illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f7">7</xref>C is bypassed: in this way, <italic>cdc27-D</italic>1 and <italic>cdc27-D3</italic> are able to suppress <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> and <italic>dna2-C2</italic> at their restrictive temperatures. The shorter flaps generated under these conditions (e.g. in <italic>cdc27-D1 cdc24-M38</italic> cells) are then presumably processed by Fen1. When Cdc24 function is partially impaired, as in <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> cells grown at their permissive temperature, lengthy uncleaved flap structures may transiently accumulate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f7">7</xref>G). This appears to lead to the formation of slippage structures between short direct repeats (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh963f7">7</xref>H) and the generation of sequence duplications. Confirmation of this model will require further biochemical investigation.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh963f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Cdc24 and Dna2 form a complex <italic>in vivo</italic>.
