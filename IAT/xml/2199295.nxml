Chronic exposure to arsenite can lead to its accumulation in the skin and cause skin hyperpigmentation and hyperkeratosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ehp0116-000001">Centeno et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-ehp0116-000001">Yu et al. 2006</xref>). This could in turn develop into skin cancers, including Bowen disease (carcinoma <italic>in situ</italic>), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-ehp0116-000001">Tseng et al. 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-ehp0116-000001">Yu et al. 2006</xref>).</p><p>Cancer development results from a synergism between genotoxic and nongenotoxic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ehp0116-000001">Hecker 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57-ehp0116-000001">Zoumpourlis et al. 2003</xref>). The former induces irreversible genetic alterations (tumor initiation), whereas the latter promotes tumor development by favoring the clone outgrowth of the genetically altered cells (tumor promotion) through activating cell survival and proliferation signal pathways and altering the machineries controlling cell proliferation and apoptosis. Previous studies have demonstrated that arsenite has a weak mutagen effect; therefore it is thought that its ability to activate signaling pathways leading to the alteration of gene expression responsible for cell growth may play an important role in its carcinogenic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ehp0116-000001">Bernstam and Nriagu 2000</xref>). It has been demonstrated that signal pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), activating factor 1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B), can be activated upon arsenite exposure and presumably contribute to arsenite-induced skin carcinogenic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ehp0116-000001">Cooper et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ehp0116-000001">Huang et al. 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ehp0116-000001">2004</xref>). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) comprises an 85-kDa regulatory subunit (p85) and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110) and could be activated by multiple growth factors and cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ehp0116-000001">Cantley 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-ehp0116-000001">Vivanco and Sawyers 2002</xref>). Upon activation, PI-3K generates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), a lipid second messenger essential for the activation of protein kinase B (Akt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ehp0116-000001">Alessi et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-ehp0116-000001">Toker and Cantley 1997</xref>). Akt in turn regulates various cellular functions such as apoptosis and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ehp0116-000001">Alessi et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ehp0116-000001">Franke et al. 2003</xref>). PI-3K/Akt has been demonstrated to be an important signaling pathway for cell survival and growth, and it also plays a pivotal role in cell transformation and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ehp0116-000001">Huang et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ehp0116-000001">Li et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ehp0116-000001">Nicholson and Anderson 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ehp0116-000001">Ouyang et al. 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-ehp0116-000001">Samuels and Ericson 2006</xref>). The elevated expression or high phosphorylation of Akt could be observed in many tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ehp0116-000001">Asanuma et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ehp0116-000001">Bae et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ehp0116-000001">Misra et al. 2006</xref>). Most recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ehp0116-000001">He et al. (2006)</xref> reported that PI-3K/Akt is related to the malignant transformation associated with acquired apoptotic resistance in human HaCaT keratinocytes induced by chronic UVA irradiation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-ehp0116-000001">Souza et al. (2001)</xref> have reported that PI-3K is required for the induction of endothelial nitric oxide synthesis (eNOS) by arsenite in human keratinocytes. Our previous studies have also shown that arsenite exposure is able to activate the PI-3K/Akt pathway and induce cyclin D1 expression in mouse epidermal Cl41 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ehp0116-000001">Ouyang et al. 2006</xref>). In HaCat cells, the PI-3K/Akt/cyclin D1 cascade activation contributed to arsenite-induced proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ehp0116-000001">Ouyang et al. 2007b</xref>). Although hyperproliferation is correlated with cellular transformation in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ehp0116-000001">Chen et al. 2001</xref>), our previous findings clearly demonstrated that in Cl41 cells, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced transformation was impaired by disrupting PI3K/p85 expression; however, cell proliferation was not affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ehp0116-000001">Huang et al. 1996</xref>), which indicates that the transformation ability is not always paralleled with the accelerated proliferation rate. Therefore, we performed the present studies to investigate whether the PI-3K/Akt signal pathway is indeed implicated in arsenite-induced cell transformation through the induction of cyclin D1.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and reagents</title><p>Spontaneously immortalized human keratinocytes, HaCat cell line, and their stable transfectants were cultured in monolayers at 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> using Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, and 25 &#x003bc;g gentamicin/mL.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ehp0116-000001">Figure 1D</xref>, injection of arsenite long-term exposed Hacat cells into nude mouse caused observable tumor formation (tumor volumes 786 &#x000b1; 126, <italic>n</italic> = 6) compared with that of long-term culture HaCat cells (0 &#x000b1; 0, <italic>n</italic> = 6). H&#x00026;E staining also revealed a tumor formation in the arsenite long-term exposed Hacat cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ehp0116-000001">Figure 1E</xref>). On the basis of these results, we anticipate that repeated exposure of HaCat cells to arsenite could cause malignant transformation.</p></sec><sec><title>The PI-3K/Akt pathway is required for arsenite-induced transformation of HaCat cells</title><p>Our previous studies have shown that PI-3K is essential for Cl41 cells obtaining anchorage-independent growth capacity in TPA (12-<italic>O</italic>-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) and EGF treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ehp0116-000001">Huang et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ehp0116-000001">Ouyang et al. 2005b</xref>). In addition, our published studies have shown that arsenite exposure is able to activate PI-3K in mouse epidermal Cl41 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ehp0116-000001">Ouyang et al. 2006</xref>). To determine the potential involvement of the PI-3K pathway in arsenite-induced HaCat cell transformation, we tested the PI-3K activity in arsenite-exposed HaCat cells. The results showed that the arsenite exposure did increase PI-3K activation in HaCat cells compared with the medium control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ehp0116-000001">Figure 2A, B</xref>). We also further confirmed this finding in NHEKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ehp0116-000001">Figure 2C, D</xref>). The aforementioned data demonstrate that PI-3K is implicated in human keratinocyte response to arsenite exposure.</p><p>Upon activation, PI-3K generates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), a lipid second messenger essential for the translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane where it is phosphorylated and activated by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ehp0116-000001">Alessi et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-ehp0116-000001">Toker and Cantley 1997</xref>). Subsequently, Akt phosphorylates and regulates the function of many downstream cellular proteins involved in the processes of apoptosis, proliferation, and transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ehp0116-000001">Alessi et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ehp0116-000001">Franke et al. 2003</xref>). To test possible Akt activation by arsenite in human keratinocytes, we determined Akt activation in both HaCat and NHEKs by evaluating its phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473. The results indicated that arsenite exposure was able to activate Akt in both cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ehp0116-000001">Figure 3A, B</xref>), which was consistent with PI-3K activation. To elucidate the PI-3K/Akt pathway and its role in human keratinocyte response to arsenite response, we established the stable HaCat &#x00394;p85 and DN-Akt transfectants. Ectopic expression of &#x00394;p85 and DN-Akt dramatically reduced arsenite-induced Akt activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ehp0116-000001">Figure 3A</xref>), and consequently blocked cell transformation upon chronic arsenite exposure in HaCat cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ehp0116-000001">Figure 3C, D</xref>). These results demonstrate the critical role of the PI-3K/Akt pathway in arsenite-induced HaCat transformation.</p></sec><sec><title>Cyclin D1 is a key PI-3K/Akt downstream protein responsible for arsenite-induced transformation of HaCat cells</title><p>It has been thought that the contribution of the PI-3K/Akt pathway to tumorigenesis could be associated with either its regulation of cell apoptosis or cell growth. Our previous studies have shown that arsenite exposure is able to up-regulate cyclin D1 protein expression in HaCat cells, which further mediates cell cycle alternation in HaCat cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ehp0116-000001">Ouyang et al. 2005b</xref>). Thus, it is important to determine whether there is a link between arsenite-induced PI-3K/Akt activation and cyclin D1 protein expression. Arsenite treatment resulted in a marked increase in cyclin D1 protein expression in both HaCat cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ehp0116-000001">Figure 4A</xref>) and NHEKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ehp0116-000001">Figure 4B</xref>), and this cyclin D1 induction was dramatically impaired in &#x00394;p85 or DN-Akt stable transfectants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ehp0116-000001">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating that the PI-3K/Akt pathway is critical for cyclin D1 protein induction by arsenite. It might be noted that overexpression of DN-Akt was able to block Akt activation, whereas &#x00394;p85 only showed a partial inhibition of Akt activation induced upon arsenite treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ehp0116-000001">Figure 3A</xref>). This differential inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by DN-Akt and &#x00394;p85 could be due to the protein expression levels of those two exogenous dominant negative mutants, or alternate pathways may be involved in the Akt activation. It might also be noted that &#x00394;p85 is able to block arsenite-induced cyclin D1 expression completely, whereas it shows only partial inhibition on Akt phosphorylation. The explanation for this may be that Akt is only one of p85 downstream kinases, and the other p85 downstream kinases such as protein kinase C, serum gluco-corticoid-inducible kinase, and Rac/CDC42 may also play some role in cyclin D1 protein expression in arsenite responses. In addition, cyclin D1 induction might need PI-3K activation to a certain level, so when Akt activation was relatively low, it was not able to cause cyclin D1 induction. The basal level of Akt phosphorylation in DN-Akt transfectants was higher than that of the vector control (Mock) transfectants. The explanation was that, due to the importance of Akt in normal cell function, the phosphorylation of the endogenous Akt in DN-Akt stable transfectant was elevated to overcome the biological effects caused by over-expression of exogenous DN-Akt. However, the arsenite-induced phosphorylation will be greatly inhibited, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ehp0116-000001">Figure 3A</xref>.</p><p>To evaluate the contribution of cyclin D1 protein expression to arsenite-induced HaCat cell transformation, we used HaCat cells stably transfected with cyclin D1 siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ehp0116-000001">Ouyang et al. 2005b</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ehp0116-000001">Figure 4D</xref>, introduction of cyclin D1 siRNA dramatically reduced the basal level of the cyclin D1 protein expression, whereas it did not affect the basal level of the cyclin D2 protein expression, verifying the specificity of cyclin D1 siRNA. Knockdown of cyclin D1 expression by its siRNA abrogated the HaCat cell transformation induced by arsenite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ehp0116-000001">Figure 4D, E</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that cyclin D1 is not only induced by arsenite exposure through the PI-3K/Akt-dependent pathway but it is also at least one of the key events responsible for arsenite-induced human keratinocyte transformation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Arsenite is a well-defined human carcinogen, with skin as its primary target organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ehp0116-000001">Centeno et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ehp0116-000001">Huang et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-ehp0116-000001">Tseng et al. 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-ehp0116-000001">Yu et al. 2006</xref>). Because arsenite has only a weak mutagenic effect, it is thought that its ability to activate some signaling pathways and gene expression responsible for cell growth may play an important role in mediating its carcinogenetic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ehp0116-000001">Bernstam and Nriagu 2000</xref>). In the present study, we demonstrated that repeated exposure of human keratinocytes to low doses of arsenite resulted in cell transformation with the characteristic of cell anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. The dose we used to repeatedly treat cells did not cause obvious cell death. On the contrary, it promoted cell proliferation as we reported in our recent publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ehp0116-000001">Ouyang et al. 2007b</xref>). The treatment of cells with arsenite also caused the activation of PI-3K/Akt, which thereby plays a critical role in arsenite-induced cell transformation through induction of cyclin D1 expression.</p><p>As an important signal pathway for cell survival and growth, PI-3K/Akt has been demonstrated to be associated with tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ehp0116-000001">Nicholson and Anderson 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-ehp0116-000001">Samuels and Ericson 2006</xref>). More than 30% of various solid tumor were found recently to contain mutations in PIK3CA, the catalytic subunit of PI-3K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-ehp0116-000001">Samuels and Ericson 2006</xref>). The mutation in p85, a regulatory subunit of PI-3K, has also been reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ehp0116-000001">Jimenez et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-ehp0116-000001">Philp et al. 2001</xref>). Recent studies also indicate that Akt is frequently constitutively activated in many types of human cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ehp0116-000001">Nicholson and Anderson 2002</xref>). Although the mechanisms have not yet been fully characterized, constitutive PI-3K/Akt signaling is believed to promote proliferation and increase cell survival, which is an indispensable event during the process of cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-ehp0116-000001">Samuels and Ericson 2006</xref>). Current studies demonstrated that arsenite exposure was able to activate PI-3K and Akt, and inhibition of either PI-3K or Akt by their dominant mutants impaired arsenite-induced cell transformation in human skin keratinocytes HaCat, suggesting that the PI-3K/Akt pathway may contribute to arsenite human skin carcinogenic effects.</p><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) at low concentration may function as a signaling intermediator of cellular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-ehp0116-000001">Sullivan et al. 1994</xref>). The production of ROS in response to arsenite treatment has been observed in various cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ehp0116-000001">Duyndam et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ehp0116-000001">Ozaki et al. 2000</xref>), suggesting that arsenite may act early in the growth factor signaling pathway. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ehp0116-000001">Jung et al. (2003)</xref> have clearly demonstrated that the predominant product by arsenite appeared to be hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) because the arsenite-induced increase in dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence was completely abolished by pretreatment with catalase but not with heat-inactivated catalase. By eliminating H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with catalase or <italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine, they further found that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> might act as an upstream molecule of PI-3K as well as ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ehp0116-000001">Jung et al. 2003</xref>). So we propose that the generation of ROS by arsenite may be associated with various cellular processes, such as PI-3K/Akt pathway activation.</p><p>Cyclin D1 could be induced by growth factors and stress, then regulate cell cycle and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ehp0116-000001">Cook et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-ehp0116-000001">Perry et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53-ehp0116-000001">Winston and Pledger 1993</xref>).

Antisense to cyclin D1 was reported to inhibit the growth and the tumorigenicity of human colon cancer cells and induce apoptosis in human squamous carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ehp0116-000001">Arber et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-ehp0116-000001">Sauter et al. 1999</xref>). It has been demonstrated that carcinogenic compounds can induce cyclin D1 expression, which in turn promote tumor cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-ehp0116-000001">Rodriguez-Puebla et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-ehp0116-000001">Shen et al. 2006</xref>). Our previous studies showed that arsenite could activate the PI-3K/Akt pathway and induce cyclin D1 expression in mouse epidermal cells. In this study, we provided the first direct evidence that cyclin D1 is a downstream target of the PI-3K/Akt signal cascade and involved in the cell transformation caused by arsenite exposure in human keratinocytes.</p><p>Although knockdown of cyclin D1 expression by its siRNA markedly inhibited cell transformation of human keratinocytes exposed to arsenite, its effect was less than expression of the dominant negative mutants of PI-3K or Akt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ehp0116-000001">Figure 3D, F</xref>). It was likely that some other downstream molecules might also be the PI-3K/Akt downstream targets partially responsible for arsenite-induced cell transformation. For example, in addition to cyclin D1 induction, the PI-3K/Akt pathway has also been reported to mediate the up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#x003b1; and its downstream target gene vascular endothelial growth factor expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ehp0116-000001">Gao et al. 2004</xref>), which has been reported to promote cell transformation, induce the anti-apoptosis genes expression, and subsequently render the cell apoptosis resistance, and promote cell immigration and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ehp0116-000001">Larcher et al. 1998</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our studies demonstrate that the PI-3K/Akt pathway plays a role in the arsenite-induced transformation of human keratinocytes through the induction of cyclin D1. These results provide novel information for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the carcinogenic effect of arsenite on its major target tissue of human skin, which also suggests that the PI-3K/Akt/cyclin D1 pathway might be a target for chemo-prevention of arsenite-induced skin cancer.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>This work was supported in part by grants from the National
