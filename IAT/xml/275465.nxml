We previously identified a 65 kDa protein that could be cross-linked to a functional PLE, but not to an inactive mutant element. This binding was competed by poly(U) and poly(C), but not poly(A) or poly(G). Selectivity for the pyrimidine-rich portion of the PLE was demonstrated by RNase footprinting of the binding activity in total nuclear extract. A 65 kDa protein that selectively cross-linked to the functional PLE was purified by conventional chromatography and identified as the large subunit of U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF). Overexpression of U2AF65 in cells transfected with a PLE-containing reporter construct resulted in the appearance of a population of mRNAs with heterogeneous poly(A) tails. However, this effect was lost following deletion of the C-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). A C&#x02192;G mutation following the AG dinucleotide in the PLE resulted in mRNA with poly(A) ranging from 25&#x02013;50 nt. This reverted to a discrete, &#x0003c;20 nt poly(A) tail in cells expressing U2AF65. Our results suggest that U2AF modulates the function of the PLE, perhaps by facilitating the binding of another protein to the element.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The 3&#x02032; poly(A) tail on most vertebrate mRNAs plays a key role in pre-mRNA processing, export, translation and turnover. Polyadenylation is intimately linked to transcription termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c1">1</xref>) and mutations that inactivate 3&#x02032; processing inhibit release of the processed mRNA from the site of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c2">2</xref>). Pre-mRNA 3&#x02032; processing functions to define the terminal exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c3">3</xref>) and upstream splicing events are impacted by selection of alternative 3&#x02032; processing sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c4">4</xref>). Polyadenylation is required for nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c5">5</xref>) and cytoplasmic shortening of the poly(A) tail precedes the degradation of many unstable mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c7">7</xref>). Finally, poly(A) acts as a length-dependent enhancer of translation initiation, where it functions both to accentuate cap-dependent translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c10">10</xref>) and to help recruit the 60S ribosomal subunit to the pre-initiation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c11">11</xref>).</p><p>For most vertebrate mRNAs poly(A) addition proceeds through two steps. After cleavage of the nascent transcript poly(A) polymerase (PAP) adds 10 or more resides in a slow, distributive manner. At this point the oligoadenylate tail is bound by poly(A)-binding protein II (PAB II or PABPN1) and poly(A) addition shifts to a processive reaction culminating in the addition of 200&#x02013;250 residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c13">13</xref>). Shortening of this poly(A) tail during subsequent steps in mRNA metabolism results in the heterogeneous 50&#x02013;200 nt poly(A) observed on numerous mRNAs.</p><p>Unlike the mRNAs described above, the <italic>Xenopus</italic> serum albumin mRNA has a discrete 17 nt poly(A) tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c15">15</xref>). This short poly(A) tail is present on both intron-containing nuclear pre-mRNA and the fully processed mRNA, suggesting that poly(A) length control occurred during the process of poly(A) addition rather than as a result of shortening of a longer poly(A) tail. Subsequent work identified two related sequence elements upstream of AAUAAA in the terminal exon of the albumin gene that can act independently to restrict the length of the poly(A) tail on reporter mRNAs to &#x0003c;20 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c16">16</xref>). A number of other poly(A)-limiting element (PLE)-containing mRNAs were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c17">17</xref>) and the broad scope of the short poly(A) phenotype was recently confirmed by Choi and Hagedorn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c18">18</xref>), using microarray analysis to identify mRNAs showing differential recovery by binding to oligo(dT) versus a modified eIF4E.</p><p>To function in regulating poly(A) length the PLE must be in the terminal exon. Moving the element into either an upstream intron or exon resulted in mRNAs with long, heterogeneous poly(A) tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c19">19</xref>). Poly(A) length control is independent of the splicing of upstream introns and deleting either of the upstream introns of a &#x003b2;-globin reporter mRNA or replacing intron II with a 21 nt polypyrimidine tract had no effect on the length of the poly(A) tail of PLE-containing mRNAs. Most of our work has focused on PLE B, since that element is conserved in the 3&#x02032; end of numerous mRNAs that have &#x0003c;20 nt poly(A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c17">17</xref>). The sequence of PLE B is 5&#x02032;-AAAGUUC CUUCAGCUGAAAAGAG, of which the eight purines at the 3&#x02032; terminus appear dispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c19">19</xref>). However, changing every other pyrimidine to a purine in the UUCCUU sequence inactivated poly(A) length control, indicating an important role for this pyrimidine-rich tract. UV cross-linking identified a 65 kDa PLE-binding protein (PLEBP) that binds to an RNA bearing the native PLE but not an RNA of the same length bearing the above mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c19">19</xref>).</p><p>We describe here the identification of the 65 kDa PLEBP as the large subunit of U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF). U2AF has previously been shown to define 3&#x02032; splice sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c24">24</xref>) and to link 3&#x02032; processing to terminal intron splicing through its interaction with PAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c26">26</xref>). Overexpressing U2AF65 or a mutant lacking the N-terminal PAP-interacting domain disrupted PLE regulation of poly(A) tail length. However, no effect was observed if the C-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) were deleted. A mutation aimed at improving U2AF binding shifted poly(A) tail length to &#x0223c;50 nt and overexpressing U2AF65 returned poly(A) tail length to &#x0003c;20 nt. These data indicate that U2AF modulates the PLE regulation of poly(A) tail length, perhaps by recruiting another protein(s) to the PLE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>All of the plasmids described here are based on the previously described human &#x003b2;-globin gene expression vectors CMV-glo-SPA, CMV-glo-PLE-SPA and CMV-glo-MutG-SPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c19">19</xref>).

HeLa nuclear extract was prepared as described by Wahle and Keller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c27">27</xref>). PLE-binding activity was assayed throughout the separation by UV cross-linking, SDS&#x02013;PAGE and autoradiography (see below) and the degree of purification was determined by silver stained SDS&#x02013;PAGE gels of individual column fractions. The Core buffer used throughout the purification contained 20 mM HEPES&#x02013;KOH, pH 7.9, 0.5 mM EDTA, 10&#x00025; glycerol, 0.02&#x00025; NP-40, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> concentrations were adjusted to this Core buffer accordingly. Aliquots of 30 ml of HeLa cell total nuclear extract was dialysed overnight against Core buffer containing 40 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. This was loaded onto a 1.5 &#x000d7; 30 cm DEAE fast flow Sepharose ion exchange column followed by washing with 2 bed volumes of loading buffer and a 45 ml gradient of 40&#x02013;350 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Subsequent purification steps were performed using a Pharmacia FPLC. PLE-binding activity eluted at 70&#x02013;110 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> from the DEAE column. The peak fractions were pooled, dialysed against Core buffer containing 20 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and applied to a Mono S ion exchange column (HR 5&#x0002f;5; Pharmacia). The column was washed with 7&#x02013;10 bed volumes of the same buffer and then eluted with a gradient of 20&#x02013;300 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in Core buffer in 20 bed volumes. The peak activity from the Mono S column was pooled, dialyzed to 200 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in Core buffer and applied to a heparin&#x02013;Sepharose column (HiTrap&#x02122;, Pharmacia). The column was washed with 7&#x02013;10 bed volumes of 200 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> buffer and then eluted with a gradient of 20 bed volumes of 200 mM&#x02013;1 M (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in Core buffer. Specific PLE-binding activity was pooled, dialyzed against 450 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in Core buffer and applied to a Phenyl-Superose column (HR 5&#x0002f;5; Pharmacia). The column was washed with 7&#x02013;10 bed volumes of Core buffer containing 450 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and eluted with a 16 bed volume gradient of 450&#x02013;0 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The pooled peak fractions from the Phenyl-Superose column were dialyzed against Core buffer containing 20 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and applied to a Mono Q ion exchange column (HR 5&#x0002f;5; Pharmacia).

MALDI TOF mass spectrometry and direct sequencing of tryptic peptides identified the 65 kDa PLEBP as the 65 kDa subunit of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary splicing factor (U2AF65). U2AF consists of a heterodimer of 65 and 35 kDa subunits, and careful examination of the stained gel in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f5">5</xref>A identified a weak negatively staining band at 35 kDa. The presence of both subunits in the PLE-binding fraction was confirmed first by western blotting using polyclonal antibodies to U2AF65 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f5">5</xref>C) and U2AF35 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f5">5</xref>D) and by western blotting with the RS domain-specific monoclonal antibody 16H3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f5">5</xref>E). The latter binds only to the proteins identified above. In RNA EMSA experiments both anti-U2AF65 and 16H3 effectively supershifted complexes formed between purified U2AF and PLE B RNA (data not shown) and there was no evidence for the presence of the newly identified 26 kDa U2AF subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c28">28</xref>) (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of U2AF65 disrupts PLE regulation of poly(A) tail length</title><p>U2AF65 and 35 are tightly bound together through a reciprocal &#x02018;tongue and groove&#x02019; arrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c29">29</xref>) and neither subunit is found free of the other. This raised the possibility that a dominant negative effect might be produced by overexpressing U2AF65 in the context of the PLE-containing reporter mRNA. The experiment in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f6">6</xref> used either wild-type U2AF65 or U2AF65 deleted in the regions shown by Vagner <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c25">25</xref>) to bind to PAP. Because these constructs lacked an epitope tag and the U2AF65 antibody was directed against the human protein, proper protein expression from the full-length and deletion constructs was demonstrated first in transiently transfected CHO cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f6">6</xref>A). Endogenous U2AF65 showed minimal cross-reactivity (lane 1) and wild-type U2AF65 and the deletion constructs migrated at the expected sizes (lanes 2&#x02013;4). The reporter plasmids bearing the target globin gene with (PLE B) and without a PLE (control) placed downstream of tetracycline operator elements were co-transfected with the indicated U2AF65 constructs into HeLa S3 (Tet-Off&#x02122;) cells in the presence of tetracycline to maintain the target gene in a repressed state. The goal was to express the various U2AF65 proteins prior to inducing expression of the target mRNAs. Tetracycline was removed from the medium after 24 h and poly(A) tail length was determined on RNA recovered 7 h later (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f6">6</xref>B).</p><p>Transfection of cells with plasmids expressing U2AF65 or U2AF65 lacking amino acids 17&#x02013;27 (&#x00394;17&#x02013;27) or 17&#x02013;47 (&#x00394;17&#x02013;47) had no effect on the production of heterogeneous poly(A) tails on the control reporter mRNA. This is seen both in the smear of polyadenylated species observed in each of the transfectants in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f6">6</xref>B and the distribution of radioactivity on the gel shown graphically in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f6">6</xref>C. In contrast, U2AF65, and to a lesser extent the &#x00394;17&#x02013;27 and &#x00394;17&#x02013;47 forms, had a dominant negative effect on polyadenylation of PLE-containing mRNA. Overexpressing these proteins shifted the trailing edge of the peak of polyadenylated species from baseline (seen in cells transfected with vector alone) to a population of more slowly migrating RNAs.</p><p>To determine whether the RNA-binding domain was required to inhibit PLE regulation of poly(A) tail length the experiment in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f6">6</xref> was repeated using a construct that expresses the N-terminal 153 amino acids of U2AF65 with a <italic>myc</italic> epitope tag (U2AF65&#x00394;RRM). The expression of U265&#x00394;RRM is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f7">7</xref>A, and the impact of its expression on poly(A) tail length is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f7">7</xref>B. U2AF65 lacking the RNA-binding domains had no effect on the length of the poly(A) tail on either the control mRNA lacking a PLE or PLE-containing mRNA. Therefore, the effect observed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f6">6</xref> resulted from U2AF65 binding to PLE-containing mRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>U2AF65 restores the function of an inactivated PLE</title><p>Results in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f1">1</xref> showed that protein(s) present in nuclear extract protected the pyrimidine-rich 5&#x02032; half of the PLE from RNase A, but did not protect the purine-rich 3&#x02032; portion from RNase T1 digestion. The sequence of PLE B shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f8">8</xref>A is similar to an intronic U2AF-binding site in that it has a series of pyrimidines followed by an AG dinucleotide. The next base (at position 14 in the PLE) is a C, and others have shown that this arrangement is less favorable for U2AF binding than a G after the AG dinucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c24">24</xref>). The sequence of the C14G mutation aligned with the wild-type PLE B and inactive MutG is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f8">8</xref>A, and its impact on polyadenylation is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f8">8</xref>B. In contrast to MutG, mRNA carrying the C14G mutation had poly(A) ranging from 20 to &#x0223c;50 nt. A graphical representation of the radioactivity distribution in each lane in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f8">8</xref>C confirmed that this single base change disrupted PLE regulation of poly(A) tail length and produced a new pattern of polyadenylated products.</p><p>The approach employed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f6">6</xref> was used to examine the impact of U2AF65 on the polyadenylation of mRNA bearing the C14G PLE. As in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f6">6</xref>A, U2AF65 had a dominant negative effect on PLE regulation of poly(A) tail length, shifting the product from a discrete peak to a broader distribution of polyadenylated mRNAs. Again, this effect was reduced if the PAP-interacting domain was removed (&#x00394;17&#x02013;47). The opposite effect was observed for mRNA bearing the C14G PLE mutation. Here, both U2AF65 and the &#x00394;17&#x02013;47 form of the protein shifted the 25&#x02013;50 nt poly(A) tail to a discrete product characteristic of the PLE. The magnitude of this effect is seen more clearly in the graphical distribution of radioactivity shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f9">9</xref>B. These data indicate that U2AF can restore poly(A) length control to an altered PLE.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The PLE contains a pyrimidine-rich stretch followed by an AG dinucleotide, a sequence motif that is similar to intronic U2AF-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c21">21</xref>). Since U2AF65 interacts with PAP to modulate the interaction between the terminal intron and 3&#x02032; processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c30">30</xref>), identification of U2AF as a PLE-binding protein provided a plausible model for PLE regulation of poly(A) tail length, where persistent binding of U2AF to the PLE in the terminal exon might inhibit the second step in poly(A) addition. However, our data do not support this model and instead show that U2AF modulates the function of the PLE.</p><p>The dominant negative effect following overexpression of U2AF65 monomer suggests that U2AF competes with another protein for binding to the PLE. Support for this comes from two additional observations. First, overexpression of U2AF65 lacking the C-terminal RRMs had no effect on PLE regulation of poly(A) tail length (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f7">7</xref>), indicating that the effect of U2AF65 is dependent on its ability to bind to RNA. Second, reducing U2AF65 to 10&#x00025; of wild-type by RNAi caused a subtle sharpening of the peak of polyadenylated PLE-containing mRNA (data not shown), consistent with the removal of a competitor for binding to the PLE. Interestingly, reducing U2AF65 to this extent had no effect on splicing of the &#x003b2;-globin reporter mRNA.</p><p>Mutating the C at position 14 to a G, a change shown to improve U2AF binding in the context of the 3&#x02032; splice site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg823c22">22</xref>), shifted poly(A) tail length from &#x0003c;20 nt to a distribution of 25&#x02013;50 residues (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg823f9">9</xref>). However, this was overcome upon expression of monomeric U2AF65 or a mutant U2AF65 lacking the PAP-interacting domain. These results suggest that the C14G mutation shifted the binding equilibrium in favor of U2AF versus a poly(A) regulatory protein and the overexpressed U2AF monomer interfered with this in a manner that restored poly(A) length control. U2AF plays a transitory role in pre-mRNA splicing, where it acts to recruit U2 snRNP to the 3&#x02032; splice site. We hypothesize that U2AF may have a similar transient role in PLE regulation of poly(A) tail length, where perhaps it functions to recruit another protein(s) to the PLE. Potential candidates are proteins known to interact with U2AF, such as SR proteins or SF3b.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg823f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> RNase footprinting of protein binding to PLE RNA. 5&#x02032;-&#x0005b;<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;PLE B RNA was incubated on ice with or without HeLa nuclear extract as above, followed by digestion at 37&#x000b0;C with RNase A (lanes 3 and 4) or RNase T1 (lanes 5 and 6) for 15 and 30 s, respectively.
