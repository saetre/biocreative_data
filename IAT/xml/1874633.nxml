Ribosomal RNA of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is represented with 120&#x02009;nt-long 5S rRNA, and two large molecules: 16S rRNA of 1542&#x02009;nt and 23S rRNA of 2904&#x02009;nt. Among 4500 rRNA nucleotide residues, 36 are modified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In the tertiary structure of the ribosome, modified nucleotides are concentrated in a continuous cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), encompassing functional centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The decoding center of the small subunit, the subunit interface and the peptidyltransferase center of large subunit are particularly enriched in the modified bases. In some cases, the role of ribosomal RNA modifications was established. These are modifications protecting some bacteria from antibiotics [see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) for review]. They were found in the limited sets of organisms, such as antibiotic producers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) and unfortunately some clinically important pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), among those spread of resistance was being caused by wide-scale antibiotic usage. Despite almost entire lack of information regarding the function of the remaining rRNA-modified nucleotides, their clustering in the functional centers suggests their importance in translation process. Here, we will discuss N2-methyl guanosine (m<sup>2</sup>G) modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), which were a point of our recent investigation. </p><p>Among the modified nucleotides of bacteria, exemplified by <italic>E. coli</italic>, the most frequently found type is pseudouridines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). There are 11 pseudouridines in the rRNA of <italic>E. coli</italic>, and all genes responsible for uridine to pseudouridine isomerization have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Here, we discuss the second most abundant modified nucleotide type of rRNA modification, namely, m<sup>2</sup>G. There are three m<sup>2</sup>G residues in the 16S rRNA and two in the 23S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), whose positions are marked in blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. In 1999, the <italic>yjjT</italic> open reading frame subsequently being renamed to rsmC, was identified as encoding methyltransferase specific for the methylation of G1207 of the 16S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Several open reading frames were suggested to encode guanine-(N2)-methyltransferases on the basis of sequence analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). However, only recently we were able to verify three genes responsible for m<sup>2</sup>G formation in rRNA experimentally. <italic>YhhF</italic> open reading frame was shown to encode RsmD methyltransferase, involved in the modification of G966 of the 16S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). <italic>YgjO</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and <italic>ycbY</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) open reading frames appeared to encode RlmG and RlmL enzymes modifying G1835 and G2445 of the 23S rRNA. Now, since four out of five ribosomal guanine-(N2)-methyltransferase genes were determined we can compare this distinctive class of enzymes, in an attempt to find their common features and differences.</p></sec><sec><title>STRUCTURES OF THE RIBOSOMAL GUANINE-(N2)-METHYLTRANSFERASES: IMPLICATIONS FOR SUBSTRATE SPECIFICITY</title><p>Of the four identified <italic>E. coli</italic> guanine-(N2)-methyltransferases, only RsmD(YhhF) tertiary structure has so far been determined by X-ray structure analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). It consists of the single Rossman fold methyltransferase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The protein was crystallized without AdoMet, however the cofactor position could easily be reconstructed by superimposition of the known Rossman fold RNA methyltransferases structure with AdoMet bound. Binding pocket of the cofactor is formed by residues conserved among homologs of RsmD(YhhF) protein (Table S1) (marked gray on the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). The core of AdoMet, surrounding the junction between methionine and adenosine should be sandwiched between <sup>127</sup>DPPF<sup>130</sup> and <sup>58</sup>DxFxGxG<sup>64</sup> motifs. Carboxyl and amino groups of methionine moiety of AdoMet are likely to form hydrogen bonds with aspartate and glycine of DxFxGxG, as in DpnM DNA methyltransferase. E<sup>82</sup> is positioned in a way to interact with AdoMet ribose hydroxyl(s). Adenine base must fit between M<sup>83</sup> and F<sup>60</sup>, while its Watson&#x02013;Crick edge is likely to interact with <sup>108</sup>SNAM<sup>111</sup> protein fragment. </p><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RsmC tertiary structure has not been solved yet, however Mj0882 protein of <italic>Methanococcus jannaschii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), whose structure has been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) is likely to represent RsmC ortholog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Reconstruction of <italic>E. coli</italic> RsmC AdoMet-binding site using sequence similarity with Mj0882 reveals overall architecture highly similar to that of RsmD(YhhF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Similarly, AdoMet core is located between <sup>268</sup>NPPF<sup>271</sup> and <sup>202</sup>DxGxGxG<sup>208</sup> conserved motifs. Conserved D<sup>227</sup> is likely to form hydrogen bond with ribose hydroxyls of AdoMet, while adenine base should be stacked between V<sup>203</sup> and V<sup>228</sup>.</p><p>Tertiary structure of RlmG(YgjO) and RlmL(YcbY) is unknown. Sequence comparisons lead to the conclusion that their AdoMet-binding site is constructed very similar to those of RsmC and RsmD(yhhF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C and D). Motifs <sup>305</sup>NPPF<sup>308</sup> and similar <sup>615</sup>DPPTF<sup>619</sup> with threonine single amino acid insertion are present in RlmG(YgjO) and RlmL(YcbY). Methionine part of AdoMet should be fitted between those proline-rich motifs and sequences <sup>234</sup>DxGxGxG<sup>240</sup> (YgjO) and <sup>544</sup>NxFxYxG<sup>550</sup> (YcbY). Aspartates 259(YgjO) and 567 (YcbY) are close to the putative position of AdoMet ribose hydroxyls. Adenine base is likely to be stacked between V<sup>258</sup> and L<sup>235</sup> (YgjO) and M<sup>568</sup> and F<sup>546</sup> (YcbY). Overall architecture of four <italic>E. coli</italic> rRNA guanine-(N2)-methyltransferases active site looks very similar. Despite this fact each of them should specifically recognize a single guanosine residue among &#x0223c;1000 guanosine residues of the ribosome.</p><p>Four <italic>E. coli</italic> rRNA guanine-(N2)-methyltransferases could be divided into two categories based on the domain structure and substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). RsmC(YjjT) and RsmD(YhhF) are relatively small proteins of 343 and 198 amino acid long. Both RsmC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and RsmD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) could recognize assembled small ribosomal subunit as a substrate and perhaps their <italic>in vivo</italic> targets are late assembly intermediates resembling the completed 30S particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). RlmG and RlmL are bigger proteins 378 and 702 amino acid long, recognizing protein-free ribosomal RNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and most probably, unfolded early assembly intermediates <italic>in vivo</italic>. Both RlmG and RlmL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) have N-terminal RNA-binding domain in addition to conserved methyltransferase domain described above. Why some of guanine-(N2)-methyltransferases recognize naked rRNA while others could use assembled subunits? On the tertiary structure of the ribosome, nucleotides that are modified at early assembly stages are either buried in the core of the tertiary structure and became inaccessible after assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>; nucleotide m<sup>2</sup>G2445) or exposed on the surface making it difficult to distinguish from other surface-exposed guanines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>; nucleotide m<sup>2</sup>G1835). To provide the specificity for modification of particular G residue such enzymes should recognize additional RNA determinants. It becomes necessary to have additional RNA-binding domain and operate with partially unfolded rRNA. In contrast, both guanines G966 and G1207 are accessible for the respective enzymes and can be modified at amino group after subunit assembly despite their location in the deep decoding cleft of the small subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>; nucleotides m<sup>2</sup>G966 and m<sup>2</sup>G1207). Decoding cleft, according to the SwissPDBviewer-assisted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) manual fitting of the RsmD(YhhF) structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) to the X-ray structure of <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> small subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) is sufficient to bind small methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Thus, the problem of substrate recognition is solved by adjustment of enzyme outer surface to the shape of the cleft in the substrate that allows in achieving such active site positioning that only target G residue can be recognized. The ability of RsmC and RsmD enzymes to use natural cavity in the substrate to ensure sufficient specificity force them to be relatively small. Indeed these enzymes practically consist of only methyltransferase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). </p></sec><sec><title>FUNCTION OF M<sup>2</sup>G RESIDUES IN THE RIBOSOMAL RNA</title><p>Modification of m<sup>2</sup>G residues is not of vital importance for the cell. However, lack of such modifications of the ribosomal RNA influence the cell growth at different conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>). The exact structural and functional role of the m<sup>2</sup>G residues can be hypothesized on the basis of their location in the ribosomal structure. The m<sup>2</sup>G residues in rRNA are located in the three clusters of modified nucleotides, coinciding with decoding and peptidyltransferase centers and subunit interface. Methylation of the amino group 2 of guanosine moiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) could have two general consequences. First, addition of the hydrophobic group allows the formation of the hydrophobic contact with protein or RNA. This property might be important for m<sup>2</sup>G966, contacting tRNA anticodon. Second, addition of the methyl group eliminates one hydrogen bond donor. Amino group 2 is involved in the Watson&#x02013;Crick interactions and has two hydrogen atoms. Monomethylation should not prevent complementary interaction of m<sup>2</sup>G with the cytosine of the opposite RNA strand, however base pair formation places methyl group unambiguously to the RNA minor groove. There it should prevent any hydrogen bond interactions, such as certain base triples. This might be the structural role of the G2445 methylation.</p><sec><title>m<sup>2</sup>G 966 OF THE 16S rRNA</title><p>Nucleotide m<sup>2</sup>G966 is located in the loop of the helix 31 of the 16S rRNA next to the m5C967 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A,B). Both modified nucleotides form a part of the binding surface for the tRNA anticodon in the P-site as was shown by footprinting in 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and recently confirmed by X-ray structure analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Direct contact with the tip of tRNA anticodon might suggests that nucleotides 966&#x02013;967 modifications to play important role, however several lines of evidence argues that this is not the case. Nucleotide 966 is not conserved among different kingdoms of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), however identity of this base is preserved within the kingdoms. In bacteria and chloroplasts nucleotide 966 is predominantly guanosine, while in archaea and eukarya it is uridine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Mitochondrial small subunit rRNA has adenosine at the position, equivalent to G966 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In agreement with lack of conservation in evolution, mutations of the nucleotide 966 do not have any severe phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Curiously, in archaea and eukarya despite changing identity of the base 966 the modified character of this nucleotide is preserved. In archaea position 966 is occupied by acp<sup>3</sup>U (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), while in eukarya m<sup>1</sup>acp<sup>3</sup>&#x003c8; is located at this place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). </p><p>Deletion of <italic>yhhF</italic> gene in <italic>E. coli</italic> has almost no phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Highly sensitive growth competition assay revealed very moderate growth disadvantage of the strain lacking G966 modification in comparison with the parental wild-type strain. Methylation of G966 and modification of this base in other kingdoms of life could prevent formation of some unproductive conformation of the small subunit rRNA. If the functional role of modification is not <italic>to cause</italic> the formation of some particular interaction, but <italic>to prevent</italic> formation of a particular interaction it explains why the identity of the base 966 is not so important. It seems that in the absence of methylation, rRNA could oscillate between functional and non-functional conformations, while methylation guarantees the preference for the functional one. If fully functional conformation is not dependent, but is only favoured by the G966 modification it explains why methylation is not so important. There is also a possibility that m<sup>2</sup>G966 is involved in binding of tRNA to the P-site. Binding of tRNA anticodon to the P-site of the small subunit is strong enough to make a single interaction with the methyl group dispensable. It is also possible that the function of m<sup>2</sup>G966 and m<sup>5</sup>C967 is redundant. Thus, a double knockout of <italic>rsmD</italic> and <italic>rsmB</italic> genes could have more severe phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>m<sup>2</sup>G 1207 OF THE 16S rRNA</title><p>Nucleotide m<sup>2</sup>G1207 is located in the helix 34 of the 16S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C,D). This functionally important helix is involved in the formation of the binding pocket for A-site-bound tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Methylated G1207 is involved in the base-pair formation with C1051. Neighboring nucleotide C1054 contact anticodon of the tRNA that is bound to the A-site directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). Despite location in the very functionally important region of the 30S subunit, m<sup>2</sup>G1207 is not involved in the contact with tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Methyl group should be located in the minor groove of the helix 34 and it is not interacting with any functional group of the ribosome. We couldnot rule out that it can interact with some ligands that binds the A-site, such as IF1, EF-G, class I termination factors, tmRNA or others. Substitution of the G1207 to A is viable and does not have any phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) despite the fact that C1051-G1207 pair would be substituted by C-A opposition. Transversions of G1207 to both pyrimidines are lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) perhaps due to alternative pairing of <sup>1053</sup>GCA<sup>1055</sup> with <sup>1207</sup>C(U)GU<sup>1205</sup> destroying secondary structure of the helix 34. It could be hypothesized that methylation of G1207 may be necessary to freeze secondary structure in the functional conformation, perhaps avoiding formation of the base pairs <sup>1054</sup>CA<sup>1055</sup> with <sup>1206</sup>GU<sup>1205</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>m<sup>2</sup>G 1835 OF THE 23S rRNA</title><p>Nucleotide 1835 is located in the four-way junction of the helices 67, 68, 69 and 71 of 23S rRNA close to subunit interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E,F). This residue is conserved among all kingdoms of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Although not in direct contact with the small subunit, m<sup>2</sup>G1835 is surrounded by intersubunit bridges B2a&#x02013;c, B3 and B7a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27">25&#x02013;27</xref>). Helix 69 was cross-linked to the 16S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). A substantial fraction of nucleotides located in helices 68 and 69 are protected from either hydroxyl radical cleavage or base-specific chemical modification upon subunit association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Among bridges surrounding m<sup>2</sup>G1835 the most conserved is B2a, contributing also to A- and P-site tRNA binding. Mutations of nucleotides C1914 and A1916 of this bridge lead to increase in translational error rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Other mutations within helix 69 severely affected cell growth and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Methylation of nucleotides A1912 and A1918 by DMS in modification-interference experiments prevented subunit association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><p>23S rRNA area encompassing nucleotides 1835&#x02013;1962 is one of the most heavily modified in the ribosome, it contains seven modified nucleotides. Among them are three pseudouridine residues, whose formation is vital for the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). On the opposite side, in the 30S ribosomal subunit there is also a cluster of modified nucleotides. The loop of the helix 45 contains five methyl groups attached to three modified nucleotides, two of which are dimethylated adenosine residues, 1518 and 1519. Lack of modification in either nucleotide or mutation of A1519, results in the resistance to antibiotic kasugamicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). The third modified residue, m<sup>2</sup>G1516, is of unknown importance and function. The enzyme responsible for the modification has not been identified, although it was suggested to be encoded by the <italic>ybiN</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>Lack of G1835 methylation in <italic>rlmG</italic>(<italic>ygjO</italic>) knockout strain doesnot lead to significant growth retardation at the optimal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). However, in the poor medium and at elevated temperature, the <italic>rlmG</italic>(<italic>ygjO</italic>) knockout strain has significantly decreased fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The normal subunit association is unlikely to be affected by the lack of G1835 methylation. However, many stress-related factors are known to bind subunit interface at non-optimal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). We can hypothesize that m<sup>2</sup>G1835 is involved in the regulation of subunit joining at stress conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>m<sup>2</sup>G 2445 OF THE 23S rRNA</title><p>Methylated residue G2445 is part of the helix 74 of the 23S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>G,H). This helix is directly linked to the peptidyltransferase circle in 23S rRNA secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Several 23S rRNA nucleotides are proximal to m<sup>2</sup>G2445 in the 50S subunit. First of all, C2065 forms a base pair with m<sup>2</sup>G2445. Both residues are absolutely conserved among all kingdoms of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Only in some mitochondria U&#x02013;G and U&#x02013;A variants of this base pair are tolerated. Lack of G2445 methylation as a consequence of deletion of the <italic>rlmL</italic>(<italic>ycbY</italic>) gene causes significant growth retardation, most prominent among all ribosomal guanine-(N2)-methyltransferases yet tested. Growth disadvantage of the <italic>rlmL</italic>(<italic>ycbY</italic>) deletion strain is potentiated in the minimal media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Since G2445 is monomethylated at the exocyclic amino group, it leaves one hydrogen atom to establish a Watson&#x02013;Crick base pair. If the pairing with C2065 is maintained, methyl group should be located in the minor groove of the helix, in which it contacts G830 and dU2449 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Both G830 and dU2449 could potentially form a base triple complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>H) forcing C2065&#x02013;m<sup>2</sup>G2445 pair. Methyl group prevents formation of the triple and cause G830 and dU2449 to move out of the C2065&#x02013;m<sup>2</sup>G2445 plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>H). We can hypothesize that methylation of G2445 is necessary to fix the structure of 23S rRNA region proximal to the peptidyltransferase center in conformation, optimal for the function. It can hardly be imagined that methyl group contacts any ribosomal ligand, since m<sup>2</sup>G2445 is packed in the core of the large subunit. It is also unlikely that methylation of G2445 is necessary for the large ribosomal subunit assembly because no temperature dependence of the cell fitness on the methylation of G2445 was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="Conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Up to now four out five ribosomal guanine-(N2)-methyltransferases have been identified. All enzymes that form m<sup>2</sup>G in rRNA have highly similar architecture of the AdoMet-binding site. According to the ribosomal substrate specificity, they could be divided into two groups. The relatively large enzymes RlmG and RlmL possessing an additional RNA-binding domain act on naked ribosomal RNA or early assembly intermediates in the cell. The smaller RsmC and RsmD methyltransferases utilize assembled small subunit or its late assembly intermediates as a substrate. It is likely that the latter class of proteins uses the decoding cleft of the small subunit as the binding site.</p><p>On the basis of the analysis of the ribosome structure, we can propose that m<sup>2</sup>G-modified residues could be essential for stabilization of correct rRNA fine structure at the functionally important sites by preventing the formation of non-correct interactions. Indeed, m<sup>2</sup>G966 is involved in fine-tuning of tRNA binding to the P-site. Methylated G1207 might either stabilize the secondary structure of the helix 34 of the 16S rRNA or be involved in interaction with some ribosomal ligands. Perhaps, methylation of G1835 located at the subunit interface is needed at the stress conditions for regulation of subunit joining. The likely role of the 23S rRNA G2445 methylation is to freeze an active conformation of the peptidyltransferase center by preventing of the involvement of C2065&#x02013;m<sup>2</sup>G2445 pair in base triple interactions.</p><p>A progress in identification of the ribosomal methyltransferase genes makes it highly probable that all the genes encoding such enzymes will be identified in several years. However, the major work on determination of the function of the ribosomal RNA modifications is only in the beginning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm104_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm104_nar-00140-d-2007-File008.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by grants from Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Russian Foundation for Basic Research and Leading Scientific Schools.
