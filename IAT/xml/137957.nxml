Previously, we identified two closely related DNA-binding proteins, AlF-C1 and AlF-C2, which repressed the AldB gene promoter. We also reported that the binding site of these proteins, site C, is one of the required DNA elements of the AldB gene origin&#x0002f;promoter for autonomously replicating activity in transfected cells. In the present study, we show that AlF-C1 and AlF-C2 bind directly to Orc1, a subunit of the origin recognition complex (ORC). Deletion analyses revealed a functional domain in AlF-C2 for binding to Orc1, which is located separately from the DNA-binding domain. In addition, we found a novel protein-interacting domain in Orc1 required for the binding of AlF-C2, which was conserved in human, mouse and Chinese hamster, but not in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, frog and yeast. Thus, it is assumed that in mammalian cells, sequence- specific DNA-binding proteins are involved in recruiting ORC to regulate replication initiation and&#x0002f;or transcription repression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>It has been generally accepted that origins of DNA replication in higher eukaryotes do not share common specific sequences. Nevertheless, the positions of origins are not distributed randomly on the chromosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c1">1</xref>). This origin spacing might involve recognition of specific sites by the origin recognition complex (ORC), a six-subunit protein, the role of which is to mark and activate origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c2">2</xref>). ORC subunits are highly conserved from yeast to plant to mammalian cells, indicating the conserved functions throughout the species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c3">3</xref>). In budding yeast, ORC directly binds to a specific sequence called autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) consensus sequence (ACS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c4">4</xref>). However, in higher eukaryotes there is no direct evidence, to our knowledge, that ORC binds directly to specific DNA sequences while it is necessarily required for replication initiation. Therefore, what directs ORC to specific sites spaced at appropriate intervals is currently important to understand mechanisms operating in initiation of DNA replication. The aim of the present study is to investigate this point.</p><p>The promoter of the rat aldolase B (AldB) gene acts bifunctionally <italic>in vivo</italic>, but these functions are mutually exclusive; it functions as an origin of DNA replication in the rat hepatoma cells in which the gene is repressed, while in differentiated hepatic cells it functions as a cell type-specific transcription promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c6">6</xref>). Our previous works identified two closely related proteins, AlF-C1 and AlF-C2, which bind to site C in the origin&#x0002f;promoter and are involved in the repression of the AldB gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c7">7</xref>). In addition, we showed that the origin&#x0002f;promoter fragment directs autonomous replication when transfected in Cos1 cells in a plasmid form. Site C is one of the necessarily required DNA elements for such an autonomously replicating activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c8">8</xref>). Therefore, we are interested in the association of AlF-C1 and AlF-C2 with ORC that might lead to the initiation of replication. In this report, we show that AlF-C1 and AlF-C2 bind directly to Orc1, a subunit of ORC, and discuss that in mammalian cells, sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins might be involved in recruiting ORC to regulate replication initiation and&#x0002f;or transcription repression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The plasmids carrying human ORC subunits were constructed as follows.

In these experiments, <italic>in vitro</italic> translated T7-tagged Orc2 was included along with Orc1 protein in the binding reactions, as Orc2 could not bind to AlF-C1 and AlF-C2. Interaction of Orc2 with any of the AlF-C2 deletion mutants was not observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf642f4">4</xref>A, upper panel), indicating that non-specific binding of <italic>in vitro</italic> translated Orc2 protein to AlF-C2 did not occur under our experimental condition. The results further confirm specific interaction between Orc1 and AlF-C proteins.</p><p>Deletion of C-terminal amino acids 207&#x02013;284 &#x0005b;AlF- C2(1-206)&#x0005d; abolished the Orc1 binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf642f4">4</xref>A, lane 1). In contrast, AlF-C2(207-284) containing C-terminal amino acids 207&#x02013;284 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf642f4">4</xref>B) showed binding to Orc1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf642f4">4</xref>A, lane 2). Then, a series of binding assays for N-terminal deletion mutants of AlF-C2(207-284) were performed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf642f4">4</xref>B). AlF-C2(240-284) and AlF-C2(249-284) bound to Orc1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf642f4">4</xref>A, lanes 3 and 4), but AlFC2(264-284) did not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf642f4">4</xref>A, lane 5). The results indicated that amino acid sequence 249&#x02013;263 in AlF-C2 was a prerequisite for the interaction with Orc1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf642f4">4</xref>B). We also constructed a series of C-terminal deletion mutants from AlF-C2(207-284) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf642f4">4</xref>B). AlF-C2(207-272) and AlF-C2(207-263) bound to Orc1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf642f4">4</xref>A, lanes 6 and 7). However, AlFC2(207-238) abolished the Orc1-binding activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf642f4">4</xref>A, lane 8). Taking these results together, amino acids 249&#x02013;263 in AlF-C2 were responsible for the interaction with Orc1.</p></sec><sec><title>AlF-C2 domain responsible for sequence-specific DNA binding</title><p>AlF-C1 and AlF-C2 have been identified as sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c7">7</xref>). To define the region of AlF-C proteins responsible for bind site C DNA, a series of deletion mutants of AlF-C proteins were prepared as GST-fusion proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf642f5">5</xref>A) and these fusion proteins were subjected to EMSA with site C DNA as a probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf642f5">5</xref>B).</p><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf642f5">5</xref>B, both AlF-C1 and AlF-C2 proteins bind to site C DNA (lanes 1 and 4). The GST tag alone yielded no shifted band (data not shown). In competitive binding assays, the addition of 100-fold molar excess amount of non-labeled site C DNA abolished the shifted band (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf642f5">5</xref>B, lanes 2 and 5), while addition of the same amount of site A DNA of the AldB promoter did not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf642f5">5</xref>B, lanes 3 and 6). Therefore, both AlF-C1 and AlF-C2 bound sequence-specifically to site C DNA. It should be noted here that, in our previous paper, we described that the AlF-C2 protein expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> without tag bound to site C only weakly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c7">7</xref>). In this work, we expressed GST-tagged AlF-C1 and AlF-C2 as soluble proteins in <italic>E.coli</italic>. In the former study, AlF-C proteins without tags were expressed in the inclusion body of <italic>E.coli</italic>, solubilized with guanidine&#x02013;HCl and renatured by dialysis. Thus, it is possible that denaturation and renaturation caused lowered binding activity of AlF-C2 to site C.</p><p>A series of deletion mutants of AlF-C2 were prepared as GST-fusion proteins and subjected to EMSA. AlF-C2(1-206), AlF-C2(1-179) and AlF-C2(1-159) bound to site C DNA (lanes 7, 10 and 13). The addition of non-labeled site C DNA efficiently diminished the shifted bands (lanes 8, 11 and 14), while site A DNA did so only partially (lanes 9, 12 and 15). In contrast, AlF-C2(1-146) did not bind to site C (lanes 16). Thus, the amino acids 147&#x02013;159 were indispensable for sequence-specific binding to site C. Protein motif search with Blocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c12">12</xref>) identified HMG14&#x0002f;HMG17 non-histone chromatin protein family motif (Block name: IPB000079) in 129&#x02013;159 and histone H5 signature (Block name: PR00624E) in 141&#x02013;155. Amino acids 129&#x02013;159 of AlF-C2 were rich in basic residues (32&#x00025;). Moreover, 46&#x00025; (6&#x0002f;13) were basic in 147&#x02013;159. Thus, basic amino acids in 147&#x02013;159 might be important for binding to DNA.</p><p>To clarify the role of the N-terminal region, we constructed N-terminal truncation mutants from AlF-C2(1-159) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf642f5">5</xref>A). AlF-C2(59-159) and AlF-C2(67-159) bound to site C (lanes 19 and 22) and their sequence-specific binding was confirmed by competitive assays (lanes 20&#x02013;21 and 23&#x02013;24). In contrast, AlF-C2(76-159) did not bind to site C (lane 25). Therefore, the amino acids 67&#x02013;75 in AlF-C2 were also important for binding to site C. Protein motif search with Blocks identified a 7 kDa DNA-binding protein motif (Block name: IPB003212B) in amino acids 71&#x02013;96. The 7 kDa DNA-binding proteins were small abundant DNA-binding proteins in thermoacidophilic archaeon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c13">13</xref>).</p><p>Taking these results together, a stretch of amino acids 67&#x02013;159 in AlF-C proteins is responsible for the interaction with site C DNA, and amino acids 67&#x02013;75 and 147&#x02013;159 are indispensable. In the region from position 76 to 146, the Pfam protein families&#x02019; database search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c14">14</xref>) identified the RNA recognition motifs (RRM). AlF-C proteins contain two RRM motifs at 76&#x02013;146 and 160&#x02013;230 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf642f5">5</xref>A). However, deletion of the latter RRM did not affect the DNA-binding activity.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this work, we found that Orc1 directly bound to novel growth-regulated DNA-binding proteins, termed AlF-C1 and AlF-C2, which represses the AldB gene. AlF-C1 and AlF-C2 are members of a hnRNP family that have two RNA-binding domains (RRM and also RBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c7">7</xref>). Although hnRNPs were first described as a major group of chromatin-associated RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c15">15</xref>), recent studies revealed that they are involved in various biological functions, including repression of viral DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c16">16</xref>), repression of estrogen- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c17">17</xref>) and vitamin D-induced transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c18">18</xref>) and transcriptional regulation of various genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c24">24</xref>). In addition, hnRNP, which binds telomeric DNA and is involved in mammalian telomere biogenesis, has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c25">25</xref>). The scaffold attachment factor A (SAF-A) and P130, components of the nuclear scaffold, are also members of hnRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c27">27</xref>). Another hnRNP, MSSP, which binds to an origin of replication in the c-<italic>myc</italic> gene, interacts with DNA polymerase &#x003b1; and stimulates its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c28">28</xref>). Usually, hnRNP proteins contain two to three RRM, and amino acids outside of RRM are variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c30">30</xref>). The variable region seems to be important to confer different functions of hnRNP proteins.</p><p>AlF-C1 and AlF-C2 are novel members of hnRNP family, in that they have separate domains to bind DNA sequence-specifically, to bind Orc1, and to repress transcription. These features of hnRNP have not been reported to date. We demonstrated that a stretch of amino acids 67&#x02013;159 in AlF-C2 (and AlF-C1) was required for the interaction with site C DNA. Although this region contains RRM (amino acids 76&#x02013;146), our study clearly indicated that RRM alone was not sufficient for DNA binding, but required flanked variable regions. However, both of the two RRMs in AlF-C2 are not required. This is contrasting to the MSSP protein, which requires two RRMs for all of its functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c31">31</xref>).</p><p>To the binding of Orc1, the amino acid sequence 249&#x02013;263 of AlF-C proteins was shown to be responsible, which was not found in other hnRNPs except for closely related AlF-C proteins found in rat, mouse and human. This sequence is rich in Gly and Arg. Interestingly, a similar sequence was also found in the Epstein&#x02013;Barr (EB) virus EBNA1 protein that binds to the replication origin of the viral DNA and activates DNA replication. Deletion of Gly- and Arg-rich sequence in EBNA1 protein resulted in decreased replication activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c32">32</xref>). In addition, it has recently been shown by immunoprecipitation experiments, that EBNA1 and Orc1 are co-precipitated as a complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c33">33</xref>). Although direct Orc1-EBNA1 interaction was not strictly proven, it might be possible that Gly- and Arg-rich sequences in EBNA1 and AlF-C proteins are important for interaction with Orc1.</p><p>Selection of replication origins in <italic>Saccharomyces cervisiae</italic> is mediated by the direct binding of ORC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c34">34</xref>). In contrast, studies of metazoan ORCs have been less clear as to specific ORC-binding sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c2">2</xref>). Recently, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with antibodies against human Orc1 and Orc2 demonstrated that an Orc1- and Orc2-binding region on the chromatin coincided with an origin of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c35">35</xref>). However, direct binding of any metazoan ORC subunits to origin DNA has yet to be reported.</p><p>The way in which ORC interacts with chromatin differs between yeast and metazoan cells. Yeast ORC is stably associated with the chromatin throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c37">37</xref>), whereas the interaction of metazoan ORC with chromatin changes during the cell cycle. Metazoan Orc1 is selectively released from chromatin during M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c38">38</xref>) and S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c39">39</xref>). Ubiquitination of the released mammalian Orc1 is sequestered from re-association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c41">41</xref>). ORC activity is restored during M to G<sub>1</sub> phase, which is concomitant with the reappearance of Orc1 tightly bound to chromatin, and with formation of pre-RCs at specific genomic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c43">43</xref>). Therefore, mammalian Orc1 is thought to play a key role in such a cell cycle-regulated ORC activity for replication initiation.</p><p>Comparison of Orc1 among 11 different species, including single cell to Metazoa, revealed 52&#x00025; similarity in the C-terminal regions that contain homologies with Cdc6 protein and the AAA&#x0002b; family of ATPases, while exhibited 35&#x00025; overall similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c44">44</xref>). Presumably, the highly conserved C-terminal region of Orc1 is that involved in its functions conserved in all those species. The BAH domain which is identified in eukaryotic DNA methyltransferases and several proteins involved in transcription regulation, locates in the N-terminal region of Orc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c11">11</xref>). In contrast, the middle part of the Orc1 proteins is highly variable among species, and thus it is conceivable that the middle part functions in species-specific mode of origin recognition. Accordingly, we found an Orc1 domain responsible for the interaction with AlF-C2 in the highly variable region. The amino acid sequence of this domain is conserved among human, mouse and Chinese hamster, but not in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>X.laevis</italic> and yeast (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf642f3">3</xref>). This sequence is also conserved in rat (data not shown). Likewise, the amino acid sequence required for binding to Orc1 was perfectly conserved among rat, human and mouse AlF-C homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c7">7</xref>). Therefore, it is considered that the interaction of Orc1 and AlF-C or AlF-C homologs occurs only in mammals.</p><p>It has been reported that human Orc2, Orc3, Orc4 and Orc5 form a core complex and that the interaction of Orc1 with the core complex is labile or cell-cycle dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c46">46</xref>). Although we showed the direct interaction of Orc1 with AlF-C proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf642f1">1</xref>), we do not know at present whether AlF-C proteins can bind to Orc1 and subsequently associate with Orc2&#x02013;5 complex, as such described above. Further experiments <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> are needed to answer the question to this point.</p><p>Concerning the origin selection by ORC, the ARS consensus sequence plays a large part in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c34">34</xref>). In <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, Orc4 is solely responsible for selection of specific ORC-binding sites; it binds to AT-rich sequences in the origin through its nine AT-hook motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c48">48</xref>). In this view, the presence of an AT-rich sequence juxtaposed to the AlF-C-binding site at the rat AldB gene origin is of great interest; the AT-rich sequence has been shown to be required for ARS activity of the origin sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c8">8</xref>). It is also interesting to consider that an unknown AT-hook protein might also be involved in recruiting ORC to the origin region of the rat AldB gene.</p><p>Unlike yeast <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, origins of DNA replication do not share common specific sequences in mammalian cells. If mammalian ORC does not have the ability to select origins based solely on its own affinity for specific consensus DNA sequence, how does it become localized to origins of replication? As mentioned above, a role for sequence-specific DNA-binding factors in the recruitment of ORC to specific genomic loci is currently suggested. It has been reported that the viral transcription factor EBNA1 binds to the EB virus origin of replication and recruits ORC in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c50">50</xref>). If such a mechanism does operate in mammalian genomic DNA, it is likely that a number of different DNA-binding factors would be involved in recruiting ORC to their selected origins. It is interesting to note here that the AlF-C1 and AlF-C2 proteins bound to site C in the AldB origin&#x0002f;promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c7">7</xref>), which was one necessarily required element for autonomous replication in transfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf642c8">8</xref>). The association of AlF-C proteins with Orc1 implied that AlF-C proteins play a role in the recruitment of ORC to the replication origins in mammalian cells, similar to EBNA1 protein.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf642f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Orc1 interacted with AlF-C1 and AlF-C2.
