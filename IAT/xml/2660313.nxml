The C-terminal end of Dg contains a number of putative SH3, SH2 and WW domain binding sites. The most C-terminal PPXY motif has been established as a binding site for Dystrophin (Dys) WW-domain. However, our previous studies indicate that both Dystroglycan PPXY motives, WWbsI and WWbsII can bind Dystrophin protein <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We now find that both WW binding sites are important for maintaining full Dg function in the establishment of oocyte polarity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. If either WW binding site is mutated, the Dg protein can still be active. However, simultaneous mutations in both WW binding sites abolish the Dg activities in both overexpression and loss-of-function oocyte polarity assays <italic>in vivo</italic>. Additionally, sequence comparisons of WW binding sites in 12 species of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as well as in humans, reveal a high level of conservation. This preservation throughout evolution supports the idea that both WW binding sites are functionally required.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the obtained results we propose that the presence of the two WW binding sites in Dystroglycan secures the essential interaction between Dg and Dys and might further provide additional regulation for the cytoskeletal interactions of this complex.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The Dystroglycan-Dystrophin (Dg-Dys) complex has been shown to provide cells with structural integrity by forming a conduit between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeletal network and there are lines of evidence that implicate an additional signaling role for the complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] Dystroglycan binds to extracellular matrix components, including Laminin at its N-terminus and the actin cytoskeleton via Dystrophin at its C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] Defects in these interactions can result in muscular dystrophies (MD) and various epithelial cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]</p><p>The characterization of the Dystrophin Glycoprotein Complex (DGC) in <italic>Drosophila </italic>has revealed that it possesses similar roles in muscle integrity and neuronal migration in flies as it does in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] These abnormalities include age dependent muscle degeneration, reduced mobility, defects in eye development as manifested by altered photoreceptor axon path finding and photoreceptor morphology. Additionally, mutations in Dys and Dg affect cell polarity in <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] Interestingly, some of these phenotypes are affected by the nutrition or energy metabolism in the animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] Recently, a reduced lifespan, as well as heart and muscle abnormalities, have been reported in <italic>Drosophila </italic>mutants of another component of the DGC, <italic>&#x003b4;</italic>-sarcoglycan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and heart and further eye phenotypes have been observed in <italic>Drosophila </italic>Dys and Dg mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]</p><p>Analogous defects observed when the Dg-Dys complex is disturbed in both flies and humans make <italic>Drosophila </italic>an attractive model for further studies on clarifying the cellular function of the DGC. Recent biochemical and <italic>in vivo </italic>structure-function analyses have revealed that a specific set of C-terminal domains are critical for the function of Dystroglycan. We have found that a putative SH3 domain binding motif but, surprisingly, not the most C-terminal Dystrophin WW domain binding motif is required for Dg function in cellular polarity in <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, since two potential WW binding sites exist near the Dg C-terminus it is possible that the second WW binding site can also bind Dystrophin <italic>in vivo</italic>, as has been shown <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In this study we dissect the roles of the two WW binding sites in the <italic>Drosophila </italic>Dystroglycan C-terminus <italic>in vivo </italic>and, interestingly, find that the sites are essential and their functions are partially overlapping.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to understand the regulation of Dg and its role in signaling, we have analyzed the binding motifs that are required for the function of the Dg-Dys complex in cellular polarity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The proline-rich C-terminus of Dg has several potential protein binding motifs, which suggests that it may be involved in regulating the complex and potentially may have signaling role(s). Proline-rich sequences have been shown to be the targets of several protein interaction domains involved in signal transduction. The most C-terminal PPxY motif has been established as a binding site for the WW domain of Dystrophin in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and in <italic>Drosophila </italic>by <italic>in vitro </italic>binding studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, this WW domain binding site at the very C-terminus of Dystroglycan, is not essential for the function of the Dg-Dys complex in cellular polarity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. An internal region of the Dystroglycan C-terminus containing a second WW domain binding site and a putative SH3 domain binding site appear to be sufficient for function in this context. We have also shown that Dystrophin can bind both the C-terminal and the internal WW domain binding sites <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We now test whether the internal WW domain binding site is essential, whether the two WW domain binding sites are redundant or whether neither is required for Dg function in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. To distinguish between these possibilities we used both overexpression and loss-of-function rescue analyses.</p><sec><title>Generation of transgenic lines expressing biochemically verified WWbs mutations</title><p>Previous results show that two mutations designed from computer predictions resulted in dramatic alterations in the affinity between Dg and Dys <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] These two mutations, predicted to abolish the WW but not the SH3 binding domain, resulted in very low binding affinities between the Dystroglycan C-terminal peptide and the Dystrophin WW domain with EF-hand region (DmWWbsI-W: Kd = 178 &#x003bc;M and DmWWbsII-G: Kd = 147 &#x003bc;M), as compared to wild type peptides (DmWWbsI: Kd = 16 &#x003bc;M and DmWWbsII: Kd = 46 &#x003bc;M). These values are comparable to the dissociation constant observed with a negative control for the assay (p53: Kd = 248 &#x003bc;M), suggesting that specific binding is abolished. We therefore generated transgenic lines expressing the following representative mutations: PPSG, which has a mismatch in WWbsII (PPSY &#x02192; PPSG) and 2WW, which has mutations in both WW binding sites (WWbsI, PPPY &#x02192; WAPY and WWbsII, PPSY &#x02192; PPSG) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). At least two independent transgenic <italic>Drosophila </italic>lines for each construct were obtained and analyzed. Similar results with two independent transgenic lines confirmed that the phenotype was due to the Dg mutation and not due to positional effects of the transgene inserts.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Transgenic constructs with mutations of WW binding sites at the Dystroglycan C-terminal end.

In <italic>Drosophila </italic>oogenesis Orb co-localizes with the microtubule organizing center (MTOC), which is localized to the anterior of the oocyte during stage 1, and then moves to the posterior by stage 3. Between stages 3 and 6, Orb is clearly localized to the posterior of the oocyte, making it an excellent marker to analyze the polarity of the oocyte (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).

When FL is overexpressed in the germline, Orb becomes mislocalized, surrounds the entire oocyte nucleus, or accumulates in a clump to one side of the oocyte instead of localizing to the posterior. Therefore, Dystroglycan, when expressed at elevated levels in germline cells, is sufficient to disrupt oocyte polarity. Overexpression of the full length form of Dg with the <italic>tubGal4 </italic>driver causes semi-lethality (data not shown). Similarly, in vertebrates overexpression of Dg has been shown to cause defects in neuromuscular junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We used the overexpression oocyte polarity assays to test whether either of the WW domain binding sites is essential for Dystroglycan function.</p><p>To test the function of WWbsI <italic>in vivo </italic>we overexpressed the PPSG mutant protein in germline cells using the <italic>MatTubGal4 </italic>driver and determined the localization of the early oocyte polarity marker Orb. As discussed, in wild type cells Orb marks the localization of the microtubule organizing center and is localized to the posterior side of the oocyte during stages 3&#x02013;6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Overproduction of the PPSG protein results in the mislocalization of the usually posterior Orb marker. In mutants Orb surrounds the oocyte nucleus or localizes to the sides of the oocyte nucleus in 44 &#x000b1; 2% of 3&#x02013;6 stage oocytes (n = 147, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E&#x02013;F</xref>). The level of this defect is similar to the one observed with the FL construct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], which contains both WW binding sites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B, D</xref>; 49 &#x000b1; 2%, n = 80). These data suggest that disturbing the second WW binding site at the Dg C-terminus does not dramatically affect the functionality of the protein; similar to FL construct, when overexpressed it still is sufficient to disturb the oocyte polarity.</p><p>In contrast to the FL and PPSG constructs, overexpression of a 2WW mutant construct did not result in a high percentage of Orb mislocalization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C, F</xref>, 19 &#x000b1; 3%, n = 123). With 2WW overexpression, Orb, in most cases, was localized to the posterior of the oocyte (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). The frequency of mislocalization with the 2WW construct, in which both WW binding sites were mutated was similar to that of the C1 construct which lacked all the C-terminal binding sites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D, F</xref>, 16 &#x000b1; 2%, n = 86).</p><p>These data, in combination with our previous data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] show that a single mutation in WWbsII or the lack of WWbsI does not result in dramatic defects in Dg activity in this sufficiency assay measuring the oocyte polarity. However, simultaneous mutations in both WW binding sites dramatically reduce the function of Dystroglycan in this assay.</p></sec><sec><title>One WW binding site is required for Dystroglycan function</title><p>We also tested the function of the WW binding site mutants in rescue experiments by expressing the transgenes in a Dg loss-of-function background. <italic>Dg</italic><sup>323 </sup>germline mutant clones are arrested prior to stage 3&#x02013;4 and have mislocalized or missing Orb protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). We have previously shown that these defects are partially rescued by wild type (full-length) Dg expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, 36&#x02013;40% rescue). Full rescue is not expected since the Dg<sup>323 </sup>deletion also affects a newly described neighboring gene mRpl34 (Additional Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>) and recent data implies that the level of nutrients and energy metabolism in the animal may affect cellular polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. To test if our mutant constructs were capable of rescuing the developmental arrest and the defects in oocyte polarity on the same level as the Dg full-length construct, we expressed them using the germline driver <italic>nanosGal4 </italic>and calculated the percentage of loss-of-function clones with rescued growth and polarity. Using this assay we tested whether the Dg WWbs mutations were capable of a similar level of rescue as full-length Dg. If the Dg mutant with both WW binding sites mutated (2WW, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) could rescue the <italic>Dg</italic><sup>323 </sup>phenotype in oocyte polarity at the same level as wild type Dg, we conclude that neither of the WW binding sites in <italic>Drosophila </italic>is required for Dg activity. On the other hand, if Dg with two WWbs mutations cannot rescue, we conclude that both or just the internal WW binding site is essential for Dg activity (we have already shown that the C-terminal WWbs is not essential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]). As discussed above, to distinguish between these possibilities, we have generated a single mutation in WWbsII (PPSG, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and will test whether this mutant still has the full length Dg activity in the loss-of-function rescue assays.</p><p>Similar to the full length Dg (FL, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), the PPSG mutant constructs were capable of partially rescuing the Dg mutant phenotype (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Loss-of-function clones with expression of FL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B-B"</xref>) and PPSG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D-D"</xref>) had similar levels of posterior localization of the polarity marker, Orb (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>, FL: 36 &#x000b1; 0.5% n = 52; PPSG: 41% n = 22). These mutants were also capable of restoring the developmental arrest phenotype by showing a higher percentage of loss-of-function clones that were older than stage 4&#x02013;6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>, FL: 47 &#x000b1; 8% n = 55; PPSG 38% n = 21). In contrast, 2WW was unable to rescue (2WW rescued at the level of the C1 mutant that lacks most of the Dg C-terminus; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.). Dg loss-of-function clones with expression of 2WW and C1 showed lower percentages of normal polarity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>; 2WW: 12 &#x000b1; 0.6% n = 66; C1: 9% n = 22) and growth rescue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>; 2WW: 19 &#x000b1; 2% n = 66; C1: 13%) than FL or PPSG constructs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). This result indicates that at least one WW binding site is required for normal function of Dg but a mutation in only one of the sites does not alter the functionality of Dg protein dramatically.</p><p>Since a single WWbsII mutation or a WWbsI deletion does not cause a severe loss of Dg activity but the double mutant does, we conclude that the two binding sites act, at least partially in a redundant manner in oocyte polarity and growth assays.</p></sec><sec><title>WW binding sites are highly conserved</title><p>Since both WW binding sites proved to be important in our <italic>in vivo </italic>experiments we wanted to know if the importance of these sites has been preserved among the interspecies population.

Mutations in the DGC cause muscular dystrophies; however only mutations in Dystrophin, but not Dystroglycan per se, are associated with known types of muscular dystrophies in vertebrates. In mice, mutations in Dystroglycan are embryonic lethal, which suggests that Dg is an essential gene and, perhaps the redundant Dystrophin binding sites in Dystroglycan provide an additional means for DGC regulation.</p><p>The comparative sequence analysis of <italic>Drosophila </italic>and human WW binding motifs revealed very high conservation. However, each WWbs resides in a specific protein micro-environment, which may suggest that each site has specific binding partners. The previously performed genetic screens for modifiers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] of Dg and Dys showed that the Dg-Dys complex interacts with components of different signaling pathways and components involved in cell/neuronal migration, cytoskeletal rearrangement and muscle development. This suggests that the Dg-Dys complex might be a major hub that regulates transfer of extracellular information to the cytoskeleton. Therefore it will be important in the future to test if WW binding sites have specific and independent biological functions in different tissues. This kind of analysis is likely to provide insights into the specific functions of the Dg-Dys complex and serve as a basis for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of muscular dystrophy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have investigated the role of the WW binding sites at the C-terminus of Dystroglycan protein and found that both sites may bind to the WW+EF hand domain of Dystrophin. Our previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], indicate that WWbsI and WWbsII both can bind Dystrophin protein <italic>in vitro</italic>. To test whether both WW binding sites can function and are required <italic>in vivo </italic>we generated two transgenic mutants: 2WW, which has mutations in both WW binding sites (WWbsI, PPPY &#x02192; WAPY and WWbsII, PPSY &#x02192; PPSG), and PPSG, which has a mismatch in WWbsII (PPSY &#x02192; PPSG). We used the establishment of early oocyte polarity as an assay to verify the functionality of WWbsI and WWbsII. Importantly, the data show that while each WW binding site mutation yields to close to normal Dg function, the double WWbs mutation has lost Dg C-terminal activity. These data suggest that at least one WWbs is required for full Dg function <italic>in vivo </italic>and that the two sites may be partially redundant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Fly Stocks</title><p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>stocks were raised on standard cornmeal/yeast/agar medium at 25&#x000b0;C.
