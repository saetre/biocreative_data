Understanding how microtubule-containing assemblies are built in a spatially and temporally controlled manner is therefore fundamental to understanding cell physiology. <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, a protozoan parasite, contains at least five distinct tubulin-containing structures, the spindle pole, centrioles, cortical microtubules, the conoid, and the intra-conoid microtubules. How these five structurally and functionally distinct sets of tubulin containing structures are constructed and maintained in the same cell is an intriguing problem. Previously, we performed a proteomic analysis of the <italic>T. gondii</italic> apical complex, a cytoskeletal complex located at the apical end of the parasite that is composed of the conoid, three ring-like structures, and the two short intra-conoid microtubules. Here we report the characterization of one of the proteins identified in that analysis, TgICMAP1. We show that TgICMAP1 is a novel microtubule binding protein that can directly bind to microtubules <italic>in vitro</italic> and stabilizes microtubules when ectopically expressed in mammalian cells. Interestingly, in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, TgICMAP1 preferentially binds to the intra-conoid microtubules, providing us the first molecular tool to investigate the intra-conoid microtubule assembly process during daughter construction.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton provides structural support for vital functions such as cell motility, cell division, and material flow in eukaryotic cells. A MT is a polymer with distinct polarity, where each MT subunit, i.e. alpha and beta tubulin heterodimer, is placed in the same orientation in the polymer, resulting in two ends (minus and plus ends) that have different structure and assembly dynamics. Higher order structures formed by MT and MT-binding proteins perform drastically different functions such as flagella beating, chromosome alignment and segregation, and vesicular transport. Understanding how MT-containing assemblies are built in a spatially and temporally controlled manner is fundamental to understanding cell physiology.</p><p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is a fantastic cell biological model organism for studying the biogenesis of tubulin containing structures.

The cytoskeleton of every single parasite in a population contains exactly 22 cortical MTs, one basal complex, and one apical complex made of three ring structures, 14 filaments of a novel tubulin polymer (collectively termed &#x0201c;the conoid&#x0201d;) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007406-Hu2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, and two intra-conoid MTs.

Besides the conoid, intra-conoid MTs, and cortical MTs, MTs are also assembled into two other structures: spindle poles, which organize the intra-nucleus spindle during parasite replication, and centrioles, which contain a central single MT and nine outer single MTs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007406-Morrissette2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. This MT organization of the centrioles is distinct from the centrioles of higher eukaryotes that are composed of two central MTs and nine triplet peripheral MTs.

For example, both the intra-conoid MTs and cortical MTs are canonical MTs with 13 protofilaments; however, their localization and length are very different. The 22 cortical MTs originate from a ring like structure at the distal end of the apical complex, and extend for &#x0223c;5 &#x000b5;m, or &#x0223c;2/3 of the parasite body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007406-Morrissette1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007406-Nichols1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007406-Morrissette2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007406-Hu2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The two intra-conoid MTs, however, do not have an obvious organizing center. They are positioned close to the center of the apical complex, and only about 0.4 &#x000b5;m in length. CryoEM studies show that both sets of MTs are heavily decorated with MT binding proteins with quite different association patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007406-Morrissette1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007406-Hu2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The identification and characterization of MT binding proteins, therefore, is key to understanding the construction and functions of these various MT-containing assemblies.

TgICMAP1 is likely to have a high affinity for MTs, as heavy eGFP-TgICMAP1 coating correlated with much weaker anti-tubulin staining when compared with that of uncoated MT segments, suggesting that perhaps TgICMAP1 binding blocks the accessibility of tubulin antibody to the MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007406-g002">Figure 2, insets</xref>).

The stability of these tubulin containing structures provides stiffness to the parasite cortex, thus they are important in maintaining the parasite shape and are likely to be important for basic parasite functions such as directional movement and invasion. MT binding proteins are central players in regulating MT stability and function. In this work, we report the identification of a new MT-binding protein in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, TgICMAP1, which is localized predominantly to the intra-conoid MTs &#x02212; two highly stable MTs in the apical complex. When TgICMAP1 was ectopically expressed in mammalian cells, it significantly increased the resistance of MTs to nocodazole treatment, suggesting that TgICMAP1 might play a role in stabilizing the two intra-conoid MTs. We also found colocalization of TgICMAP1 with perinuclear MTs when TgICMAP1 was expressed at a high level in mammalian cells. It has been shown that perinculear MTs are more stable than other MTs, but it is unclear if their perinuclear localization is the cause or the consequence of their stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007406-Park1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007406-Masson1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. The colocalization of TgICMAP1 with this subset of MTs therefore could be due to the preference of TgICMAP1 in binding to these MTs (recognizing, for example, certain distinct biochemical or structural properties of these MTs) or an indirect result of the stabilization effect of TgICMAP1 on MTs. Right now we cannot distinguish between these two possibilities.</p><p>TgICMAP1 binds directly to the lattice of bare MTs polymerized <italic>in vitro</italic>, yet in <italic>T. gondii</italic> it preferentially binds to the intra-conoid MTs but not other tubulin containing structures, such as the conoid and the cortical MTs. How is this specific binding regulated? We showed previously that the conoid fibers are formed of protofilaments arranged in a &#x0201c;comma&#x0201d; like structure much different from that of a canonical MT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007406-Hu2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> (c.f. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007406-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This drastic structural difference between the conoid fibers and the intra-conoid MTs could well be the reason that TgICMAP1 is not found in the conoid. This cannot explain however, why TgICMAP1 does not bind to the cortical MTs, which are tubes with 13 protofilaments, just like the intra-conoid MTs. We speculate that the &#x0201c;masking&#x0201d; of the cortical MTs by other MT binding proteins might play a role in excluding TgICMAP1 from the cortical MTs. A second possibility is that differences in the post-translational modifications of tubulin in the intra-conoid MTs and the cortical MTs may affect the affinity of TgICMAP1 binding. In mammalian cells, for example, a number of MT-binding proteins and molecular motors preferentially bind detyrosinated MTs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007406-Hammond1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007406-Reed1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

Indeed, the length and position of the intra-conoid MTs are very consistent with their potential structural roles in secretion and the subsequent recycling of the lipid and proteins on the membrane of the emptied vesicles. However, due to the lack of knowledge of their protein composition other than tubulin, little is known about how the intra-conoid MTs function and how they are constructed during daughter formation. Using TgICMAP1 as a marker for the intra-conoid MTs, we showed that the intra-conoid MTs are formed during daughter parasite construction within the mother parasite. In addition, we noted that the anti-TgICMAP1 antibody recognized a doublet by Western blot, which may suggest that TgICMAP1 is post-translationally modified.
