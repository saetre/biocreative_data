Reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased in colorectal cancer due to increased aerobic metabolism and exposure to various anti-cancer modalities such as ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Many factors are involved in this process. ROS are capable of activating certain transcription factors directly and thereby modulating the regulation of gene transcription. Several transcriptional factors such as AP1, Sp1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], Smad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and snail are potentially associated with ROS-triggered cellular process. Apoptosis and cancer are opposed phenomena but ROS have been widely reported to play a key role in both[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], suggesting that the regulation of gene expression by oxidants, antioxidants and the redox state remains as a promising therapeutic approach. Hyperphysiological levels of ROS cause DNA damage, mutation and activation of several proto-oncogenes in normal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. On the other hand, the DNA damage and initiation of signal transduction pathways caused by ROS contribute to the cytotoxicity to cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The mechanism involved is still controversial and its ability to induce apoptosis in colorectal cancer is not yet fully understood.</p><p>It is generally recognized that oxidative stress is associated with p53-dependent cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], but a clear understanding of the downstream regulation mechanisms is still elusive. It has been proposed that Bcl-2 regulates antioxidant pathways at sites of free radical generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Another gene, called p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), was identified through global profiling as a p53-inducible gene. Yeast two-hybrid screening identified PUMA as a Bcl-2 interacting protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. PUMA is a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family and plays an important role in stress-induced apoptosis. Yu et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] suggested that PUMA could be directly activated by p53 through p53-responsive elements in its promoter region. The protein encoded by PUMA was exclusively localized to mitochondria where it interacted with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl through its BH3 domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We have previously shown that oxaliplatin-induced ERK inactivation was involved in the regulation of oxaliplatin-induced PUMA expression and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We hypothesized that ROS had a direct effect on PUMA.</p><p>In the present study, we found that PUMA plays a role in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. The effects of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>on the expression of PUMA and the mechanism by which this is regulated were examined. Our results suggest that Sp1 plays a role in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced PUMA expression and apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. Comprehensive understanding of the ROS-triggered signal transduction, transcriptional activation and regulation of gene expression will help to identify the critical role of ROS in tumor progression and in defining a strategy for chemo-therapeutic intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>All reagents for cell culture were purchased from Invitrogen/Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Mithramycin A (Mithr.A) is a drug which has been clinically used in the therapies of several type of cancer and Paget's disease. It binds to GC-rich regions in chromatin and interferes with the transcription of genes that bear GC-rich motifs in their promoters including Sp1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Previous study suggested that Mithr.A also activates endogenous p53 protein and has no effect on the expression of endogenous Sp1 genes. To identify the effects of Mithr.A on p53 and Sp1 expression, Mithr.A (200 ng/ml) was added to LoVo cells 24 hours before p53 and Sp1 expression was assessed by Western blotting analysis. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, Mithr.A had no effects on p53 expression, but suppressed the expression of Sp1.

To confirm the role of Sp1 in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced PUMA expression furthermore, we suppressed Sp1 expression by transfecting Sp1 siRNA and our data suggested that Sp1 siRNA abrogated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced PUMA expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>).</p><p>To understand the mechanism of Mithr.A and PFT-&#x003b1; action, we tested the ability of Mithr.A and PFT-&#x003b1; to inhibit PUMA promoter activation induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

On the other hand, the production of ROS during the catabolism of tumor and chemotherapy leads to apoptosis and benefits in the process of the clearance of tumor cells. In the present study, we found that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>up-regulated PUMA expression and induced apoptosis in colorectal cancer LoVo cells. Suppression of PUMA expression abrogated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced apoptosis. To further elucidate the mechanism responsible for the changes in amounts of PUMA, we determined levels of PUMA mRNA by RT-PCR. Our data suggested that PUMA expression at the mRNA level increased and transcription activity of PUMA was upregulated by administration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>especially at doses between 0.04 and 0.64 mM in colorectal cancer LoVo cells.</p><p>PUMA is essential in the process of apoptosis induction by exogenous or endogenous p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, many studies described that there were other factors involved in the regulation of PUMA expression, either in a p53-dependent or independent manner including our previous report. For example, Tzippi et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] reported E2F1 upregulated the expression of PUMA through a direct transcriptional mechanism and increased PUMA levels mediated E2F1-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, Koutsodontis et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] found that the PUMA promoter contains a cluster of GC-rich motifs flanked by two p53-recognition motifs and a series of Sp1 recognition sites at the 5'-end. This was identified by searching the 5'-flanking sequence of PUMA with Tfsearch software <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://molsun1.cbrc.aist.go.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html"/>. The same report also suggests that the Sp family was essential for the cellular response to p53 activation by genotoxic stress such as ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This urged us to hypothesize that Sp1 plays a role in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced PUMA expression and apoptosis.</p><p>To investigate the role of Sp1 on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced PUMA expression, Mithr.A (a DNA-binding antitumor agent) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and PFT-&#x003b1; (a selective p53 inhibitor), were used for pharmacological intervention both in LoVo cells (p53 mutation) and HCT116 cells (p53 wide type). Sp1 siRNA was also used to confirm the result. Our data suggest that Sp1 plays a role in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced PUMA expression and regulated it at the transcriptional level. This regulation is not cell specific in LoVo cells and HCT116 cells. To determine whether H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>could induce PUMA expression in p53 mutant cell lines, we detect the expression of PUMA in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated SW480 cells(p53 mutated colorectal cancer cells) and LoVo p53- cells (established in our previous study). Our data showed that no much difference was found in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>-treated cells and untreated cells (data not show) and this induction was p53-dependent.</p><p>Sp1 and p53 could regulate PUMA expression synergistically in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated LoVo colorectal cancer cells. More interesting, Mithr.A was used as an antitumor agent and has been used in the clinic for several types of cancer. Lee et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] reported that it sensitized cancer cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by down-regulation of XIAP gene promoter through Sp1 sites. Our data suggest that Mithr.A decreases apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells through inhibiting PUMA promoter activity, which may limit the application of Mithr.A in colorectal cancer therapy.</p><p>To assess whether inhibiting Sp1 binding to the PUMA promoter by Mithr.A contributed to a decrease of apoptosis induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, Hoechst dye 33258 staining was carried out. Our data showed that combination of Mithr.A and PFT-&#x003b1; abrogated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced apoptosis significantly better, as compared with PFT-&#x003b1; alone. PUMA induction results in Bax multimerizaion, mitochondia-dependent death, the release of cytochrome C and caspase 9 induction leading to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Our data showed an increase in expression of procaspase 3, procaspase 9 and suggested an decrease of caspase 3 and 9. Therefore, Sp1 activity may be functionally linked to the effects of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>on PUMA.</p><p>In summary, a novel mechanism of PUMA stimulation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in colorectal cancer LoVo cells has been demonstrated. The results suggest that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced up-regulation of PUMA is partly due to Sp1 transcription factor except for p53. These results may provide an insight into the molecular control of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced PUMA expression in colorectal cancer cells through Sp1 binding sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>WXY carried out Western blotting analysis, Hoechst 33258 staining for apoptosis, Statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.
