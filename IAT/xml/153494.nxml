Despite extensive work, there is a need to understand the cellular sites of expression of these important regulatory molecules, and how their gene expression changes within the basic ovary cell types through the cycle. Here we have performed a detailed <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization analysis of the spatial and temporal expression patterns of the BMP ligands (BMP-2, -3, -3b, -4, -6, -7, -15), receptors (BMPR-IA, -IB, -II), and BMP antagonist, follistatin, in rat ovaries over the normal estrous cycle. We have found that: i) all of the mRNAs are expressed in a cell-specific manner in the major classes of ovary cell types (oocyte, granulosa, theca interstitial, theca externa, corpora lutea, secondary interstitial, vascular and ovary surface epithelium); and ii) most undergo dynamic changes during follicular and corpora luteal morphogenesis and histogenesis. The general principle to emerge from these studies is that the developmental programs of folliculogenesis (recruitment, selection, atresia), ovulation, and luteogenesis (luteinization, luteolysis) are accompanied by rather dramatic spatial and temporal changes in the expression patterns of these BMP genes. These results lead us to hypothesize previously unanticipated roles for the BMP family in determining fundamental developmental events that ensure the proper timing and developmental events required for the generation of the estrous cycle.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The adult mammalian ovary is a complex tissue composed of four fundamental cell types: the oocytes, granulosa, interstitial, and corpora luteal cells. Within this basic quartet are many other cell types such as the ovary surface epithelium and blood vessels in addition to the classic subtypes of granulosa (membrana, periantral, cumulus, and corona radiata), theca (interna and externa), and luteal cells (granulosa and theca lutein). The coordinated control of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in these cell types is the underlying basis for primate and non-primate menstrual and estrous cycles, respectively. The process by which each cell type obtains its state of differentiation is the subject of intense study. The role of hormones in this process is clear; however, new results indicate that autocrine/paracrine or growth factor mechanisms also have important roles.</p><p>The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family including ligands, receptors, and binding proteins, has emerged as a central player in ovary physiology and female fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The BMPs represent a large subclass of the transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) surperfamily of ligands whose biological responses are mediated by Ser/Thr kinase receptors via the Smad-signaling molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The mRNAs encoding several BMP family members have been identified in the murine ovary, including the ligands, BMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], BMP-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], BMP-3b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], BMP-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], BMP-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], BMP-7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], BMP-15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], the BMP receptors, BMPR-IA, BMPR-IB and BMPR-II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and the BMP binding protein, follistatin (FS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In the murine, BMP-4 and -7 mRNA have been identified in the theca interstitial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], BMP-6 and -15 in oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], BMPR-IA, BMPR-IB and BMPR-II in oocytes and granulosa cells (GCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and FS in granulosa and lutein cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The direct involvement of the BMP system in regulating ovary function has been established. <italic>In vitro </italic>experiments with rat GCs have demonstrated that BMP-4 and -7 inhibit and stimulate FSH-induced progesterone and estradiol production, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In related studies BMP-6 and BMP-15 were found to block FSH action through inhibiting FSH-dependent adenylate cyclase activity and FSH receptor expression, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The importance of these findings is underscored by the fact that FSH action is obligatory for normal folliculogenesis and female fertility. In addition, BMP-7 and -15, but not BMP-6 have stimulatory effects on GC DNA synthesis, indicating they may play a mitogenic role in follicle growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The importance of this finding is underscored by the fact that the control of GC proliferation is crucial for follicle dominance and atresia. Equally important, other studies have shown that loss-of-function and naturally occurring mutations in BMP ligands and receptors are associated with dysregulation of folliculogenesis and ovulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Of particular interest is the finding that ewes having a mutation in the <italic>bmp15 </italic>gene in both alleles are infertile whereas the heterozygotes are superfertile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, the <italic>bmp15 </italic>gene can control ovulation quota through a dosage-sensitive mechanism. Evidence that a mutation at the Ser/Thr kinase domain of BMPR-IB leads to high fecundity in ewes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] provides further support that BMP signaling pathways play a key role in specifying ovary function.</p><p>Although it is becoming clear that intrinsic BMPs are important players in the ovary, the cellular localization of BMPs in the ovary is poorly understood, and a proper understanding of how the cell-specific expression of the BMP system changes during the cycle is still lacking. As part of our ongoing investigations of the roles of BMPs in ovary physiology, we have analyzed the spatiotemporal expression patterns of the BMP system in the rat ovary cell types during the normal estrous cycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (2&#x02013;3 months of age) were housed (four animals per cage) in isolation under controlled lighting conditions (14 h of light, 10 hr of darkness; lights on from 0500 to 1900 h) at 23&#x000b0;C and provided formulated rat chow and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Vaginal smears were taken daily, and rats exhibiting two or more consecutive 4-day estrous cycles were used. The animals (two at each time of the cycle) were sacrificed on proestrus (P1000 and 2000 h), estrus (E0200 and E1000 h), diestrus I (DI, 1100 h) and diestrus II (DII, 1100 h). The rats were handled in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the protocols were approved by the University of California, San Diego Animal Subjects Committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmid construction for synthesizing riboprobes</title><p>Probes for <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization studies were made by RT-PCR. Total RNA from adult rat ovaries was prepared and single-stranded cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcriptase and then subjected to PCR as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. To design primers for PCR, DNA sequence information was first collected from GenBank and primers for PCR were designed based on standard guidelines. All sequence information was derived from rat cDNA clones except for BMP-2, -7, BMPR-IB and BMPR-II whose cDNA sequences in rat have not been deposited into the GenBank. However, because cDNA sequences in human and mouse are available from the GenBank, we designed the PCR primers by choosing the homologous DNA sequence regions between human and mouse homologues. Specifically, these primers are derived from the cDNA clones at the following nucleotide numbers: #511 &#x02013; #528 and #1066 &#x02013; #1083 (accession number of the cDNA clone is M22489) for BMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]; #923 &#x02013; #942 and #1341 &#x02013; #1360 (accession number D63860) for BMP-3 (Kangawa, unpublished); #878 &#x02013; #897 and #1292 &#x02013; #1311 (accession number D49494) for BMP-3b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]; #737 &#x02013; #757 and #1181 &#x02013; #1200 (accession number Z22607) for BMP-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]; #6 &#x02013; #25 and #475 &#x02013; #494 (accession number U66298) for BMP-6 (Knittel et al., unpublished); #497 &#x02013; 514 and #865 &#x02013; #882 (accession number X56906) for BMP-7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]; #441 &#x02013; #460 and #876 &#x02013; #895 (accession number D38082) for BMPR-IA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]; #528 &#x02013; #547 and #965 &#x02013; #984 (accession number U89326) for BMPR-IB (Astrom et al., unpublished); #525 &#x02013; #544 and #895 &#x02013; #904 (accession number AF003942) for BMPR-II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These primers were selected from different exons of the corresponding genes to discriminate PCR products that might arise from possible chromosome DNA contaminants. All PCR products were cloned into pBluescript SK+ and their DNA sequences confirmed. The plasmid containing FS was constructed by sub-cloning of the XbaI-PstI fragment derived for rat FS cDNA clone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], pROF304 into pBluescript SK+.</p></sec><sec><title>In situ hybridization</title><p>Ovaries were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4&#x000b0;C, washed in PBS, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Eight consecutive sections (8 &#x003bc;m) were cut from each ovary and mounted onto poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides. The sections were digested with proteinase K, acetylated, washed and dehydrated as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Anti-sense and sense cRNA probes were prepared by means of <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription using T3 or T7 RNA polymerase. Hybridization was carried out with the <sup>35</sup>S-labeled RNA probe (4&#x02013;6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cpm/ml) in a solution containing 50% (vol/vol) deionized formamide, 0.3 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris (pH 8.2), 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% yeast tRNA, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1 &#x000d7; Denhardt's solution and 10% dextran sulfate. Hybridization solution (20 &#x003bc;l) was placed over each section and covered with a 60 &#x000d7; 22 mm acid washed, siliconized coverslip. Coverslips were sealed with liquid DPX. Sections were hybridized for 16 h at 58&#x02013;60 C in a humidified chamber. After hybridization, the sections were treated with ribonuclease A and washed in 15 mM NaCl/1.5 mM sodium citrate at 60&#x02013;62 C for 30 min. Dehydrated slides were exposed to X-ray film for several days. After adequate X-ray film images were obtained, the ovary sections were treated with xylene, rinsed in 100% ethanol, air dried, and then coated with Kodak NTB-2 liquid autoradiograph emulsion. Slides were exposed for four weeks at 4 C in a linedesiccated dark box. After exposure, the slides were developed (Kodak D19, 3.5 min, 14 C), rinsed briefly in distilled water and fixed. After washing in distilled water for 1 h, slides were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin.</p><p>After an autoradiography and counterstaining, the sections were analyzed microscopically. The <italic>in situ </italic>experiments were performed two times for each BMP ligand and receptor. The intensity of the hybridization signals were determined as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A subjective comparison of eight sections from each ovary from six animals hybridized with the same concentrations of sense and antisense cRNAs and exposed for the same time (4 weeks) was made. The hybridization signal was estimated on a scale of 1+ to 4+ as originally described by Meunier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]: +, silver grains sparse, but positive hybridization; ++, silver grains are numerous but do not cover the cell type in question; +++, silver grains are very numerous and begin to merge in some places; ++++, silver grains are very dense and form a near uniform mass above the cell type in question; +/-, there was heterogeneity in the hybridization signal, e.g., some of the histological units contained a signal, others did not; &#x02013;, no detectable hybridization signal. The slides were analyzed simultaneously by two investigators and the results confirmed independently by another researcher. In each experiment, tissues hybridized with the sense probe were used as the negative control. In all cases, the sense probes showed no specific hybridization to the adult ovaries above background (see for example Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><italic>In situ </italic>hybridization of BMP-2 mRNA in the ovaries of adult cycling rats.

A weak hybridization signal was first detected in some GC of early primary follicles, consistent with BMP-2 gene activation during recruitment. As folliculogenesis progressed, BMP-2 mRNA expression increased rapidly reaching maximal levels in the GC of secondary follicles. The expression of GC BMP-2 mRNA was heterogeneous. In preantral follicles, BMP-2 mRNA expression was confined mainly to the membrana GC with little or no expression in the corona radiata GC next to the oocyte (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D,1E</xref>). This indicates that the GC become functionally diverse very early in follicle development, i.e. about the time the follicle has two layers of GC. As the follicle undergoes its development to the preovulatory stage (i.e. from selection at E 0200 h through ovulation at E 0200 h the next cycle), the membrana, but not the cumulus and periantral GC, express high levels of BMP-2 mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F,1G</xref>). These findings indicate that the oocyte may regulate GC BMP-2 gene expression by a morphogen gradient mechanism. Finally the highest levels of BMP-2 mRNA in the ovary were seen in the GC of atretic follicles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H,1I</xref>).</p><p>BMP-2 mRNA expression in the dominant follicle was rapidly down-regulated following ovulation. As such, there was no detectable BMP-2 mRNA in the new CL-I during luteinization i.e. E 2000 h to DI 1100 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J,1K</xref>). The message was re-expressed at DII 1100 h (luteolysis) with strong hybridization for BMP-2 appearing in clusters of endothelial cells scattered throughout the CL-I (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A,1B,1L,1M</xref>). This correlation suggests a possible function for endothelial-derived BMP-2 in luteolysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1N</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of BMP-3 and -3b mRNA</title><p>The hybridization signal for BMP-3 was relatively weak in the ovaries examined (data not shown). BMP-3 mRNA expression was present in the TIC of healthy Graafian follicles and in the theca lutein cells (TLC) of the CL-I at DI 1100 h (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This is consistent with a role for theca-derived BMP-3 in regulating the dominant follicle and CL.</p><p>A strong expression of BMP-3b mRNA was seen in some ovaries (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). During folliculogenesis, the theca cells (T) of the theca interna (TI) and externa (TE) of dominant follicles strongly expressed BMP-3b mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,2B,2C</xref>). In the TI, the expression appeared mainly in the TIC located nearest the TE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). After ovulation the signal was reduced. In the CL-I, BMP-3b mRNA was expressed at low to moderate levels in the TLC and TE cells during luteinization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D,2E</xref>). Little or no BMP-3b mRNA was evident in degenerating CL (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,2B</xref>). Interestingly, there was high expression in the ovary surface epithelium (OSE) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>), and in the epithelial cells of the sex cords (SC) located in the hilum of the ovary (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>).

A weak BMP-4 signal was first detectable in primary follicles, being localized to a few stroma fibroblasts near the basal lamina. This finding is consistent with the intriguing idea that the theca may begin to develop very early in preantral folliculogenesis, i.e. during the initial steps of primary follicle development. In secondary follicles, BMP-4 mRNA was present at moderate levels in an outer layer of flattened cells (the TE) and in a subset of TIC adjacent to these cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E,3F,3G</xref>). BMP-4 mRNA was expressed at high levels in the theca of developing dominant follicles, again being localized to the TE and adjacent TIC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H,3I,3J</xref>). Unlike healthy follicles, BMP-4 mRNA was very low or undetectable in atretic follicles. High levels of BMP-4 mRNA continue to be expressed in the TE of the CL throughout luteogenes, i.e. luteinization (E 0200 h to DI 1100 h), and luteolysis (DII 1100 h to E 0200 h the next cycle) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3K,3L</xref>). A potentially important finding is that the OSE covering the ovulated follicle and newly formed CL-I expressed high levels of BMP-4 mRNA while little or no BMP-4 mRNA was detected in other areas of the surface epithelium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3M,3N,3O</xref>). This is consistent with a role for BMP-4 in OSE regeneration following ovulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of BMP-6 mRNA</title><p>BMP-6 mRNA was present in the oocytes, GC, CL, blood vessels and the OSE (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A,4B</xref>). In the vascular system, BMP-6 mRNA was continuously expressed at relatively high levels in the endothelial cells of some large arteries and veins in the medulla (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Thus BMP-6, like BMP-4, could have a role in ovarian blood circulation. BMP-6 mRNA showed relatively high expression in the OSE throughout the cycle, suggesting a general, non-regulated role for BMP-6 in the OSE and/or adjacent tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A,4B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><italic>In situ </italic>hybridization of BMP-6 mRNA in ovaries of adult cycling rats.

There was no detectable BMP-6 mRNA in primordial and primary follicles (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>); however a weak hybridization signal was detected in oocytes of early secondary follicles when the second layer of GCs was forming (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Thereafter, expression increased sharply and was maximal in oocytes after the fourth layer of GC had developed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E,4F</xref>). High levels of BMP-6 mRNA were present in oocytes of all Graafian follicles, both healthy and atretic (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A,4B,4E,4F,4G,4H,4I,4J</xref>). The developmental changes in oocyte BMP-6 mRNA expression showed no obvious cyclic variation.</p><p>Like oocytes, BMP-6 mRNA was first detected in the GC at the early secondary stage. Expression increased as the follicle grew and was maximal after the fourth layer of GC had formed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D,4E,4F</xref>). In the preantral follicles, only the membrana GC expressed BMP-6 mRNA, consistent with a role of the oocyte in regulating GC BMP-6 expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E,4F</xref>). BMP-6 mRNA was not detectable in the GC of dominant follicles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G,4H</xref>). This loss of BMP-6 mRNA became evident soon after selection at E 0200 h, and continued through dominant follicle development. This suggests the inhibition of GC BMP-6 gene activity may be required for the formation of dominant follicles. The finding that BMP-6 mRNA is strongly expressed in GC during atresia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I,4J</xref>) is consistent with this idea. It is notable that BMP-6 mRNA was expressed in the TE of the CL-I from ovulation throughout luteolysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A,4B,4K,4L</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of BMP-7 mRNA</title><p>As with BMP-4, relatively high expression of BMP-7 mRNA was identified in the theca, CL and SC (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A,5B,5C</xref>). A specific pattern of BMP-7 expression was identified in the theca during folliculogenesis and luteogenesis. The theca of developing follicles first exhibited BMP-7 mRNA when the second layer of GC appeared, i.e. at the primary/secondary follicle transition (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Subsequent follicle growth was accompanied by increased BMP-7 mRNA expression which reached high levels in the theca of dominant follicles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D,5E</xref>). An intriguing feature of theca BMP-7 mRNA expression is that it restricted to the inner most layer, being present in a subset of fibroblast-like cells juxtaposed to the basal lamina and a sub-population of adjacent TIC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D,5E,5F</xref>). Notably, this pattern of theca BMP-7 mRNA expression is just the opposite of BMP-4 mRNA whose expression is limited to the outer half of the theca. These observations are consistent with the novel concept that the TIC of the TI represent two classes based on the BMP mRNAs that they expressed. As atresia occurs, BMP-7 mRNA is rapidly decreased to low or undetectable levels, indicating that BMP-7 is a marker for healthy follicles.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><italic>In situ </italic>hybridization of BMP-7 mRNA in ovaries of adult cycling rats.

The formation of a second layer of GC at the primary/secondary follicle transition was marked by a sharp increase in BMPR-IB mRNA expression in all the GC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8G</xref>). The entire mass of GC in developing dominant follicles strongly expressed BMPR-IB mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A,8B,8H,8I</xref>). Cells in atretic follicles (GC and oocyte) continued to show high expression of BMPR-IB mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8J,8K</xref>).</p><p>There was a marked decrease in BMPR-IB mRNA following ovulation, whereby little or no expression was evident in the CL-I during the luteinization i.e. E 0200 h to DI 1100 h (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). However, when luteolysis was initiated at DII 1100 h, the BMPR-IB mRNA is expressed in the TE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8L,8M</xref>). Then at P 2000 h, there was strong BMPR-IB expression in both the TE and in groups of endothelial cells scattered throughout the luteolytic CL-I (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8N,8O</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of BMPR-II mRNA</title><p>Over the cycle, the GC expressed the highest levels of BMPR-II mRNA, with the CL, SC, and the vascular endothelium showing low variable levels of expression (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A,9B</xref>). Although the oocytes of most follicles showed no hybridization signal above background, a weak expression was consistently seen in some oocytes of primary and early secondary follicles (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C</xref>). There was no detectable BMPR-II mRNA expression in GC of the primordial follicles; however, a low expression was detected in primary follicles after recruitment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C</xref>). During preantral follicle growth, expression increased reaching high maximal levels in the GC of secondary follicles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A,9B</xref>). High expression was seen in all the GC of the dominant follicle, except at ovulation when there appeared to be a decrease in BMPR-II mRNA within the cumulus GC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9D,9E</xref>). Ovulation was accompanied by a rapid decrease in the levels of BMPR-II mRNA. During the life of the CL, low to moderate expression was seen in the lutein, but not the endothelial cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9H</xref>). BMPR-II mRNA was strongly expressed in all GC during atresia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9F,9G</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><italic>In situ </italic>hybridization of BMPR-II mRNA in ovaries of adult cycling rats.

During the preantral stages of folliculogenesis, FS mRNA was poorly expressed in the GC. By comparison FS mRNA was highly expressed in all the GC of the dominant follicles over the cycle (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10A,10B</xref>). Then, during atresia, FS mRNA was low or absent in the GC (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Thus, FS gene activity and follicle dominance appear to be physiologically coupled. After ovulation, the CL showed high levels of FS mRNA expression during luteinization at E 0200 h and E 1000 h and moderate levels at DI 1100 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10F,10G,10H,10I,10J,10K</xref>). The high expression of FS mRNA correlates with a high expression of progesterone by the new CL-I. Interestingly, FS mRNA fell to non-detectable levels in the CL-I when luteolysis occurred at DII 1100 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10L,10M</xref>). FS mRNA remained undetectable in the CL until P 2000 h when high expression was induced in a subset of lutein cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10N,10O</xref>). This high expression in the luteolytic CL-I persisted through estrous of the next cycle.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To better understand the physiological role of the BMP family in ovarian function, the spatiotemporal expression patterns of a number of relevant BMP ligands, receptors, and a binding protein were determined by in situ hybridization in rat ovaries over the estrous cycle. The general principle to emerge from our data is that the developmental programs of folliculogenesis (recruitment, selection, and atresia), ovulation and luteogenesis (luteinization and luteolysis) are accompanied by precise cell-specific changes in the expression of the genes encoding the BMP family. Therefore, we hypothesize the regulated expression of BMP gene activity forms a part of the controlling network that ensures the proper timing of the developmental events that generates a normal estrous cycle.</p><p>The finding that the genes encoding the three types of BMP receptors are expressed in primordial follicles indicates that these fundamental reproductive units are targets for the BMPs. In this regard, we have shown recently that BMP-7 can promote primordial follicle growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Thus, it is reasonable to propose that one function of the BMP receptors in the primordial follicle might be to mediate the activation of recruitment by endogenous BMP-7. As there is no evidence that primordial follicles express BMP ligands, the mechanism by which this activation occurs would be paracrine, most likely involving BMP-7 from adjacent tissues such as the theca, secondary interstitial, or sex cords.</p><p>Unlike lower vertebrates, the developing mammalian follicle is composed of more than one layer of GC. One of the most important concepts generated in the ovary BMP field is that oocyte derived GDF-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] plays a role in the mechanisms governing the development of the second layer of GC i.e. the primary /secondary follicle transition. The question of how GDF-9 controls this step has yet to be answered. Our data show that the primary/secondary transition stage is accompanied by some rather dramatic changes in BMP expression including increased expression of: i) BMP-6, BMP-15, and BMPR IB in the oocyte; ii) BMP-2, BMP-6, and BMPR-IA, -IB and -II in the GC; and iii) BMP-4 and BMP-7 in the theca. Because folliculogenesis in the murine proceeds to the preovulatory stage in the absence of BMP-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], BMP-15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and BMPR-IB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], one can assume that the marked increases in these regulatory molecules are not essential for the development of a second layer of GC. The question of whether the increased expression of BMPR -II and BMP-2, -4, and -7 contribute to this important developmental event remains to be answered. One interesting implication of our BMP-2 data is that the GC have already attained different states of differentiation by the early stages of secondary follicle development Based on previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], it is not unreasonable to propose that oocyte morphogens may have control over GC fate beginning as early as the primary/secondary follicle transition. It will be interesting to investigate how this phenomenon fits into the mechanisms underlying the primary/secondary follicle transition.</p><p>Our results demonstrate for the first time that the theca interna of healthy follicles is composed of two distinct populations of theca interstitial cells (TIC). One group, which expresses BMP-4, is present as an outer layer of cells juxtaposed to the theca externa (TE), and another, which expresses BMP-7, is present at the proximal side of the theca interna near the basal lamina of the follicle. These differences can be found throughout folliculogenesis, beginning during the secondary stage. This, together with the failure to detect BMP-4 and 7 in the theca of atretic follicles, supports the idea that the cellular sites and coordinate expression of these BMP genes may have important regulatory roles in maintaining folliculogenesis. In this regard, a recent study has demonstrated the ability of BMP-4 to inhibit cyclic AMP-stimulated androgen production by the cultured human theca cell line, presumably by activating BMP receptors (BMPR-IA, -IB, and -II) which are expressed in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Because theca derived androgen is required for follicle estrogen biosynthesis and has been implicated in ovary pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], it will be interesting to determine how the expression and functions of these TIC-specific BMPs are integrated into the overall processes of physiology and pathophysiology. Besides the TI, a high level of BMP expression (BMP-3b and 4) is found within the smooth muscle cells of the TE during the process of follicle formation. Very little is known about the role of the TE in folliculogenesis: however this new finding raises the possibility that BMP-3b and -4 could have autocrine actions on TE histogenesis and/or paracrine actions on theca/follicle morphogenesis.</p><p>The rapid cessation of mitosis and the expression of apoptosis in the GC is the sinequanone of follicle atresia. Our results suggest a possible role for BMPs in follicle atresia. The supporting data are as follow. First, a striking feature of atresia in the rat ovary is the cessation of BMP expression (BMP-3b, -4, and -7) within the theca compartment. This observation is particularly interesting with respect to BMP-7. In previous work, we demonstrated that BMP-7 could stimulate DNA synthesis in rat GC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], as it does in human osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Equally relevant, several reports have demonstrated the role for BMP-7 in preventing apoptosis in other cell systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Together, these data suggest that theca-derived BMP-7 might be a follicle survival factor through its ability to enhance GC proliferation and suppress apoptosis. Second, atresia is accompanied by a relatively high level of expression of BMP-2 and -6 and the BMPR-IA, -IB, and -II. Significantly, this occurred in the absence of the BMP antagonist, FS. Thus, it is possible that GC BMP receptor signaling pathways are under maximal stimulation by BMP-2 and -6 during atresia. How this phenomenon contributes to atresia is unknown, but our finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] that BMP-6 inhibits FSH signaling is relevant because there is compelling evidence that continuous FSH stimulation is essential for follicle survival.</p><p>The expression of the family of BMPs (ligands, receptors and a binding protein) in the fundamental cell types of the dominant follicles (DF) argues for a physiological role of an intrinsic BMP in directing growth and cell fates in the DF. This is supported by two main lines of evidence. First, we found that the genes encoding the BMP receptors (BMPR-IA, -IB, -II) are highly expressed in the DF throughout its course of development. And second, the BMP ligands (BMP-4, -6, -7, and -15) act on the GC to control the level of mitosis and FSH receptor signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In this regard, one particularly interesting observation is the dramatic loss of BMP-6 mRNA in the GC when the DF is selected at E 0200 h. Because BMP-6 can prevent FSH action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the rapid loss of BMP-6 expression may be required for FSH to exert its crucial functions during DF-development. The secondary rise of FSH on estrous morning is obligatory for DF selection, and we have preliminary data showing that FSH induces the loss of BMP-6 mRNA in GC. Thus, the secondary rise of FSH may down regulate BMP-6 expression in the DF. It is notable that the absence of GC BMP-6 is a marker for the DF. Finally, with regard to FSH action, FS has been shown to neutralize the bioactivity of the FSH inhibitor, BMP-15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. It is possible, therefore, that the strong expression of FS by the DF may serve to modulate BMP-15 action such that sufficient FSH receptors are expressed in the GC to permit the development of a preovulatory follicle.</p><p>A role for the BMPs in regulating luteogenesis is strongly suggested our data. Some key findings are as follows. First, the classical view of CL development is that luteinization is inhibited by oocyte-derived luteinization inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], two of which have been identified as BMP-6 and -15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Therefore, the loss of oocyte BMP-6 and -15 at ovulation undoubtedly plays an especially prominent role in activating luteinization. Second, the fact that CL BMP-2 expression is suppressed and activated during luteinization and luteolysis, respectively, suggests that BMP-2 might be a novel luteinization inhibitor. Further work is necessary to investigate this possibility. Third, FS is strongly expressed during luteinization, but is undetectable at luteolysis. Thus, it is conceivable that the cycle-specific expression of FS within the CL may control the level of progesterone production through anti-BMP mechanisms. And fourth, a role of BMPR-IB in luteogenesis was suggested by our finding that luteinization and luteolysis, respectively are characterized by the absence and presence of BMPR-IB expression in the CL. A functional link between the expression of BMPR-IB and luteolysis comes from loss-of-function studies showing that the CL of the cycle continues to secrete progesterone in the absence of BMPR-IB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This work, together with our finding that BMPR-IB is selectively expressed in the TE of the CL at luteolysis, supports the novel hypothesis that the regulation of inducible and TE specific BMPR-IB gene expression may control luteolysis.</p><p>The observation that the ovarian sex cords (SC) express an intrinsic BMP system replete with ligands (BMP-3b, -4, -7) and receptors (BMPR-IA, -IB, -II) is novel. The SC are vestiges of the cranial portion of the mesonephric tubules and ducts, and in the adult ovary appear as a cluster of blind tubules in the hilar region. Although little is known about the physiology and biology of ovarian SC, they have been linked to the genesis of ovary cancer through distinct TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Significantly, the importance of FS in the genesis of this cancer has been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Given the evidence that BMPs are potent growth factors and that FS can modulate their bioactivity, it will be interesting to investigate the possibility that this intrinsic BMP system may be involved to pathogenesis of SC tumors. Because SC were occasionally found juxtaposed to developing follicles, blood vessels and secondary interstitial cells, one cannot exclude the possibility that the SC-derived BMPs may have paracrine functions.</p><p>A functional role for the BMPs in the ovary surface epithelium (OSE) is suggested by the strong expression of BMP-3b, -4, and -6. Based on our data, BMP-3b and -6 appear to be constitutively expressed throughout the epithelium over the cycle, a finding consistent with a maintenance-type role for these OSE BMPs. An interesting finding is the cell-specific induction of BMP-4 gene expression in a subset of epithelial cells covering the ovulated follicle and the newly formed CL-I. Although the function of this inducible and cell-specific gene expression is unclear, it is tightly correlated with the replenishment of the surface epithelium that is exfoliated from the surface of ovulating follicle. Thus, the importance of this highly specific expression of BMP-4 may relate to the regeneration of the OSE during postovulatory repair. Although BMP-4 expression appears tightly regulated over the cycle, it remains to be determined how the regulation is controlled. Because the OSE does not appear to express BMP receptors, the OSE-derived BMP-4 probably acts as a paracrine growth factor in the underlying stroma. It is noteworthy that epidemiological studies have shown that the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer is decreased by factors that suppress ovulation, i.e., pregnancy, breast-feeding, and oral contraceptive pill. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Given the relationship between LH-dependent ovulation and the induction of BMP-4 expression, it will be important to explore a possible link between the risk of ovary cancer and the ovulation-inducible and OSE cell-specific BMP-4 gene expression.</p><p>It is clear from this work that the regulation of inducible and cell-specific expression of the BMP family is a general property of the mammalian ovary. Consequently, the potential for independent and coordinated contributions of different BMPs to control growth, differentiation, and apoptosis is widely distributed throughout all the histological units of the ovary. The current challenges are to understand how specific hormone/growth factor interactions regulate BMP expression in the fundamental ovary cell types, and how these interactions are integrated into the morphological and histological events that generate the estrous cycle. The clinical relevance is emphasized by our previous finding that the expression of GDF-9 is dysregulated in oocytes of women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Holly Kim-Hoover and Danmei Li for excellent technical assistance and Andi Hartgrove for her excellent work in preparing the manuscript and figures.
