CpGs 3&#x02032; of the TSS of actively transcribed CpG island promoters typically remain methylation-free, indicating that maintaining promoter-proximal CpGs in an unmethylated state may be important for efficient transcription. Here we utilize recombinase-mediated cassette exchange to introduce a Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MoMuLV)-based reporter, in vitro methylated 1 kb downstream of the TSS, into a defined genomic site. In a subset of clones, methylation spreads to within &#x0223c;320 bp of the TSS, yielding a dramatic decrease in transcript level, even though the promoter/TSS region remains unmethylated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses reveal that such promoter-proximal methylation results in loss of RNA polymerase II and TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) binding in the promoter region, suggesting that repression occurs at the level of transcription initiation. While DNA methylation-dependent trimethylation of H3 lysine (K)9 is confined to the intragenic methylated region, the promoter and downstream regions are hypo-acetylated on H3K9/K14. Furthermore, DNase I hypersensitivity and methylase-based single promoter analysis (M-SPA) experiments reveal that a nucleosome is positioned over the unmethylated TATA-box in these clones, indicating that dense DNA methylation downstream of the promoter region is sufficient to alter the chromatin structure of an unmethylated promoter. Based on these observations, we propose that a DNA methylation-free region extending several hundred bases downstream of the TSS may be a prerequisite for efficient transcription initiation. This model provides a biochemical explanation for the typical positioning of TSSs well upstream of the 3&#x02032; end of the CpG islands in which they are embedded.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Genes, the functional units of heredity, are made up of DNA, which is packaged inside the nuclei of eukaryotic cells in association with a number of proteins in a structure called chromatin. In order for transcription, the process of transferring genetic information from DNA to RNA, to take place, chromatin must be decondensed to allow the transcription machinery to bind the genes that are to be transcribed. In mammals, promoters, the starting position of genes, are frequently embedded in &#x0201c;CpG islands,&#x0201d; regions with a relatively high density of the CpG dinucleotide. Paradoxically, while cytosines in the context of the CpG dinucleotide are generally methylated, CpGs flanking the start sites of genes typically remain methylation-free. As CpG methylation is associated with condensed chromatin, it is generally believed that promoter regions must remain free of methylation to allow for binding of the transcription machinery. Here, using a novel method for introducing methylated DNA into a defined genomic site, we demonstrate that DNA methylation in the promoter-proximal region of a gene is sufficient to block transcription via the generation of a chromatin structure that inhibits binding of the transcription machinery. Thus, methylation may inhibit transcription even when present outside the promoter region.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Appanah R, Dickerson DR, Goyal P, Groudine M, Lorincz MC (2007) An unmethylated 3&#x02032; promoter-proximal region is required for efficient transcription initiation.

Methylation exclusively in the coding region of an episomal reporter for example, yields an &#x0223c;10-fold reduction in expression, relative to an unmethylated control &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;.

Taken together, these results reveal that methylation 3&#x02032; of the TSS may adversely affect the efficiency of transcription. However, a detailed analysis of the interplay between proximity of DNA methylation to the TSS, transcription efficiency, and chromatin structure has not yet been reported.</p><p>Here we used RMCE to target a MoMuLV long terminal repeat (LTR)-based transgene encoding &#x0201c;humanized&#x0201d; green fluorescent protein (GFP), either unmethylated or methylated in vitro exclusively in a region 3&#x02032; of the TSS, to a specific intergenic genomic site in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. We show that the methylation pattern introduced in vitro is unstable in vivo, with spreading of methylation towards the TSS occurring in a subset of the clones isolated. When methylation spreads to within &#x0223c;320 bp 3&#x02032; of the TSS, expression is dramatically reduced, relative to clones bearing an unmethylated cassette integrated at the same site. Surprisingly, such promoter-proximal methylation inhibits RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) recruitment and TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) binding at the unmethylated promoter. Analysis of the modification state of the amino-terminal tail of H3 reveals that while H3 trimethylated on lysine 9 (H3K9me3) is confined to the patch-methylated region, the unmethylated promoter is hypo-acetylated at this residue, and nucleosome positioning is dramatically altered around the TSS. Based on these observations, we propose that while methylation &#x0223c;1,000 bp 3&#x02032; of the TSS has a relatively modest effect on transcription elongation, methylation &#x0223c;300 bp 3&#x02032; of the TSS generates a chromatin structure that precludes efficient transcription initiation from a methylation-free promoter.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>To determine if DNA methylation exclusive of the promoter/TSS region of a CpG island promoter influences transcription initiation, we introduced a transgene containing the MoMuLV LTR driving expression of GFP, either unmethylated or &#x0201c;patch&#x0201d; methylated in vitro exclusively in a region &#x0223c;1 kb 3&#x02032; of the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), into the RL5 integration site in MEL cells by RMCE &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. This integration site was recently cloned and mapped to the intergenic region between the <italic>Tal1</italic> and <italic>Map17</italic> genes on Chromosome 4 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. Flow cytometric analysis of the pool of ganciclovir resistant cells electroporated with the control unmethylated (&#x02212;) cassette revealed a high and homogeneous level of GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). In contrast, analysis of the pool of ganciclovir resistant cells harboring the patch-methylated cassette revealed heterogeneous GFP expression, with one population expressing at a level approaching that of the unmethylated cassette and another expressing at a relatively low level. To study the transcriptionally active subpopulations in greater detail, GFP&#x0002b; cells were sorted, and subclones generated. As expected, the majority of clones generated with the unmethylated cassette harbor the transgene at the RL5 site in one of two possible orientations, as determined by Southern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Thus, consistent with our previous work, these data reveal that an unmethylated cassette is expressed at relatively high levels, irrespective of genomic orientation. In all subsequent experiments, control clones harboring an &#x0201c;orientation-matched&#x0201d; unmethylated cassette were analyzed in parallel with clones harboring the patch-methylated cassette.</p><p>To determine whether the heterogeneity in expression detected in the pool of cells harboring the patch-methylated cassette reflects the presence of cells with distinct, stable expression states, clones were analyzed by flow cytometry at day 38 post-electroporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g002">2</xref>B). Patch-methylated clones (identified with an affixed &#x0201c;P&#x0201d; throughout the remainder of this article) of two distinct classes were detected; one expressing GFP at levels close to the unmethylated cassette and another expressing at significantly reduced levels. Comparison of the median GFP fluorescence values of ten clones harboring the patch-methylated cassette reveals that the &#x0201c;dull&#x0201d; clones express at a level &#x0223c;2&#x00025;&#x02013;10&#x00025; of the unmethylated control (with the exception of clone 3P, which shows a heterogeneous pattern of expression; unpublished data), while the &#x0201c;bright&#x0201d; clones express at a level approaching that of the unmethylated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). To independently determine the relative expression level of the &#x0201c;low-expressing&#x0201d; class of clones, the steady state level of mRNA of an unmethylated control (6&#x02212;), and a representative low-expressing patch-methylated clone (9P) was determined by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Consistent with the flow cytometry results, the methylated clone was found to express mRNA at &#x0223c;2&#x00025; of the level of the unmethylated clone. To confirm that the clonal populations showing a low level of expression do not include transcriptionally silent cells, subpopulations of clone 9P cells showing relatively high (above the 98th percentile of the GFP negative parent line) or low (indistinguishable from the parent line) expression were sorted, cultured for 5 d, and reanalyzed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). The expression profiles of these populations were very similar, indicating that the cells in this clone are homogeneous with respect to expression level. Taken together, these results reveal that a subset of patch-methylated clones harbor a cassette from which expression is dramatically reduced relative to an unmethylated control cassette integrated at the same site in the same orientation.</p><p>Given the heterogeneity in expression profiles of clones harboring the initially patch-methylated cassette, we next determined the methylation status of the cassettes in each of the clones described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g002">Figure 2</xref>. Genomic DNA isolated 35 days post-electroporation was digested with BamHI alone, or in combination with the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme HpaII, and Southern analysis was conducted using a GFP probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g003">3</xref>B). Two classes of clones are readily apparent, one with a relatively high molecular weight band of &#x0223c;1.65 kb (clones 1P, 4P, 8P, 9P, and 10P), and another with relatively low molecular weight bands between &#x0223c;0.5 and 0.9 kb (clones 2P, 5P, 6P, and 7P). The former is indicative of the absence of methylation at the first HpaII site 5&#x02032; of the patch-methylated region, but maintenance of methylation at all HpaII sites 3&#x02032; of this site, while the latter is indicative of loss of methylation at some or all of the premethylated sites. Comparison of the methylation state with the expression data, as measured by flow cytometry (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), reveals that clones harboring cassettes with varying degrees of demethylation of the patch-methylated region are all in the high-expressing class, while clones showing maintenance of methylation at the premethylated sites, are all in the low-expressing class of clones.</p><p>To characterize the methylation status of representative low- and high-expressing patch-methylated clones in greater detail, we analyzed clones 2P, 5P, 8P, 9P, and the unmethylated control clone 6&#x02212; by bisulphite sequencing, using primers specific for the LTR (I), GAG (II), &#x0201c;methylation-junction&#x0201d; (III), and GFP/in vitro methylated (IV) regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g003">Figure 3</xref>C; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030027-sg001">Figure S1</xref>; and unpublished data). Sequencing of cloned amplification products revealed that &#x0201c;alleles&#x0201d; of the high-expressing unmethylated control clone 6&#x02212; and the initially patch-methylated clone 2P are virtually methylation-free, explaining why the latter clone shows an expression profile similar to that of the initially unmethylated cassette. Interestingly, clone 5P, which shows an &#x0201c;intermediate&#x0201d; level of expression, retains the general methylation pattern introduced in vivo, with loss of methylation at some sites in the premethylated region but no spreading upstream of this region.</p><p>In contrast, &#x0201c;alleles&#x0201d; of the low-expressing clones 8P and 9P not only retained the initial methylation state at the majority of CpG sites, but also showed significant spreading of methylation upstream of this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g003">Figure 3</xref>C, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030027-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Thus, the apparently unmethylated HpaII site (as determined by Southern blotting) is embedded within the &#x0201c;de novo<italic>&#x0201d;</italic> methylated domain in these clones. Unfortunately, as this site is within the 3&#x02032; primer sequence of the GAG amplicon (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030027-st001">Table S1</xref>), the bisulphite data is uninformative for this site. However, several other CpGs in the initially unmethylated promoter proximal region remain unmethylated, despite being flanked by newly methylated sites, indicating that specific CpGs flanking the patch-methylated region are de novo methylated with very different efficiencies.</p><p>Surprisingly, in the two low-expressing clones that were analyzed, methylation did not spread beyond &#x0223c;320 bps 3&#x02032; of the TSS. With the exception of a few dispersed CpGs that are methylated in a subset of sequenced alleles, the promoter and TSS region in these clones remain methylation-free. These data indicate that spreading of methylation to within &#x0223c;320 bp of the TSS is sufficient to dramatically reduce transcriptional efficiency from an unmethylated promoter, while methylation &#x0223c;1,000 bp 3&#x02032; of the TSS has a relatively modest effect on transcription.</p><p>Previously, we found that the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) dramatically increased transcription from MoMuLV proviral clones constitutively expressing at a low level, but is incapable of activating expression in the same clones at a later time point when DNA methylation has accumulated in the TSS region &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. These results indicate that deacetylation of histones enhances transcription from active promoters, but is ineffective at promoting transcription from promoters that are methylated. Treatment of representative clones (3&#x02212; and 6&#x02212;) harboring the unmethylated L1-LTRGFP-1L cassette with 50nmol TSA for 48 h yielded a dramatic increase in expression level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030027-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). In contrast, the same treatment of the low-expressing clones 8P and 9P yielded no increase in GFP expression, indicating that in the presence of promoter-proximal methylation, inhibition of HDAC activity is not sufficient for transcriptional induction.</p><p>To determine whether methylation in close proximity to the promoter region influences recruitment of RNAPII to the transgene, formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin was generated from a representative unmethylated control clone (6&#x02212;) and a low-expressing patch-methylated clone (9P). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed using antibodies specific for the N-terminal domain (sc&#x02212;899) or the unphosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD) (8WG16) of RNAPII. Quantitative real-time PCR was conducted using primers specific for the transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), as well as for the endogenous <italic>&#x003b2;-major (&#x003b2;-maj) globin</italic> gene, which is not expressed in uninduced MEL cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Analysis of the data generated from two independent chromatin preparations reveals that, as expected, no enrichment of RNAPII is detected in the promoter region of the <italic>&#x003b2;-maj</italic> gene, relative to control immunoglobulin G (IgG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g004">4</xref>C). While clone 9P also shows no enrichment of RNAPII in the promoter (TATA) and downstream (GFP) regions of the transgene, the unmethylated clone shows significant enrichment in both regions using both &#x003b1;-RNAPII reagents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g004">4</xref>C). Not surprisingly, a higher level of enrichment of RNAPII was detected in the promoter than in the downstream region. Similar results were obtained using an antibody specific for RNAPII phosphorylated on Serine 5 of the CTD, the elongation-competent form of the holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030027-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). Taken together, these results reveal that methylation beginning &#x0223c;320 bp downstream of the TSS is sufficient to inhibit recruitment of RNAPII to the unmethylated transgene promoter.</p><p>To determine whether the failure to recruit RNAPII is the result of the inhibition of formation of the preinitiation complex (PIC), we next carried out ChIP analysis of TBP, a subunit of the transcription initiation factor (TFIID) complex that binds to the TATA box and initiates formation of the PIC. Analysis of the data generated from two independent chromatin preparations reveals that relative to control IgG, no TBP is detected in the promoter region of the endogenous <italic>&#x003b2;-maj</italic> gene or in the GFP region of the transgene in either clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). However, while the unmethylated clone shows significant enrichment of TBP in the TATA box region, clone 9P shows no enrichment. These data indicate that the reduced expression observed in the patch-methylated clone is the result of transcriptional inhibition at a step prior to recruitment of TFIID to the promoter region.</p><p>Given that recruitment of RNAPII and TFIID to the promoter region of the patch-methylated transgene is clearly inhibited, we next investigated whether the histone marks normally associated with &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; genes are similarly affected. The 5&#x02032; ends of actively transcribing genes are marked by histone H3 trimethylated (H3K4me3) and dimethylated (H3K4me2) on K4 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, and several of the HMTases with specificity for H3K4 are associated with the elongating RNAPII holoenzyme. Interestingly, methylation of H3K4 precedes acetylation of H3 in the promoter regions of inducible genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;, and a low but clearly detectable level of H3K4me3 is found associated with the 5&#x02032; end of some genes &#x0201c;poised&#x0201d; for transcription &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. To determine whether promoter-proximal DNA methylation influences H3K4 methylation state, two independent ChIP experiments were conducted using antibodies specific for H3K4me3 or H3K4me2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030027-sg003">Figure S3</xref>) and primers specific for the transgene or the endogenous pancreatic <italic>Amylase 2 (Amy2)</italic> gene, which is transcriptionally silent in MEL cells. In the intragenic regions analyzed, H3K4me3 enrichment is significantly higher in the transcriptionally active unmethylated control, likely the result of transcription-coupled deposition of H3K4me3. Surprisingly, enrichment of this mark in the promoter region is 2-fold higher in the patch-methylated than the unmethylated clone, perhaps as a consequence of decreased turnover of nucleosomes in the promoter region of the patch-methylated cassette. Analysis of H3K4me2 revealed low but significant levels of enrichment on both clones, with clone 9P showing a &#x0223c;2&#x02013;4-fold lower level of enrichment throughout the transgene. These results reveal that while DNA methylation starting &#x0223c;320 bp 3&#x02032; of the TSS yields a lower level of H3K4 methylation in the transcribed region of the cassette, this mark is still present in the promoter region.</p><p>We next tested whether acetylation of the H3 tail, another mark associated with &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; chromatin, is affected by promoter-proximal methylation.

We hypothesized that a condensed chromatin structure extending 5&#x02032; of the methylated region and/or a methylation-mediated alteration in nucleosome positioning may be responsible for the observed effect on TBP binding and transcription initiation.</p><p>We isolated chromatin from clones 6&#x02212; and 9P and determined the acetylation state of H3 on K9 and K14 (H3K9/K14ac), the latter of which is the major substrate of the mammalian p300, PCAF and GCN5 histone acetyltransferases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;.

Analysis of the <italic>Gnas</italic> gene revealed similar levels of enrichment in the unmethylated and patch-methylated clones (&#x0223c;26- and 23-fold, respectively, relative to the IgG control), indicating that the H3K9me3 ChIP worked with similar efficiency in both chromatin preparations. A low level of enrichment, was also detected in the promoter region of the endogenous <italic>&#x003b2;-maj</italic> gene in both clones, consistent with the previous report showing H3K9me3 1 kb 3&#x02032; of the promoter region in uninduced MEL cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. Analysis of the TATA box region of the transgene reveals that both clones 6&#x02212; and 9P show a modest level of enrichment for H3K9me3. In contrast, analysis of the GFP region reveals a high level of H3K9me3 enrichment (&#x0223c;22-fold relative to IgG) exclusively in clone 9P. The unmethylated clone shows a relatively low level of enrichment in the same region, &#x0223c;4.7-fold relative to IgG. Given the size of chromatin fragments generated via sonication, the slightly higher level of enrichment detected in the TATA region of clone 9P may be the result of amplification of template fragments bearing H3K9me3 in the downstream DNA methylated region. These data reveal that targeting of H3K9me3 to &#x0201c;euchromatic&#x0201d; regions in mammalian cells may be facilitated by the presence of DNA methylation per se, and that methylation-associated deposition of this mark may not spread beyond the DNA methylated regions.</p><p>To directly determine whether the observed inhibition of transcription in the low-expressing patch-methylated clones is associated with an altered chromatin structure in the upstream unmethylated CpG island promoter/TSS region, DNase I hypersensitivity (HS) analysis was conducted. Previous experiments have shown that a transcriptionally active MoMuLV LTR harbors two HS sites, one in the upstream enhancer region, and another around the TSS &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. Nuclei from clones 6&#x02212; and 9P were isolated and treated with DNase I. Subsequently, genomic DNA was extracted, digested with BamHI, and analyzed by Southern blot using the indirect end-labeling technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g006">Figure 6</xref>A).</p><p>The unmethylated clone showed a predominant band at 2.3 kb, and an additional band at 2.5 kb, corresponding to the TSS and the enhancer regions, respectively. In contrast, the clone bearing promoter-proximal DNA methylation showed a band of comparable intensity in the enhancer region, but only a faint HS site around the TSS, indicating that the chromatin structure around the TSS is indeed altered by DNA methylation &#x0223c;320 bp downstream of this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). To establish that the difference in DNase I digestion patterns was not the result of a difference in the efficiency of digestion, the blot shown in 6B was subsequently stripped and reprobed with a probe specific for the endogenous &#x0201c;HS3&#x0201d; site in the Locus Control Region of the &#x003b2;-globin locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). A single DNase I-dependent band is present in clone 6&#x02212; and 9P samples, demonstrating that both clones were digested with comparable efficiency.</p><p>To determine whether the loss of the TSS-specific HS site reflects an alteration in nucleosome positioning at the TSS of the patch-methylated cassette, &#x0201c;methylase-based single promoter analysis&#x0201d; (M-SPA), a method recently developed by Fatemi et al<italic>.</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;, was conducted using nuclei isolated from clones 6&#x02212; and 9P. M-SPA involves treatment of isolated nuclei with the cytosine-C5 CpG-specific DNA methyltransferase SssI (M.SssI), followed by genomic bisulphite sequencing of individual progeny DNA molecules. In the context of chromatin, the accessibility of individual CpGs to M.SssI activity is dependent upon nucleosome positioning or the presence of bound transcription factors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. Patches of &#x0223c;150 bp of relatively under-methylated regions correlate with the approximate positions of nucleosomes on individual sequenced molecules &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. As the promoter region of the transgene is virtually methylation-free in both the patch-methylated and unmethylated clones (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g003">Figure 3</xref>), the methylation detected predominantly reflects the accessibility of individual CpGs to M.SssI activity. Bisulphite analysis of isolated genomic DNA treated with M.SssI for 5 min revealed complete methylation of all 24 CpGs in the promoter region (unpublished data). In contrast, analysis of isolated nuclei treated with M.SssI for 15 min revealed a clone-dependent methylation pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). While clone 6&#x02212; shows a relatively low level of methylation downstream of the TSS, clone 9P showed a relatively low level of methylation across a &#x0223c;150-bp region centered on the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). These distinct patterns of methylation sensitivity likely reflect the positioning of a nucleosome over the promoter/TSS region in clone 9P, and the absence of a nucleosome in this region in the unmethylated, highly transcribed control. Taken together, these data reveal that the chromatin structure around the unmethylated TSS is indeed altered in cells harboring DNA methylation &#x0223c;320 bp 3&#x02032; of this region, demonstrating that this epigenetic mark can act at a distance to disrupt nucleosome positioning and in turn, transcription initiation in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we utilized RMCE to target a patch-methylated construct into a defined chromosomal region. Spreading of methylation towards the TSS in a subset of clones allowed us to study the influence of methylation on transcription when present at different distances downstream of a methylation-free promoter. When methylation spreads to within &#x0223c;320 bp of the TSS, expression is dramatically reduced, relative to an unmethylated cassette integrated at the same site. Clones bearing such promoter-proximal methylation show loss of RNAPII and TBP binding and a reduction in the level of H3K4me3 in the transcribed region. Surprisingly, while H3K9me3 is enriched in the patch-methylated region, this mark does not spread upstream into the unmethylated promoter, despite the fact that this region is hypo-acetylated on H3K9/14. Nevertheless, the observed loss of a promoter-specific DNase I HS site and alteration of nucleosome positioning around the promoter/TSS region reveals that DNA methylation beginning 320 bp&#x02014;three nucleosomes&#x02014;downstream of the TSS generates a chromatin structure in the methylation-free promoter region that precludes efficient transcription initiation.</p><p>Previously, we conducted a similar set of experiments using a construct with the p16 promoter driving expression of the GFP gene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. This construct, which differs from the construct used in this study at the promoter region only, was patch-methylated in vitro, in the same region as the L1-LTRGFP-1L construct and integrated at the same genomic site via RMCE. In contrast to the LTR-based construct, only one GFP&#x0002b; population was detected by flow cytometry. Analysis of the methylation status of GFP&#x0002b; clones harboring the p16 promoter-based construct, which showed a decrease in expression of &#x0223c;40&#x00025; relative to unmethylated control clones, revealed no spreading of methylation upstream of the premethylated region &#x0223c;1 kb downstream of the promoter, and no apparent effect on transcription initiation rate, as determined by polII ChIP and run-on analyses of the transcribed region upstream of the patch-methylated domain. Given that the level of expression from the unmethylated LTR is approximately five times greater than that of the unmethylated p16 promoter (at the RL5 integration site), it is quite possible that methylation spreading inhibited transcription from the p16 promoter to such an extent that the level of GFP expression was below the threshold for detection by flow cytometry. If so, this class of clones was inadvertently excluded from our original study, as only cells showing detectable GFP expression were chosen for further analysis.</p><p>In a subpopulation of cells harboring the L1-LTRGFP-1L cassette described here, a region upstream of the in vitro methylated domain was de novo methylated, yielding a dramatic decrease in expression that was nevertheless above the threshold for detection by flow cytometry. Why methylation spreading did not extend into the promoter region remains to be determined. Given the persistence of H3K4 methylation in the promoter region of the patch-methylated cassette, it is tempting to speculate that this &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; mark may serve in part to protect this region from de novo DNA methylation. Regardless, these data reveal that while transcription is only modestly reduced in the presence of a dense patch of methylation &#x0223c;1 kb downstream of the TSS, methylation within &#x0223c;320 bp of the TSS is sufficient to dramatically reduce transcription initiation efficiency, results consistent with those of Graessmann and colleagues, who found using microinjection of premethylated HSV-based reporter constructs that methylation of specific CpGs &#x0003e;570 bp downstream of the TSS had no effect on expression, while methylation of CpGs within 570 bp of the TSS had a dramatic effect on transcription &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Similarly, using a transiently transfected luciferase reporter, Hisano et al<italic>.</italic> showed that methylation of a region &#x0223c;100 bp downstream of the TSS of the minimal promoter (which lacks CpGs altogether) of the murine <italic>Tact1</italic> gene yielded a dramatic reduction in expression, relative to an unmethylated control &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. Taken together, these observations indicate that methylation of the promoter region per se is not a prerequisite for DNA methylation-mediated transcriptional inhibition. As outlined in the model described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030027-g008">Figure 8</xref>, we propose that the distance of DNA methylation downstream of the TSS dictates the nature and level of transcriptional inhibition, with a modest effect on elongation efficiency occurring in the presence of dense DNA methylation on the order of 1 kb downstream of the TSS &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, and a dramatic decrease in initiation efficiency occurring in the presence of DNA methylation on the order of 300 bp downstream of the TSS.</p><p>Recruitment of HDAC and/or H3K9 MTase complexes to the methylated region may play a role in inhibiting transcriptional initiation at a distance. However, while we did detect a high level of enrichment of H3K9me3 in the DNA methylated/GFP region in the patch-methylated clone analyzed here, enrichment of this mark was only 2-fold higher in the promoter region of the patch-methylated cassette than the control unmethylated cassette, indicating that H3K9me3 acts at a distance to prevent recruitment of TBP, or is not responsible for the observed initiation block. As Vakoc et al<italic>.</italic> recently showed that H3K9me3 is frequently found in the transcribed regions of actively transcribing genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;, we favor the latter possibility. Regardless, given that the unmethylated control cassette shows a relatively low level of enrichment of the H3K9me3 mark in the otherwise identical but unmethylated GFP region, our experiments clearly reveal that the presence of a short patch of DNA methylation is sufficient to recruit an HMTase with H3K9me3 activity to a &#x0201c;euchromatic&#x0201d; region in mammalian cells. Consistent with the hypothesis that DNA methylation can act &#x0201c;upstream&#x0201d; of H3K9 trimethylation in mammalian cells, Feng and colleagues recently showed that the presence of CpG dinucleotides is required for maintenance of H3K9 trimethylation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Genome-wide analysis of the distribution of H3K9/K14 acetylation reveals that this mark typically extends &#x0223c;1 kb downstream of TSSs, and along the entire length of CpG islands &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;.

As the unmethylated promoter region of the patch-methylated cassette described here is hypo-acetylated relative to the identical but unmethylated control cassette integrated at the same site, we propose that the observed decrease in histone H3 acetylation reduces nucleosome &#x0201c;fluidity&#x0201d; in the promoter proximal region, which inhibits repositioning of the nucleosome around the TATA-box and in turn, recruitment of TBP.</p><p>Support for this hypothesis comes from the DNase I and M-SPA analyses described here.

For bisulphite analyses, genomic DNA was digested with BamHI, purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, denatured, treated with bisulphite as described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, and subject to nested or semi-nested PCR using primers designed to amplify bisulfite-converted template.

DNase I digested genomic DNA was purified and digested with BamHI, prior to electrophoresis on a 0.8&#x00025; agarose gel. The GFP probe used for hybridization was generated by digestion of the plasmidL1-MFG-<italic>GFP-</italic>1L with NcoI and BamHI, yielding a restriction fragment including the complete 720-bp <italic>GFP</italic> gene.

After repeating this step with 0.5&#x00025; SDS only, the blot was rinsed with 2&#x000d7; SSC. The blot was subsequently exposed to film to establish the efficiency of stripping. The probe used for rehybridization was generated by digestion of the plasmid BSKSIImHS3TIM with EcoRI and BamHI, generating a 360-bp fragment that is specific for the &#x0201c;HS3&#x0201d; region of the murine &#x000df;-globin Locus Control Region.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title> M-SPA.</title><p>M-SPA was conducted as described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;, with minor modifications.

Subsequently, genomic DNA was isolated and digested with BamHI. Digested DNA was resolved on a 0.8&#x00025; agarose gel. A map of the transgene, GFP probe, and HS sites is shown (A). The location of transgene-specific DNase HS sites was determined via Southern hybridization using a GFP probe (B). Predicted HS sites at the proviral enhancer and promoter, 2.5 kb and 2.3 kb upstream of the BamHI site, respectively, are shown. Note that the promoter-specific HS site is absent in clone 9P, even in the presence of relatively high concentrations of DNase I. Two additional HS sites, one site that is common to both clones and maps to a genomic (g) site (within a Charlie4 DNA transposon) &#x0223c;3 kb upstream of the enhancer HS site, and a second that is unique to the 6&#x02212; clone and maps to the splice acceptor (SA) site within the transgene (&#x0223c;1.2 kb upstream of the BamHI site) were also detected.

Subsequently, genomic DNA was isolated and analyzed by bisulphite sequencing using primers flanking the promoter/TSS region. For each clone, 24 molecules were cloned and sequenced. Methylated and unmethylated CpGs are depicted as filled and open ovals, respectively (A). The fraction of molecules harboring an unmethylated cytosine at each CpG in the sequenced region is plotted in (B). Note the dramatic difference in methylation efficiency spanning the region from &#x0223c;CpG &#x00023;5 to &#x0223c;CpG &#x00023;18 (a distance of 148 bps), particularly those sites flanking the TSS at &#x0223c;CpG &#x00023;11. Based on these data, a diagram showing the predicted predominant sites of nucleosome occupancy (ovals) for each clone is shown. The enhancer region (CpGs &#x00023;1&#x02013;3) is likely to be constitutively nucleosome-free, consistent with the presence of a DNase HS site in this region in both clones.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0030027.g007"/></fig><fig id="pgen-0030027-g008" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Model of the Relationship between Promoter-Proximal DNA Methylation and Transcriptional Efficiency</title><p>Four alternative DNA methylation states are shown, along with the acetylation (K9ac) and methylation (K9me) states of H3K9.

This would allow for methylation and silencing of intronic parasitic elements, such as SINE and LINES or &#x0201c;cryptic promoters&#x0201d;, while allowing for efficient transcription of bona fide genes. Dense DNA methylation on the order of 1 kb from the TSS may have a modest effect on elongation efficiency, perhaps by altering the chromatin structure of the promoter proximal region, as we have shown previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030027-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Promoter proximal methylation (&#x0223c;300 bp from the TSS) may have a dramatic effect on transcription initiation, as a result of altering promoter chromatin structure, as described here.
