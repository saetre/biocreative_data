There is evidence that infection of immature myeloid dendritic cells plays a crucial role in dengue pathogenesis and that the interaction of the viral envelope E glycoprotein with CD209/DC-SIGN is a key element for their productive infection. Dermal macrophages express CD209, yet little is known about their role in dengue virus infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Here, we showed that dermal macrophages bound recombinant envelope E glycoprotein fused to green fluorescent protein. Because dermal macrophages stain for IL-10 <italic>in situ</italic>, we generated dermal-type macrophages from monocytes in the presence of IL-10 to study their infection by dengue virus. The macrophages were able to internalize the virus, but progeny virus production was undetectable in the infected cells. In addition, no IFN-&#x003b1; was produced in response to the virus. The inability of dengue virus to grow in the macrophages was attributable to accumulation of internalized virus particles into poorly-acidified phagosomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Aborting infection by viral sequestration in early phagosomes would present a novel means to curb infection of enveloped virus and may constitute a prime defense system to prevent dengue virus spread shortly after the bite of the infected mosquito.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Mosquito-transmitted pathogens are a major challenge to humans due to ever-increasing distribution of the vector worldwide. Dengue virus causes morbidity and mortality, and no anti-viral treatment or vaccine are currently available. The virus is injected into the skin when an infected mosquito probes for blood. Among the skin immunocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages are equipped with pathogen-sensing receptors. Our work has shown that dermal macrophages bind the dengue virus envelope protein. We demonstrate that monocyte-derived dermal macrophages are resistant to infection and present evidence that this is due to sequestration of the virus into fusion-incompetent intracellular vesicles. This identifies skin macrophages as the first innate immune cell potentially capable of protecting the human host from infection by dengue virus shortly after a mosquito bite. These findings have important implications for better understanding the early infection events of dengue virus and of other skin-penetrating pathogens.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dengue is probably the most important mosquito-transmitted viral disease of humans worldwide. It is caused by dengue virus (DV), which exists as four serotypes (DV1-4) and circulates in an endemic-epidemic mode in most tropical and sub-tropical territories. Transmission of DV to humans occurs when an infected mosquito probes for blood vessels and during a blood meal, through injection of infectious saliva into the human dermis. As a member of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, DV infection involves virus uptake into endosomal vesicles that undergo acidification. The low pH induces structural alterations in the envelope (E) protein that lead to membrane fusion and the release of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000311-Stiasny1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. After uncoating, the RNA genome is translated to initiate virus replication. It has been proposed that non-neutralizing antibodies raised against one DV serotype may enhance infection by a heterotypic serotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000311-Halstead1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. This may explain why secondary infections are often associated with the more severe forms of dengue fever (hemorrhagic fever with or without shock).</p><p>Much research on DV relies on relevant human cell culture models due to the difficulty of establishing appropriate animal models. Progress has been made by showing that DV E protein recognizes the C-type lectin CD209 and its homologue L-SIGN and that expression of either of these lectins is sufficient to render cells permissive to DV grown in mosquito cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000311-NavarroSanchez1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000311-Tassaneetrithep1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, the mannose receptor (MR) has also been shown to mediate DV binding and infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000311-Miller1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Dendritic cells (DC), generated from monocytes in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4, express CD209, L-SIGN and the MR and are highly susceptible to DV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000311-NavarroSanchez1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000311-Tassaneetrithep1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000311-Wu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. These monocyte-derived DC are thought to be representative of dermal DC (dDC), yet there is increasing evidence that CD209 is not expressed by dDC but primarily by dermal macrophages (dM&#x003c6;) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000311-Turville1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000311-Zaba1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. This underscores the importance of dM&#x003c6; in early infection events and raises the question of whether dM&#x003c6; are permissive for productive DV infection. Studies of these cells have been hampered by the lack of suitable isolation techniques from human skin and culture methods to generate the cells from monocytic precursors.</p><p>Here, we confirmed that human dM&#x003c6; express CD209 and showed that they bind DV E protein. Based on the finding that dM&#x003c6; stained for intracellular IL-10, we developed a method to generate the cells from monocytes in the presence of IL-10. The monocyte-derived dM&#x003c6; bound E protein and acquired DV in intracellular vesicles, but were resistant to viral replication. The inability of DV to grow in these dermal-type M&#x003c6; was attributable to accumulation of internalized virus particles into poorly-acidified phagosomes. These findings advance our understanding of the host innate resistance to DV at the early stages of infection and have implications for other pathogens recognizing CD209.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Dermal cell suspensions</title><p>Before blood and tissue samples were collected for the study, all healthy donors and patients gave written informed consent in agreement with the Helsinki Declaration and French legislation.

To monitor DV3 sE protein internalization in MDdM&#x003c6; and MDDC, the cells were incubated with pH-sensitive LysoSensor dye and analyzed by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000311-g004"><bold>Fig. 4</bold></xref>). This dye accumulates in acidic organelles, where its fluorescence emission is highest. After 5 min at 37&#x000b0;C, DV3 sE protein was observed in vesicle-like structures in both cell-types. By 30 min and 60 min, DV3 sE protein dispersed to acidified perinuclear lysosomes in MDDC. In marked contrast, when MDdM&#x003c6; were examined at these time-points, a large fraction of internalized DV3 sE protein was excluded from the acidic compartment and remained in non-acidic, large endosomes. Electron microscopy analysis using a colloidal gold-conjugated antibody to GFP demonstrated that DV3 sE protein accumulated in large phagosomes in MDdM&#x003c6;, located close to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000311-g005"><bold>Fig. 5</bold></xref>). On the other hand, at 30 min, in MDDC, DV3 sE protein was mostly found in small perinuclear vesicles in the environment of the endoplasmic reticulum. Taken together, these data suggest that the inability of DV to productively infect MDdM&#x003c6; is due to accumulation of virus particles in immature endosomal vesicles whose pH does not allow efficient viral-cell membrane fusion and subsequent virus uncoating.</p><fig id="pntd-0000311-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0000311.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>DV3 sE-eGFP protein is excluded from acidic compartments in MDdM&#x003c6;.</title><p>Confocal microscopic analysis of the localization of DV3 sE-eGFP protein at different time-points in cells loaded with the fluorescent LysoSensor dye (optimal fluorescence at pH 5.1).

By combining IL-10, M-CSF and GM-CSF, a homogenous cell population was obtained which carried CD209 and other markers characteristic of dM&#x003c6;, rapidly produced IL-10 in response to LPS or other toll-like receptor ligands (data not shown), and bound DV3 sE protein. Like MDDC, the MDdM&#x003c6; were capable of internalizing live DV but, distinct from MDDC, they displayed an inherent resistance to viral growth. In contrast to DV3 sE protein found in acidified compartments in MDDC, we observed that DV3 sE protein accumulated in non-acidified phagosomes in MDdM&#x003c6;. The DC vesicles containing DV3 sE protein or live virus were bell-shaped or tubular, whereas they were round, larger and close to the plasma membrane in the M&#x003c6;. To our knowledge, this identifies MDdM&#x003c6; as the first innate immune cell capable of protecting the human host from DV infection and virus propagation. From this data, we propose that dM&#x003c6; can act to trap infecting virions in a fusion-incompetent endosomal environment and thus to prevent DV spread to dDC at the anatomical site of the mosquito bite. We cannot formally exclude the possibility that downstream delays in the viral life cycle contribute to the inability of DV to replicate in MDdM&#x003c6;, but the finding that West Nile virus productively infects these cells (data not shown) indicates that they are not generally refractory to flavivirus growth.</p><p>IL-10, required for CD209 expression and blockage of endosome acidification, is likely to be produced by the dM&#x003c6; themselves, constitutively, or in response to stimuli such as UV-light <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000311-Kang1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In this context, a key question is whether mosquito salivary proteins, co-injected with the infectious virus, would also trigger IL-10 production by dM&#x003c6; or, on the contrary, provoke an inflammatory response. Inflammatory cytokines of the Th2 T-helper cell type, IL-4 and IL-13, may be responsible for the formation of CD209<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>MR<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DC, which are permissive for DV infection and viral progeny production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000311-NavarroSanchez1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000311-Wu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, the presence of anti-DV non-neutralizing antibodies raised against a heterotypic DV serotype may render dDC susceptible to DV infection at the site of the mosquito bite.</p><p>The abundance and strategic position of the M&#x003c6; in the dermis is consistent with their function as first defense barrier against pathogens by isolating and eliminating them and thus avoiding unnecessary immune activation. However, other pathogens that recognize C-type lectins, such as mycobacteria, may exploit these cells to escape immune attack.
