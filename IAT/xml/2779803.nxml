Three different <italic>Wnt </italic>pathways have been described downstream of Fz receptors: the canonical <italic>Wnt</italic>/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway; and the non-canonical pathways involving intracellular signaling by Ca<sup>2+ </sup>or the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In the canonical <italic>Wnt</italic>/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway, <italic>Wnt </italic>ligands interact with Fz receptors and their co-receptor LRP5/6 and signal through Dishevelled to inhibit the kinase activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3&#x003b2; in a protein degradation complex containing Axin and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein. When <italic>Wnt </italic>signaling is inactive, &#x003b2;-catenin is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3&#x003b2; and thus rapidly degraded via the proteasome pathway. When cells receive <italic>Wnt </italic>signals, the degradation pathway is inhibited, and &#x003b2;-catenin consequently accumulates in the cytoplasm and is translocated to the nucleus where it binds the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors to regulate the expression of <italic>Wnt </italic>target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Fz receptors have an extracellular amnio-terminal region that contains a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) consisting of 120 to 125 residues with 10 conserved cysteines that is necessary for the binding of <italic>Wnt </italic>molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In mammals, 19 different <italic>Wnts </italic>are known, and 10 Fz proteins have been identified as <italic>Wnt </italic>receptors. In addition to Fz, other <italic>Wnt </italic>receptors have been described more recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and it has been shown that a single <italic>Wnt </italic>ligand can signal through different pathways depending on receptor context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], increasing the complexity of the <italic>Wnt </italic>signaling cascade.</p><p>In the past decade, it has been well established that <italic>Wnt </italic>signaling plays a key role in diverse aspects of neuronal connectivity by regulating axon guidance and remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], dendritic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and synapse formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Additionally, intracellular modulators of the <italic>Wnt </italic>pathway enhanced excitatory transmission in adult hippocampal preparations, acting predominantly via a presynaptic mechanism to increase neurotransmitter release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and <italic>Wnt-7a </italic>was shown to induce recycling and exocytosis of synaptic vesicles in cultured hippocampal neurons and enhance synaptic transmission in adult hippocampal slices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>Wnt-3a </italic>is released from synapses in an activity-dependent manner, and the secreted <italic>Wnt </italic>and the consequent activation of <italic>Wnt </italic>signaling facilitates long-term potentiation, suggesting that <italic>Wnt </italic>signaling plays a role in regulating synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. <italic>Wnt-3a </italic>was also shown to induce the recycling of synaptic vesicles in cultured hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In the present work, we have studied the distribution of the canonical <italic>Wnt </italic>receptor Fz1 in neurons, and the potential role of this receptor in synapse structure and function. We determined that, in cultured hippocampal neurons, Fz1 clusters are localized in synapses co-localizing with presynaptic markers in close apposition to the postsynaptic protein PSD-95. In addition, Fz1 was observed in functional synapses detected with FM1-43 staining and in synaptic terminals from adult rat brain. Overexpression of Fz1 increased the number of Bassoon clusters, and treatment with the Fz1 ligand <italic>Wnt-3a </italic>induced presynaptic protein clustering and modulated the kinetics of synaptic vesicle release, suggesting that the activation of <italic>Wnt </italic>signaling through Fz1 modulates presynaptic differentiation and function.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Presynaptic distribution of the Fz1 receptor in hippocampal neurons</title><p>In order to better understand the mechanisms involved in the synaptic effects of the <italic>Wnt </italic>pathway, we studied the distribution of the Fz1 receptor, which has been well studied and has been related to the <italic>Wnt</italic>/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The distribution of Fz1 was analyzed by immunofluorescence in cultured hippocampal neurons at 14 days <italic>in vitro </italic>(DIV). This receptor shows a punctate distribution in neuronal processes and a low staining in the cell body (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). To test whether Fz1 is present at synaptic sites in cultured neurons, we examined the co-localization of Fz1 with the presynaptic marker synapsin I (Syn) and the postsynaptic density scaffold protein PSD-95. Fz1 clusters are in close apposition to PSD-95 puncta and seem to co-localize with Syn (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This observation is supported by the overlap coefficient according to Manders <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], which represents the number of co-localized pixels expressed as a fraction of the total number of pixels within each channel (Syn/PSD-95, 0.214 &#x000b1; 0.023; Syn/Fz1, 0.376 &#x000b1; 0.039; PSD-95/Fz1, 0.157 &#x000b1; 0.016; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). In addition, another approach was used to establish the presynaptic distribution of Fz1. In hippocampal neurons transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP), synaptic vesicles were labeled by activity-dependent uptake of the fluorescent dye FM1-43 and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, upper panel). Then, cells were fixed and permeabilized and the presynaptic protein VAMP and Fz1 were detected by immunofluorescence. The same GFP-positive neuron was analyzed by confocal microscopy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, lower panel). Fz1 was present in most of the presynaptic terminals stained with FM1-43 and VAMP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, arrows).

At early stages of differentiation (4 DIV), Fz1 distributes mostly at the axon as determined by double labeling with the axonal marker phosphorylated MAP1B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), supporting the presynaptic distribution of this receptor. By 7 DIV, Fz1 is observed in isolated axons as fine puncta that mostly do not co-localize with Bassoon puncta (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), suggesting that Fz1 is not associated with presynaptic proteins during the initial stages of synaptic assembly. Bassoon is a presynaptic cytomatrix protein recruited early during synapse formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. By 10 DIV, larger clusters of Fz1 are observed and it is possible to find co-localization of Fz1 with Bassoon mainly in axons contacting other neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, arrows), but not in isolated axons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>).

In these hippocampal neurons at 9 DIV, there was a significant decrease in the density of Bassoon clusters after treatment with 1 &#x003bc;g/ml Fz1-CRD (34.42 &#x000b1; 0.98 Bassoon puncta per 100 &#x003bc;m neurite length) compared to control (40.12 &#x000b1; 1.07). This decrease was not observed when neurons were treated with 1 &#x003bc;g/ml of the soluble CRD of the Fz2 receptor, which has been shown to be involved in non-canonical <italic>Wnt </italic>pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] (40.18 &#x000b1; 0.73 Bassoon puncta per 100 &#x003bc;m), indicating a specific effect of Fz1 on Bassoon clustering that is not mediated by all Fz receptors. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> shows representative images of control neurons and neurons treated with 1 &#x003bc;g/ml Fz1-CRD or Fz2-CRD. This result suggests that Fz1 may normally participate in the presynaptic differentiation. To further assess this hypothesis, we overexpressed Fz1 in hippocampal neurons. First, to evaluate whether overexpressed Fz1 localizes at presynaptic sites, neurons were transfected with GFP-tagged Fz1. We observed that this receptor was present in axons stained with phosphorylated MAP1B (MAP1BP) antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, upper panel), showing a punctuate distribution at higher magnification (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, lower panels). In addition, Fz1-GFP co-localized with active synaptic terminals that were loaded with FM4-64 under stimulation with KCl (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, arrows), indicating a synaptic location of the overexpressed Fz1 receptor. To assess the effect of this overexpression on presynaptic differentiation, we transfected neurons with rat Fz1-myc, which we previously demonstrated to be able to increase the activation of the <italic>Wnt </italic>signaling pathway, indicating that this is a functional receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Neurons were co-transfected with GFP to easily identify transfected neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E, F</xref>). As determined by anti-Fz1 immunoreactivity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>), Fz1 is highly overexpressed in transfected neurons (asterisk) compared to non transfected neurons (arrow), and this overexpressed receptor is located in axons stained with MAP1BP. We then evaluated Bassoon clustering during the initial stages of synaptic assembly. At 9 DIV, hippocampal neurons transfected with Fz1-myc showed increased numbers of Bassoon puncta compared to control neurons transfected with the empty vector (pCS2+; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>), strongly supporting a role for Fz1 in presynaptic differentiation.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Fz1 overexpression induces presynaptic protein clustering</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>The number of Bassoon clusters per neurite length was evaluated in hippocampal neurons (9 DIV) treated for 24 h with different concentrations of the soluble extracellular Fz1 CRD or 1,000 ng/ml Fz2-CRD. <bold>(B) </bold>Representative images of control neurons and neurons treated with 1 &#x003bc;g/ml Fz1-CRD or Fz2-CRD for 24 h. <bold>(C) </bold>Hippocampal neurons were transfected with Fz1-GFP, which was detected in axons stained with phosphorylated MAP1B (MAP1BP). <bold>(D) </bold>Fz1-GFP clusters co-localize with pre-synaptic terminals loaded with FM4-64 under stimulation with 90 mM KCl (arrows). <bold>(E) </bold>Hippocampal neurons were transfected with Fz1-myc plus GFP to easily identify transfected neurons.

Although roles for <italic>Wnt </italic>ligands in regulating synaptic assembly and plasticity have been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], little is known about the receptors that mediate these effects. Previously, we and others determined that Fz1 is highly expressed in the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In the present work, we determined the synaptic distribution of the canonical <italic>Wnt </italic>receptor Fz1. We found that this receptor is located at synaptic sites in hippocampal neurons, co-localizing with presynaptic proteins and with active synaptic vesicle recycling sites stained under KCl stimulation with a fluorescent dye, indicating that this receptor is distributed presynaptically. In addition, Fz1 was detected in a synaptosome preparation from adult rat brains, supporting the synaptic distribution of this receptor.</p><p>Specifically, the presynaptic distribution of Fz1 determined in this work suggests that the activation of the <italic>Wnt </italic>signaling pathway through Fz1 could be operating at the presynaptic level, where it could modulate presynaptic structure and function. Consistent with this view, we observed that overexpression of Fz1 induced the clustering of Bassoon, which is a component of the presynaptic cytoskeletal matrix involved in the structural organization of neurotransmitter release sites and is delivered to nascent synapses via vesicles that are detectable early during the formation of synaptic junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, treatment with the CRD of Fz1, the extracellular region of the receptor that binds <italic>Wnt </italic>molecules with high affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], decreased the number of Bassoon puncta per neurite length, indicating that activation of endogenous Fz1-mediated signaling contributes to synapse formation. This effect was not observed when neurons were treated with the CRD of the Fz2 receptor, which has been shown to activate non-canonical <italic>Wnt </italic>pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The specificity of the <italic>Wnt</italic>-Fz interaction remains largely unknown, particularly in vertebrates, because of the large number of <italic>Wnts </italic>and Fzs; however, it is well known that <italic>Wnt-3a </italic>and Fz1 are functional partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. We observed that <italic>Wnt-3a </italic>induced the clustering of Bassoon during the initial stages of synaptic assembly, increased synaptic vesicle recycling and increased the clustering of VGlut1. All these effects were prevented by co-treatment with the CRD of Fz1, suggesting the involvement of <italic>Wnt-3a</italic>/Fz1 signaling. VGluts are vesicular glutamate transporters that mediate the transport of glutamate from the cytoplasm into synaptic vesicles; they are therefore used as specific markers of the glutamatergic phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. VGlut1 is the major isoform in cortex, hippocampus and cerebellar cortex. The increase in the number of VGlut1 clusters indicates that <italic>Wnt-3a</italic>/Fz1 signaling increased the number of excitatory presynaptic puncta. In addition, we observed an increase in the number of SYP clusters, a synaptic vesicle membrane protein that has been associated with synaptic vesicle cycling and was shown to regulate activity-dependent synapse formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Altogether, the increases in vesicle-associated and active zone protein clusters suggest that the <italic>Wnt-3a</italic>/Fz1 pathway modulates the assembly of presynaptic terminals. These pre-synaptic effects were observed after 1 h of treatment, whereas no effect on synaptic contact number was observed. On the other hand, in 24-h experiments, <italic>Wnt-3a </italic>did induce an increase in synaptic contact number that was prevented by co-treatment with the CRD of Fz1. These results suggest that <italic>Wnt-3a</italic>/Fz1 signaling may induce a fast increase in pre-synaptic protein clustering that may precede the increase in synaptic contacts.</p><p>Synaptic vesicles accumulate neurotransmitters and secrete them upon stimulation. The recycling process of synaptic vesicles, including exocytosis, endocytosis and re-exocytosis, is essential for maintaining vesicle pools in the nerve terminals and ensuring normal synaptic transmission. The rate of vesicle turnover and the size of vesicle pools play a role in several forms of synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Recently, we demonstrated that the canonical <italic>Wnt-7a </italic>ligand modulates the recycling and release of synaptic vesicles in functionally mature excitatory synapses <italic>in vitro</italic>. Here, we determined that <italic>Wnt-3a </italic>treatment increased the number of functional presynaptic sites in mature neurons, which is in agreement with previous findings showing that <italic>Wnt-3a </italic>increases the number of active recycling sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>Wnt-3a </italic>increased the efficacy of synaptic vesicle exocytosis in synaptically mature neurons. These results suggest a role for the <italic>Wnt-3a</italic>/Fz1 pathway in presynaptic function in adult neurons. Interestingly, we have observed strong staining for synaptic Fz1 in older neurons (21 to 28 DIV), and the expression of Fz1 in the hippocampus increases gradually until adult stages, supporting the idea that it may have a role in mature synaptic function.</p><p>Thus, our results indicate that <italic>Wnt-3a</italic>/Fz1 signaling modulates the structure and function of the presynaptic compartment. This modulation is probably mediated by the activation of components of the canonical <italic>Wnt </italic>pathway, since Fz1 and <italic>Wnt-3a </italic>have been widely associated with this branch of <italic>Wnt </italic>signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In agreement with this idea, treatment with Dickkopf-1, which promotes internalization of the LRP5/6 co-receptor, required for canonical signal activation but not for non-canonical <italic>Wnt </italic>signaling, resulted in decreased numbers of excitatory presynaptic puncta, indicating that activation of the endogenous canonical pathway contributes to synapse formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, it has been recently shown that Wingless (the <italic>Drosophila Wnt </italic>homolog) directly signals to the presynaptic endings at the <italic>Drosophila </italic>neuromuscular junction, where it activates components of the canonical pathway and locally regulates microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>It has been previously suggested that activation of the canonical and non-canonical pathways differentially modulates pre- and postsynaptic events. The non-canonical ligand <italic>Wnt-5a </italic>induces the clustering of the postsynaptic protein PSD-95 and glutamate receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and <italic>Wnt-7b </italic>increases dendritic branching in cultured hippocampal neurons through Rac and JNK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], whereas the canonical <italic>Wnt-7a </italic>ligand induces presynaptic protein clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and the recycling and exocytosis of synaptic vesicles in cultured hippocampal neurons, and enhances synaptic transmission in adult hippocampal slices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Interestingly, loss of function of the canonical Wnt pathway in the presynaptic region, but not in the postsynaptic muscles of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>neuromuscular junction, affects synaptic differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This is in agreement with our findings, which suggest a presynaptic effect of canonical Fz1/Wnt-3a signaling. It will be interesting to study whether all the synaptic effects of Wnts are modulated by specific receptors whose expression and localization in neurons should be correlated with their functions. We have determined that Fz receptors have varied distributions in neurons and show very different patterns of expression in the developing hippocampus (unpublished data). Thus, the activation of specific <italic>Wnt </italic>signaling pathways would be controlled temporally and spatially during the development of neuronal circuits. In addition, there are alternative <italic>Wnt </italic>receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] that could spatially modulate the activation of the <italic>Wnt </italic>pathway. This is the case for the axonal localization of Ryk receptors in mammals and <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and the Ror2 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], which is highly concentrated in the growth cones of immature neurons and are present throughout the somatodendritic compartment of mature hippocampal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>In summary, we show for the first time the presynaptic distribution of a Fz receptor in mammalian neurons, which could mediate the synaptic effects of the <italic>Wnt </italic>signaling pathway activation. This synaptic localization suggests that there could be a local activation of the <italic>Wnt </italic>pathway at the synapse. In addition, the synaptic expression of some downstream components of the <italic>Wnt </italic>pathway have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], indicating that the machinery required for the local activation of the pathway is present at central synapses. Altogether, these results suggest that <italic>Wnts </italic>binding to synaptic Fz-LRP5/6 could activate the canonical <italic>Wnt </italic>signaling at the synapse and, as a consequence, increase presynaptic inputs and the recycling and release of synaptic vesicles. Our findings give new insight into the mechanisms by which the <italic>Wnt </italic>signaling pathway could modulate the synapse.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Primary culture of rat hippocampal neurons</title><p>Rat hippocampal cultures were prepared as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].
