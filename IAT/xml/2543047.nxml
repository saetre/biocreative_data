Recent findings suggest that epigenetic inactivation of multiple tumor suppressor genes plays an important role in the tumourigenesis of NPC. BRD7 is a NPC-associated bromodomain gene that exhibits a much higher-level of mRNA expression in normal than in NPC biopsies and cell lines. In this study, we explored the role of DNA methylation in regulation of BRD7 transcription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The presence of CpG islands within BRD7 promoter was predicted by EMBOSS CpGplot and Softberry CpGFinder, respectively. Nested methylation-specific PCR and RT-PCR were employed to detect the methylation status of BRD7 promoter and the mRNA expression of BRD7 gene in tumor cell lines as well as clinical samples. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and luciferase assay were used to detect the effects of cytosine methylation on the nuclear protein binding to BRD7 promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that DNA methylation suppresses BRD7 expression in NPC cells. In vitro DNA methylation in NPC cells silenced BRD7 promoter activity and inhibited the binding of the nuclear protein (possibly Sp1) to Sp1 binding sites in the BRD7 promoter. In contrast, inhibition of DNA methylation augments induction of endogenous BRD7 mRNA in NPC cells. We also found that methylation frequency of BRD7 promoter is much higher in the tumor and matched blood samples from NPC patients than in the blood samples from normal individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>BRD7 promoter demethylation is a prerequisite for high level induction of BRD7 gene expression.

The development of this EBV-associated cancer may involve cumulative genetic and epigenetic changes in a background of predisposed genetic and environmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Genome-wide studies have unraveled multiple chromosomal abnormalities with involvement of specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. BRD7 has been recently identified as a bromodomain gene in NPC cells by cDNA Representational Difference Analysis (cDNA RDA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. As a member of the bromodomain genes family, BRD7 may be considered as a component of chromatin remodeling complexes which possess histone acetyltransferase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Together with E1B-AP5, BRD7 functions as an inhibitor of basic transcription in several viral and cellular promoters in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. An alternative role of BRD7 arises from the evidence that BRD7 exhibits a much higher level of mRNA expression in normal nasopharyngeal epithelia than in NPC biopsies and cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Indeed, over-expression of BRD7 in NPC cells can effectively inhibit cell growth and cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase by transcriptional regulation of some key cell cycle related genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Our previous studies revealed the full-length promoter -404/+46 of BRD7 gene, and showed that Sp1 specifically bound to BRD7 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, little is known about the down-expression of BRD7 in NPC cells. In this report, we reveal that DNA methylation results in the suppression of BRD7 expression in NPC cells. BRD7 promoter activity is regulated by methylation of CpG sites with the (G+C)-rich promoter region. DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-Aza-CdR, up-regulates BRD7 expression in NPC 5&#x02013;8F cells. More importantly, the methylation frequency of BRD7 promoter is much higher in the tumor and matched blood samples from NPC patients than that in the blood samples from normal individuals. These results will be helpful in further understanding the transcription-repression mechanism of the BRD7 gene in NPC cells and the establishment of noninvasive approach in the early detection and surveillance of NPC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and antibodies</title><p>Most of the cell lines used in this study was from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

Our previous studies confirmed that the MYC-MAX binding site at -260/-246 was non-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. To investigate whether cytosine methylation within Sp1 binding sites at -353/-337 and -330/-317 interfere with nuclear factor binding, we compared the binding abilities in EMSA reactions of a 20-bp oligomer (nucleotides -353/-337 and -330/-317), which contained the two different Sp1 elements and neighboring cytosines, in unmethylated and methylated forms. First we examined the abilities of unmethylated and methylated -353/-337 to compete with the unmethylated -353/-337 probe in binding to nuclear proteins from 5&#x02013;8F cells. As seen in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, two sequence-specific gel shift complexes were observed with labeled unmethylated -353/-337 as a probe (lane 1 of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), but no complex was formed with labeled methylated -353/-337 as a probe (lane 2 of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In competition EMSA reactions, 50-fold excess of unlabeled unmethylated -353/-337 oligomers were sufficient to completely inhibit complex formation (lane 3, 4 of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), but none of the DNA-protein bands were inhibited by the addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled methylated -353/-337 oligomers (lane 5, 6 of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), suggesting that the unmethylated -353/-337 oligomer binds activated protein. Then we compared the abilities of unmethylated and methylated -330/-317 oligomers to bind nuclear proteins from 5&#x02013;8F cells in EMSA reactions using labeled unmethylated -330/-317 or methylated -330/-317 as probes. A strong and a weak DNA-protein complexes were formed with labeled unmethylated -330/-317 as probes (lane 7 of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), whereas no DNA-protein complexes were formed with methylated -330/-317 as probes (lane 8 of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In the competition assay, both of them were completely inhibited with cold unmethylated -330/-317 (lane 9 of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), but none of them were inhibited by cold methylated -330/-337 (lane 11, 12 of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These results suggested that methylation of cytosines at -353/-337 and -330/-317 significantly inhibited nuclear protein (possibly Sp1) binding to BRD7 promoter.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Cytosine methylation inhibits transcription factor binding to its corresponding binding sites in BRD7 promoter.</bold><italic>Left panel: </italic>Comparison of the nuclear binding capabilities of unmethylated and methylated -353/-337 probes by EMSA.

It exhibits much higher-level of mRNA expression in normal nasopharyngeal epithelia than in NPC biopsies and cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Over-expression of BRD7 in NPC cells is effective in inhibiting cell growth and cell cycle progression of NPC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], but little is known about its down-expression in NPC cells. In this study, we found that BRD7 promoter is hemimethylated in a number of NPC cell lines including HNE1, CNE1, 6&#x02013;10B and 5&#x02013;8F cell lines, and that the methylation status of BRD7 promoter is inversely proportional with BRD7 mRNA expression in NPC cells. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of DNA methylation by 5-Aza-CdR enhanced BRD7 mRNA expression in NPC cells. This is in agreement with previous studies that, indeed, hemimethylation is sufficient to inhibit the expression of p16ink4A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and hMLH1 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] in HCT116 and HT29 cell lines, respectively. Numerous studies have suggested that DNA methylation can suppress gene transcription either by directly inhibiting the interaction of transcription factors with their regulatory sequences or by attracting methylated DNA binding proteins that, in turn, recruit histone deacetylases and histone methyltransferases, resulting in an inactive chromatin structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Our study indicates that DNA methylation represses BRD7 gene transcription by directly inhibiting the interaction of transcription factors with their regulatory elements, as judged by the inability of TSA to potentiate 5-Aza-CdR-mediated expression of BRD7 gene. Sp1 is a well-investigated factor that regulates transcription through specific sequences in G/C-rich promoter regions and is often critical for transcription initiation of TATA-less promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We identified several Sp1 binding sites in BRD7 promoter. Sp1 has high affinity to BRD7 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Sequence analysis of the bisulfite-modified BRD7 promoter demonstrated that cytosine residues flanking functional Sp1 elements at -353/-337 and -330/-317 are methylated. It is known that methylation of specific cytosine residues in or near transcription regulatory motifs can block accessibility of the transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Indeed, we found that methylation of cytosines flanking the -353/-337 and -330/-317 element impaired the ability of nuclear protein to bind the Sp1 binding sites in BRD7 promoter. Moreover, in vitro methylation of BRD7 promoter construct with SssI methylase leads to an almost complete loss of the activity of BRD7 promoter in NPC cell lines. NPC is highly radiosensitive and chemosensitive, but treatment of patients with locoregionally advanced disease remains problematic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. New biomarkers for NPC, including DNA copy number of EBV or methylation of multiple tumour suppressor genes, which can be detected in serum and nasopharyngeal brushings, have been developed for the molecular diagnosis of this tumor. Recent findings suggest that epigenetic inactivation of multiple tumor suppressor genes plays an important role in the tumourigenesis of NPC, such as aberrant methylation of the 5-CpG island of Ras association domain family 1A (RASSF1A), RAR&#x003b2;2, death-associated protein kinase (DAP-kinase), p16 (CDKN2A), p15 (CDKN2B), p14 (ARF) and O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), DLC1, TSLC1, TIG1 in NPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In the present study, among the 18 NPC patients, aberrant promoter methylation of BRD7 gene was detected in 100% of tumor biopsies and matched blood samples of NPC patients. In contrast, weak promoter methylation of BRD7 gene was observed in half of the blood samples from normal, healthy, age-matched individuals, indicating that epigenetic inactivation of BRD7 gene plays an important role in the tumorigenesis of NPC. This is a provocative observation, suggesting that the methylation status of BRD7 promoter may serve as a clinical biomarker for early detection and prescreening patients with clinical symptoms or individuals at high risk as well as in monitoring patients for recurrence. Further studies are necessary to confirm this.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>BRD7 promoter demethylation is a prerequisite for high level induction of BRD7 gene expression.
