We discovered that its morphological activity is controlled by association with RanBP9/RanBPM, a protein involved in transmembrane signaling and a conserved intracellular protein complex. By subcellular fractionation, endogenous muskelin is present in both the nucleus and the cytosol. Muskelin subcellular localization is coregulated by its C terminus, which provides a cytoplasmic restraint and also controls the interaction of muskelin with RanBP9, and its atypical lissencephaly-1 homology motif, which has a nuclear localization activity which is regulated by the status of the C terminus. Transient or stable short interfering RNA&#x02013;based knockdown of muskelin resulted in protrusive cell morphologies with enlarged cell perimeters. Morphology was specifically restored by complementary DNAs encoding forms of muskelin with full activity of the C terminus for cytoplasmic localization and RanBP9 binding. Knockdown of RanBP9 resulted in equivalent morphological alterations. These novel findings identify a role for muskelin&#x02013;RanBP9 complex in pathways that integrate cell morphology regulation and nucleocytoplasmic communication.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>M.

For proteins too large to diffuse through the nuclear pore complex, the regulation of nuclear localization by karyopherins and the Ran gradient are extensively understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mattaj and Englmeier, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pemberton and Paschal, 2005</xref>). However, the functional significance and molecular mechanisms by which proteins that lack classical nuclear localization sequences are trafficked remain poorly studied. The scale of this gap in knowledge is illustrated by the finding that 43% of nuclear-located proteins of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> do not have classical nuclear import motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lange et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, this figure does not include cytoplasmic-located proteins that enter the nucleus in response to specific cues. In this paper, we have identified a novel process involving the cytoplasmic protein muskelin that connects the regulation of cell morphology with nucleocytoplasmic communication.</p><p>Muskelin is an intracellular multidomain protein that was identified in an expression cloning screen for proteins functionally involved in cell spreading responses to the extracellular glycoprotein thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams et al., 1998</xref>). Muskelin is a member of the kelch-repeat superfamily, which includes numerous proteins with roles in actin binding or the regulation of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bork and Doolittle, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Adams et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kobayashi and Yamamoto, 2005</xref>). The muskelin transcript is expressed throughout life in multiple tissues, including skeletal and smooth muscle, the central nervous system, and lung, and is up-regulated in several pathological conditions, including periodontitic neutrophils, ischemic vascular smooth muscle cells, and hyperosmotic intervertebral discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams and Zhang, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kubota et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dhodda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyd et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ledee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prag et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tagnaouti et al., 2007</xref>). The domain architecture of muskelin includes an amino-terminal discoidin-like domain (DD), a central &#x003b1;-helical region with lissencephaly-1 (LIS1) homology (LisH) and C-terminal to LisH (CTLH) motifs, six kelch repeats that form a &#x003b2; propeller structure, and a unique carboxyl-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prag et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Muskelin is unique within the kelch-repeat family: in addition to its unique domain architecture it has a unique phylogenetic distribution, being conserved in the animal, fungal, and protozoal kingdoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Prag and Adams, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prag et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, TSPs are restricted to the animal kingdom. Thus, it is likely that muskelin has additional TSP-independent cellular roles. Although cytoplasmically located and linked functionally to cytoskeletal organization in several cell types, muskelin does not specifically colocalize with F-actin or microtubules and is not a direct binding partner for monomeric or polymerized actin or tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prag et al., 2004</xref>). These findings motivated us to establish how muskelin participates in both TSP-dependent and -independent pathways.</p><p>Muskelin binding proteins reported from yeast two-hybrid screens include EP3&#x003b1; prostaglandin receptor, RanBP9/RanBPM, and the p39 activator of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hasegawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Umeda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ledee et al., 2005</xref>). However, the tissue-restricted expression patterns of EP3&#x003b1; receptor and p39 are not congruent with a general significance for muskelin function in the many tissues where it is expressed. Additional complexity has been suggested by reports that muskelin and RanBP9 are components of a protein complex of unknown function that includes several nucleocytoplasmic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Umeda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kobayashi et al., 2007</xref>). In this paper, we establish that RanBP9 binding is needed for activity of muskelin in cell spreading and is integrated with mechanisms that regulate the distribution of muskelin between cytoplasm and nucleus. These data advance concepts of mechanisms of regulatory communication between the cytoplasm and the nucleus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Endogenous muskelin includes a nuclear pool</title><p>Muskelin is present in cytoplasm, yet a possible nuclear component was suggested by studies of GFP-tagged muskelin, and RanBP9 is present in both cytoplasm and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prag et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denti et al., 2004</xref>). We undertook rigorous subcellular fractionation of C2C12 skeletal myoblasts that have high levels of muskelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams et al., 1998</xref>). Full-length muskelin was present in cytosol and the high-salt nuclear extract that is enriched for nonstructural nuclear proteins such as Ran (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The generality of full-length nuclear muskelin was established by its detection in human aortic smooth muscle cells and human SW1222 carcinoma cells (unpublished data).

A panel of GFP-tagged mouse muskelin domain deletion mutants were developed according to the domain boundaries assigned from bioinformatic analyses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prag et al., 2004</xref>). With the exception of GFP-MKDDLH, the proteins were expressed at similar levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). The subcellular localization of these proteins was examined in COS-7 epithelial cells (muskelin negative), C2C12 skeletal myoblastic cells, and mouse embryo fibroblasts (both muskelin positive), with identical results for all cells. Only results from COS-7 cells are depicted in figures.</p><p>GFP-MK was cytoplasmic in comparison to GFP alone and had the same distribution as endogenous muskelin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, xy and xz images of GFP-MK; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams et al., 1998</xref>). We reported previously that GFP-MKDD (45.5 kD) is below the size threshold for diffusion through nuclear pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prag et al., 2004</xref>). The C-terminal domain alone, GFP-MKC35 (31.2 kD), is also below this threshold and also localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm indistinguishably from GFP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Thus, neither the DD nor the C35 region contains active nuclear localization or export motifs. However, deletion of the C-terminal 35 aa (GFP-MK&#x00394;C35, predicted molecular mass 108.3 kD) resulted in a predominantly nuclear localization in 70% of the transfected cells. GFP-MK&#x00394;C35 was present in the nucleoplasm with exclusion from nucleoli, as established by costaining cells for the nucleolar component fibrillarin and examining confocal images in the xy and xz planes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Because this large protein is above the molecular mass limit for diffusion through the nuclear pore complex, this result suggested the possible existence of nuclear localization or trafficking motifs within MK&#x00394;C35.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Muskelin domain deletion proteins have distinct subcellular localizations.</bold> (A) Localization of GFP-MK and the panel of muskelin domain deletions, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, visualized in fixed COS-7 cells by laser scanning confocal microscopy.

GFP-MKDD and GFP-MKC35 were excluded from this scoring because of their diffusion properties. GFP-MKDDLH (57.3 kD) was excluded because of its poor expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). In the few cells where MKDDLH was detectable, it formed large cytoplasmic puncta (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Analysis of the other domain proteins revealed that GFP-MKDDL, although only 4 kD larger than GFP-MKDD, localized strongly to the nucleus with exclusion from nucleoli (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and not depicted). GFP-MKLHKC (93 kD) was mainly cytoplasmic, whereas GFP-MKLHK (89.4 kD) had pronounced nuclear localization (compare micrographs in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Other domain combinations from the C-terminal region of muskelin were the following: GFP-MKHKC (88.3 kD); GFP-MKHK (84.9 kD); GFP-MKKC (83.9 kD), and the kelch-repeats alone, GFP-MKK (78.8 kD), all distributed uniformly between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Additional experiments with influenza HA epitope-tagged MKDDL (HA-MKDDL; 24.7 kD) confirmed that the strong nuclear localization of MK-DDL was independent of GFP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>).</p><p>These results revealed the following unexpected novel attributes of muskelin: First, its cytoplasmic localization depends on a cytoplasmic restraint, apparently provided by the C35 region; second, this restraint is only active in proteins that also contain the LisH motif (compare the major changes in distribution between WT and &#x00394;C35 or LHKC and LHK, with the very similar distributions of HKC and HK or KC and K; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>); third, in the absence of C35 and the presence of the LisH motif, the major localization is in the nucleus; and fourth, any combination of the HKC domains partitions between nucleus and cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec><title>Muskelin does not undergo chromosome maintenance region 1 (Crm1)&#x02013;mediated nuclear export</title><p>The propensity of GFP-MK&#x00394;C35 to localize to the nucleus could theoretically result either from deletion of a nuclear export sequence (NES) located in C35 or the dysregulated activity of a NES or NLS elsewhere in the protein. Because GFP-MKC35 had the same distribution as GFP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), our experiments did not support the presence of an NES in C35. An active NES would cause GFP to accumulate in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Itahana et al., 2006</xref>). To examine whether a Crm1-dependent NES is present elsewhere within muskelin, GFP-MK&#x02013;expressing cells were treated with leptomycin B to inhibit Crm1-mediated nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fukuda et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wolff et al., 1997</xref>). After treatments from 30 min to 18 h, GFP-MK did not accumulate in the nucleus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, shown for 18-h treatment). Under the same conditions, cyclin B, which undergoes leptomycin B&#x02013;sensitive nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 1998</xref>), became concentrated in the nucleus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Thus, Crm1-mediated nuclear export of muskelin was not apparent.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Muskelin does not undergo Crm1-mediated nuclear export.</bold> (A) Localization of GFP-MK in COS-7 cells treated with solvent (Con) or 10 &#x003bc;g/ml leptomycin B for 18 h.

The LisH motif was identified originally as a short &#x003b1;-helical region at the amino terminus of LIS1 that is present in many other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emes and Ponting, 2001</xref>). In LIS1, the motif contributes to homodimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cahana et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2004</xref>). Although all muskelins contain a central region with predicted &#x003b1;-helical secondary structure, not all contain motifs identified by the simple modular architecture research tool (SMART) database as LisH motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prag et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, the relationship with LIS1 might not be the optimal way to consider the significance of this region of muskelin. We made an unbiased evaluation of the LisH<sub>MK</sub> sequence by the Sequence Logo method, a graphical method that displays the information content of a set of aligned sequences more comprehensively than a standard consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shaner et al., 2003</xref>). The Sequence Logo of LisH from 12 muskelins from chordates, insects, and fungi revealed strong conservation of multiple residues including arginines at positions 3 and 9, clustered basic residues at positions 13&#x02013;16, and certain flanking acidic and neutral residues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>; top). These conserved charged residues distinguish LisH<sub>MK</sub> from the general Sequence Logo for a LisH motif from these eukaryotes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, bottom).</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>The LisH motif of muskelin has nuclear localization activity.</bold> (A) Sequence Logos for the consensus LisH motif of muskelin (LisH<sub>MK</sub>), derived by alignment of LisH motifs from 12 muskelin sequences from vertebrates, insects, and fungi, and the general consensus for a LisH motif, derived by alignment of 120 LisH motifs from vertebrates, insects, and fungi in the SMART database.

To test whether LisH<sub>MK</sub> confers nuclear import on a heterologous protein, we engineered a chimera of LisH<sub>MK</sub> with vinculin, a 1,068-aa 117-kD cytoplasmic protein that associates with F-actin and focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zamir and Geiger, 2001</xref>). Chimerization of vinculin with GFP (adding 265 aa, resulting in a predicted molecular mass of 143.9 kD; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>) did not alter the normal localization of vinculin in cytoplasm, membrane ruffles, and adhesion sites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C and D</xref> [quantification]). In contrast, the addition of LisH<sub>MK</sub> (37 aa, resulting in a predicted molecular mass of 121.5 kD) did not change the expression level of the protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>) yet caused dramatic relocalization to the nucleus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C and D</xref> [quantification]). To establish the role of the LisH<sub>MK</sub> basic cluster in this relocalization, we prepared a double alanine point mutation of positions 13 and 14 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, Sequence Logo). Vinculin-LisHAA had a majority cytoplasmic localization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C and D</xref> [quantification]). These experiments establish that LisH<sub>MK</sub> can independently import a heterologous protein into the nucleus and that an intact basic cluster is necessary for this activity.</p><p>To establish the functional role of LisH<sub>MK</sub> within muskelin itself, we generated the same alanine point mutations in the context of GFP-MK&#x00394;C35 or GFP-MK. Both proteins were expressed at the same level as their control counterparts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>) yet, in comparison to the mainly nuclear location of GFP-MK&#x00394;C35, GFP-MK&#x00394;C35/LisHAA had a dramatically altered uniform distribution between the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, F and G</xref> [quantification]). This result was consistent with decreased nuclear entry of GFP-MK&#x00394;C35/LisHAA, as seen with the vinculin-LisHAA chimera. Counterintuitively, the point mutations in the context of full-length muskelin (GFP-MK/LisHAA) markedly increased the percentage of cells with equivalent cytoplasmic and nuclear muskelin compared with GFP-MK (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, F and G</xref> [quantification]). This unexpected result pointed to the existence of additional intramolecular determinants that regulate muskelin nuclear localization.</p></sec><sec><title>The C35 region regulates the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of muskelin and RanBP9 binding</title><p>On the basis of our results and that C35 acts as a cytoplasmic restraint for full-length muskelin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), we hypothesized that LisH<sub>MK</sub> and C35 cocontrol the localization of full-length muskelin. To explore this concept, we analyzed the sequence of C35 for possible functional motifs. C35 from vertebrate muskelin contains a conserved consensus motif for phosphorylation by proline-directed serine/threonine kinases, T<sub>723</sub>PPK<sub>726</sub> (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801133/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801133/DC1</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 1999</xref>). This is supported by the presence of a conserved consensus cyclin binding motif within the DD (Fig. S1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 1999</xref>). We addressed the putative functional significance of the TPPK motif through point mutations. GFP-MKT723A and GFP-MKT723D were expressed equivalently to GFP-MK (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Whereas GFP-MKT723A had the same cytoplasmic localization as GFP-MK, GFP-MKT723D was mostly nuclear (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, C, D, and G</xref>). The redistribution of GFP-MKT723D was less than that of GFP-MK&#x00394;C35 (45% of GFP-MKT725D cells had nuclear muskelin compared with 70% of GFP-MK&#x00394;C35 cells; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Identical results were obtained in COS-7, C2C12, and A549 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, C and D</xref>; shown for COS-7 only). Proteins mutated in both the TPPK motif and LisH<sub>MK</sub> were also expressed at the same level as GFP-MK (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Both GFP-MKLisHAA/T723A and GFP-MKLisHAA/T723D were predominantly uniformly distributed between the cytoplasm and nucleus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, E&#x02013;G</xref>). However, &#x0003e;10% of GFP-MKLisHAA/T723D&#x02013;expressing cells had elevated nuclear muskelin unlike either GFP-MKLisHAA or GFP-MKLisHAA/T723A cells. 18% of GFP-MKLisHAA/T723A&#x02013;expressing cells had elevated cytoplasmic muskelin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 G</xref>). Thus, whereas functional impairment of LisH<sub>MK</sub> strongly impacts the localization of GFP-MK&#x00394;C35, the LisH mutation counteracts but does not completely abolish the distinct localizations of the TPPK mutants.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Role of the C-terminal TPPK motif in coregulating muskelin localization.</bold> (A and B) Immunoblots demonstrate equivalent expression of GFP-MK and the indicated point mutant proteins.

Minor interaction was detected with the KC domains. There was no coimmunoprecipitation with HK, the kelch repeats, or C35 region alone.

Effective silencing in A549 lung epithelial cells, which have strong expression of muskelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams and Zhang, 1999</xref>) and RanBP9 (Fig. S3 C, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801133/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801133/DC1</ext-link>), was achieved by stable expression of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting human muskelin. 62 clones were established with two different shRNAs, and 3 clones with the largest reductions in muskelin protein (50&#x02013;65% reduction) representing both shRNAs (Fig. S3 A) were used for detailed analyses. Muskelin expression was silenced in C2C12 mouse skeletal myoblasts by an independent methodology: transfection with a chemical siRNA duplex targeting a distinct point on the mouse transcript from the shRNAs to human muskelin.

The cells had altered spreading behavior on fibronectin (FN), with significantly enlarged cell perimeters caused by increased ruffling and protrusive edges (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 B</xref>).

In comparison to A549 control cells, or cells induced for an irrelevant shRNA, RanBP9-depleted A549 cells adherent on FN had enlarged cell perimeters, caused by protrusive morphologies, and altered F-actin distributions particularly at cell edges (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 F</xref>).

The majority of muskelin appears cytoplasmic by immunofluorescence in multiple mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hasegawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prag et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ledee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kobayashi et al., 2007</xref>), yet rigorous subcellular fractionation of endogenous muskelin revealed a nuclear pool. Analysis of the localizations of muskelin domain deletions defined that the distribution of the full-length protein depends on an intricate molecular balance, in which the extreme C terminus provides a cytoplasmic restraint and the LisH motif contains a nuclear localization activity that is largely cryptic under standard conditions. We identify that muskelin interacts with RanBP9 via its HKC domains and that the status of C35 is important in regulating this interaction. We establish that depletion of either muskelin or RanBP9 has an impact on cell morphology and that the morphological activity of muskelin depends on its C-terminal region, which mediates cytoplasmic localization and RanBP9 binding.</p><p>In other proteins with LisH motifs, which include both cytoplasmic- and nuclear-located proteins, the LisH motifs are typically uncharged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emes and Ponting, 2001</xref>). Several have homodimerization activity that is important for protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mikolajka et al., 2006</xref>). Interactions with cytoplasmic dynein or microtubules have been reported and the LisH motif of p220<sup>NPAT</sup> is required for activation of histone transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cahana et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wei et al., 2003</xref>). A small number of proteins in mammalian genomes, including both muskelin and RanBP9, contain contiguous LisH and CTLH motifs. The functional significance of the combined motif is unclear. The presence of highly conserved charged residues within the muskelin LisH-like motif is a unique feature that we demonstrate for the first time here to have functional activity in regulating the nuclear localization of muskelin or a heterologous protein, vinculin. BLASTP searches of GenBank with the muskelin LisH-like motif identify only the LisH motifs from other muskelins. We suggest it is appropriate to redesignate the muskelin LisH-like motif as a nuclear localization motif.</p><p>Despite the potent activity of LisH<sub>MK</sub> in mediating nuclear localization of a heterologous protein, vinculin, under standard cell culture conditions only a small fraction of endogenous muskelin is nuclear located. In the vinculin chimera, the C-terminal&#x02013;located LisH<sub>MK</sub> is very likely constitutively active. The experiments with muskelin mutants revealed that strong nuclear localization of muskelin depends on either deletion of the C terminus or inclusion of a phosphomimetic mutant within the C terminus. Thus, the major cytoplasmic localization of wild-type muskelin likely reflects the dominance of C35-dependent phosphoregulated binding interactions with cytoplasmic proteins over the intrinsic nuclear localization activity of LisH<sub>MK</sub>, with the net result that LisH<sub>MK</sub> activity appears cryptic. These counterbalancing activities remain functional in the LHKC deletion mutant. In addition, we previously identified that the amino-terminal DD and the C-terminal half, comprising the kelch-repeats and C35, bind in trans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prag et al., 2004</xref>). Analogous to signal-activated cytoskeletal regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pufall and Graves, 2002</xref>), molecular self-association might facilitate the autoinhibition of LisH<sub>MK</sub> by C35.</p><p>Muskelin exists in cells as multiple isoelectric variants, some of which result from phosphorylation by protein kinase C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prag et al., 2007</xref>). Our data on the key role of the C35 region and the status of T723 for the subcellular localization of muskelin implicate phosphorylation by a proline-directed kinase as a physiological mechanism to relieve autoinhibition of LisH<sub>MK</sub> activity. Muskelin was reported to physically associate with the p39 activator of cdk5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ledee et al., 2005</xref>); however, we did not detect association of muskelin with p39, cdk5, or cyclins for cdk1 or cdk2 by coimmunoprecipitation (unpublished data). Instead, the presence of both phosphorylation and cyclin binding motifs in muskelin (Fig. S1) implicates a transient substrate interaction with active cdks. Further research will be needed to definitively identify the proline-directed kinases that mediate muskelin phosphorylation at residue T723. We speculate that dynamic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation might be linked to specific cell cycle stages and/or in response to specific environmental cues.</p><p>Another major conceptual outcome of this research is the identification of a novel functional role for the muskelin&#x02013;RanBP9 complex. RanBP9 is an evolutionarily conserved nucleocytoplasmic protein implicated as a scaffold for receptors that network with the Erk1/2 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Umeda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2005</xref>). An emerging consensus places RanBP9 as a multifunctional protein that interacts with the cytoplasmic domains of cell surface receptors including c-Met, integrin &#x003b2; subunit, and L1 adhesion protein. Interactions with nuclear proteins are also indicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunkhorst et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Togashi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kobayashi et al., 2007</xref>). Biochemically, RanBP9 is a component of a large protein complex of unknown function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Umeda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kobayashi et al., 2007</xref>). In this complex, RanBP9 or its <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> homologue, VID30p, associates with several proteins that are conserved from plants to animals. Current data suggest that the complex could be both cytoplasmic and nuclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pitre et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kobayashi et al., 2007</xref>).

We propose that muskelin confers distinct functional capacities on the conserved complex in which RanBP9 participates.</p><p>Our data establish that the status of muskelin C terminus and, thereby, RanBP9 binding are essential for the morphological activity of muskelin. In general, the &#x003b2; propeller structure formed by repeated kelch motifs presents a large domain with multiple faces for binding interactions. There are precedents for intramolecular interactions with C-terminal sequences, and N-terminal sequences may also contribute to correct folding of the kelch-repeat &#x003b2; propeller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Prag and Adams, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Padmanabhan et al., 2006</xref>). For muskelin, C35 is not sufficient to bind RanBP9, yet its status profoundly regulates the physical association with RanBP9, which depends on the HKC domains. We propose that the status of C35 controls RanBP9 binding by the muskelin &#x003b2; propeller and that this is a central mechanism for regulating muskelin localization and, thereby, its morphological activity in cells. We have demonstrated that knockdown of either muskelin or RanBP9 leads to equivalent morphological alterations in which adherent cells adopt protrusive phenotypes. Receptor-bound RanBP9 might concentrate muskelin in proximity to submembranous sites of Erk signal activation and active morphological remodelling. For example, elevated RanBP9 levels alter cell migration behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zou et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Our data also establish that nuclear-located forms of muskelin are impaired for morphological activity. Thus, physiological mechanisms to activate nuclear localization of muskelin can be seen as mechanisms that provide modulation of ECM-dependent cell adhesion and spreading. It is well established that conversion between a protrusive or contractile phenotype has a major impact on cell behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cukierman et al., 2002</xref>). It will be of future interest to establish the functions of nuclear muskelin. The presence of muskelin in the salt-extractable nuclear fraction, but not the nuclear matrix, is suggestive of a regulatory rather than a structural role. One possibility is that nuclear muskelin functions via the RanBP9 complex. RanBP9 is also present in the salt-extractable nuclear fraction and is implicated in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denti et al., 2004</xref>). In initial support, our coimmunoprecipitation data demonstrate that partially nuclear-located muskelin mutants associate efficiently with RanBP9. In conclusion, our data establish the muskelin&#x02013;RanBP9 complex as a novel player in pathways of nucleocytoplasmic signaling and open new directions for understanding how nucleocytoplasmic communication and morphological processes are integrated by cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and materials</title><p>Green monkey kidney COS-7 cells and A549 human lung epithelial cells were grown in DME containing 10% FCS.

The SMARTpool siRNA produced an &#x0223c;45% decrease in muskelin protein at 72 h. Individual siRNA duplexes from the pool were tested for silencing by the same method, and the most active duplex (sense strand sequence 5&#x02032;CAAAGGCGAUGGAGAAGAUUU), producing &#x0223c;70% depletion of GFP-MK, was chosen for depletion of endogenous mouse muskelin.
