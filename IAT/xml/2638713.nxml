Analysis and comprehension of the plant's response to excessive salt and dehydration will aid in the development of stress-tolerant crop varieties. Signal transduction lies at the basis of the response to these stresses, and numerous signaling pathways have been implicated. Here, we provide further evidence for the involvement of phospholipase D (PLD) in the plant's response to high salinity and dehydration. A tomato (<italic>Lycopersicon esculentum</italic>) &#x003b1;-class PLD, LePLD&#x003b1;1, is transcriptionally up-regulated and activated in cell suspension cultures treated with salt. Gene silencing revealed that this PLD is indeed involved in the salt-induced phosphatidic acid production, but not exclusively. Genetically modified tomato plants with reduced LePLD&#x003b1;1 protein levels did not reveal altered salt tolerance. In Arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>), both AtPLD&#x003b1;1 and AtPLD&#x003b4; were found to be activated in response to salt stress. Moreover, <italic>pld</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic> and <italic>pld</italic>&#x003b4; single and double knock-out mutants exhibited enhanced sensitivity to high salinity stress in a plate assay. Furthermore, we show that both PLDs are activated upon dehydration and the knock-out mutants are hypersensitive to hyperosmotic stress, displaying strongly reduced growth.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Phospholipase D</kwd><kwd>High salinity</kwd><kwd>Drought</kwd><kwd>Phosphatidic acid</kwd><kwd>Arabidopsis</kwd><kwd>Tomato</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>High salinity and hyperosmotic stress are major determinants of crop yield throughout the world (Epstein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">1980</xref>, Boyer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">1982</xref>). Hyperosmotic extracellular conditions lead to a loss of turgor that necessitates a response from the plant in order to survive. Plants respond by accumulating intracellular osmolites and reducing water loss, consequently reacquiring their hypertonic state and regaining/maintaining rigidity (Yancey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">1982</xref>, Fricke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2004</xref>, Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2006</xref>). High salinity stress is also detrimental because it disturbs ion homeostasis. High cytosolic sodium concentrations are toxic and plants respond to this condition by removing the sodium from the cytosol, making use of antiporter and co-porter ion channel activity across the plasma and vacuolar membranes. This ion flux causes a loss of homeostasis that has to be actively restored (Kinraide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">1998</xref>, Zhu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">2003</xref>, Yamaguchi and Blumwald <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2005</xref>).</p><p>Salt and drought tolerance depend on complex signaling networks, allowing plants to respond rapidly and efficiently to the stress (Zhu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">2002</xref>). Signal transduction in response to these stresses has become an intensively studied subject because it is believed that a better understanding of this process will lead to the discovery of ways to generate stress-tolerant crops that do not have a fitness penalty (Kasuga et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">1999</xref>, Flowers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2004</xref>, Jakab et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2005</xref>, Yamaguchi and Blumwald <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2005</xref>). Numerous signal transduction pathways have been demonstrated to be activated in response to high salinity and hyperosmotic stress (Munnik and Meijer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2001</xref>, Xiong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2002</xref>, Zhu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">2002</xref>). Our interest focuses especially on lipid signaling events and in particular on phospholipase D (PLD) activity during such processes.</p><p>PLD catalyzes the hydrolysis of structural phospholipids, e.g. phosphatidylcholine, producing phosphatidic acid (PA) and a free head group. Twelve PLD genes are present in the genome of the model plant thale cress (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>), whereas just two PLD genes are found in animals and one in yeast. The plant PLD family can be partitioned into six classes, the &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-, &#x003b3;-, &#x003b4;-, &#x003b5;- and &#x003b6;-PLDs, depending on protein sequence homology and biochemical properties (Qin and Wang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2002</xref>, Wang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">2005</xref>). Roles have been suggested for PLD in numerous processes including vesicular transport, membrane degradation and intracellular signaling. PLD has been reported to be involved in signaling events occurring in response to a multitude of stimuli, e.g. freezing, wounding, plant&#x02013;pathogen interactions, dehydration and salt stress (Wang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2002</xref>, Bargmann and Munnik <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2006</xref>). PA is believed to act as a second messenger in such signaling events; it is generated rapidly and transiently during various stress responses (Munnik <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2001</xref>), functioning in signaling cascades by recruiting target proteins to particular membranes and/or influencing their activity (Testerink and Munnik <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2005</xref>, Wang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">2005</xref>).</p><p>PLD has been linked to high salinity and hyperosmotic stress in several independent studies. Tomato (<italic>Lycopersicon esculentum</italic>) <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic> gene expression increases in cell suspensions treated with NaCl (Laxalt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2001</xref>) and <italic>AtPLD</italic>&#x003b4; expression is induced upon both high salinity and dehydration treatments in Arabidopsis (Katagiri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2001</xref>, Mane et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2007</xref>). PLD is activated in response to hyperosmotic stress and dehydration (Frank et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2000</xref>, Munnik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2000</xref>, Katagiri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2001</xref>). Arabidopsis plants expressing antisense <italic>AtPLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic> have been shown to have increased sensitivity to drought stress (Sang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2001</xref>, Mane et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2007</xref>). Additionally, Arabidopsis <italic>pld</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>3</italic> knock-out mutants have recently been shown to be hypersensitive to both salt and hyperosmotic stress, and <italic>AtPLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>3</italic>-overexpressing plants were found to be more resistant to these stresses (Hong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2008</xref>). Furthermore, PLD has been suggested to be a negative regulator of the biosynthesis of the osmolite proline in Arabidopsis (Thiery et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2004</xref>).</p><p>This investigation examines the role of PLD&#x003b1; and &#x003b4; in high salinity as well as water deficit stress, employing <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic>-silenced tomato cell suspension cultures and plants, in addition to Arabidopsis <italic>pld</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic> and <italic>pld</italic>&#x003b4; single and double knock-out mutants. We demonstrate that both classes are activated by the different stresses and that lack of either AtPLD&#x003b1;1 or AtPLD&#x003b4; leads to decreased tolerance on high salt-containing medium and hyperosmotic medium. Notably, the Arabidopsis <italic>pld</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic>/<italic>pld</italic>&#x003b4; double mutant is even more sensitive than either of the single knock-out mutants. The results and their implications are discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>High salinity-induced PLD activity in LePLD&#x003b1;1-silenced tomato cell suspension cultures</title><p>Plant cell suspension cultures are a useful model system for biochemical research because they can be treated with various conditions in parallel, are homogeneous and can be genetically modified relatively easily and quickly. The tomato cell suspension culture Msk8 has been used in several studies to investigate plant responses to both biotic (Felix et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">1991</xref>, Felix et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">1999</xref>) and abiotic stress (Felix et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2000</xref>). Our laboratory has also used this cell suspension culture in the study of lipid signaling and especially the function of PLD therein (Munnik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2000</xref>, van der Luit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2000</xref>, Laxalt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2001</xref>, Bargmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2006</xref>). <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic> gene expression in Msk8 cultures has been knocked-down using an RNAi (RNA interference) construct targeting the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR); the UTR was used to minimize chances of unspecific cross-silencing (see materials and methods). Five independently transformed cell suspension culture lines were obtained as well as an empty vector control line. RNA blot analysis showed that three of the five lines carrying the RNAi construct were in effect completely silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Analysis of the expression of other PLD isoforms (Laxalt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2001</xref>) indicated that only <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic> was knocked-down in these lines (data not shown). Although there was an apparently truncated transcript visible in line #5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), the LePLD&#x003b1;1 protein was absent and PLD&#x003b1; activity was deficient in all silenced lines (data not shown). Salt treatment induced a clear increase in <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic> expression in the empty vector control and the non-silenced cultures (lines #2 and #4), which was lacking in the silenced lines #1 and #3 and truncate in line #5. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Silencing and salt-induced expression of <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic> in tomato cell suspension cultures. RNA was extracted from independently transformed Msk8 cultures carrying an <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic>-RNAi construct (lines #1&#x02013;5) or an empty control vector (C) that had been treated with 0 or 125&#x02009;mM NaCl for 5&#x02009;h. RNA was separated by gel electrophoresis, blotted and hybridized with a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic> probe. An 18S rRNA probe was used as a loading control.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcn173f1"/></fig></p><p>PA increases in response to salt stress have been reported to be produced by both the PLD and phospholipase C/diacylglycerol kinase pathways (PLC/DGK; Munnik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2000</xref>, Katagiri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2001</xref>). Addition of primary alcohols allows for the distinction of PLD activity from other PA-producing reactions, making use of this enzyme's ability to substitute primary alcohols for water in its transphosphatidylation reaction, whereas non-primary alcohols (e.g. <italic>sec</italic>- and <italic>tert</italic>-butanol) cannot be used in such a reaction (Munnik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">1995</xref>, Dhonukshe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2003</xref>). In this case we used <italic>n</italic>-butanol to visualize PLD activity separately from DGK-generated PA. In the presence of 0.5% <italic>n</italic>-butanol, high salt treatment of cell suspension cultures led to a dose-dependent accumulation of PA and phosphatidylbutanol (PBut; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>a, c). A 15&#x02009;min treatment with 500&#x02009;mM NaCl led to a clear PA accumultion, while treatment with 1 and 1.5&#x02009;M NaCl induced a marked increase in both PA and PBut. A manifest reduced induction of PA and PBut formation was evident when <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic>-silenced lines were treated with high salt concentrations (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>a, c). These results show that LePLD&#x003b1;1 activity is induced in response to high salinity stress in a tomato cell suspension culture. The fact that some salt-induced PLD activity still remained in the silenced cell suspension culture suggests that at least one other PLD is activated under these conditions. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Salt-induced LePLD&#x003b1;1 activity in tomato cell suspension cultures. <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub>-labeled control or <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic>-silenced (line 1) cell suspensions were left untreated, snap-frozen and thawed or treated with an equal volume of cell-free medium supplemented with increasing NaCl concentrations for 15&#x02009;min, either without buffer or buffered with 50&#x02009;mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.5 and 10&#x02009;mM EGTA (TE). Lipids were extracted, separated by TLC and analyzed by phosphoimaging. PA (a and b) and PBut (c and d) were quantified as a percentage of total radiolabeled lipids and are presented in a histogram (salt treatment <italic>n</italic> = 2, min and max values indicated; freeze/thaw <italic>n</italic> = 1).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcn173f2"/></fig></p><p>Reduced PLD activity in the <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic>-silenced line could only be detected after severe salt treatments of &#x02265;1&#x02009;M NaCl. The finding that PLDs are also active upon loss of cell membrane integrity (B.O.R.B. and T.M., unpublished) prompted us to investigate whether PLD activity, after these high salt treatments, might be due to a &#x02018;cell lysis&#x02019; effect. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>b and d, cells that were lysed by snap-freezing and thawing displayed a marked increase in PLD activity, and this activity could be completely inhibited when cells were buffered in 50&#x02009;mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.5 and 10&#x02009;mM EGTA (TE). However, when cell suspension cultures were treated with high salt concentrations in the presence of TE, a PLD activation similar to unbuffered samples was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>a, c). This was true for both control- and <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic>-silenced cell suspension cultures. Correspondingly, vitality staining of salt-treated cell suspension cultures with fluorescein diacetate revealed that no loss of plasma membrane integrity had occurred (data not shown). These results suggest that the increase in LePLD&#x003b1;1 activity in response to high salt concentrations is not due to loss of cell membrane integrity.</p></sec><sec><title>Silencing LePLD&#x003b1;1&#x02009;in tomato plants</title><p>Previously, Laxalt et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2001</xref>) reported that the <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic> transcript was present in all tested tomato plant organs. Here, expression levels were analyzed using a peptide-specific PLD&#x003b1;1 antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>a, LePLD&#x003b1;1 could be detected in roots, stems, petioles, leaves, flowers and fruit of mature tomato plants. This ubiquitous presence of LePLD&#x003b1;1&#x02009;in tomato mirrors AtPLD&#x003b1;1 expression in Arabidopsis, which could also be detected in all tested organs. AtPLD&#x003b1;1 was detected in roots, leaves, stems, flowers and siliques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>b). In order to study LePLD&#x003b1;1 function in the salt tolerance of tomato plants, transgenic lines were generated carrying the same RNAi construct that was used to knock-down <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic> in the Msk8 cell suspension cultures. Several independent transformants were obtained and three lines were selected in which knock-down of <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic> was verified by protein blot analysis of seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>c). Compared with wild-type tomato seedlings (GCR161), the <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic>-silenced plant lines had reduced LePLD&#x003b1;1 protein levels. Nonetheless, a protein band could still be detected in the different silenced lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>c). <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic>-silenced tomato plants developed normally, displaying no obvious growth phenotype. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Silencing <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic> in tomato plants.

Accordingly, seedlings were transferred to new plates containing 0, 125 or 250&#x02009;mM NaCl, and rotated 180&#x000b0; to be able to monitor the new growth. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>a, primary root growth after 24&#x02009;h was greatly reduced on plates with 125&#x02009;mM NaCl compared with control plates, and was completely abolished when seedlings were transferred to plates containing 250&#x02009;mM NaCl. <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic>-silenced plant lines had the same magnitude of growth reduction on plates containing 125&#x02009;mM NaCl as the wild-type control lines and also exhibited complete growth inhibition on 250&#x02009;mM NaCl. These results show that, although it was able to reduce LePLD&#x003b1;1 protein levels, the introduction of a <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic>-RNAi construct did not lead to altered salt tolerance in tomato seedlings. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Salt tolerance and lysis-induced PLD activity in <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic>-silenced tomato plants.

Whereas gene silencing can be incomplete, non-specific and inconsistent, T-DNA insertional mutagenisis gives a higher degree of confidence that the gene of interest is no longer functional and that no other genes are affected. AtPLD&#x003b1;1 and AtPLD&#x003b4; are the two predominant PLD isoforms present in Arabidopsis and, for both, silencing has been linked to altered responses to water stress (Katagiri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2001</xref>, Sang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2001</xref>).

Katagiri and co-workers (2001) went on to show that the activity in dehydrated leaf discs of Arabidopsis plants expressing an antisense <italic>AtPLD</italic>&#x003b4; construct was reduced compared with wild-type plants, implicating this PLD isoform as one of the PLDs activated under hyperosmotic conditions.

This recaptures findings of Laxalt and co-workers (2001), who studied changes in <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic> expression in Msk8 cultures in response to various stresses. These authors found an induction of expression after a 1&#x02009;h treatment with 250&#x02009;mM NaCl. Yet no induction was seen in this period when cells were treated with 400&#x02009;mM sorbitol, suggesting this response was specific to salt and not due to hyperosmotic stress (Laxalt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2001</xref>). Increased PLD activity in response to high salinity has also been previously demonstrated in Msk8 cells (Munnik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2000</xref>). The generation of cell suspension cultures lacking LePLD&#x003b1;1 by the use of an RNAi construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) made it possible to assess whether this PLD contributed to the induced activity. Whereas basal PA and PBut levels were not affected in the silenced lines, the PLD activity induced with salt treatment was markedly less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), indicating that this isoform is indeed responsible for, at least part of, the observed PLD activity. The remaining activity could be attributed to either incomplete silencing or the activity of yet another PLD in response to this treatment. The latter seems more likely, as the silencing seen on the transcript level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) and on the protein level (data not shown) was effectively complete.</p><p>Excessive salt concentrations were needed to make out the induction of PLD activity and the disparity between control and silenced lines, possibly due to the short incubation time (15&#x02009;min) used in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Although the treatment was severe, the observed PLD activity was not due to cell lysis, as demonstrated by the enduring activity seen when the treatment was carried out in the presence of TE buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Cell lysis-induced PLD activity is completely lost in this buffer, as demonstrated by snap-freezing and thawing of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>The fact that <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic> gene expression and enzymatic activity were induced by salt treatment of cell suspension cultures provided an incentive to study the role of LePLD&#x003b1;1 during high salinity stress in tomato plants. The LePLD&#x003b1;1 protein was detected in all organs of mature tomato plants as well as in the seedling stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Introduction of the <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic>-RNAi construct in tomato plants again resulted in gene silencing; however, it did not lead to an absolute attenuation of LePLD&#x003b1;1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) as seen in cell suspension cultures (data not shown). This incomplete silencing could explain the lack of an effect on salt tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>a) and the cell lysis-induced PLD activity, which can be seen in an Arabidopsis <italic>pld</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic> knock-out mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>b). Silencing in planta might also not be as consistent as in the cell suspension cultures, perhaps due to the less efficient 35S-driven expression of the silencing construct in certain cells and tissues (van Leeuwen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2001</xref>). Alternatively, the effects could be explained by the action of another PLD isoform.</p></sec><sec><title>AtPLD&#x003b1;1 and AtPLD&#x003b4; are required for high salinity and hyperosmotic stress tolerance in Arabidopsis</title><p>Extending our research to include Arabidopsis conferred the opportunity to analyze actual null mutants rather than looking at plant material expressing silencing constructs. This gave the assurance of examining the complete knock-out of a gene and no possibility of non-specific or secondary effects of a silencing construct. Furthermore, this extension made it possible to incorporate analysis of another PLD isoform that has been implicated in hyperosmotic stress responses, i.e. AtPLD&#x003b4; (Katagiri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2001</xref>). Notably, a mutant lacking both AtPLD&#x003b1;1 and AtPLD&#x003b4; could be generated and scrutinized along with the two single knock-out mutants.</p><p>Analysis of PLD activity in Arabidopsis leaf discs treated with high salt concentrations demonstrated that both AtPLD&#x003b1;1 and AtPLD&#x003b4; are responsible for PA production in reaction to this treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Yet, even in the double knock-out mutant, there is still a considerable accumulation of PA, indicating that there is one (or more) other route(s) of PA synthesis active under these conditions. Again, severe salt treatments were required to bring out the difference between the wild type and mutants in this assay. Although these are distant from physiological salt concentrations encountered in nature, it is reasonable to believe that these PLD isoforms are activated by high salinity, especially in light of the fact that the knock-out mutants have a growth defect under physiological salt concentrations of 150&#x02009;mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Parallel to the differences in activity discernible between the wild type and the mutants, the double knock-out mutant fared worse on plates supplemented with salt than the wild type or either of the single mutants. These results demonstrate that PLDs are activated in response to salt treatment in plants and that the lack of these PLDs leads to enhanced salt sensitivity, pointing to the importance of these enzymes in the high salinity response.</p><p>Previously, activation of AtPLD&#x003b4; by dehydration in leaf discs has been demonstrated by Shinozaki's lab using antisense <italic>AtPLD</italic>&#x003b4; lines (Katagiri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2001</xref>). However, this study did not find a phenotype for these lines under hyperosmotic stress conditions. Conversely, antisense <italic>AtPLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic> lines have been reported to be hypersensitive to drought (Sang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2001</xref>, Mane et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2007</xref>) but AtPLD&#x003b1;1 has not been shown to be activated by hyperosmotic stress. Here, we demonstrate that both PLD isoforms in Arabidopsis are activated by dehydration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>) and that both are required for an adequate response to hyperosmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). The double <italic>pld</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic>/<italic>pld</italic>&#x003b4; mutant showed a hypersensitivity that is more acute than either of the single mutants alone. As in the PA response to high salt concentrations, a residual PA production could be noted in the double knock-out mutant, once more implicating other routes of PA synthesis.</p><p>Recently, Wang and co-workers (Hong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2008</xref>) discovered a novel PLD that is involved in salt stress, i.e. AtPLD&#x003b1;3. They showed that this isoform is activated upon salt and hyperosmotic stress, and is required for wild-type growth under these conditions. It is not unlikely that this is the PLD isoform that is responsible for the observed residual PA production in the <italic>pld</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic>/<italic>pld</italic>&#x003b4; double knock-out mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). It will be interesting to find out how salt and hyperosmotic stress sensitivity is affected in a <italic>pld</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic>/<italic>pld</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>3</italic>/ <italic>pld</italic>&#x003b4; triple mutant.</p></sec><sec><title>PLD function in high salinity and water deficit stress responses</title><p>This study has made apparent that two separate PLD isoforms, PLD&#x003b1;1 and PLD&#x003b4;, are concomitantly activated by high salinity and hyperosmotic stress in planta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Furthermore, the importance of their involvement in the response to these stresses is emphasized by the fact that both are required for wild-type growth under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). That these two PLDs are not redundant during these responses is demonstrated by the finding that the single knock-out mutants, by themselves, have an effect on PA production as well as stress tolerance and that the double knock-out mutant displays an effect that verges upon additive. There is, however, a remaining accumulation of PA in the <italic>pld</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic>/<italic>pld</italic>&#x003b4; double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), suggesting that another route of PA production is active under these conditions. Theoretically, this could be accounted for by the activity of another PLD or the concerted action of PLC and DGK. The latter is also known to be activated by salt treatment and hyperosmotic stress (Munnik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2000</xref>, DeWald et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2001</xref>, Katagiri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2001</xref>). We have noted a remnant of PBut production in the salt-treated and dehydrated double mutant in the presence of <italic>n</italic>-butanol (data not shown), indicating that at least one other PLD is active under these circumstances. A good candidate would be the newly implicated AtPLD&#x003b1;3, which has been shown to be involved in the response to both of these stresses (Hong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2008</xref>).</p><p>The discovery that the single and double mutants are hypersensitive to growth on 300&#x02009;mM mannitol as well as 150&#x02009;mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) leads one to question whether the effect seen upon high salt treatment is just due to the hyperosmotic stress or whether sodium toxicity also plays a role in the inferior root growth. Several findings argue that PLDs also play a role in the response to sodium toxicity alone. Laxalt and co-workers (2001) found that <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic> (and <italic>LePLD</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>2</italic>) expression is up-regulated in response to salt treatment but not upon hyperosmotic treatment with 400&#x02009;mM sorbitol. In addition, PLD-derived PA has been proposed to regulate the activity of vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases upon high salt treatment (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">2006</xref>). These proton pumps help maintain the proton gradient that drives Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter activity.</p><p>The premise that PLDs play a role in the hyperosmotic stress response is supported by several other independent lines of research. PA has been found to bind Snf-related protein kinases (SnRKs) (Testerink et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2004</xref>), and these signaling components have been shown to be activated in response to hypersomotic stress and high salinity (Munnik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">1999</xref>, Miko&#x00142;ajczyk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2000</xref>, Hrabak et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2003</xref>, Boudsocq et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2004</xref>, Kelner et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2004</xref>, Boudosq and Lauri&#x000e8;re 2005, Burza et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2006</xref>). In addition, several papers have pointed to a role for PA and PLD in stomatal aperture (Jacob et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">1999</xref>, Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2004</xref>, Mishra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2006</xref>, Dist&#x000e9;fano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2007</xref>). Lastly, PLD has also been implicated in Arabidopsis proline biosynthesis (Thiery et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2004</xref>). Together, these findings argue a strong case for PLD function in hyperosmotic and salinity stress signaling. Yet, it must also be taken into account that these stresses induce significant membrane remodeling and rearrangements, and that PLD activity could be physically involved in such membrane alterations (Gigon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2004</xref>). In conclusion, PLDs are key players in the plant response to hyperosmotic stress and high salinity, and their important role warrants further investigation of how, when and where which isoforms are involved. Future analysis will require (i) exploration of the mechanism by which these enzymes are activated; (ii) scrutiny of the activation temporally and spatially, throughout the plant and within the cell, i.e. by looking at reporter constructs, green fluorescent protein-tagged PLDs and fluorescent PA biosensors (as in Vermeer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2006</xref>, van Leeuwen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2007</xref>, Kusuno et al. 2008, Vermeer at al. 2008); (iii) study of the involvement of other PLD isoforms (e.g. PLD&#x003b1;3); and (iv) performing genome-wide transcriptional profiling of the mutants upon exposure to salt and drought stress.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant material</title><p>Tomato plants (<italic>L. esculentum</italic> cv.
