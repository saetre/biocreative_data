TrxR has, together with the principal substrate thioredoxin (Trx), a wide range of functions in cells as a major reducing system for DNA synthesis, redox regulatory functions and antioxidant defense <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Lillig1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Rundlf1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Three mammalian isoenzymes of TrxR have been identified, namely the most abundant predominantly cytosolic TrxR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Tamura1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Zhong1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, mitochondrial TrxR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Lee1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Rigobello1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and TGR (thioredoxin glutathione reductase), the latter mainly expressed in testis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Sun1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Su1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. It should be noted, in the context of this study, that TrxR proteins of other organisms such as bacteria, archaea, plants or insects, are typically not selenoproteins. There is also a lack of consensus for nomenclature of TrxR, sometimes abbreviated as TR or TXNRD, with additional abbreviations occurring, e.g. mitochondrial TrxR2 is the same enzyme as TR3 and TGR has also been called TR2.</p><p>Mammalian TrxR1 is a homodimeric protein with the two subunits arranged head to tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Sandalova1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The first phases of the catalytic cycle involve a transfer of electrons from NADPH via an enzyme-bound FAD to a disulfide in the CVNVGC motif located in the N-terminal domain, which is highly homologous to the mechanisms of glutathione reductase and other members of the enzyme family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Sandalova1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Arscott1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The electrons in TrxR1 are subsequently transferred from the dithiol of the reduced CVNVGC motif to a selenenylsulfide within the C-terminal -GCUG motif of the other subunit in the dimeric holoenzyme. The selenenylsulfide is thereby reduced to a selenolthiol, which can finally reduce the disulfide in the active site of Trx or other substrates of TrxR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Sandalova1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Zhong2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Lee2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Zhong3">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Only forms of the modified protein having an intact N-terminal CVNVGC motif and being able to propagate NADPH oxidase activity could induce cell death. This cell death had both apoptotic and necrotic features and it correlated to an increased intracellular oxidative stress.

With a SecTRAP mass of 55 kDa, 100 pg amounts to about 100,000 SecTRAP molecules per cell, thereby sufficient to provoke a significant increase of cell death in A549 cells, provided that all of the added molecules were indeed delivered into the cells.

We also studied the effects of SecTRAPs in a direct TrxR1 activity assay using DTNB as substrate. In neither case could we find evidence of an inhibition of TrxR1 activity by an excess of SecTRAPs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001846-t002">Table 2</xref>). We then analyzed whether A549 cells could be protected from SecTRAP-induced cell death by the simultaneous addition of an excess of enzymatically active full-length TrxR1. Using co-delivery of 10 ng SecTRAP with 100 ng TrxR, i.e. a 10-fold excess of TrxR over SecTRAP protein, and about 50-fold excess of TrxR added over the endogenous cellular level of TrxR, this indeed counteracted the SecTRAP effect to some extent, while at equimolar amounts or less of TrxR compared to SecTRAP no protection was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001846-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).

We thus initially speculated that a direct prooxidant capacity of SecTRAPs should not be the reason for the cell death induction. However, we here hypothesized that SecTRAPs, still having a functional FAD moiety and an intact N-terminal redox active CVNVGC motif (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1"><italic>Introduction</italic></xref>), could perhaps react with some endogenous cellular substrate or target as a part of the apoptotic mechanism.

We first performed <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis of the NADPH consumption of the C59S/C64S mutant compared to other TrxR1 or SecTRAP preparations, using the quinone substrate juglone, which was previously studied with non-modified TrxR1 and found to be reduced by the N-terminal CVNVGC motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Cenas1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Cenas2">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. As expected the NADPH consumption of the C59S/C64S mutant, either with the Sec residue intact or with this residue derivatized with cisplatin, was negligible. We concluded that the C59S/C64S mutant is, in principle, a completely redox inert form of modified TrxR1. In contrast, a SecTRAP preparation, here represented by the two-amino acid truncated TrxR1 (with an intact N-terminal CVNVGC motif), was found to efficiently reduce juglone, at a rate comparable to that of full-length TrxR1.

In (<italic>B</italic>) Michaelis-Menten kinetics for both full-length (filled symbols) and truncated (open symbols) TrxR1 using juglone as a substrate is demonstrated. In (C) it is shown that Trx1 and juglone compete for the reduction by full-length TrxR1 (filled bars) but that truncated TrxR1 (open bars) can only use juglone and not Trx1 as a substrate. This is illustrated from the initial NADPH consumption rate (0&#x02013;200s) followed at 340 nm with or without Trx1 and insulin (upper panels). After 30 min of reaction, the number of exposed free thiols was determined (lower panels) in order to estimate to which extent the electrons from the NADPH oxidation were passed on to Trx1 and subsequently to insulin.

Concomitantly, superoxide formation was detected at 480 nm with the adrenochrome method using 2 mM epinephrine (filled symbols).

SecTRAPs however, can only reduce juglone and not Trx1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001846-t003">Table 3</xref>). We therefore wished to analyze whether reduction of juglone by SecTRAPs could occur also in the presence of Trx1, which would possibly suggest that SecTRAPs can react with alternative substrates also in a cellular context where Trx1 would be present. We found that Trx1 at a physiological concentration (10 &#x000b5;M) could lower the juglone reduction by truncated TrxR1 using low concentrations of juglone (5 &#x000b5;M or less). However, 10 &#x000b5;M Trx1 had no effect on the reduction of 50 &#x000b5;M juglone by truncated TrxR1, as demonstrated by the same NADPH oxidation rate either in the presence or absence of Trx1 and its disulfide substrate insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001846-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, upper panels, white bars). It should be noted that this activity was dependent upon direct juglone reduction by the SecTRAP protein, since this truncated enzyme has no activity with Trx1. This fact was also illustrated by the lack of Trx-coupled insulin reduction in the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001846-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, lower left panel, white bars). The properties of the SecTRAP protein were in sharp contrast to those of full-length TrxR1, which has a preference for Trx1 as substrate, being essentially unaffected by addition of low concentrations of juglone in the presence of Trx1 and insulin. This was clearly illustrated by the channeling of electrons from NADPH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001846-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, upper left panel, black bars) to production of free insulin-derived thiols, formed through insulin disulfide reduction by Trx1 in the reaction propelled by the TrxR1 enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001846-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, lower left panel, black bars). However, the Trx1-reducing activity of full-length TrxR1 was noticeably impaired at the higher concentration of juglone (50 &#x000b5;M) through the effects of juglone as inhibitor and a subversive substrate for the enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Cenas1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. These results collectively suggested to us that TrxR1 preferentially reduces Trx1 when present, whereas SecTRAPs albeit not being able to reduce Trx1, can still be active as oxidoreductases able to reduce other substrates than Trx1. As we found next, this activity can confer notable prooxidant properties, that also correlate to the cytotoxic effects of SecTRAPs.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Superoxide is produced during reations with juglone</title><p>We detected superoxide production during juglone reduction, by either SecTRAPs or TrxR1, as assessed with the adrenochrome method.

Those findings in combination with the intracellular ROS production triggered by SecTRAPs, as shown by DCF fluorescence and the protection from cell death by antioxidants, collectively show that the selenoprotein TrxR1, a key player in antioxidant defense, can be converted into a potent prooxidant killer of cells when its highly reactive Sec residue becomes compromised.</p><p>The notion that SecTRAPs trigger cell death, at least in part, by a provoked oxidative stress is compatible with several earlier observations.

It should furthermore be noted that the protein surface charge distribution patterns of GR and TrxR1 are strikingly different from each other; this was suggested to explain the different substrate specificities between these two enzymes, even upon removal of the selenolthiol motif in TrxR1, although the two enzymes are otherwise closely related in overall domain configuration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Urig2">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>. This difference may be part of the explanation why TrxR1, or SecTRAPs, are about one order of magnitude more efficient than GR in reduction of several quinone substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Cenas1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our findings that SecTRAPs can be potent prooxidant enzymes, although they completely lack the native Trx1 reducing capacity of TrxR1, could explain much of their toxic properties. We have not yet identified any cellular endogenous substrate(s) that interact with SecTRAPs. However, the findings with the model substrate juglone clearly demonstrated that SecTRAPs have the capacity to become potent superoxide-producing NADPH oxidases, also in the presence of physiological concentrations of Trx1, provided that intracellular substrates exist at sufficient concentration together with which SecTRAPs can propagate prooxidant reactions. The prominent oxidative stress seen upon treatment of cells with SecTRAPs, as illustrated by the increased DCF fluorescence and the protective effects of antioxidants, suggest that such intracellular substrates exist.</p><p>The observation that SecTRAPs could propagate intracellular ROS production and cell death upon the combinatory treatment with ascorbic acid and &#x003b1;-tocopherol, whereas either of the two compounds alone protected the cells, was an intriguing finding. It can likely be explained by the redox properties of these compounds in connection with the properties of SecTRAPs and the finding further supports our view that directly SecTRAPs propagate oxidative stress, coupled to some hitherto unidentified cellular substrate(s). It should be noted that antioxidant compounds, like ascorbate and &#x003b1;-tocopherol, all have the inherent capacity to act as prooxidants because they easily form radical compounds, with their cellular effects thereby being a matter of concentration and the microenvironment within which they act. If SecTRAPs promote the initiating oxidative event and ascorbic acid and &#x003b1;-tocopherol are present at high equal concentrations, this may potentially first lead to the formation of ascorbyl radicals, which in turn may react with &#x003b1;-tocopherol to form tocopheryl radicals. Thereupon the electrons can be transferred to subsequent cellular compounds, induce propagation of radical formation and give rise to the observed oxidative stress. This potential reaction, from SecTRAPs over ascorbate to tocopheryl radical formation, should be amplified when &#x003b1;-tocopherol is added concomitantly with ascorbic acid and SecTRAPs. If ascorbic acid alone is instead added in excess, two ascorbyl radicals that are formed through the prooxidant effects of SecTRAPs, could easily dismutate into one ascorbate and one dehydroascorbate molecule, thereby acting as chain-breaking antioxidant. If &#x003b1;-tocopherol alone is added in excess, this may potentially protect cellular lipids from oxidative damage, but SecTRAPs are probably less likely to induce tocopheryl radicals by direct interactions, while in contrast a direct reaction with ascorbic acid is indeed plausible. Interestingly, dehydroascorbate formed from the ascorbyl radical dismutation can be reduced back to ascorbic acid by TrxR1. For further discussions on the web of interactions and reactions between TrxR1, ascorbic acid and &#x003b1;-tocopherol, see an earlier review on the subject <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Nordberg1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we used a two-amino acid C-terminally truncated form of TrxR1 as the major model protein for studies of SecTRAPs. Such truncated TrxR1 could perhaps be produced in certain cells during translation by a truncation at the Sec-encoding UGA codon. However, the interplay between UGA-directed Sec insertion and translational termination is far from fully understood in mammalian cells and the UGA-truncated form of TrxR1 has not yet been conclusively demonstrated in analyses of selenium-starved tissue. Only direct demonstration of the two-amino acid truncated TrxR1 species purified from selenium-depleted tissues would answer whether such protein species may be formed under natural conditions of selenium depletion. To our knowledge, no studies have yet been published demonstrating endogenous production of the truncated enzyme in mammalian tissues. Evidence for production of a truncated TrxR1 species was reported for NCI-H441 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Yarimizu1">&#x0005b;71&#x0005d;</xref>, while in other liver or kidney-derived cell lines clear evidence for such production at selenium depletion could not be seen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Crosley1">&#x0005b;72&#x0005d;</xref>. The toxicity of SecTRAPs to A549 and HeLa cells could possibly explain prior difficulties encountered in attempts to establish a stable TrxR1-overexpressing cell line. After several unsuccessful attempts in different tumor cell lines (Jurkat, HeLa, U1285), an overproducing stable transfection was finally achieved in HEK293 cells, as reported elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Nalvarte1">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>, which is a cell line that we found to be resistant to SecTRAPs. It is possible that the difficulty to stably overexpress TrxR in several different cell lines, may have been due to the fact that under such overproducing conditions, UGA-truncated forms of TrxR1 (i.e. SecTRAPs) are formed, while the HEK293 cells in which the overproduction was successful are resistant to SecTRAPs by a mechanism yet to be elucidated. Although it is not clear whether cells or tissues may become exposed to truncated TrxR1 under certain cases of selenium limitation, formation of SecTRAPs can nonetheless occur through the direct derivatization of the Sec residue of TrxR1 by electrophilic compounds, either endogenously produced in cells, exposed in the form of xenobiotics or environmental contaminants, or purposely given in the form of alkylating drugs.</p><p>Here we showed that SecTRAPs, devoid of the natural Sec-containing active site of TrxR1, could still have their FAD cofactor efficiently reduced by NADPH. Upon reduction by NADPH, SecTRAPs could also form the charge-transfer complex between the FAD moiety and the CVNVGC redox active disulfide/dithiol-containing site. The fact that the cell-killing SecTRAP properties evidently depend upon an intact FAD/CVNVGC-containing redox active motif and correlate to a prooxidant capacity has additional implications. A potential drug or compound that would inhibit the redox activity of this N-terminal motif, and thereby block the reductive half reaction of TrxR1-derived protein, would according to his notion <italic>not</italic> give rise to the formation of SecTRAPs. However, such potential drugs may still have major effects on cellular function as a result of the lowered capacity of the thioredoxin system, reminiscent to the effects of knocking down TrxR1 expression by siRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Cassidy1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Yoo2">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Trigona1">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Gan1">&#x0005b;75&#x0005d;</xref>. This emphasizes the delicate balance between different cellular effects that can be governed by either an intact thioredoxin system, by a loss of thioredoxin reductase activity, or by the formation of SecTRAPs. This concept is summarized in the scheme shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001846-g009">Figure 9</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0001846-g009" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001846.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Model for the formation and function of SecTRAPs.</title><p>We propose that during most conditions of normal cell growth the Sec residue in TrxR1 is intact and the role of this enzyme is thus to sustain the many cellular functions of the thioredoxin system. This activity is dependent upon the redox active C-terminal Sec-containing active site in TrxR1. SecTRAPs may however be formed from TrxR1 if its Sec residue becomes compromised, either by removal or by derivatization with electrophilic compounds, while the FAD and N-terminal redox active CVNVGC motif of the enzyme are kept intact. SecTRAPs lack the Trx reducing activity of native TrxR1 but become potent inducers of cell death by a gain of function. This cell death is, as shown in the present study, rapid, does not require induction of protein synthesis, involves production of reactive oxygen species and is prevented by caspase inhibitors. If, on the other hand, both the CVNVGC motif and the C-terminal selenolthiol motif become inactivated, e.g. by certain types of TrxR1 inhibitors or if the overall expression of TrxR1 is diminished in cells, impaired cell function or cell death may still occur. In such cases the cellular consequences would however not be due to a gain of function in derivatives of TrxR1, but rather to hampered functions of the complete cellular thioredoxin system.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001846.g009"/></fig><p>The pronounced protection of the cells by inhibitors of caspase-3/7 or caspase-2, and partially caspase-8, indicated that the apoptotic machinery was required for cell death to occur in connection with the oxidative stress triggered by SecTRAPs. The general features of the cell death found here, with both caspase-3 and caspase-8 involvement and signs of both apoptosis and necrosis, are in fact typical for cell death induced by oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Ryter1">&#x0005b;76&#x0005d;</xref>. Regarding caspase-2, recent findings have shown that this caspase when activated can induce apoptosis by directly promoting the release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> from mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Enoksson1">&#x0005b;77&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Robertson1">&#x0005b;78&#x0005d;</xref>. We have attempted to detect mitochondrial release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> after treatment with SecTRAPs, however with inconclusive results. It should also be noted that it was recently shown that Ac-VDVAD-CHO, commonly used as caspase-2 inhibitor, may also inhibit caspase-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Schweizer1">&#x0005b;79&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, we also studied the effects of a caspase-9 inhibitor (z-LEHD-fmk) but with intermediate and inconclusive results (not shown). Therefore, taken together we do not know at present to which extent the SecTRAP-induced cell death involves caspase-2 activation, release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> from the mitochondria or caspase-9 activation. We have been limited in our analyses by the low amount of cells used in experiments employing the <italic>BioPORTER</italic> protein delivery approach. We have attempted to construct stably transfected HeLa cells for conditional overexpression of the two-amino acid truncated TrxR1 but were not successful to do so, potentially because of the toxic effects of a low basal expression of truncated TrxR1 (S. Prast-Nielsen and E. Arn&#x000e9;r, unpublished results). Future studies with other approaches are clearly needed for more detailed analyses of signaling events such as cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release from the mitochondria or direct detection of caspase activation.</p><p>Based upon the results presented in this study, we conclude that SecTRAPs, produced by C-terminal truncation of TrxR1 or by chemical derivatization of its Sec residue, are potent inducers of a cell death that involves both apoptotic and necrotic features in line with increased intracellular ROS production. The effect was rapid and did not require induction of protein synthesis. The properties of SecTRAPs obviously add another level of complexity to the thioredoxin system. It is becoming increasingly evident that the thioredoxin system is of major importance for cancer development and as a target for anticancer therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Gromer1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Urig1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001846-Arner1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. Within that context, it is plausible that formation of SecTRAPs may play a role for some of the observed effects e.g. seen upon use of alkylating drugs in cancer treatment. Further studies are needed in order to fully understand both the exact molecular mechanisms by which SecTRAPs trigger apoptosis in cells and the potential physiological or clinical importance of the formation of these proteins.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Olle Rengby for providing the ORaa(DE3) bacterial strain, Qing Cheng for help with the PAO sepharose
