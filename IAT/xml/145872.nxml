We have screened for proteins binding to the AT-rich repeat region in plasmids F, R1 and pSC101 using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay with PCR-amplified DNA fragments from the origins. The IciA protein, which is known to bind to the AT-rich repeat region in the Escherichia coli origin of chromosome replication, oriC, was found to bind to the corresponding region from plasmids F (oriS) and R1, but not to pSC101. DNase I footprint analysis showed that IciA interacted with the AT-rich region in both F and R1. When the IciA gene was deleted, the copy number of plasmid F increased somewhat, whereas there was no major effect on the replication of pSC101 and R1, or on the E. coli chromosome.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
