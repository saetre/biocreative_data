The ability of axons to navigate their environment and find their appropriate targets has been divided into several consecutive steps &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. First, neurons sprout neurites, one of which subsequently becomes an axon and extends. Axons then navigate through a maze of negative and positive cues to their appropriate targets. Mistargeted axons must be retracted or degraded. Finally, axons recognize their targets and switch from extension to branching to make functional synaptic contacts. The processes of growth cone formation, axon pathfinding, target recognition, and synapse formation have received much attention. Not surprisingly, these complex processes require a large number of genes and pathways &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>That extension of axons, per se, may be regulated independently from pathfinding is suggested by several observations. Most pathfinding mutants cause axons to change their navigational routes rather than arrest prematurely &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Conversely, mutations in genes like <italic>short stop, chickadee, dfmr1,</italic> and the small GTPases <italic>Rho, Rac,</italic> and <italic>Cdc42</italic> have been shown, in various contexts, to either antagonize or promote neurite extension &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b010">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. The Rho GTPases have been demonstrated to act as signal transducers in a number of signaling pathways &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d; and play well-documented roles in controlling neurite sprouting, extension, retraction, and guidance in vertebrates and invertebrates &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Despite important advances in our understanding of the genetic control of axon projection, much remains to be learned. In particular, it not yet clear how various simultaneous, and sometimes antagonistic signals are integrated to result in the appropriate extension or retraction of an axon. Furthermore, whether or not neuronal activity is required for neurite extension during development has been debated &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. Finally, it is interesting to investigate how the behavior of individual axons translates into stereotyped wiring patterns of whole populations of neurons.</p><p>We studied a group of cells in the fruit fly brain called the dorsal cluster neurons (DCNs). DCNs are ~40 clustered neurons located in the dorso-lateral central brain. They are part of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> adult visual system and innervate the optic lobes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. DCN axons form a highly stereotyped pattern of connections between two areas of the fly optic lobes called the lobula and the medulla. This regular pattern enabled us to perform a systematic genetic dissection of the requirements for, and interactions of, signal transduction pathways during connectivity patterning in the adult fly brain. We carried out a candidate gene search for modulators of the normal pattern of DCN axon projections within the medulla. We found that Wnt and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signals modulate Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation levels, and it is therefore likely that JNK activity, via Rac1, regulates the extension and retraction of DCN axons.</p><p>Wnt signaling plays important roles in many cellular process including cell fate, adhesion, and polarity in various developmental contexts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b020">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Recently, Wnt signaling has been found to play a role in axon guidance and fasciculation in studies of cultured neurons, flies, and vertebrates &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b024">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;. Similarly, the FGFR (fibroblast growth factor receptor) pathway is essential for various developmental processes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d; and has been shown to interact with Wnt signaling in limb development, inner ear development, neural induction, and cell migration &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b028">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, neurite outgrowth assays and injury recovery models suggest that growth factors like FGF and nerve growth factor regulate neurite outgrowth, guidance, and regeneration in culture &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b031">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. However, whether such effects are specific to neurite outgrowth or secondary to the enhanced survival and growth effects is unclear. The JNK pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b036">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d; plays a role in cell movement and cell death, possibly by regulating Actin dynamics &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We dissected the roles of these pathways and their interactions during axonal extension. Our data suggest that DCN axons extend in a JNK-dependent manner. Upon arriving at their target area, these axons are exposed to a FGF Branchless (Bnl) retraction signal requiring the Breathless (Btl) FGFR. Btl signaling results in the activation of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> Rac1, in turn suppressing JNK activity. While most axons begin to retract, 11&#x02013;12 are stabilized by a Wnt-mediated signal acting via the Frizzled (Fz) receptors and their adaptor protein Disheveled (Dsh). Wnt signaling results in the suppression of Rac1 activity, thus permitting the JNK extension pathway to remain active. Single-cell mutant analyses suggest that these signals act cell-autonomously. In summary, the adult pattern of DCN connectivity is established, at least in part, through the Rac1/JNK-mediated integration of two simultaneous antagonistic signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Development of the DCN Connectivity Pattern</title><p>The DCNs are a group of ~40 neurons located dorso-laterally in each brain hemisphere. They are higher-order visual system neurons which innervate the lobula and the medulla neuropils of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> optic lobes. Their innervation of the optic neuropil originates from a supra-esophageal commissure clearly visible in third instar larval (L3) brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The DCNs form extensive branches in the adult lobula. In the medulla, branches originate from 11&#x02013;12 parallel axons which have crossed the second optic chiasm between the lobula and medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). DCN axon extension into the optic lobes takes place during metamorphosis between L3 and the adult stages, making the DCNs an attractive model in which to study the development and control of axon extension directly in the developing brain.</p><p>We first characterized the development of this pattern between L3 and adult stages. The DCNs can be visualized and specifically perturbed at these stages through the use of the <italic>atoGal4-14a</italic> line, a UAS-controlled reporter gene and any other transgene of interest. This Gal4 line is expressed in the DCNs beginning in early L3 shortly before they begin to extend their axons toward the optic lobes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d; and continues to express in the DCNs during metamorphosis and into adult life. Importantly, this driver is not expressed in the DCNs during early larval development when their precursors are dividing or during the formation of their commissure. Therefore, the use of the <italic>atoGal4-14a</italic> driver enabled us to evaluate candidate genes acting specifically during DCN innervation of the optic lobes. Transgenes encoding the membrane-associated CD8-green fluorescent protein (GFP) or cytoplasmic &#x003b2;-Galactosidase (&#x003b2;-Gal) were used to visualize DCN axons. In L3 brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) DCN axons have already formed a commissure that begins sprouting growth cones bilaterally toward the developing optic lobes at puparium formation (PF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g001">Figure 1</xref>C&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g001">1</xref>H). At approximately 20&#x00025; PF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g001">Figure 1</xref>E), contralateral DCN axons innervate the lobula and form a dense front of fibers at the junction between the lobula and the medulla. At least 30 of these axons project toward the medulla by approximately 30&#x00025; PF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g001">Figure 1</xref>F). Many of these axons have disappeared by 45&#x00025; PF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g001">Figure 1</xref>H). Between 50&#x00025; and 70&#x00025; PF, the number of axons crossing the optic chiasm between the lobula and medulla reaches the final number still detectable after eclosion (11&#x02013;12 with an average of 11.7 axons/hemisphere; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g001">Figure 1</xref>I).</p><p>Axons that do not remain in the medulla might either retract to the lobula or degenerate in place as has been demonstrated to occur during the neuronal remodeling in other systems &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. To test this possibility, we carefully examined small clones of wild-type DCN axons at various stages during pupal brain development. We did not find any evidence for axonal blebbing or fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g001">Figure 1</xref>J). In addition, we generated and evaluated more than 30 wild-type single DCN clones for axon fragment formation but were not able to detect such fragments. These data support the likelihood that the DCN axons that do not innervate the medulla retract back to the lobula.</p><p>Wild-type adult flies show little variation in the number of DCN axons extending between the lobula and medulla: 71.4&#x00025; of the flies examined had 12 axons/hemisphere, whereas 28.6&#x00025; had 11 (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 28). To analyze DCN axons in greater detail, we further examined wild-type DCN clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g002">Figure 2</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g002">2</xref>F). Analysis of single-cell DCN clones generated via Flipase (FLP) mediated recombination using either the FLP-out &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d; or MARCM (mutant analysis using a repressible cell marker) techniques &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d; shows that contralateral commissural DCN axons have two alternative choices. The majority, corresponding to axons which retracted during pupal development, branches within the lobula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g002">2</xref>C). The rest of the axons extend toward the medulla and form terminal branches in the distal medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g002">2</xref>E). Quantitative analysis of single-cell clones reveals that approximately 63&#x00025; (12/19) of the wild-type DCN axons remain in the lobula and 37&#x00025; (7/19) cross the second optic chiasm to the medulla. The ipsilateral branches of both kinds of clones remain within the lobula and form dense, dendrite-like trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g002">2</xref>F). That these contralateral extensions are likely axons is suggested by three observations. First, it has been shown that &#x003c4;-LacZ, a fusion protein frequently used as an axonal marker, localizes to these neurites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Second, the terminal branches of these neurites have a typical bouton-like morphology, suggesting they bear presynaptic apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). Finally, we find that the presynaptic marker, nSyb-GFP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;, accumulates specifically in these terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g002">Figure 2</xref>G&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g002">2</xref>I). Using different markers, a recent report &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d; comes to very similar conclusions.</p><p>Taken together, these data provide the following picture of the evolution of the DCN connectivity pattern during adult brain development. Initially all DCN axons extend toward the developing medulla. However, during metamorphosis only 11&#x02013;12 axons are stabilized along specific paths while the intervening axons retract. This raises a number of questions. First, what are the roles of intrinsic versus extrinsic factors in DCN axon outgrowth? Second, is the choice between extension and retraction determined strictly cell-autonomously or do extrinsic factors play roles? If the latter is correct, what signals cause most, if not all of the DCN axons to extend early in development? Third, what signals cause many of these axons to retract later? Fourth, how are the 11&#x02013;12 axons crossing the optic chiasm at the end of pupal development stabilized? Finally, how are these different signals integrated to produce the adult pattern?</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Identifying Pathways Required for DCN Extension and Retraction</title><p>To begin to address these questions we used a candidate gene approach to search for modifiers of the number of DCN axons crossing between the lobula and the medulla (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040348-t001">Table 1</xref>). We assayed for statistically significant changes in the number of DCN axons spanning the optic chiasm in the absence of obvious effects on the structure of the DCN commissure, DCN axon guidance, cell number, position, and overall morphology. To perform the screen, we initially used the <italic>atoGal4-14a</italic> driver together with UAS::CD8-GFP and UAS-driven transgenic inhibitors of key signal transduction pathway members. We selected transgenes that specifically result in well-characterized loss of function phenotypes for the genes they target.</p><p>We found that DCN axon extension was not affected by blocking neuronal activity via expression of an activated potassium channel &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d; or by blocking vesicle recycling through inhibition of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> Dynamin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040348-t001">Table 1</xref>). These data suggest that neuronal activity is not required for DCN axon extension, in agreement with largely normal brain development observed in mice lacking Munc18&#x02013;1, a protein essential for neurotransmitter release &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.

However, blocking JNK activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d; or the Fz2 receptor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d; significantly decreased the number of DCN axons crossing between the lobula and the medulla, suggesting that these genes are required for DCN axon extension, stabilization, or both.

To test this, we evaluated the amount of phosphorylated JNK relative to total JNK levels in fly brains by Western blot analysis using phospho-JNK (P-JNK) and pan-JNK specific antibodies. We then determined if Dsh is indeed required for increased levels of JNK phosphorylation. We find that <italic>Dsh<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g008">Figure 8</xref>H, lane 3) show a 25&#x00025; reduction in P-JNK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g008">Figure 8</xref>H', <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 3) consistent with a stimulatory role for Dsh on JNK signaling. The reduction caused by loss of <italic>Dsh</italic> function is reversed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g008">Figure 8</xref>H, lane 4), to 150&#x00025; of wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g008">Figure 8</xref>H'), when the amount of Rac is reduced by half, consistent with a negative effect of Rac on JNK signaling downstream of Dsh. These data support the conclusion that Dsh and Rac interact to regulate JNK signaling by modulating the phosphorylated active pool of JNK.</p><p>Taken together, our data suggest that during brain development DCN axons extend under the influence of JNK signaling. A non-canonical Wnt signal acting via Fz and Dsh ensures that JNK signaling remains active by attenuating Rac activity. In contrast, activation of the FGFR activates Rac1 and suppresses JNK signaling. These data support a model whereby the balance of the Wnt and FGF signals is responsible for determining the number of DCN axons that stably cross the optic chiasm. To test this model, we reduced FGFR levels, using the dominant-negative <italic>btl</italic> transgene, in <italic>dsh<sup>1</sup></italic> heterozygous flies. We found that simultaneous reduction of FGF and Wnt signaling restored the number of axons crossing the optic chiasm to almost wild-type levels (10.2, with 33&#x00025; of the samples indistinguishable from wild-type; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g008">Figure 8</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g008">8</xref>I), suggesting that the two signals in parallel, to control the patterning of DCN axon connectivity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we investigated how axon extension and retraction contribute to the patterning of neuronal connections using the visual system of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> brain as a model. The <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> brain is well suited for these analyses in that it is both highly complex and amenable to genetic analysis. In addition, an increasing number of well-defined and specifically marked neuronal populations allow the in vivo visualization of complex events during brain development. One such population, the DCNs, represents an attractive system in which to investigate these issues due to their stereotypical and readily detectable axonal projection pattern. This regular pattern allows quantitative assessment of the effects of specific mutations on an entire group of related neurons, at the same time providing single axon resolution. We find that the development of the adult pattern of DCN connections does not require neuronal activity, suggesting that it is specified by an intrinsic DCN genetic program and extracellular cues.</p><p>Our work reveals a regulatory network composed of at least two signaling pathways, Wnt and FGF, which feed into common downstream effectors, Rac and JNK, which serve to regulate the dynamic behavior of axons during development. Members of these pathways localize to the DCNs or their target regions during the DCN axon remodeling stages, suggesting that the genetic results reflect their roles there. Axons extending to the medulla in the mutant backgrounds we examined appear to project along normal paths. Thus, the Wnt-FGF regulatory network described here appears to mediate axonal extension and retraction, but not axon guidance, suggesting that these aspects of neuronal connectivity can be regulated independently.</p><p>Together, the data suggest a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040348-g009">Figure 9</xref>) in which extending axons encounter competing signals that cause them to retract or to continue to extend and stabilize in their specific paths. Analysis of single-cell mutant clones in otherwise wild-type backgrounds indicates that JNK signaling is required cell-autonomously for initial axon outgrowth. Inhibition of JNK signaling during later phases of axonal extension using a dominant-negative transgene prevents axons from extending toward their targets. JNK signaling therefore appears to be required at these two, and perhaps all stages of DCN axon outgrowth.</p><p>Signaling by Wnt proteins via Fz receptors and Dsh, provides an important stabilization signal, likely by mediating the continued activation of JNK. Wnts have recently been shown to be involved in the establishment of neuronal polarity that orients anterior-posterior axon outgrowth &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b068">68</xref>&#x0005d;. Initial DCN axon outgrowth occurs normally in <italic>wnt</italic> mutants suggesting that either other Wnt ligands or non-Wnt pathways are involved. Single-cell MARCM analyses indicate that the <italic>fz/fz2</italic> receptors, which we find to interact genetically with <italic>wnt5,</italic> are required cell-autonomously in the DCNs.</p><p>Wnt5 acts to repulse a subset of embryonic CNS axons, apparently independently of Dsh and the Fz receptors, via the RYK tyrosine kinase receptor family member Drl &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. One way to reconcile those findings with these presented here is to propose that the specific receptor interacting with Wnt5 determines axonal behavior. Support for this hypothesis comes from the recent observations that purified Wnt5a protein can either activate or inhibit &#x003b2;-Catenin signaling, depending on which of the two receptors it interacts with &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b069">69</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, the interaction of Wnt proteins with potentially alternative receptors need not be mutually exclusive, as suggested by a study of Wnt interactions with Fz and RYK in mammalian tissue culture cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b070">70</xref>&#x0005d;. Our data indicate that Wnt5 binding to the Fz receptors likely stabilizes axons, whereas Wnt5 signaling through Drl is apparently interpreted by embryonic CNS axons as a repulsive signal. Consistent with this, we observe that ectopic expression of Drl in DCNs results in a reduction of the number of DCN axons crossing the optic chiasm (from 11.7 to ~8; unpublished data). We do not, however, observe Drl expression in DCNs, making it unlikely that Drl plays a role in regulating the DCN connectivity pattern.</p><p>Conversely, activation of FGFR signaling results in axonal retraction, apparently through the inhibition of JNK signaling. The Rac1 GTPase and JNK appear to act to integrate these pathways: the Wnt and FGFR extracellular cues modulate Rac1 activity, which in turn attenuates JNK signaling, and therefore the balance between axon extension and retraction. Thus, Rac1 transforms complex signaling events into a deterministic binary decision. This decision is likely to be made autonomously in each DCN cell, since we observe that Rac1 mutant DCN single-cell clones cross the optic chiasm at significantly higher rates than controls. A recent study shows that in contrast to what we observe in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> DCNs, Wnts can signal through Rac to increase JNK signaling to promote dendritic arborization in mammals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b071">71</xref>&#x0005d;. The differences between these two results of Wnt signaling through Rac may be accounted for by observations that Rac can have opposite effects on outgrowth in axons versus dendrites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b072">72</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Remodeling of neuronal connections by changes in axonal behavior may result from either retraction or degeneration of axonal shafts and branches. Axonal degeneration, including the blebbing and fragmentation of the axonal shaft, has been shown to occur in both fly and vertebrate axonal remodeling &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. Alternatively, axons may retract from one target site to another, a process which has been suggested to involve the Rac GTPase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040348-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d;. During the remodeling of DCN axonal connections, it appears that the axons retract rather than degenerate. This is supported by the lack of DCN axonal fragments in the medulla during the remodeling phase, as well as the requirement of Rac activity for the remodeling process.</p><p>The development of the adult DCN pattern did not require neuronal activity, suggesting that it is part of a hard-wired genetic program running in the DCNs either as individual cells or as a group. In order to generate a more complete picture of how this genetic program establishes a connectivity map, it will be important to determine the mechanism that specifies the identity of those axons stabilized by Wnt signaling. Are they predetermined by programmed differences between the individual DCNs? Alternatively, are they stochastically specified with competitive interactions resolving the numbers of axons crossing the optic chiasm? Finally, how is the regular spacing between DCN axons determined? Although single-cell mutant analysis suggests that whether or not a given DCN axon retracts or stabilizes is determined in part by cell-autonomous machinery, our data do not exclude a requirement for interactions between individual DCN cells. Thus, while many of the genes examined in this study, e.g., <italic>fz, fz2, bsk,</italic> and <italic>rac1,</italic> apparently act cell-autonomously, it remains possible that DCN axons engage in competitive interactions, or that the retraction or extension of certain axons influences whether other axons retract or continue to extend. Addressing these issues will enable us to understand the rules governing the generation of the formidable complexity of neuronal connectivity which underlies animal behavior.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title><named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> strains and genetics.</title><p>All stocks were raised on standard fly food and the crosses were performed in controlled 25 &#x000b0;C incubators.

DCN axons extend due to active JNK signal. These axons encounter Wnt5 and probably Wnt2 as well, resulting in activation of Disheveled. Disheveled, via its DEP domain, has a negative effect on the activity of the Rac GTPase, thus keeping JNK signaling active. After DCN axons cross the second optic chiasm they encounter a spatially regulated FGF/Branchless signal that activates the FGFR/Breathless pathway. Breathless in turn activates Rac, which inhibits JNK signaling in a subset of axons. These axons then retract back toward the lobula. The wide expression of the different components of these pathways and the modulation of JNK phosphorylation by Dsh and Rac in whole-head extracts strongly suggests that this model may apply to many neuronal types.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0040348.g009"/></fig><table-wrap id="pbio-0040348-t001" content-type="1col" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The Effects of Transgenes Expressed in the DCNs on Axonal Extension to the Medulla</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0040348.t001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="pbio-0040348-t002" content-type="1col" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Results of MARCM Analysis for Wild-Type and <italic>bsk, rac1,</italic> and <italic>fz,fz2</italic> Mutant DCNs</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0040348.t002"/></table-wrap></sec><fn-group><fn id="ack3" fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing interests.</bold> The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn id="ack1" fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions.</bold> BAH conceived and designed the experiments.
