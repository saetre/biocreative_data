The intergene regions of six dispersed and divergently-transcribed H2A/H2B gene pairs contain several extremely well conserved and spaced blocks of sequence homology. Adjacent coding regions are on average 342 base-pairs apart. Respective TATA boxes are separated by 180 base-pairs and within this confined region there are four CCAAT boxes and a previously identified 13 base-pair H2B-specific element (H2B-box) which has homology to the octamer motif present in a number of gene promoter/enhancer elements. Transcription of H2A and H2B genes from wild-type and mutant constructs was measured in transient assays by transfection into HeLa cells, and in permanently transformed clonal cell lines. In vitro separation of the two genes at a unique intergenic site significantly decreased transcription of each gene. This suggested that the H2A/H2B gene pairs contained overlapping promoters. Deletion or point mutagenesis of the H2B-specific element decreased the levels of H2B and the H2A transcripts indicating that this sequence is a common regulatory element of both genes in the divergent-pair configeration.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0373-a" xlink:role="8576"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0376-a" xlink:role="8579"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0378-a" xlink:role="8581"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0380-a" xlink:role="8583"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0368.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8571"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0369.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8572"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0370.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8573"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0371.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8574"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0372.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8575"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0373.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8576"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0374.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8577"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0375.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8578"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0376.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8579"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0377.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8580"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0378.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8581"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0379.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8582"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0380.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8583"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0381.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8584"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0382.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8585"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0383.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8586"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
