Evidence is accumulating that some of them are also participating in induced gene expression in the adult. Here we show that the three CNC-bZIP members NF-E2, Nrf1 and Nrf2 are constitutively expressed in the murine mast cell line CPII and that they form transcription factor complexes with several AP1 binding proteins. Upon induction, complexes are observed at the 2 x NF-E2 consensus binding site and the extended kappa3/AP1(+) site of the TNFalpha promoter. The interaction of Nrf1 with c -jun, junD, fosB and ATF2 in mast cells is in contrast to the recently reported binding of Nrf1 alone at the kappa3/AP1(-) site in dendritic cells. We speculated that this may be the result of the expression of isoforms of Nrf1 in mast cells. Using a PCR cloning strategy, we have isolated six novel splice variants of this transcription factor. Some of them have deleted the translational stop codon, resulting in an Nrf1 protein with an altered leucine zipper region. Expression of this altered binding/interaction domain interferes with TNFalpha induction, indicating an interaction of this splice variant with the active AP1/NF-AT complex at this promoter.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
