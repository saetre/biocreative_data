The budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has been extensively used to study the molecular mechanisms of genetic recombination during meiosis. Several proteins with sequence similarity to RecA, such as Dmc1 and Rad51, have been isolated and their essential roles in recombination have been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c4">4</xref>). Dmc1 and Rad51 share significant amino acid sequence homology, particularly within the core region, and similar conserved sequences are also observed in RecA, which plays a pivotal role in homologous recombination in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Despite this level of similarity, sequence divergence in the N-terminal domain distinguishes the Rad51 from the Dmc1 family. Similar RecA-like proteins have also been isolated from mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c6">6</xref>) and from plants (Lim15, a lily homolog of Dmc1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c8">8</xref>), indicating that the structure of factors involved in recombination is conserved among a wide variety of species.</p><p>Expression of <italic>DMC1</italic>, unlike that of <italic>RAD51</italic>, is meiosis specific. Dmc1 has no role in the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) during vegetative growth, but <italic>dmc1</italic> mutants are defective in reciprocal meiotic recombination, accumulate DSB recombination intermediates, fail to initiate normal synaptonemal complex (SC) formation, and arrest late in meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c1">1</xref>). Both Rad51 and Dmc1 are required for meiotic recombination and promote the synapsis of homologous chromosomes of budding yeast and side-by-side joining of lateral elements in pachytene chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c9">9</xref>). Double mutation of <italic>rad51 dmc1</italic> causes more severe meiotic defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c4">4</xref>). Lim15 and Rad51 are also involved in the recombination reaction during meiotic prophase in the lily, and are colocalized at multiple sites on meiotic chromosomes at prophase 1, suggesting that they may be components of early recombination nodules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c8">8</xref>). Analysis of <italic>dmc1</italic> gene knockout mice revealed that both homozygous mutant males and females were sterile, with gametogenesis arrested in meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c11">11</xref>). This strong similarity in the effects of <italic>dmc1</italic> null mutation between yeast and mouse suggests the existence of an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of regulation of meiotic recombination.</p><p>Although most organisms form SCs, fission yeast is an intriguing exception in which no SC formation has been reported to date. Thus, it is of interest to investigate whether meiotic recombination regulatory mechanisms are also conserved in fission yeast and, if so, how regulation is achieved without a proteinaceous scaffold such as the SC. Structural and functional analysis of <italic>rhp51</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, a fission yeast homolog of <italic>RAD51</italic>, has been carried out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c12">12</xref>), but no functional analysis of a fission yeast <italic>DMC1</italic> homolog has been reported to date. In the course of a systematic search for genes whose transcription is induced in a meiosis-specific manner in fission yeast, we isolated a cDNA clone whose sequence closely resembled that of <italic>DMC1</italic>. Here we report the structural and functional analysis of this clone. We show that the fission yeast <italic>dmc1</italic> gene is transcribed as a bicistronic mRNA in a meiosis-specific manner and carries an additional open reading frame (ORF) downstream of the <italic>dmc1</italic>-like ORF. The second ORF encodes Rad24, a 14-3-3 protein which is required for a variety of cellular events such as DNA damage checkpoint regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c13">13</xref>), and which is also known to associate with target proteins via phosphoserine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c15">15</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and media</title><p>Standard <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> genetic procedures were conducted as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c17">17</xref>). <italic>Schizo&#x000ad;saccharomyces pombe</italic> strains used in this study are derivatives of those originally described by Leupold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c18">18</xref>), as listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd419tb1">1</xref>. <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> cells were grown in standard rich media (YPD or YEL) and in synthetic minimal media (EMM2) containing additional leucine (150 mg&#x0002f;ml) or uracil (75 mg&#x0002f;ml) when specified. For the induction of mating and meiosis, cells were cultured in MEA, SPA, SSA, EMM2 or SSL-N medium at 26&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c17">17</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of RNA and northern blot analysis</title><p>CD16-1 and CD16-5 cells were shaken at 28&#x000b0;C in PM&#x0002b;N medium (containing nitrogen) until they reached log phase (OD<sub>600</sub> &#x0003d; 0.6). Then, the cells were transferred into PM-N medium (without nitrogen) and shaken under the same conditions. Cells were collected at 2-h intervals for 12 h, mixed with 10&#x00025; SDS, phenol&#x0002f;chloroform and RNA extraction buffer and disrupted with glass beads (&#x003c6; &#x0003d; 0.5 mm). The samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was treated with phenol&#x0002f;chloroform and then with chloroform before precipitation with ethanol.

CD16-1 cells are heterozygous (h<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0002f;h<sup>&#x02013;</sup>) and initiate meiosis after nitrogen starvation. In contrast, CD16-5 cells are homozygous (h<sup>&#x02013;</sup>&#x0002f;h<sup>&#x02013;</sup>), and do not proceed to meiosis even after nitrogen starvation. We first constructed a cDNA library in the pAP3neo vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c21">21</xref>) by a linker&#x02013;primer method, using mRNA from CD16-1 cells which were collected at 1-h intervals for 6 h during incubation in sporulation medium following nitrogen starvation. These cell preparations were combined into a single sample before mRNA preparation. Once constructed, the CD16-1 cDNA library was converted to a single-stranded form using f1 helper phage. In parallel with these procedures, we prepared mRNA from CD16-5 cells which were collected at 1-h intervals for 8 h after nitrogen starvation and mixed before mRNA preparation. This mRNA was labeled with biotin using the photobiotin system (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA), and then mixed in excess in hybridization buffer with the single-stranded form of the CD16-1 cDNA library. Hybrid RNA species were removed using avidin as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c21">21</xref>).

In a cross heterozygous for <italic>rhp51</italic> (wt &#x000d7; <italic>rhp51</italic>&#x00394; crosses), cells proceeded to partial meiosis with a reduced meiotic gene conversion rate (0.36 or 0.24&#x00025;). The reduction in the gene conversion rate in <italic>dmc1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> &#x000d7; <italic>rhp51</italic>&#x00394; crosses was not significant when <italic>dmc1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene was eliminated (0.28 or 0.21&#x00025;).

A <italic>dmc1 rad51</italic> double mutant is more defective than a <italic>dmc1</italic> mutant in inter-homolog and inter-chromosomal recombination during return to growth.

In budding yeast, Dmc1 and Rad51 (a homolog of Rhp51) have been shown to make unique contributions to meiotic recombination, sharing at least one overlapping function but otherwise playing distinct roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd419c4">4</xref>).</p><p>As shown in this report (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd419tb3">3</xref>), a mutant heterozygous for <italic>dmc1</italic> did not affect the gene conversion rate, while a mutation homozygous for <italic>dmc1</italic> caused remarkable reductions in the gene conversion rate, indicating that Dmc1 plays an important role in meiotic recombination. A mutation heterozygous for <italic>rhp51</italic> caused a reduced meiotic gene conversion rate, which was further reduced by cumulative elimination of <italic>dmc1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>.
