Mn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> was previously found to stimulate the endonuclease activity of these homologues. ATP was required for the nicking activity of hPMS2 and yPMS1, but was reported to inhibit bacterial MutL proteins from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> and <italic>Aquifex aeolicus</italic> that displayed homology to hPMS2. Mutational analysis has identified the DQHA(X)<sub>2</sub>E(X)<sub>4</sub>E motif present in the C-terminus of PMS2 homologues as important for endonuclease activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodologies/Principal Findings</title><p>We examined the effect ATP had on the Mn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> induced nicking of supercoiled pBR322 by full-length and mutant <italic>A. aeolicus</italic> MutL (Aae MutL) proteins. Assays were single time point, enzyme titration experiments or reaction time courses. The maximum velocity for MutL nicking was determined to be 1.6&#x000b1;0.08&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 4.2&#x000b1;0.3&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in the absence and presence of ATP, respectively. AMPPNP stimulated the nicking activity to a similar extent as ATP. A truncated Aae MutL protein composed of only the C-terminal 123 amino acid residues was found to nick supercoiled DNA. Furthermore, mutations in the conserved C-terminal DQHA(X)<sub>2</sub>E(X)<sub>4</sub>E and CPHGRP motifs were shown to abolish Aae MutL endonuclease activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>ATP stimulated the Mn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> induced endonuclease activity of Aae MutL. Experiments utilizing AMPPNP implied that the stimulation did not require ATP hydrolysis. A mutation in the DQHA(X)<sub>2</sub>E(X)<sub>4</sub>E motif of Aae MutL further supported the role of this region in endonclease activity. For the first time, to our knowledge, we demonstrate that changing the histidine residue in the conserved CPHGRP motif abolishes endonucleolytic activity of a hPMS2 homologue. Finally, the C-terminal 123 amino acid residues of Aae MutL were sufficient to display Mn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> induced nicking activity.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite their incredible accuracy, replicative polymerases are known to make misincorporation, deletion, and addition errors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Bloom1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to a 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; exonuclease activity to improve replication fidelity, there is a pathway termed the mismatch repair pathway (MMR) present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes to correct DNA mismatches and small insertions/deletions (ID) before they lead to permanent mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Modrich1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Kolodner1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The general mechanism of mismatch repair involves the steps of mismatch recognition, DNA nicking 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; to the mismatch, mismatch strand removal, and DNA synthesis to correct the mistake. These steps are well conserved from bacteria to multicellular eukaryotes. There is, however, an interesting divergence in how the newly synthesized DNA strand that contains the misincorporated base is discriminated from the mother strand.</p><p>The first mechanism of daughter/mother strand discrimination is used by the well-studied bacteria <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and takes advantage of the transient hemimethylation state of its DNA during DNA replication. Following nucleotide misincorporation during DNA replication, MutS, the &#x0201c;sensor&#x0201d; molecule of the mismatch repair pathway, binds to the DNA mismatch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Lamers1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Obmolova1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. This triggers ATP/ADP exchange in MutS that then stimulates binding of MutL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Acharya1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. MutL also binds ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Ban1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Spampinato1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> and acts as a bridge between MutS and the endonuclease MutH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Sancar1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. MutH recognizes dam methylation sites and, when stimulated by the mismatched DNA/MutS/MutL complex, nicks hemimethylated dam sites on the newly synthesized, unmethylated strand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Junop1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The nicks direct subsequent repair steps.</p><p>The second mechanism is best understood from studies of eukaryotic mismatch repair, but it also appears to occur in bacteria that lack MutH homologues. In humans there are MutS homologues that serve as mismatch sensors in common with the <italic>E. coli</italic> pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Plotz1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. MutL homologues are found in humans; however, no homologues of MutH have been found. Recent studies have demonstrated that homologues of the PMS2 subunit of human MutL&#x003b1; nick the daughter strand 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; to a mismatch thus taking on the role that MutH plays in <italic>E. coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Kadyrov1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Kadyrov2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Jiricny1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, strand discrimination does not appear to occur by methylation status, but instead by the presence of a preexisting nick near the mismatch. The nick-directed endonuclease activity of hPMS2 and related proteins, and therefore repair, relies on discontinuities being more prevalent in the newly synthesized DNA strand.</p><p>The most highly studied MutL protein is the one found in <italic>E. coli</italic>. It has been reported to exist as a homodimer in solution with each monomeric subunit composed of 3 domains. The N-terminal domain (LN40) carries a ATPase domain which belongs to the <underline>Gyrase H</underline>sp Histidine <underline>K</underline>inase Mut<underline>L</underline> (GHKL) ATPase/Kinase superfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Ban1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Dutta1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The binding of ATP triggers a dramatic conformational change in this polypeptide that promotes the self-dimerization of the LN40 domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Ban1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Ban2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. This domain has many roles including involvement in MutL protein and DNA binding activity and activation of the endonuclease MutH. The self-dimerization of MutL LN40 domains also increases the affinity of MutL for DNA by creating a positively charged cleft <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Ban2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The second domain is an 8 kD-linker that bridges LN40 with the 20 kD C-terminal domain (LC20). LC20 is involved in MutL homodimerization even in the absence of ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Guarne1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Kosinski1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Eukaryotic MutL proteins, such as human MutL&#x003b1; (hMutL&#x003b1;) are heterodimeric proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Kolodner1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Human MutL&#x003b1; is composed of MLH1 and PMS2 subunits. The N-terminal domain of hPMS2 is homologous to the LN40 region in <italic>E. coli</italic> MutL, however, the C-terminal domains vary significantly between these two proteins. It is in the C-terminal domain of the hPMS2 subunit that a conserved DQHA(X)<sub>2</sub>E(X)<sub>4</sub>E heavy metal binding site was discovered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Kadyrov2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Yang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Kosinski2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

A second conserved motif, the CPHGRP motif, has been identified in the C-terminal domain of hPMS2 homologues. Mutation of the first Cys in this motif in <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> MutL (Tth MutL) abolished sensitivity to ATP but not its endonuclease activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Fukui1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, changing the conserved His or Arg residues inhibited MMR in an <italic>in vitro</italic> system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Kosinski2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref></p><p>MutL in both the methyl-directed and nick-directed MMR pathways is regulated by the binding of ATP. It has been shown in <italic>E. coli</italic> that the binding of ATP dramatically changes the conformation of MutL and induces the dimerization of the N-terminal LN40 domain changing the MutL from a &#x0201c;loose&#x0201d; form to a &#x0201c;tight&#x0201d; one <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Ban1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The binding of ATP or a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue induces the physical interaction between MutL and the endonuclease MutH. A truncated MutL that lacks the LC20 domain also shows the same property. The binding of ATP by <italic>E. coli</italic> MutL correlates with activation of MutH. Interestingly, while the Mn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> induced nicking activity of hMutL&#x003b1; and yMutL&#x003b1; are significantly stimulated by ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Kadyrov1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Kadyrov2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, it has been reported that the homologous proteins in <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> and <italic>A. aeolicus</italic> are down regulated by ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Fukui1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Perhaps hPMS2 homologues are regulated differently in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.</p><p>The aim of this study is to better understand the ATP regulation of bacterial hPMS2 homologues and gain a greater understanding of the roles that the DQHA(X)<sub>2</sub>E(X)<sub>4</sub>E and CPHGRP motifs play in MutL function. Initial rate studies of the Mn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> induced nicking activity of Aae MutL demonstrated that ATP has a stimulatory effect. A truncation protein composed of only the C-terminal 123 amino acid residues of Aae MutL (Aae MutL-CTD) retained endonucleolytic activity. We also demonstrate for the first time, as far as we are aware, that the conserved histidine residue in the CPHGRP motif is required for MutL activity. This data implies that Aae MutL responds to ATP in a manner similar to hPMS2 and the information garnered herein may be applicable to all hPMS2 homologues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cloning wild-type and mutant Aae MutL</title><p>The gene encoding <italic>A. aeolicus</italic> MutL (accession number AAC07483) was amplified by the Touchdown method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Don1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> of the polymerase chain reaction from <italic>A. aeolicus</italic> genomic DNA using Phusion&#x02122; DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA) and the forward and reverse primers <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GCGGCGGCGGC GGCCTCGAGCATATGTTTGTAAAGTTACTTCCTCC-3&#x02032;</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-CGGCGGCGGATCCGCTCTTCCGC AGTAATTCCTGCCTACTTTTTCG-3&#x02032;</named-content>, respectively.

A protein that remains associated with the plasmid after it is relaxed and continues nicking would be determined to be less active than an equally active, but highly distributive, enzyme that nicks a new supercoiled plasmid with each nicking event. This situation may be occurring if ATP converts Aae MutL protein into a more active, but also less distributive enzyme.

This may be a further parallel between the more highly studied methyl directed mismatch repair pathway of <italic>E. coli</italic> and nick-directed mismatch repair. Furthermore, ATP binding to a mutant of <italic>E. coli</italic> MutL that lacks ATPase activity has been reported to stimulate MutS association, MutH endonuclease activity, and UvrD loading whereas a mutant that does not bind ATP did not participate in these activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Robertson1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Matson1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Mechanic1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Hall1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Schofield1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, in <italic>E. coli</italic> ATP binding to MutL may stimulate the early steps in methyl-directed MMR repair and its hydrolysis is a transition to later steps.</p><p>MutL homologues, including Aae MutL, that are involved in nick-directed mismatch repair seem to merge the <italic>E. coli</italic> MutL and MutH activities. ATP may serve the same basic function in MMR in <italic>A. aeolicus</italic> as it does in <italic>E. coli</italic>. That function being the stimulation of Aae MutL activity, including endonuclease activity, with subsequent hydrolysis of the bound ATP to ADP by the weak MutL ATPase to transition repair from the early to late stages. Tight regulation of MutL function, particularly the endonuclease activity, would minimize undesirable damage to the genome.</p><p>Structural studies of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Thermatoga maritima</italic> MutL, representing MutL enzymes from both methyl-directed and nick-directed MMR pathways, respectively, have shown that an ATPase domain is located in the protein N-terminus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Ban1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Kim1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. This GHKL ATPase/kinase super family domain is highly conserved and involves four distinct protein motifs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Ban2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Previous work has demonstrated that mutation of this conserved domain disrupts ATP stimulation of activity in <italic>E. coli</italic> MutL. A truncation mutant Aae MutL was constructed that consisted only of the C-terminal domain and therefore lacked the conserved N-terminal ATPase domain. The fact that this truncated form of Aae MutL does not bind ATP in both the absence or the presence of dsDNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007175-g006">Figure 6</xref>) reinforces the importance of the N-terminal domain, but not the C-terminal domain, in ATP binding. The truncated Aae MutL-CTD protein retained Mn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> induced DNA nicking activity, but was no longer responsive to ATP. This result is in agreement with a recently published article on the C-terminal domain from Ngo MutL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Duppatla1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the N-terminal domain may bind ATP and induce a change that alters the nicking activity of the enzyme that resides in the C-terminal domain. Furthermore, the observation that Aae MutL-CTD retained Mn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> induced DNA nicking activity demonstrated that the C-terminal domain is sufficient for endonuclease activity. The requirement for a higher concentration of Aae MutL-CTD to observe nicking activity may be due to a reduced affinity for DNA caused by removal of the N-terminal region</p><p>Amino acid residues have been identified in the C-terminal domain that were important for hPMS2 homologue endonuclease activity. Human MutL&#x003b1; harboring D699K or E705K mutations displayed no detectable endonuclease activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Kadyrov2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Comparable mutations in yMutL&#x003b1; and Tth MutL also abolished endonucleolytic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Kadyrov1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Fukui1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. The mutations alter the DQHA(<italic>X</italic>)<sub>2</sub>E(<italic>X</italic>)<sub>4</sub>E motif found in the C-terminal domain of these enzymes and it may be part of a divalent metal cation binding site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Kadyrov2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Kosinski2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. A mutation within the final Glu in the DQHA(<italic>X</italic>)<sub>2</sub>E(<italic>X</italic>)<sub>4</sub>E sequence of hPMS2 was reported to have no effect in an <italic>in vitro</italic> MMR assay. Interestingly, the comparable mutation in Aae MutL, E357K, results in a nucleolytically inactive protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007175-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The CPHGRP motif is another highly conserved region found in hPMS2 homologues. Previous work reported that mutation of the Cys within this motif did not abolish endonuclease activity, although this mutant no longer responded to ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Fukui1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Mutation of the conserved His or Arg residue in hPMS2 resulted in impaired <italic>in vitro</italic> MMR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Kosinski2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. We further investigated the role of this region by creating H404A and R406A mutations in the CPHGRP motif of Aae MutL. Aae MutL (H404A) did not have detectable endonuclease activity, while R406A remained active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007175-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Interestingly, the conserved His residue in this motif was previsouly implicated in metal ion binding, but the Arg was not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Kosinski2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. This region of the protein may be involved in multiple interactions and we concur with the previous statement that a complete structure of a hPMS2 homologue in complex with substrate would facilitate further structure/function studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007175-Fukui1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that ATP stimulates the endonucleolytic activity of Aae MutL in common with the eukaryotic homologues hMutL&#x003b1; and yMutL&#x003b1;. It is possible that ATP alters other protein properties, such as processivity, that complicates experimental investigation. Furthermore, 2 mutations were identified that abolish Aae MutL endonucleolytic activity. The H404A mutation in the conserved CPHGRP motif abolished Mn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> induced endonuclease activity, while R406A did not. Finally, the ATP stimulation of hPMS2 homologues appears to be conserved from at least a subset of bacteria to multicellular eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007175.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Effect of salt concentration on the initial nicking rate of Aae MuL.
