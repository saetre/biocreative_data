TRPs are functionally diverse involving thermal, chemical and mechanical transducers which modulate the concentration of intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (&#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;i). Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> triggers and/or regulates principal sperm functions during fertilization such as motility, capacitation and the acrosome reaction. Nevertheless, the presence of the TRPM subfamily in sperm has not been explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>Here we document with RT-PCR, western blot and immunocitochemistry analysis the presence of TRPM8 in human sperm. We also examined the participation of this channel in sperm function using specific agonists (menthol and temperature) and antagonists (BCTC and capsazepine). Computer-aided sperm analysis revealed that menthol did not significantly alter human sperm motility. In contrast, menthol induced the acrosome reaction in human sperm. This induction was inhibited about 70&#x00025; by capsazepine (20 &#x000b5;M) and 80&#x00025; by BCTC (1.6 &#x000b5;M). Activation of TRPM8 either by temperature or menthol induced &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;i increases in human sperm measured by fluorescence in populations or individual sperm cells, effect that was also inhibited by capsazepine (20 &#x000b5;M) and BCTC (1.6 &#x000b5;M). However, the progesterone and ZP3-induced acrosome reaction was not inhibited by capsazepine or BCTC, suggesting that TRPM8 activation triggers this process by a different signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is the first report dealing with the presence of a thermo sensitive channel (TRPM8) in human sperm.

Signaling cascades involving intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (&#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;i) changes regulate sperm fundamental functions such as maturation, swimming, finding and fusing with the egg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006095-Darszon1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Cells utilize different mechanisms to regulate their &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;i. Voltage dependent Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels (Ca<sub>v</sub>s) are important players during signaling and in fact several Ca<sub>v</sub>s have been detected in sperm from different species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006095-Darszon2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The TRP superfamily also contributes significantly to Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signaling in different cell types. TRPs are classified into seven groups (TRPC, TRPV, TRPM, TRPA, TRPP, TRPN and TRPML) displaying a large variety of gating and regulatory mechanisms, and therefore participate in diverse cellular processes. In sperm, however, only the TRPC subfamily has been explored and indeed several of its members have been detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006095-Jungnickel1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006095-Castellano1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. They are heterogeneously distributed in these cells, suggesting their participation in distinct functions at particular sperm locations. For example, TRPC2 is present in the head of mouse sperm where it has been proposed to participate in the acrosome reaction (AR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006095-Jungnickel1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Searching for the egg, sperm encounter complex changes in media composition, viscosity and temperature. We reasoned that other members of the TRP family may be present in sperm to contend with the variety of signaling demands required for fertilization. In particular, TRPM channels are good candidates since they participate in sensory physiology, both at the cell and whole organism level. TRPM members are responsible for sensing, among other stimuli, temperature, osmolarity, voltage and pH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006095-Venkatachalam1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, these channels are often regulated by more than one stimulus and thus regarded as signal integrators. This particular feature is presumably essential for sperm during their adventurous journey towards the egg. Interestingly, olfactory receptors have been already reported in sperm as possible transducers of sperm-egg communication, although the natural ligand (s) is (are) still a mystery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006095-Spehr1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics</title><p>The study was approved by the Bioethics Committee at the Biotechnology Institute from the National Autonomous University of Mexico.

In our case, it is worth mentioning that sperm populations are highly heterogeneous, possibly reflecting the complex maturational processes needed for fertilization during transit along the epididymus and the female reproductive tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006095-Salicioni1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>As in other exocytotic processes, &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;i and membrane fusion are intimately related in the sperm AR. During this process, the outer acrosomal membrane fuses with the inner plasma membrane releasing the acrosomal content (mainly hydrolytic enzymes) that helps sperm penetrate the extracellular egg's matrix and reach the plasma membrane. The egg's extracellular coat is composed of several glycoproteins; human eggs express ZP1, ZP2, ZP3 and ZP4. Most current models consider that ZP3 is the physiological AR inducer and that ZP3 binding to its sperm receptor(s) (not yet fully characterized) produces a biphasic rise in &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;i. This Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry is essential for AR completion. Artificially raising &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;i with ionophores can trigger AR. At least three different Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels have been implicated in the ZP3-induced AR. The pharmacology and kinetics of the first, fast (&#x0223c;200 ms) &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;i transient are consistent with opening of Ca<sub>v</sub> channels (Voltage dependent Calcium Channels) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006095-Arnoult1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Ca<sub>v</sub> channels usually require a depolarization to open. Though the identity of the depolarizing channel is still unknown, a Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel such as the Glycine receptor has been a proposed candidate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006095-Sato1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, TRPM8 could play this role in mammalian sperm. For instance, in a subpopulation of primary afferent neurons TRPM8 has been proposed to induce the depolarization that triggers an action potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006095-Okazawa1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006095-Reid2">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. ZP3 binding to sperm also causes the activation of a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-sensitive PLC and IP3 and diacylglycerol production. IP3 then binds to its receptor (IP3R, second channel) located in the acrosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006095-Walensky1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006095-DeBlas1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref> releasing Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> from this intracellular store which activates a plasma membrane Store Operated Channel (SOC) (third channel) leading to a sustained &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;i increase lasting several minutes. These SOCs may be constituted by TRP family members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006095-Jungnickel1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006095-Trevino2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The signaling model described is based mainly on results from mouse sperm, but a similar sequence of events has been proposed for the human AR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006095-JimenezGonzalez1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Due to the lack of native human ZP3, progesterone has been widely used to study the human sperm AR. Though progesterone also causes a biphasic &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;i increase, its signaling cascade is different from that of ZP3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006095-Darszon1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. TRPM8 activation significantly increases &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;i and also induces the AR; however, the pharmacology of these responses differs from that of the physiological inducers, indicating a distinct signaling cascade. In agreement with this notion, TRPM8 null mice are fertile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006095-Colburn1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the physiological role of TRPM8 in the mouse sperm AR remains to be established. It could participate in the ill defined ZP4-induced AR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006095-Chiu1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, in alternate paths leading to this reaction needed under altered physiological conditions or to decrease its threshold, as has been postulated for progesterone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006095-Shi1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Finally, TRP channels integrate multiple signals such as temperature, osmolarity, pH changes, mechanical stress, etc. Their heteromultimeric nature contributes to their diverse regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006095-Hellwig1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>; thus identification of the subunit composition of the functional entity in a particular cell type is essential to understand its physiological role.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0006095.s001" mimetype="image/tiff" xlink:href="pone.0006095.s001.tif" position="float"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Menthol does not influence human sperm motility.
