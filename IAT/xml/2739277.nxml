The designed siPLD1 successfully reduced the endogenous expression of PLD1 to &#x0003c;10&#x00025; of the control (i.e., inhibition with luciferase siRNA: siLuc) within 72 hours of transfection (data not shown). Cell surface protein biotinylation studies showed that the EGF (20 nM)-induced endocytosis of EGFR was significantly delayed in cells transfected with siPLD1 compared with the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007090-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007090-g001">Figure 1B</xref> for quantitative analysis). The maximal attenuation of EGFR internalization occurred after 2 min of EGF treatment. However, the internalization of transferrin receptor (TfR), which constitutively endocytoses through clathrin-coated pits, remained unchanged. The <sup>125</sup>I-EFG internalization data strongly support the essential role of PLD1 in EGFR internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007090-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

Association between PLD1 and PA through the PX domain of PLD1 increases the affinity of the interaction between the PH domain of PLD1 and &#x003bc;2. This interaction enhances the translocation of AP2 onto the plasma membrane and the recognition of EGFR by &#x003bc;2 facilitating EGFR endocytosis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0007090.g005"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>PLD1 is a key factor in the regulation of EGFR endocytosis. PLD1 is activated upon EGF stimulation and it hydrolyzes PC to PA at the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007090-Voss1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Nonetheless, the identity of PA effector protein and the mechanism by which PA regulates the EGFR endocytosis are still unknown. The present study shows that PLD1 itself is an effector of PA and auto-regulatory interaction between the PX domain of PLD1 and PA promotes the binding of another domain of PLD1, the PH domain, with &#x003bc;2 and thereby facilitates EGFR endocytosis. The findings that the PLD1-&#x003bc;2 association is dependent on its lipase activity and that the effector of PA is PLD1 itself establish the key role of PLD1 in EGFR endocytosis and also provide new mechanistic insight. To our knowledge, this is the first example of an auto-regulatory mechanism for a signaling enzyme.</p><p>On the basis of our results, we propose that PLD1 is a complex molecular device with functional triad composed of catalytic, PX, and PH domain, each of which senses and mediates discrete steps of EGFR endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007090-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). In our model, the catalytic domain of PLD1 first generates PA from PC in response to EGFR activation. The PX domain of PLD1 then binds with PA and thus senses the input indicating that EGFR has been activated. This in turn may cause the conformational change of PLD1 to expose the &#x003bc;2 binding site of the PH domain which generates the output signal that triggers the translocation of AP2 to the plasma membrane and the endocytosis of EGFR. Previously, we also reported that the PX domain of PLD1 has GTPase activating properties for dynamin and enhances the EGFR endocytosis at lower concentration of EGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007090-Lee1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, PLD1 might be a multifunctional hub protein for the control of EGFR endocytosis speed in response to the strength of the outside EGF signal.</p><p>It is still unclear how the kinetics of receptor endocytosis is finely regulated depending on the strength of receptor activation. In this study, we found direct evidence linking receptor stimulation and endocytic molecule recruitment. We observed that increased concentration of EGF (20 nM)-induced PLD1 activation is responsible for the translocation of endocytic adaptor protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007090-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) and that this is critically required to facilitate the internalization of EGF receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007090-g005">Figure 5B</xref>. When EGF is present at low concentrations, EGFR endocytosis occurs slowly (linear increase, time for half internalization (t<sub>1/2</sub>) is about 5 min) and under such conditions the GAP function of PLD1, which is independent of its lipase activity, rather than its lipase activity is mainly involved, because the amount of EGF is not enough to induce PLD1 lipase activity. However, when EGF is present at relatively high concentrations to turn on PLD activity, PLD1 performs an additional role in endocytosis (in addition to acting as a GAP for dynamin) by acting as a membrane target for the adaptor protein, which enables for a high-rate of internalization of EGFR (highly saturated, t<sub>1/2</sub>&#x02248;1.5 min). PLD2, an isoform of PLD1, also roles in EGFR endocytosis by acting as GAP for dynamin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007090-Lee1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> (lipase activity-independent role) but not in lipase activity-dependent manner because it does not interact with &#x003bc;2 (data not shown). These results imply that receptor endocytosis utilizes the same molecules but has a regulatory mode that depends on the amount of ligand.</p><p>The present study demonstrates that PA generated by PLD1 activation plays a pivotal role in the facilitated EGFR endocytosis. PA roles in promoting the PLD1-&#x003bc;2 interaction and triggering the membrane translocation of AP2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007090-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) through binding to the PX domain of PLD1. Furthermore, a good correlation between the activation kinetics of PLD1 and the kinetics of PLD1-&#x003bc;2 interaction and EGFR endocytosis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007090-g002">Figure 2B, 2A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007090-g001">1A</xref> respectively) suggests that PLD1 controls the kinetics of EGFR endocytosis through the generation of PA. It has been proposed that PA stimulates PIP5-kinase which is primarily associated with the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007090-Simonsen1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and generates phosphatidylinositol&#x02013;4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007090-Wiedemann1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> which plays a pivotal role in receptor endocytosis. The level of PIP<sub>2</sub> reaches a maximum at the initiation of endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007090-Jenkins1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and it causes the recruitment of endocytic proteins onto the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007090-Cremona1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007090-Jost1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently it was also reported that activation of PIP5-kinase through interaction with AP2 and local generation of PIP<sub>2</sub> is important for the recruitment of endocytic machineries and synaptic vesicle internalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007090-NakanoKobayashi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, we propose that PA generation by PLD1 activation is a key molecular event that causes the local accumulation of PIP<sub>2</sub> through direct activation of PIP5-kinase and enhancing AP2-PIP5-kinase pathway by placing these two molecules in close proximity to facilitate EGFR endocytosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>RNA interference</title><p>Pairs of 21-nucleotide sense and antisense RNA oligomers which correspond to human PLD1a coding nucleotides 1455&#x02013;1475 were chemically synthesized and annealed by Dharmacon Research, Inc.
