INTRODUCTION</title><p>High mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB1) is an ubiquitous, extremely conserved (99% mammal identity) protein, to have DNA-binding properties; to participate in DNA transcription, replication, and repair; and also to participate in neurite outgrowth and cell motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Amphoterin is a 30-kD heparin-binding protein widely expressed in humans and other organisms, and it is abundantly expressed in the developing brain as well as in various immature and transformed cell lines. Unexpectedly, its amino acid sequence turned out to be identical to HMGB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In a new nomenclature of high-mobility group proteins, amphoterin is called HMGB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Further investigations revealed that this has properties similar to those of proinflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. HMGB1 has been demonstrated to have the capacity to induce cytokines and to activate inflammatory cells when it is released extracellularly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Extracellular HMGB1 functions as a proinflammatory late cytokine, and activates monocytes and endothelial cells, leading to release of further cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. To act as a danger signal and inflammatory mediator, HMGB1 must be transported extracellularly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Moreover, HMGB1 can also be actively secreted by stimulated macrophages or monocytes in a process requiring acetylation of the molecule, which enables translocation from the nucleus to secretory lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In response to proinflammatory stimuli, that is, proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-<inline-formula><mml:math id="M7"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>&#x003b1;</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and IL-1, or even. lipopolysacharide (LPS), HMGB1 may be actively secreted from monocyres and macrophages via the nonclassical, vesicle-mediated pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. At the same time, HMGB1 is a nuclear danger signal passively released by necrotic cells that will induce inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], but not from cells undergoing apoptosis.</p><p>In the classical experiment of Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] when LPS was administered to mice to generate endotoxaemia, the serum HMGB1 levels began to increase 12&#x02013;18 hours after the peak levels of TNF, and IL-1. Administration of HMGB1 to mice causes sepsis-like symptoms and death. HMGB1 has been found as a downstream and late mediator in human sepsisl too [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. During infections, microbial components can be the activators of danger signals. So in infectious diseases, HMGB1 may function as a secreted or released molecule to alert the host that the pathogen has invaded. Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria are able to cause sepsis, but little is known about the HMGB1 inducing ability of mycobacteria. We therefore set out to elaborate an in vitro model, with which the HMGB1 inducing capacities of different bacteria or bacterial components could be investigated. For this purpose, the monocytic cell line U-937 were applied, and the extents of HMGB1 secretion were compared following activation of these cells with <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> BCG.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2.

We speculate that the receptors (i.e., Toll-like receptors) recognizing cell wall components of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria may not be equally involved in HMGB1 secretion, which serve as HMGB1 receptors too [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Moreover, the intracellular mycobacteria may activate different signals which lead to HMGB1 secretion. TNF plays a critical role in host defense against <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Mycobacteria are able to induce TNF production by different pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, it is very likely that this is not the only way to induce HMGB1 release. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the exact mechanism, that is, which signalization is initiated by <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> resulting in HMGB1 secretion.</p><p>In our immunofluorescence experiments, the translocation of HMGB1 from the nucleus toward the cytoplasm was observed following induction of cells with BCG, which proves an active secretion process. The HMGB-1 protein can get out of the cells by two mechanisms: it can be secreted actively mostly by living inflammatory cells, or released passively by damaged or necrotic cells. HMGB-1 lacks a secretory signal peptide (similarly to interleukin-1<inline-formula><mml:math id="M21"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>&#x003b2;</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (IL-1<inline-formula><mml:math id="M22"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>&#x003b2;</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]), so it can not be secreted via the Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum pathway. In resting monocytes, HMGB1 shuttles through the nuclear membrane to the cytosol or into the nucleus. The activation signal leads to the acetylation of lysine residues within the two nuclear localisation signal (NLS) sites on the HMGB-1 molecule, thereby neutralising their charge and making them unable to function as NLS. This is thought to inhibit the relocalisation of the protein into the nucleus, so the hyperacetylated HMGB-1 accumulates in the cytosol and will be packed into secretory lysosomes. Hence, we conclude that the translocation of HMGB1 from the nucleus toward the cytoplasm, which was observed in our immunofluorescence experiment following the induction of the cells with BCG, may lead to an active secretion process.</p><p>Though U-937 cells are able to release a low level of HMGB1 spontaneously, it is noteworthy, that they secrete a considerable amount of HMGB1 only following PMA activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1"> Table 1</xref>). PMA is a potent activator of monocytes, resulting in differentiation too. Thus, it is very probable that activation, or (much more likely) differentiation of monocytes is an important factor which may facilitate their HMGB1 secretion. Incubation of the cells with BCG resulted in HMGB1 secretion even without a coincubation with PMA. However, the cells treated with PMA and BCG simultaneously secreted the highest amount of HMGB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The results of the ELISA measurements correlated well with those of the Western blot experiments, but the sensitivity was higher. No ultrafiltration was needed before testing of the cell supernatants, as it was necessary in Western blot experiments.</p><p>In the Western blot experiments the chicken anti-HMGB1 antibody recognized both the <italic>E. coli</italic>-derived recombinant human HMGB1, and the recombinant rat HMGB1, but the two proteins featured slightly different molecular weights by SDS-PAGE (30&#x02009;kD versus 25&#x02009;kD). In order to determine the structural differences, both proteins were in-gel digested with trypsin and the resulting peptide mixtures were subjected to MALDI-TOF mass and PSD analysis. These results confirmed the identity of the proteins. Our &#x0201c;natural&#x0201d; samples, from the cell supernatants gave positive bands with this antibody at the same molecular weight, as that of rat HMGB1. The exact reason for this is not yet known. It is very likely, that naturally secreted HMGB1 from biological sources is not identical to the <italic>E. coli</italic>-derived recombinant HMGB1, and they may be recognized differently by different antibodies. This might be the explanation that why not all commercial monoclonal antibodies are equally able to detect HMGB1 from biological samples in Western blot experiments (personal observations). The chicken anti-HMGB1 antibody was successfully applied also to detect human HMGB1 from sera of septic patients in the study of Sund&#x000e9;n-Cullber et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>HMGB1 can occupy a central role in mediating the local and systemic responses to invasion by pathogens. Our pilot experiments draw attention to the HMGB1&#x02014;inducing ability of <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic>, demonstrated in both Western blot and ELISA experiments. Assessment the pathophysiological role of this late cytokine in mycobacterial infections demands further in vitro and in vivo experiments.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank Mrs. Gy&#x000f6;rgyi M&#x000fc;ller for expert technical assistance and Mrs. Zsuzsanna Rosztoczy for skillfull administration.
