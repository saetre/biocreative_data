Second, expression of Pax7 with viral vectors in CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:Sca1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells purified from uninjured muscle promoted the formation of highly proliferative myoblasts that readily differentiated as multinucleated myotubes (see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020130-g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020130-g003">3</xref>). CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:Sca1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells engineered to express Pax7 (CDSC-Pax7) also differentiated in vivo, readily contributing to the regeneration of dystrophic muscle (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020130-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Lastly, Ad-Pax7 gene delivery into chemically damaged <italic>Pax7</italic><bold><sup>&#x02009;&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> muscle resulted in the efficient de novo generation of myofibers in the absence of endogenous satellite cells. Taken together, these data unequivocally establish that Pax7 plays a key regulatory role for directing myogenic specification in some populations of adult stem cells during regenerative myogenesis. Moreover, these results emphasize the possibility of designing strategies to upregulate or ectopically express Pax7 in stem cells for the treatment of muscle degenerative diseases.</p><p>The presence of adult stem cell populations distinct from satellite cells resident in skeletal muscle tissue has been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Gussoni1">Gussoni et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Jackson1">Jackson et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Torrente1">Torrente et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Asakura1">Asakura et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-McKinney-Freeman1">McKinney-Freeman et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Qu-Petersen1">Qu-Petersen et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Cao1">Cao et al. 2003</xref>). An understanding of the developmental origin of these various cell populations and their physiological relevance in the maintenance of tissue integrity is beginning to emerge. Several lines of evidence argue that skeletal muscle regeneration is normally mediated entirely by stem cells resident in muscle tissue. First, destruction of stem cells resident in muscle with high-dose local irradiation of limbs results in a long-term deficit in muscle growth and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Wakeford1">Wakeford et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Pagel1">Pagel and Partridge 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Heslop1">Heslop et al. 2000</xref>). Second, transplanted muscles do not incorporate host nuclei after injury and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Schultz1">Schultz et al. 1986</xref>). Together, those experiments argue that CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> stem cells from marrow do not normally transit in significant numbers through the circulation to sites of muscle damage. Our experiments, however, suggest that a population of specialized CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells resides in muscle and can efficiently form myogenic progenitors in response to Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Polesskaya1">Polesskaya et al. 2003</xref>). In the current work we demonstrate that induction of Pax7 is required for the myogenic specification of CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> stem cells and that retroviral transduction can dominantly induce the myogenic specification of these cells. These observations therefore provide compelling evidence that some adult stem cells participate in regenerative myogenesis by forming myogenic progenitors following Pax7 induction in response to Wnt signaling. These data additionally suggest the hypothesis that Pax7 is a transcriptional target of the &#x003b2;-Catenin complex in Wnt-stimulated adult stem cells.</p><p>Interesting parallels exist between the inductive mechanisms and transcriptional networks in embryonic and regenerative myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Parker1">Parker et al. 2003</xref>). For example, the Pax7-dependent myogenic specification of CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> adult stem cells appears analogous to the Pax3-dependent induction of muscle precursors during somitogenesis. In the early embryo, Pax3 is expressed in the presomitic mesoderm and immature epithelial somites prior to the onset of muscle-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Goulding1">Goulding et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Williams1">Williams and Ordahl 1994</xref>). Moreover, Pax3 functions upstream of MyoD in the formation of trunk and body-wall muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Tajbakhsh2">Tajbakhsh et al. 1997</xref>). Consistent with a direct role for Pax3 in myogenic induction, ectopic Pax3 activates MyoD expression in embryonic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Maroto1">Maroto et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Bendall1">Bendall et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Heanue1">Heanue et al. 1999</xref>). However, Pax3 also regulates cell survival in the presomitic mesoderm in areas that do not express Pax7, suggesting an indirect mechanism by which Pax3 may act genetically upstream of MyoD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Borycki1">Borycki et al. 1999</xref>). Our experiments do not rule out the possibility that Pax7 promotes the survival of CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> progenitors that are already competent to give rise to myogenic cells. Characterization of the downstream targets of Pax7 in CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells will be required to directly address this issue.</p><p>In explanted embryonic tissues, signals from the floor plate and neural tube are required for induction of the MRFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Munsterberg1">Munsterberg and Lassar 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Pourquie1">Pourquie et al. 1995</xref>, 1996; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Cossu1">Cossu et al. 1996</xref>). In particular, Wnt7a activates expression of MyoD in explanted paraxial mesoderm from 10.5-d-old mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Tajbakhsh3">Tajbakhsh et al. 1998</xref>). The requirement for Pax3 expression in somitic precursors prior to the onset of MyoD expression suggests that Wnt signals may activate Pax3 and indirectly promote MRF expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Borycki1">Borycki et al. 1999</xref>). An analogous requirement for Pax7 in the myogenic commitment of adult CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> progenitors suggests a conserved hierarchy whereby Wnt signaling activates Pax3 or Pax7 expression upstream of the MRFs in somitic and adult muscle stem cells, respectively. This notion is supported by the observed loss of Pax3 expression in P19 mesodermal precursors engineered to express a dominant negative form of the Wnt effector protein, &#x003b2;-Catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Petropoulos1">Petropoulos and Skerjanc 2002</xref>).</p><p>A confounding result from our study was the inability of Pax7 to induce myogenesis in CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:Sca1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells recovered from <italic>Pax7</italic><bold><sup>&#x02009;&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> muscle (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020130-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Several possible explanations may account for this observation. First, CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:Sca1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> muscle cells represent a heterogeneous cell population, as evidenced by their nonuniform response to stimuli such as myoblast coculture, Wnt proteins, and ectopic expression of Pax7 (results herein and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Polesskaya1">Polesskaya et al. 2003</xref>). Analysis of muscle suspensions from young <italic>Pax7</italic><bold><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> mice revealed a significantly increased number of hematopoietic progenitors and adipogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Seale1">Seale et al. 2000</xref>). We also observed altered proportions of CD45- and Sca1-expressing cells in uninjured and regenerating muscle (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020130-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The putative stem cell subfraction coexpressing CD45 and Sca1 may have been exhausted prematurely during postnatal <italic>Pax7</italic><bold><sup>&#x02009;&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> muscle development. It is also conceivable that a reduced proportion of stem cells in the <italic>Pax7</italic><bold><sup>&#x02009;&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:Sca1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> muscle fractions was not detected in our assay due to a low efficiency of retroviral transduction (approximately 10&#x00025; of surviving CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:Sca1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells with GFP virus). The identification of additional markers expressed by adult muscle-derived stem cells is required to more thoroughly explore these issues.</p><p>Alternatively, adult stem cells may require additional signals to undergo myogenesis in response to Pax7. The profound growth deficit in <italic>Pax7</italic><bold><sup>&#x02009;&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> muscles is likely to invoke nonspecific and indirect changes to the muscle microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Seale1">Seale et al. 2000</xref>). Specific cues required to &#x0201c;prime&#x0201d; or activate adult stem cells may thus be absent or ineffective in <italic>Pax7</italic><bold><sup>&#x02009;&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> muscle. Finally, our experiments also revealed that the endogenous <italic>Pax7</italic> gene is upregulated during the myogenic specification of CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:Sca1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020130-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Therefore, endogenous gene activity, possibly through the regulated expression of different isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Kay1">Kay et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Ziman1">Ziman et al. 1997</xref>), may be essential to the stability of myogenic commitment. Future experiments addressing the functional differences between CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:Sca1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in wild-type and <italic>Pax7</italic>-deficient muscle will provide a unique opportunity to gain a more complete understanding of the role of these cells during postnatal muscle development.</p><p>Although CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from <italic>Pax7</italic><bold><sup>&#x02009;&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> muscle were apparently unable to undergo myogenesis, ectopic Pax7 induced expression of Myf5 and myogenic specification in <italic>Pax7</italic>-deficient CD45<sup>&#x02212;</sup>:Sca1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020130-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

Skeletal muscle in adult <italic>Pax7</italic><bold><sup>&#x02009;&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> mice displays a profound regeneration deficit with only occasional regenerated fibers observed at the site of injury 30 d after ctx injection (S.B.P.

Taken together, these results imply the presence of <italic>Pax7</italic><bold><sup>&#x02009;&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> muscle progenitors that require the activity of Pax7 to generate sufficient numbers of myoblasts for effective regeneration. Further studies will be required to molecularly characterize the responsive cells and their developmental relationship to other muscle stem cell populations.</p><p>The dominant expression of Myf5 in Pax7-infected CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:Sca1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (CDSC-Pax7) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020130-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) suggests a paradigm wherein Pax7 preferentially activates Myf5 compared to MyoD. Interestingly, Pax3 has been implicated in myogenesis specifically upstream of MyoD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Tajbakhsh2">Tajbakhsh et al. 1997</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest the hypothesis that Pax3 and Pax7 specify distinct myogenic lineages through the preferential activation of MyoD and Myf5, respectively.</p><p>Several experimental observations have noted a role for Myf5 in promoting myoblast proliferation. For example homozygous <italic>Myf5nLacZ</italic>, (e.g., <italic>Myf5</italic>-deficient) embryos display significantly reduced numbers of LacZ-expressing myogenic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Tajbakhsh1">Tajbakhsh et al. 1996</xref>). In avian embryos, Myf5 is preferentially expressed in proliferating myoblasts, whereas MyoD appears to be upregulated in differentiating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Delfini1">Delfini et al. 2000</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Myf5<sup>&#x02009;&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> satellite-cell-derived myoblasts display a profound proliferation deficit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Montarras1">Montarras et al. 2000</xref>).

These observations raise the possibility that Pax7 activates expression of Myf5 to promote adult myoblast expansion whereas Pax3 preferentially induces MyoD and differentiation.</p><p>The requirement for Pax7 in the specification of muscle satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Seale1">Seale et al. 2000</xref>) and its induction during the myogenic recruitment of CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> adult stem cells provide further evidence for a developmental relationship between CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> adult muscle stem cells and satellite cells. Together, our experiments suggest the hypothesis that CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:Sca1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells give rise to satellite cells by a Pax7-dependent mechanism in response to Wnt signals. In conclusion, our work establishes that Pax7 is necessary and sufficient for the myogenic specification of specific populations of adult stem cells resident in muscle tissue. The proliferative myogenic character of CDSC-Pax7 cells and their efficient engraftment into dystrophic muscle further argue that methods to deliver Pax7 or upregulate its expression in stem cells may be useful in treating degenerative muscle disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Mice</title><p>Mice carrying a targeted null mutation in <italic>Pax7</italic> (hereafter referred to as <italic>Pax7<sup>&#x02009;&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>) were generously provided by Drs.

The purity of sorted populations was routinely greater than 98&#x00025;.</p></sec><sec id="s4a3"><title>Retroviral and adenoviral gene expression</title><p>Retrovirus was produced according to the 3-plasmid HIT system with plasmids pHIT60, pHIT456, and pHAN-puro as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Soneoka1">Soneoka et al. 1995</xref>). pHIT60 encodes the MLV retroviral gag-pol, pHIT456 expresses an amphotrophic envelope protein, and pHAN-puro is an expression vector with a hybrid CMV-5&#x02032; LTR promoter driving production of the retroviral transcript. Pax7 expression vectors were generated using the mouse Pax7d isoform containing a single Ala&#x02192;Thr substitution at the seventh amino acid (the Thr residue is conserved in human, chicken, and zebrafish Pax7 proteins). Pax7d or mouse MyoD are translated from the full retroviral transcript, whereas the puromycin-resistance marker is expressed following integration from a shorter transcript produced by the SV40 early promoter located 3&#x02032; to the multiple cloning site. Transient cotransfection of all three plasmids into 293FT cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States) by the calcium phosphate method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020130-Graham1">Graham and van der Eb 1973</xref>) routinely produced viral titres between 10<sup>6</sup> and 10<sup>7</sup> cfu per ml. pHAN-puro was used to produce puromycin-resistant virus for controls.</p><p>Purified CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:Sca1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or CD45<sup>&#x02212;</sup>:Sca1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells were spun down, counted, and 20,00&#x02013;50,000 cells were then cultured overnight on collagen-coated 4-well chamber slides in HAM's F10 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20&#x00025; FBS, antibiotics, and 10 ng/ml Stem Cell Factor (R &#x00026; D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States).
