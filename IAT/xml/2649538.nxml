To make such a therapy readily available, new sources of insulin-producing cells must be identified. Pancreatic duct cells represent such an alternative source for generation of new beta cells in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-BonnerWeir1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Duct compartment has also implications in type 2 diabetes (T2D), since T2D is associated with beta cell loss, and the in situ induction of beta cell neogenesis from ductal progenitor cells may help to restore the beta cell mass in the pancreas of type 2 diabetic patients. Therefore, characterization of stimuli with potential to induce the expansion of duct cells and/or to drive their differentiation into beta cells is of great importance. A variety of growth factors have been described to induce growth and differentiation of ductal cells. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) comprise a growing group of structurally related polypeptide mitogens with more than 20 members, most of which stimulate proliferation of a variety of cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Werner1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Finch1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Keratinocyte growth factor, also called FGF7, is a member of the FGF family. KGF is a paracrine-acting mitogen produced by cells of mesenchymal origin. It acts exclusively through a subset of FGF receptor isoforms (FGFR2IIIb) expressed predominantly by epithelial cells and therefore is a specific mitogen for these cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Finch2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Preclinical data from several animal models have demonstrated that recombinant human KGF could enhance the regenerative capacity of epithelial tissues and protect them from a variety of toxic exposures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Finch1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. We and others have previously reported that KGF induces ductal cell proliferation in the pancreas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Krakowski1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Yi1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> and promotes beta cell regeneration in neonatal streptozotocin diabetic rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Movassat1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. However the molecular mechanisms underlying the stimulation of beta cell regeneration through the induction of ductal cell proliferation and beta cell neogenesis by KGF are not known.</p><p>The present study was undertaken to investigate the intracellular signaling pathways which mediate the growth promoting effects of KGF (palifermin) in pancreatic ducts and to dissect the key steps of duct-to-beta cell differentiation induced by KGF in a model of neonatal diabetes in rat.</p><p>In our study, we have established that KGF acts on ductal cells by the the activation of distinct signaling pathways to promote beta cell regeneration. It induces proliferation of the pancreatic ductal cells via the activation of the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway and it triggers duct-to-beta cell differentiation directly by the induction of PDX1 expression in the neonatal ducts via the activation of PI3K/AKT pathway. The duality of the effects of KGF in a different subsets of a unique cell type is an original finding and could have important implication in the potential use of this factor as differentiation promoting agent for regenerative therapies of diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Reagents</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>The following chemicals and reagents were used in this study</title><p>DMEM was purchased from Promochem (Molsheim, France), penicillin&#x02013;streptomycin, and trypsin&#x02013;EDTA solutions from Invitrogen (Cergy Pontoise, France).

These consisted of cells that expressed specific beta cell markers that are not normally expressed in ductal cells. As such markers, we investigated the expression of PDX1 and the beta cell specific glucose transporter, Glut 2. Since both CK20 and PDX1 antibodies were raised in rabbit, double staining using both antibodies on the same section could not be carried out. Therefore, in order to localize the PDX1 expressing ductal cells in the pancreatic sections of 2-day-old rats , double staining for insulin and PDX1 were performed in sections adjacent to those that were stained for CK20. To estimate the number of PDX1-positive cells, ductal cells that were positive for PDX1, but negative for insulin were counted and the results were expressed as the percentage of PDX1-positive/insulin-negative ductal cells over total ductal cells. For all in vivo studies at least 4 animals were used in each group. For the identification of Glut 2 expressing ductal cells, we performed double immunofluorescent staining for Glut 2 and insulin on pancreatic sections of 4-day-old rats.

One of the most common signaling pathways linked to cell response to growth factors is the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway. Among the three main MAPK cascades (ERK1/2, JNK and P38), ERK1/2 are predominantly activated by growth factors whereas P38 and JNK transduce stress-related stimuli such as heat shock and inflammatory cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Robinson1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Minden1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

We first inactivated MEK1 by its pharmacological inhibitor PD98059. We further confirmed the specificity of MEK inactivation by the use of antisense morpholino-oligonucleotides (MEK1-AS) specifically designed to inhibit MEK1 translation. Strikingly, in both cases blockade of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was associated with complete inhibition of proliferation induced by KGF. From these data we clearly established that ERK1/2 activation is necessary and sufficient for the mediation of growth promoting effects of KGF in pancreatic ductal cells in vitro. The mediation of mitogenic effects of KGF by ERK1/2 signaling has also been reported in other cell types such as endometrial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Taniguchi1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Sharma2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> while other effects of KGF such as regulation of cell migration were mediated by MAP Kinase P38 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Sharma2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.

We first established that cyclin D1 was expressed in Panc-1 cells while cyclin D2 was not detectable in this cell type. KGF treatment of Panc-1 cells significantly increased the levels of cyclin D1 protein and the blockade of the ERK signaling by PD98059 prevented the induction of cyclin D1 expression by KGF.

Thus, our report in support of previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Kornmann1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Mei1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref> suggests that cyclin D1 may represent a final common effector for mitogenic signaling via KGF receptor.</p><p>Although previous in vitro studies have partly identified the signaling pathways of growth factor-mediated proliferation in pancreatic ductal cells in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Rescan1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Elghazi1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, the intracellular mechanisms of KGF-induced duct cell proliferation in vivo are still poorly understood. Therefore, in this study we explored how the pathways induced by KGF in vitro, translate into their in vivo activation. In a previous work we have reported that in vivo administration of KGF to neonatal diabetic rats stimulated beta cell regeneration via the induction of duct cell proliferation and their subsequent differentiation into insulin producing cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Movassat1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we confirmed the in vivo growth promoting effect of ductal cells by KGF in the pancreas of STZ diabetic rats. To determine the relevance of our in vitro findings to the in vivo situation we assessed the implication of ERK1/2 pathway in the KGF-induced duct cell proliferation. We used a specific approach based on the administration of anti-MEK1 antisense oligonucleotides to the pups. We demonstrated for the first time that MEK1 can be successfully knocked down in the pancreas by the use of antisense-oligonucleotides in vivo. This approach, more specific than pharmacological inhibition and less harmful than adenovirus mediated gene inactivation was well tolerated by the pups and no general deleterious effects due to the downregulation MEK1 in other organs during the time course of our study were observed (not shown). This is the first demonstration of the in vivo use of morpholino-oligonucleotides as a safe and specific post-transcriptional gene silencing approach in newborn rats. The blockade of ERK1/2 in vivo totally abolished the KGF-induced proliferation of ductal cells indicating that, at least in the neonatal pancreas, ERK1/2 pathway is the exclusive signaling pathway responsible for duct cell proliferation induced by KGF. The mediation of growth promoting effects of KGF by ERK1/2 signaling has also been reported in culture of embryonic pancreatic rudiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Elghazi1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. ERK1/2 activation has been shown to occur in a model of adult pancreas regeneration after pancreatectomy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Morisset1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that in this model, ERK phosphorylation can be seen only in duct cells and not in acinar cells during pancreatic regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Watanabe2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Watanabe3">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Ductal compartment of the pancreas is admitted to harbour precursor cells for islet neogenesis. Therefore, the activation of ERK proteins in the duct in regenerating pancreas may play an indirect role in endocrine cell neogenesis by increasing the number of so-called progenitor cells. Here we have further explored the possibility that, beyond the stimulation of cell proliferation in the ductal compartment, other steps of beta cell neogenesis from ducts could be directly modulated by KGF. In order to address this question, we examined the expression of beta cell specific markers in ductal cells in the pancreas of neonatal diabetic rats. The homeodomain protein PDX1 is a prominent transcription factor for pancreas morphogenesis during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Edlund1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Jonsson1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Kim2">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> and a transcriptional regulator of insulin synthesis and secretion in mature beta cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Macfarlane1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Marshak1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been strongly suggested that during the postnatal life, PDX1 may also be essential for neogenesis of endocrine cells by differentiation from precursor cells that reside among the cells lining the pancreatic ducts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Rutter1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Bouwens3">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. The examination of pancreatic sections revealed that the number of PDX1-positive/insulin-negative cells was significantly higher among ductal cells of KGF treated STZ rats. PDX1-positive/insulin-negative cells can be considered as cells committed toward a beta cell-like phenotype without having achieved terminal differentiation yet. This novel finding designates for the first time KGF as a differentiation inducing agent through the stimulation of PDX1 expression in ductal cells. In a study in primary islets and in INS1 beta cells, ERK1/2 activation has been shown to be required for the regulation of important transcription factors such as Beta2, PDX-1, and E12/47 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Khoo1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore we assessed the implication of ERK1/2 pathway in the induction of PDX1 expression in ductal cells induced by KGF. We found that the blockade of this pathway by the administration of anti-MEK1 antisense-oligonucleotides did not affect the KGF-induced expression of PDX1 in ducts, suggesting that the induction of PDX1 in those cells in not dependent upon ERK1/2 activation. Several papers by Evers group have reported that in the context of pancreas regeneration after pancreatectomy in adult rodents, the induction of PDX1 expression in duct cells is regulated by the PI3K pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Watanabe2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Watanabe3">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. However whether KGF acts through this pathway to induce PDX1 expression in ductal cells had not been reported. We addressed this question in the present study and showed that the effect of KGF on the ductal expression of PDX1 is totally abolished in animals treated with wortmannin, providing evidence on the role of the PI3K/AKT pathway in the mediation of the KGF signal for PDX1 expression in ducts. As an additional hallmark of the progression of duct-to-beta cell differentiation process, we investigated the expression of Glut 2 in ductal cells. Glut 2, a transcriptional target of PDX1, is an essential effector of the glucose sensing machinery in terminally differentiated beta cells. However, Glut 2 has also been reported as a marker of precursor cells during the early stages of pancreas development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Pang1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref> and in a subset of precursor cells during beta cell regeneration in experimental models of diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Guz1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Our histological examination of the pancreatic sections revealed that the number of Glut 2-positive/insulin-negative cells among the ductal compartment is significantly increased in rats treated with KGF, suggesting that this growth factor induces duct-to-beta cell differentiation by the sequential activation of beta cell specific markers in ductal cells. Whether the expression of Glut 2 in ductal cells is induced by KGF directly or by transactivation effect of PDX1 is not clear but the fact that at an earlier stage (day 2 post natal) the number of Glut 2-positive ductal cells was not greater than that found in the age-matched untreated control group, suggests that the increased number of Glut 2-positive ductal cells observed at day 4 post natal might be due to the induction of Glut 2 by PDX1.</p><p>Although PDX1 and Glut 2 are required for the initiation of the process of beta cell differentiation, the expression of many other factors including transcription factors are necessary for the full differentiation of beta cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Habener1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. However, only the presence of insulin can testify that the process of beta cell neogenesis has reached full completion. Therefore we evaluated the number of single or small clusters of insulin containing cells within or in the vicinity of the ductal epithelium.</p><p>The previous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Movassat1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and the present observation that the number of duct-associated insulin-positive cells was greater in KGF treated rats at the age of 4 and 7 days post natal compared to the age-matched untreated rats suggests that ductal cells expressing PDX1 and Glut 2 eventually differentiate into mature insulin producing beta cells.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first in providing evidence of a direct differentiation promoting effect of KGF on ductal cells and for the identification of the signaling pathways involved in this process. We demonstrated that in vivo, in the context of beta cell deficiency, exogenous KGF acts on pancreatic ductal cells through two distinct mechanisms: 1) via the induction of their proliferation through an ERK1/2 dependent mechanism. The activation of cell proliferation in ductal compartment which includes that of progenitor cells would increase the number of the latter and indirectly promote the process of beta cell neogenesis. 2) via the induction of PDX1 expression through a PI3K dependent mechanism in a subpopulation of ductal cells, committing those cells towards differentiation into beta cell. Different duct cell subpopulations may differ in their precursor capacity. We have demonstrated that KGF acts in a unique cell type, via distinct signaling pathways to trigger the commitment of different subsets of ductal cells towards a beta cell-like phenotype. The transition from duct to beta cell phenotype requires a complex network of signaling pathways whose activation / inactivation in a finely coordinated manner ensures the proper differentiation process to take place <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004734-Bulotta1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. The identification of agents with the potential to trigger this transition is of great interest. Our present work designates KGF as an effective agent for the in vivo induction of duct-to-beta cell differentiation and might have have important implications for the regenerative therapies of diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank AMGEN Inc. for providing KGF (palifermin) used in this study.
