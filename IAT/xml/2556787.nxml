SHM and CSR are initiated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) through the deamination of cytosine residues on the immunoglobulin loci, which leads to the generation of DNA mutations or double-strand break intermediates. As a bystander effect, endogenous AID levels can also promote the generation of chromosome translocations, suggesting that the fine tuning of AID expression may be critical to restrict B cell lymphomagenesis. To determine whether microRNAs (miRNAs) play a role in the regulation of AID expression, we performed a functional screening of an miRNA library and identified miRNAs that regulate CSR. One such miRNA, miR-181b, impairs CSR when expressed in activated B cells, and results in the down-regulation of AID mRNA and protein levels. We found that the AID 3&#x02032; untranslated region contains multiple putative binding sequences for miR-181b and that these sequences can be directly targeted by miR-181b. Overall, our results provide evidence for a new regulatory mechanism that restricts AID activity and can therefore be relevant to prevent B cell malignant transformation.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>S.

The first one is coupled to B cell differentiation in the bone marrow and takes place by V(D)J recombination, a site-specific recombination reaction that is also responsible for antigen receptor diversification in T cells. In contrast to T cells, mature B cells that have been stimulated by antigen can undergo a secondary antibody diversification in so-called germinal centers, which entails two distinct molecular mechanisms: somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR). SHM introduces nucleotide changes in the antigen recognition (i.e., variable region) of the Ig genes, thereby allowing the generation of antibodies with a higher affinity for their cognate antigen. CSR is a region-specific recombination reaction that replaces the primary &#x003bc; constant (C&#x003bc;) region by a downstream constant region (C&#x003b3;, C&#x003b5;, or C&#x003b1;) that will endow the antibody molecule with new effector properties for antigen removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Both CSR and SHM are triggered by the activity of one enzyme, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). AID initiates CSR and SHM by deaminating cytosine residues on the switch or variable region of the Ig genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). AID-induced cytosine deamination results in the generation of U:G mismatches on Ig DNA that can be processed by uracil-N-glycosylase, or of mismatch repair enzymes to promote the fixation of a mutation (SHM) or the generation of a DNA double-strand break and a subsequent recombination reaction (CSR; for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>).</p><p>Most of the lymphomas diagnosed in the western world arise from mature B cells and are characterized by the presence of chromosome translocations that involve one of the Ig loci and a protooncogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). AID has been shown to be required for the generation in vivo of <italic>c-myc</italic>/<italic>IgH</italic> lymphomagenic translocations, analogous to those found in human Burkitt lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). AID promotes <italic>c-myc</italic>/<italic>IgH</italic> translocations in a deaminase- and uracil-N-glycosylase&#x02013;dependent fashion, which indicates that CSR and <italic>c-myc</italic>/<italic>IgH</italic> chromosome translocations are initiated through a common mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). In addition, AID can mutate a significant number of genes expressed in germinal center B cells, including the protooncogenes <italic>Bcl-6</italic>, <italic>c-myc</italic>, and <italic>Pim1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Moreover, AID lymphomagenic potential has been revealed in IL-6&#x02013; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), myc- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), Bcl6- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), and pristane-induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) B cell neoplasias.</p><p>Several mechanisms have been proposed to regulate AID expression and function and, expectedly, to reduce the risk of unwanted DNA damage. These mechanisms include the restriction of AID activity or of mutagenic resolution mostly to Ig DNA sequences, limiting AID nuclear concentration by regulation of its subcellular localization and phosphorylation (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Regarding the regulation of AID expression, although it is mostly restricted to activated B cells, recent findings have shown that low expression levels can be detected in immature B cells, in response to some viral infections, and occasionally in non&#x02013;B cells, at least in certain inflammation-associated neoplasic situations (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA molecules that can regulate gene expression by affecting either the stability or the translation efficiency of their target mRNAs. Gene expression regulation by miRNAs has been involved in several processes that include development and differentiation, cell proliferation, cell death, and neoplasic transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). In addition, miRNA expression analysis of different neoplasias, particularly lymphomas, has revealed specific profiles associated with particular malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Recently, miRNAs have been shown to regulate some aspects of normal B cell differentiation and function. miR-181a promotes B cell differentiation in the bone marrow, miR-155 is involved in the generation of germinal center and plasma B cells, and miR-150 controls B cell development and response through the regulation of c-Myb transcription factor (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). However, the role of miRNAs in the regulation of AID-dependent reactions in activated B cells has not been specifically addressed. In this work, we have screened for miRNAs involved in the regulation of CSR and have identified miR-181b, which regulates AID expression posttransciptionally in B cells.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>miR-181b expression impairs the CSR reaction</title><p>To determine whether specific miRNAs are involved in the regulation of the CSR reaction, we performed a functional screen of an miRNA expression library containing 150 clones. miRNA sequences, including their genomic context, were cloned into a retroviral vector harboring a GFP cassette for tracking purposes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Independent miRNAs were retrovirally transduced into primary B cells from wild-type mouse spleens, and CSR efficiency to IgG1 isotype in the presence of LPS and IL-4 was evaluated (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080579/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080579/DC1</ext-link>). We found that expression of miR-181b resulted in the most profound decrease of the CSR rate as compared with B cells transduced with an empty control vector (55 &#x000b1; 15%; Fig. S1, B and C). This effect was observed after 2 d of miR-181b expression but became more apparent at later time points (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Both in the mouse and human genomes, two isoforms of miR-181b can be expressed from two different loci. These isoforms are referred to as miR-181b-1 and miR-181b-2 and are identical in their mature forms, but their genomic contexts are slightly different. We found that transduction of either miR-181b-1 or miR-181b-2 precursors resulted in a similar reduction of CSR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). miR-181b is member of an miRNA family (miR-181a-d) that is highly conserved in vertebrates while being absent from other phyla (Fig. S2). Interestingly, overexpression of miR-181a-1 or miR-181a-2, whose mature forms differ from miR-181b's by only three nucleotides, failed to induce a similar effect on the efficiency of CSR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). These results indicate that miR-181b expression in primary B cells interferes with CSR.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>miR-181b expression reduces CSR efficiency.</bold> (A) Representation of the pre-miRNA&#x02013;GFP retroviral vector. (B) miR-181b-1 and -2 isoforms, but not miR-181a-1 or -2 isoforms, decrease CSR. Primary B cells were activated with LPS &#x0002b; IL-4 and were transduced with vectors containing the indicated pre-miRNAs (x axis). CSR efficiency was measured by FACS analysis of IgG1 expression 4 d after retroviral transduction. Bars indicate the mean percentage of IgG1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells within the subset of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, transduced cells, normalized to the value obtained in control-transduced cells.

(C) miR-181b reduces CSR efficiency. B cells were activated and transduced as in B. IgG1 CSR efficiency of B cells transduced with control (left) or miR-181b (right) pre-miRNA retroviral vectors was analyzed by flow cytometry after 4 d in culture in the presence of LPS &#x0002b; IL-4. Analysis of IgG1/B220 expression gated on GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from three independent representative experiments is shown. Percentages indicate the proportion of IgG1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (within the GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transduced population) in the displayed gates.

(E) miR-181b does not affect B cell proliferation. Splenic B cells were labeled with PKH26, and were activated and transduced as in B. The proliferation of transduced cells was assessed by measuring PKH26 dilution in GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells after 2 (top), 3 (middle), or 4 (bottom) d of LPS &#x0002b; IL-4 stimulation. Histograms show representative flow cytometry profiles of PKH26 (continuous line, control-transduced cells; dashed line, miR-181b&#x02013;transduced cells). Bars underneath the histograms show the percentage of cells that have undergone each of the indicated cell divisions, as calculated with ModFit software (black bars, control-transduced cells; white bars, miR-181b&#x02013;transduced cells). Error bars show SD values (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 2). (F) miR-181b expression is regulated upon B cell activation.

RNA was isolated as in F and retrotranscribed, and mature miR-181b was amplified by real-time PCR. Bars show the amount of miR-181b (in zeptomole/ng RNA) at each time point as calculated with an miRNA reference panel (Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080579/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080579/DC1</ext-link>).

To assess whether miR-181b&#x02013;induced reduction of CSR could be caused by a defect in B cell proliferation, we labeled B cells with PKH26 dye and analyzed cell division in control- and miR-181b&#x02013;expressing cells. We found that B cells transduced with control or miR-181b vectors display very similar profiles of proliferation at all time points analyzed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Similar proliferative activity was also found by analyzing the percentage of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells throughout the cultures (Fig. S3 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080579/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080579/DC1</ext-link>). In addition, no significant differences in cell survival or plasma cell generation were observed in miR-181-b versus control-transduced B cells (Fig. S3, B and C). Therefore the CSR impairment induced by miR-181b is not caused by defective proliferation, altered survival, or enhanced plasma cell differentiation.</p><p>To assess the miRNA expression profile of CSR-stimulated B cells, we performed array analysis of LPS &#x0002b; IL-4&#x02013;activated versus mature resting B cells. B cell activation resulted in a shift of miRNA expression featuring the down-regulation of a large number of miRNAs and a dramatic increase of a reduced number of miRNAs, including miR-155 and miR-217 (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080579/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080579/DC1</ext-link>), whose expression has been associated with B cell neoplasias. Interestingly, our array analysis showed that miR-181b is down-regulated in stimulated compared with nonstimulated B cells (Fig. S4). To confirm this observation, we analyzed miR-181b expression in B cells at different time-points of LPS &#x0002b; IL-4 cultures both by Northern blotting and by real-time PCR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, F and G;</xref> and Fig. S5). We found that mature miR-181b expression is highest at day 0, drops at day 1 (mean &#x0003d; 18 &#x000b1; 7%), and increases moderately later to reach &#x0223c;50% of initial levels after 3 d of culture (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>). Quantitative analysis of miR-181b expression in transduced B cells showed that our miRNA overexpression assay yielded a 3.3 &#x000b1; 2.9-fold increase at day 3 of culture (Fig. S6), and therefore that it restores miR-181b levels found in resting, mature B cells. We conclude that miR-181b decreases CSR efficiency and that its expression is down-regulated upon B cell activation. miR181 miRNAs are predominantly expressed in the lymphoid system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>) (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), and miR-181a has been shown to promote B cell differentiation and to fine tune the activation thresholds of thymocytes (for review see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>]). These findings suggest that the miR-181 family can have an evolutionarily conserved role in the regulation of adaptive immunity.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of miR-181b mRNA targets</title><p>To gain insights into the putative mRNA targets of miR-181b, we profiled mRNA expression shifts upon miR-181b expression.

The most significant contribution for target recognition involves the six to eight nucleotides located in the 5&#x02032; end of the miRNA, and it is termed seed sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). To identify putative miR-181b targets, we assessed the presence of minimal seed complementation in the 3&#x02032;UTRs of miR-181b&#x02013;down-regulated mRNAs, as defined by containing the sequences 5&#x02032;-GAATGT-3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-AATGTT-3&#x02032;, or 5&#x02032;-TGAATG-3&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>).

To assess whether putative miR-181b binding sites in AID mRNA are phylogenetically conserved, we analyzed AID 3&#x02032;UTR sequences from the human, dog, and zebrafish. There is no experimental data on the rat AID 3&#x02032;UTR sequence, and only a 60-nucleotide long expressed sequence tag from the chicken 3&#x02032;UTR, which lacks a polyA sequence, is found in the databases, very likely reflecting that this UTR is not complete.

in miR-181b&#x02013;transduced when compared with control-transduced primary B cells (32% reduction; P &#x0003d; 0.004; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Similar results were obtained in the Ramos Burkitt lymphoma cell line (not depicted) or when protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting (52 &#x000b1; 8%; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). In contrast, a reduction of AID levels was not observed in B cells transduced with miRNAs 19b, 30b, or 149 (Fig. S7, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080579/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080579/DC1</ext-link>), indicating that this effect is specific for miR-181b. We conclude that miR-181b expression in CSR-activated primary B cells results in the down-regulation of AID both at the mRNA and protein levels, and that the AID 3&#x02032;UTR contains putative binding sites for miR-181b. The observed AID reduction is physiologically relevant, as we have found that AID expression level in activated B cells is limiting both for the CSR reaction and for the generation of <italic>c-myc</italic>/<italic>IgH</italic> chromosome translocations, as revealed in AID<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (unpublished data). Therefore, AID down-regulation induced by miR-181b can account for the observed reduction in CSR.</p></sec><sec><title>AID is a direct target for miR-181b</title><p>To assess whether miR-181b promotes AID down-regulation by direct targeting of its 3&#x02032;UTR, we performed luciferase reporter analysis. Alignment analysis showed that mouse and human AID 3&#x02032;UTRs in fact contain multiple putative binding sequences for miR-181b (Fig. S8, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080579/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080579/DC1</ext-link>). Luciferase constructs were developed that contain each of the miR-181b putative binding sites identified in the mouse AID 3&#x02032;UTR (BS1-3), or mutated versions of the same (mutBS1-3). Reporter constructs, which included a firefly luciferase cassette to allow internal Renilla luciferase activity normalization, were transiently cotransfected together with miR-181b duplexes into 293T cells, and luciferase activity was analyzed 24 h later (Fig. S9 shows raw values of luciferase measurements). We found that transfection of the BS1 and BS2 constructs in the presence of miR-181b resulted in a significant decrease of luciferase activity when compared with their mutant counterparts mutBS1 (85 &#x000b1; 9%) and BS2 (45 &#x000b1; 9%; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>), whereas transfection of BS3 did not affect luciferase activity (Fig. S9 and not depicted). Besides AID, we have found that miR-181b expression results in the down-regulation of several genes, a subset of which contain minimal seed sequences for miR-181b in their 3&#x02032;UTRs. Although we cannot rule out that other target genes could play a minor role in the CSR impairment induced by miR-181b, none of these genes are known to directly participate in the CSR reaction.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>AID is a direct target of miR-181b.</bold> (A) Luciferase reporter assays of NIH-293T cells transfected with luciferase constructs containing AID&#x02013;miR-181b putative binding sites. Cells were cotransfected with miR-181b miRNA duplexes along with wild-type (BS1 and BS2) or mutated versions (mutBS1 and mutBS2) of the miR-181b putative binding sites in the mouse AID 3&#x02032;UTR. The sequences included in each luciferase construct are shown in Table S3 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080579/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080579/DC1</ext-link>).

(B) miR-181b and AID mRNA expression assessed by quantitative RT-PCR in Burkitt (closed triangles), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (closed circles), and Mantle cell lymphoma (open diamonds) human B cell lines. The expression of miR-181b and AID was normalized to their expression in primary human B cells, which has been given an arbitrary value of 1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2052199f03"></graphic></fig><p>Finally, to address whether miR-181b could play a physiological role in the control of AID expression in B cells, we analyzed miR-181b and AID expression by real-time PCR in a collection of Burkitt, mantle cell lymphoma, and diffuse B cell lymphoma human B cell lines. None of the lymphoma cell lines were found to coexpress high levels of AID and miR-181b (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>), which indeed suggests that high expression of miR-181b may prevent the accumulation of high amounts of AID transcripts.</p><p>AID mRNA levels are low in resting B cells and dramatically increase 2 d after stimulation with LPS &#x0002b; IL-4 (Fig. S10, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080579/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080579/DC1</ext-link>). In contrast, miR-181b levels are highest in nonstimulated cells, drop upon stimulation, and increase steadily afterward (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, F and G</xref>). While this manuscript was under review, two reports have shown that AID 3&#x02032;UTR contains functional sites for miR-155 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), an miRNA with pleiotropic effects on B cell function, including plasma cell generation and lymphomagenesis (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Removal of the miR-155 site from the AID 3&#x02032;UTR results in an increase of AID levels, slightly enhances CSR, and promotes <italic>c-myc</italic>/<italic>IgH</italic> translocations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). miR-155 transduction failed to reduce CSR efficiency in our overexpression assay (Fig. S1), most likely because of the high levels of this miRNA already present in activated B cells. It is tempting to speculate that miR-181b and miR-155 have nonoverlapping functions in regulating AID expression, with miR-181b preventing premature AID activity while allowing proper AID transcriptional activation at early time points and with miR-155 narrowing its function at a later activation stage.</p><p>This work provides evidence for a new role of miRNAs in the control of the CSR reaction. We have shown that there is a differential miRNA expression profile in B cells undergoing CSR that shares remarkable similarities with miRNA profiles in human cancers, including overall miRNA down-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>) and a dramatic increase of very few miRNAs whose expression has been linked to B cell neoplasias. This observation may reflect that miRNAs contribute to the transformation propensity that seems associated with germinal center B cells. miRNA functional screening combined with miRNA profiling has allowed to identify miR-181b as a negative regulator of the CSR reaction that directly targets AID. Consistent with this observation, miR-181b expression is reduced upon B cell activation, presumably allowing optimal efficiency of this reaction within the appropriate time window. miR-181b expression yields a moderate decrease of AID levels, which is nevertheless sufficient to promote a proportional impairment of CSR efficiency. This fine-tune regulatory mechanism highlights the importance of miRNAs in keeping the expression of target genes within narrow, physiological levels, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). By limiting AID expression, miR-181b could act as a tumor suppressor miRNA in B cells. In support of this hypothesis, miR-181b has been shown to target the <italic>Tcl-1</italic> oncogene in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and the loss of miR-181b expression has been shown to be associated to the aggressive form of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we have identified miR-181b as a modulator of endogenous AID expression. This finding represents a novel, posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism of AID activity in B cells that may be involved in restricting the lymphomagenic potential associated with this reaction.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Cell cultures.</title><p>The NIH-293T cell line was cultured in 10% FCS DMEM.
