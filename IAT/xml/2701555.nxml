Sera that recognized a 140-kd protein by immunoprecipitation were identified. The identity of the p140 autoantigen was investigated by immunoprecipitation/immunodepletion, using commercial monoclonal antibodies to NXP-2, reference anti-p140, and anti-p155/140, the other autoantibody recently described in juvenile DM.

No anti-p140 antibody&#x02013;positive patients were positive for other recognized autoantibodies. Immunodepletion suggested that the identity of p140 was consistent with NXP-2 (the previously identified MJ autoantigen). In children with anti-p140 antibodies, the association with calcinosis was significant compared with the rest of the cohort (corrected <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005, odds ratio 7.0, 95% confidence interval 3.0&#x02013;16.1). The clinical features of patients with anti-p140 autoantibodies were different from those of children with anti-p155/140 autoantibodies. The presence of HLA&#x02013;DRB1*08 was a possible risk factor for anti-p140 autoantibody positivity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study has established that anti-p140 autoantibodies represent a major autoantibody subset in juvenile DM.

The reported incidence is 0.8&#x02013;4.1 per million children per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Juvenile DM is chronic, potentially debilitating, and can be associated with significant morbidity. Due to the heterogeneity of the condition with multisystem disease, the clinical outcome (and thus prognosis) is difficult to predict. Certain clinical features, such as skin ulceration, calcinosis, gastrointestinal involvement, and respiratory disease, have been proposed as predictors of a severe disease course in juvenile DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>).</p><p>The precise etiology of IIMs is unknown, but there is increasing evidence to suggest an important role for autoimmunity. Knowledge of an autoantibody profile is an important cornerstone in the diagnosis of patients with a wide variety of autoimmune connective tissue disorders. Myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSAs) are being observed with increasing frequency in adult patients with IIM. There is now increasing evidence that MSAs are associated with homogeneous clinical subsets within the IIM spectrum, which can help predict clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). For example, autoantibodies directed against the aminoacyl&#x02013;transfer RNA synthetases (aaRS) form the largest group of MSAs in adult IIM and are associated with the antisynthetase syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Other well-described MSAs in adult IIM that are associated with specific clinical manifestations include anti-signal recognition particle (anti-SRP) and anti&#x02013;Mi-2 autoantibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p><p>To date, MSAs in juvenile myositis, including juvenile DM, have been less well characterized. Previous reports have described myositis-associated autoantibodies (MAAs), including anti&#x02013;PM-Scl and anti&#x02013;U1 RNP, in juvenile DM overlap syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Anti&#x02013;Mi-2 has been described more frequently, but this autoantibody specificity and others such as aaRS and anti-SRP are detected in a relatively small number of juvenile myositis cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Recently, our group and other investigators have observed that autoantibodies to a 155-kd protein and a 155/140-kd doublet protein are a major serologic subset in juvenile DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). In addition, anti-p155/140 autoantibodies appear to define a distinct clinical phenotype within the juvenile DM spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). A further autoantibody termed anti-MJ, which targets a 140-kd protein, has been described in a US cohort of patients with juvenile DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). The MJ autoantigen was recently identified as nuclear matrix protein NXP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we describe the prevalence, clinical associations, and immunogenetic associations of autoantibodies targeting a p140 protein in children recruited to the Juvenile DM Registry and Repository for UK and Ireland (JDRR) (for review, see refs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> and<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). We demonstrate that anti-p140 and anti-p155/140 are different autoantibody subsets and investigate the identity of the p140 target, which is likely to be the same as the previously identified MJ autoantigen NXP-2 (also termed MORC3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Patients and sera</title><p>The JDRR has recruited patients with juvenile-onset myositis, all of whom were younger than age 16 years at the time of disease onset and diagnosis, from 10 centers around the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). All patients had probable or definite myositis according to the diagnostic criteria described by Bohan and Peter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Demographic and serial clinical data were recorded at the time of diagnosis and prospectively at subsequent visits (approximately every 6 months). The clinical information recorded comprised specific cutaneous manifestations, including the presence of Gottron's lesions, skin ulceration, edema, calcinosis, and the distribution of skin rash over the body. Details on muscle involvement included muscle enzymes (creatine kinase [CK] and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]) and the Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale (CMAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) at baseline. Data were stored onto a central database, using anonymous codes. Serum and DNA samples were obtained at the time of diagnosis and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until required. Serum samples for serologic typing were available from 162 children recruited to the registry. DNA for genotyping was available from 100 Caucasian children with juvenile DM.</p><p>Clinical data were available for 160 children, 74% of whom were female. The median age at disease onset was 6 years (interquartile range [IQR] 3&#x02013;9 years), and the median age at the time of diagnosis was 7 years (IQR 4&#x02013;10 years). For this study, the median followup period from disease onset to the time of data analysis was 48 months (IQR 33&#x02013;72 months) for the overall cohort. One hundred thirty-seven children had juvenile DM. Juvenile DM&#x02013;scleroderma (juvenile DM&#x02013;SSc) overlap syndrome is well recognized in children with juvenile DM who have a history of Raynaud's phenomenon, sclerodactyly, and other sclerodermatous skin changes. In this study, 21 children were defined as having juvenile DM&#x02013;SSc overlap syndrome, with 2 or more of the above-mentioned features. Two children were defined as having other forms of juvenile myositis, not specifically juvenile DM or juvenile DM&#x02013;SSc overlap syndrome.</p><p>Sera from 124 juvenile disease control subjects (20 with scleroderma/linear scleroderma, 8 with systemic lupus erythematosus, and 96 with juvenile idiopathic arthritis) were also analyzed. No sera from healthy children were available, reflecting the ethical difficulties in studies of this nature. Therefore, sera from 50 healthy adult control subjects were also serotyped.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics approval</title><p>All patients or their parents gave fully informed written/parental consent to participate and provide biologic samples, according to the Declaration of Helsinki, under both national multicenter and local ethics committee regulations.</p></sec><sec><title>Indirect immunofluorescence</title><p>Indirect immunofluorescence was performed by standard methods, using Hep-2 cells and fluorescein-labeled anti-human IgG (Sigma, Poole, UK).</p></sec><sec><title>Protein immunoprecipitation (IP)</title><p>IP with K562 cell extracts was performed as previously described (23).

Beads were washed in IP buffer followed by Tris buffered saline buffer (10 m<italic>M</italic> Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 150 m<italic>M</italic> NaCl) before being resuspended in 50 &#x003bc;l sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer (Sigma). After heating, proteins were fractionated by 10% SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, enhanced, fixed, and dried. Labeled proteins were analyzed by autoradiography.</p></sec><sec><title>IP with mouse monoclonal anti&#x02013;NXP-2 and immunodepletion experiments</title><p>Ten microliters of anti-p140&#x02013;positive sera or 50 &#x003bc;l of commercial mouse antibody to NXP-2 (MORC3) (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan) was mixed with 100 &#x003bc;l of prewashed protein G Dynabeads (Dynal, Liverpool, UK) in sodium phosphate (pH 8.1, 0.1<italic>M</italic>) at room temperature for 30 minutes. The antigens were immunoprecipitated as described for IP, using <sup>35</sup>S-methionine&#x02013;labeled K562 cell extracts. Immunodepletion was performed to ascertain whether the IP pattern observed with anti-p140&#x02013;positive juvenile DM sera and the commercial antibody to NXP-2 was attributable to precipitation of the same antigen. This method was also used to confirm that anti-p155/140&#x02013;positive juvenile DM sera target a different protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Cell extracts were depleted of autoantibody targets, using a reference anti-p140&#x02013;positive juvenile DM serum, reference anti-p155/140&#x02013;positive juvenile DM serum, and normal serum as a negative control.</p><p>Briefly, duplicate samples, each of which contained 10 mg protein A&#x02013;Sepharose beads (when preparing predepleted p140 cell extract for IP with commercial anti&#x02013;NXP-2, 150 &#x003bc;l prewashed protein G Dynabeads was used) in 1 ml IP buffer and 50 &#x003bc;l anti-p140 serum (or 50 &#x003bc;l anti-p155/140 serum) were mixed at room temperature for 30 minutes. The beads were washed in IP buffer, and 1 tube (tube A) was placed on ice, while 120 &#x003bc;l <sup>35</sup>S-methionine&#x02013;labeled K562 cell extract and 380 &#x003bc;l IP buffer were added to tube B. Tube B was mixed at 4&#x000b0;C for 2 hours; the supernatant was transferred to the corresponding tube A, which was then mixed at 4&#x000b0;C for an additional 2 hours. The supernatant from the corresponding tube A (i.e., p140 antigen&#x02013;depleted cell extract or p155/140 antigen&#x02013;depleted cell extract) was stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. IP with depleted cell extracts was completed using 50 &#x003bc;l commercial anti&#x02013;NXP-2, different anti-p140 sera (10 &#x003bc;l), or different anti-p155/140 sera (10 &#x003bc;l).</p></sec><sec><title>HLA typing</title><p>DNA samples from Caucasian patients with juvenile DM were extracted from blood samples and analyzed using a standard phenol&#x02013;chloroform method.

Our study suggests that specific genetic and serologic profiles may also be associated with clinical phenotypes in juvenile DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). In this report, we describe the novel autoantibody specificity, anti-p140, in a UK cohort study of patients with juvenile DM. The presence of anti-p140 autoantibodies represents a major serologic subset in juvenile myositis; it was observed exclusively in juvenile DM and was not detected in any cases of juvenile DM&#x02013;SSc overlap syndrome. All anti-p140&#x02013;positive sera recognized the same polypeptide and did not immunoprecipitate any other known myositis autoantigens, including the anti-p155/140 autoantibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Combining the data from our UK juvenile DM cohort studies, anti-p140 and anti-p155/140 autoantibodies were detected in &#x0223c;40% of patients with juvenile DM, in contrast to a much lower frequency of anti&#x02013;Mi-2 and other myositis-specific or associated autoantibodies, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).</p><p>The confirmation of a further serologic subset in juvenile DM appears to have important clinical implications. Anti-p140 positivity was significantly associated with the presence of calcinosis when compared with the overall juvenile myositis cohort. In addition, anti-p140 and anti-p155/140 appear to define juvenile DM into 2 serologic subsets with more homogeneous clinical features. The results of this study, combined with our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), suggest that anti-p155/140&#x02013;positive patients have a wider distribution of skin disease, more cutaneous complications including edema or ulceration, and possibly overall higher disease activity but a significantly lower frequency of calcinosis compared with anti-p140&#x02013;positive patients.</p><p>The clinical differences observed between anti-p140&#x02013;positive patients, anti-p155/140&#x02013;positive patients, and patients with neither of these specificities are not explained by differences in the time to disease onset or disease duration. This is an interesting observation, because a factor suggested to influence the development of calcinosis is persistent active disease, including chronic cutaneous inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). The association between serotype and clinical phenotype suggests that the targeted autoantigens p140 and p155/140 may play a role in the pathogenesis of skin and soft tissue complications in juvenile DM. In addition, HLA&#x02013;DRB1*08 is a possible immunogenetic risk factor for the development of anti-p140 autoantibodies in Caucasian children with juvenile DM.</p><p>Based on previous work that showed an association with the tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;) 308A allele, increased production of TNF&#x003b1;, and calcinosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>), future studies to investigate for other potential susceptibility genes, including TNF polymorphisms, in juvenile DM patients with anti-p140 or anti-p155/140 autoantibodies would be of major interest.</p><p>The p140 protein targeted by an autoimmune response in our juvenile DM cohort study is consistent with NXP-2, the MJ autoantigen described in preliminary reports in a US juvenile DM cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). NXP-2 has nuclear matrix&#x02013;binding, RNA-binding, and coiled-coil domains that are structurally separated, which may implicate a role in diverse nuclear functions including regulation of transcriptional and RNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Previously described DM-specific autoantigen targets in children and adults, Mi-2 and p155/140 (p155; transcription intermediary factor 1 gamma) (31,32), are nuclear proteins that also mediate gene transcription. It is of further interest to note that autoantibodies to small ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme (SAE), which is involved in posttranscriptional modification termed sumoylation, have been described in adult DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). To date, anti-SAE autoantibodies have not been detected in juvenile myositis sera (Gunawardena H: unpublished observations). However, NXP-2 has been shown to be a sumoylation target involved in transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>), which may suggest potential shared pathogenic mechanisms in both juvenile and adult DM.</p><p>In conclusion, anti-p140 autoantibody is a clinically important serologic marker that is observed with a high frequency in patients with juvenile DM and is associated with calcinosis, a complication of the disease that confers significant morbidity. In the future, routine testing for these novel autoantibodies (anti-p140 and anti-p155/140) at the time of disease onset could have prognostic value and identify those children who are at risk of more severe disease, which may influence management. Furthermore, increasing our understanding of autoimmune targets and their relationship to the clinical phenotype in juvenile myositis may provide further insight into pathogenic pathways that in turn will stimulate new therapeutic approaches.</p></sec><sec><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>All authors were involved in drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content, and all authors approved the final version to be published.
