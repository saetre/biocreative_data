One of the four clones analyzed contained an mRNA region encoding the total amino acid sequence of this enzyme subunit and the complete 3'-noncoding region. The nucleotide sequence indicates that this enzyme subunit has 209 amino acids (calculated Mr=23,307) distinct from other glutathione S-transferase subunits such as Ya and Yc. Comparison of the amino acid sequences between these proteins indicates that glutathione S-transferase P subunit gene has been evolved from the ancestral gene at an earlier stage than the separation of Ya and Yc and that there are at least three domains having a considerable homology with each other in these enzymes. The very large increase of this mRNA in chemically induced hepatocellular carcinoma suggests a characteristic derepression of this gene during hepatocarcinogenesis.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00311-0047-a" xlink:role="6055"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00311-0041.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6049"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00311-0042.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6050"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00311-0043.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6051"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00311-0044.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6052"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00311-0045.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6053"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00311-0046.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6054"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00311-0047.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6055"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00311-0048.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6056"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00311-0049.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6057"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
