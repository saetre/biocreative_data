In the Arabidopsis genome, there are five <italic>VIM</italic> genes that share very high sequence similarity and encode proteins containing a PHD domain, two RING domains, and an SRA domain. To gain further insight into the function and potential redundancy among the VIM proteins, we investigated strains combining different <italic>vim</italic> mutations and transgenic <italic>vim</italic> knock-down lines that down-regulate multiple <italic>VIM</italic> family genes. The <italic>vim1 vim3</italic> double mutant and the transgenic <italic>vim</italic> knock-down lines showed decreased DNA methylation primarily at CpG sites in genic regions, as well as repeated sequences in heterochromatic regions. In addition, transcriptional silencing was released in these plants at most heterochromatin regions examined.

Proteins that bind methylated cytosines and also help maintain that DNA modification are important linchpins in a self-propagating system mediating memory of epigenetic states. We previously demonstrated that the VIM1 (VARIANT IN METHYLATION 1) protein from the flowering plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> binds DNA that contains methylated cytosine and is required for complete methylation and compaction of centromeric DNA. In this study, we show that VIM1 works in concert with two related proteins, VIM2 and VIM3, to maintain cytosine methylation not only at centromeres but throughout the genome. VIM proteins act specifically in the DNA methylation pathway that targets CpG dinucleotides, which plants share with animals, rather than the plant-specific non-CpG methylation pathways. Loss of <italic>VIM1</italic>, <italic>VIM2</italic>, and <italic>VIM3</italic> function also causes a reduction in transcriptional gene silencing at a variety of sequences, and leads to abnormal developmental phenotypes, including late flowering associated with loss of <italic>FWA</italic> gene silencing.

Elevated levels of 180-bp repeat transcripts from both strands were detected in the <italic>vim1 vim3</italic> mutant and the two transgenic <italic>vim</italic> knock-down lines, suggesting that DNA hypomethylation of the 180-bp centromeric repeats caused by VIM deficiency is associated with a loss of transcriptional silencing of these repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000156-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Next, we focused on the 5S rRNA genes, where loss of VIM function leads to dramatic changes in cytosine methylation. 5S rRNA genes are organized into pericentromeric tandem repeat arrays, and only a subset of the repeats is transcribed with the remainder being epigenetically silenced. To detect the release of 5S rRNA repeat silencing, we used primer pairs that detect two 5S transcript variants, resulting in amplification of 140 and 210 nucleotide products from cDNA templates prepared from wild-type Col plants. 5S-140 transcripts accumulated to a higher level in the <italic>vim1 vim3</italic> mutant and the transgenic <italic>vim</italic> knock-down lines compared to the wild-type Col genotype, but no significant increase in 5S-210 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000156-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

The importance of VIM2 is demonstrated by the more severe cytosine hypomethylation and loss of transcriptional silencing displayed by the <italic>vim1 vim2 vim3</italic> triple mutant compared to the <italic>vim1 vim3</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000156-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000156-g007">7</xref>). These results indicate that VIM1 is the major functional member of the VIM family with regards to DNA methylation and epigenetic silencing, while VIM3 and VIM2 (in descending order) play lesser roles in the examined loci. This functional hierarchy might reflect qualitative differences among VIM proteins or relative gene expression levels (<italic>VIM1</italic> is the most highly transcribed member of the gene family based on public databases: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mpss.udel.edu/at">http://mpss.udel.edu/at</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bbc.botany.utoronto.ca/efp">http://bbc.botany.utoronto.ca/efp</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Specificity of Cytosine Hypomethylation in <italic>vim</italic> Mutants</title><p>VIM proteins affect CpHpG as well as CpG methlyation at the 180-bp repeats and 45S rRNA genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000156-g002">Figure 2</xref>), while VIM proteins specifically affect CpG methlyation in other loci examined. One possibility is that CpHpG methylation in the centromere and 45S rRNA genes may be reduced as a secondary consequence of a loss of CpG methylation, as reported in <italic>met1</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000156-Saze1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, VIM proteins may have locus-specific regulatory mechanisms for maintaining DNA methylation.

The specificity may be determined by the primary sequence itself or sequence copy number. In addition, the activities of VIM proteins could be influenced by other proteins that have sequence specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>VIM and Flowering Time Control</title><p>The <italic>vim1 vim2 vim3</italic> triple mutant showed delayed flowering, and we uncovered <italic>FWA</italic> hypomethylation and ectopic <italic>FWA</italic> expression as one possible mechanism for this developmental phenotype.

One possibility is that the late flowering phenotypes in <italic>vim1 vim2 vim3</italic> triple mutant plants and plants overexpressing <italic>VIM1</italic> result from different mechanisms. Another possibility is that the late flowering phenotype in the VIM1 overexpression line might be caused by a dominant negative mechanism. The overexpressed VIM1-GFP fusion proteins could sequester other components for maintaining DNA methylation and epigenetic silencing. Alternatively, the <italic>VIM1</italic> transgene induce silencing of endogenous <italic>VIM</italic> genes, similar to the situation in our <italic>vim</italic>KD-A and <italic>vim</italic>KD-B transgenic lines.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Possible Mechanisms of VIM Action</title><p>The precise role of VIM proteins in epigenetic regulation remains an open question, but two plausible models are supported by previous reports and this study. The mammalian counterparts of VIM proteins exhibit a variety of activities that either directly modify histones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000156-Unoki1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000156-Citterio1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> or specifically recognize modified histones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000156-Karagianni1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Accordingly, we originally proposed that VIM1 affects DNA modification by acting at the chromatin &#x02013; cytosine methylation interface, possibly by modifying chromatin substrates for DNA methyltransferase activity. The preference for CpG hypomethylation in the <italic>vim</italic> mutants suggests that the MET1-mediated pathway is primarily affected by any alteration of the chromatin substrates. In the alternative model, which is based on the physical interaction of mammalian VIM homologs with DNMT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000156-Bostick1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000156-Achour1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, VIM proteins tether the DNMT1-class CpG methyltransferase MET1 to the replication fork. This model predicts that inactivation of the redundant VIM family proteins would phenocopy <italic>met1</italic> mutants &#x02013; a prediction supported by several observations. First, the <italic>vim1 vim3</italic> mutant and the transgenic <italic>vim</italic> knock-down lines showed a preference for CpG hypomethylation, similar to <italic>met1</italic> mutants. Second, these <italic>vim</italic> mutant lines exhibited CpHpH hypermethylation and a reduction in <italic>ROS1</italic> transcript level, two recently described characteristics of <italic>met1</italic> null mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000156-Huettel1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000156-Mathieu1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Third, the developmental phenotypes of the <italic>vim1 vim2 vim3</italic> mutant, including late flowering, resembled that of <italic>met1</italic> homozygotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000156-Kankel1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000156-Saze1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. The late flowering phenotype is likely to be caused in part by the ectopic expression of <italic>FWA</italic> associated with DNA hypomethylation of the upstream repeats observed in both <italic>met1</italic> and <italic>vim1 vim2 vim3</italic> mutants. Fourth, the reduction in 180-bp centromere and 5S rRNA gene repeat methylation in the <italic>vim1 vim2 vim3</italic> triple mutant matched the extreme hypomethylation observed in the <italic>met1-3</italic> null mutant. The parallels between the <italic>vim1 vim2 vim3</italic> mutant and <italic>met1</italic> mutants argue that the VIM proteins are essential components of the MET1-mediated cytosine methylation pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant Materials and Growth Conditions</title><p>Seeds of <italic>vim</italic> T-DNA insertion mutants were obtained from the SALK T-DNA collection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000156-Alonso1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> through the Arabidopsis Biological Resources Center at The Ohio State University.
