Therapy targeted to a specific patient based on his or her genetically determined pathophysiology responsible for the disease offers the possibility of significantly improving patient care and reducing costs. However, despite the clear public health and economic benefits that would be attained by such an approach, this paradigm has not been successfully applied to a common disease.</p><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is responsible for 75&#x00025; of deaths among individuals with diabetes, and yearly expenditures for CVD in diabetes exceed $200 billion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>). Neither conventional risk factors nor the degree of glycemic control adequately predict which individuals with diabetes develop CVD, suggesting the existence of genetic susceptibility factors.</p><p>A polymorphism in the haptoglobin (Hp) gene may define which individuals with diabetes are at greatest risk of CVD. There exist two classes of alleles at the Hp locus denoted 1 and 2 with three possible Hp genotypes 1-1, 2-1, and 2-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>). In five independent longitudinal studies performed in ethnically and geographically diverse groups, individuals with the Hp 2-2 genotype and diabetes were found to have a two- to fivefold increased risk of CVD compared with diabetic individuals without the Hp 2-2 genotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). The prevalence of the Hp 2-2 genotype in the diabetic population in most Western countries is &#x0223c;40&#x00025;, making this a common polymorphism.</p><p>The Hp polymorphism differs from nearly all polymorphisms being assessed in genome-wide association studies because it is a functional polymorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>). Understanding functional differences between the Hp 1 and Hp 2 allelic protein products, particularly in diabetes, may provide insight into why Hp 2-2 diabetic individuals have more CVD and how this increased burden of disease might be reduced. The most well-understood function of Hp is to bind Hb released from erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>). Each day, &#x0003e;6 g Hb is released into the bloodstream due to turnover of erythrocytes, and heme iron in this Hb is a powerful oxidizing agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). Hp, which is present in a 400-fold molar excess to free Hb under normal conditions, binds Hb, reducing its ability to mediate oxidative modifications and directing its removal from the blood via the monocyte/macrophage CD163 Hp-Hb scavenger receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>).</p><p>More than 5 years ago, motivated by in vitro studies demonstrating that the Hp 2-2 protein provides inferior protection against Hb-mediated oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>), coupled with the suggested importance of oxidative stress in diabetic atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>), we sought to determine whether antioxidant therapy might be particularly beneficial to the Hp 2-2 diabetic cohort. We first tested this hypothesis by examining stored samples from the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study, which had failed to demonstrate benefit from vitamin E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). We found that myocardial infarction and CVD death were reduced by &#x0003e;40 and 50&#x00025;, respectively, in Hp 2-2 diabetic HOPE participants who received vitamin E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). To prospectively test the hypothesis, we initiated a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study of vitamin E in 1,434 Hp 2-2 diabetic individuals (Israel Cardiovascular Events Reduction with Vitamin E &#x0005b;ICARE&#x0005d; Study). We found that vitamin E supplementation was associated with a &#x0003e;50&#x00025; reduction in the combined primary outcome of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death in Hp 2-2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>).</p><p>Enthusiasm for these findings, despite the considerable public health and economic benefits that they suggest, has been muted. Our study comes in the wake of numerous large clinical trials that failed to demonstrate that vitamin E provides any protection against CVD and may be harmful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>). Further hampering acceptance of this paradigm is the lack of a rational pathophysiological and pharmacogenomic mechanism to explain why Hp 2-2 diabetic individuals have an increased risk of CVD and how vitamin E mitigates this risk. In this study, we sought to provide a rationale for the pharmacogenomic application of the Hp genotype to prevent CVD in diabetes by elucidating the unique structural modifications and dysfunctional nature of HDL in Hp 2-2 diabetic individuals and how these structural and functional changes in HDL are rapidly reversed with vitamin E.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Ethical approval.</title><p>These studies were approved by the institutional review boards of the Rambam Medical Center and the Technion.

NCT00314379) was performed in 18 Hp 2-2 diabetic individuals who were not on antioxidant therapy at baseline (baseline characteristics provided in supplementary Table 1 available in an online appendix at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db08-0450">http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db08-0450</ext-link>). Blood was taken at baseline (test 1). Participants were randomly allocated to initially receive vitamin E or placebo for 2 months, after which another blood sample was taken (test 2), and this initial treatment was stopped.

We tested this hypothesis by injecting <sup>125</sup>I-Hp-Hb into Hp 1-1 or Hp 2-2 mice with or without diabetes. The half-life of Hp 1-1&#x02013;Hb was &#x0223c;20 min with or without diabetes. The half-life of Hp 2-2&#x02013;Hb was &#x0223c;50 min in mice without diabetes and &#x0003e;100 min in mice with diabetes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Hp is an HDL-associated protein in humans.</title><p>Hp has been shown by some but not all investigators to be an HDL-associated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>). Critical analysis of these prior studies suggested that the key difference in these studies was in the manner in which the HDL was prepared. We assessed the presence of Hp in human HDL prepared from serum by either ultracentrifugation or immunoabsorbtion (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). We found that Hp is present in the HDL when the HDL is prepared by immunoabsorbtion but not if the HDL is prepared by ultracentrifugation. Although we found that Hp is present in the HDL of all individuals, because the Hp 2-2 protein is made up of 3&#x02013;10 disulfide-linked Hp monomers compared with the Hp 1-1 protein, which is made up of only 2 disulfide-linked Hp monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>), significantly more Hp was detected in the HDL of Hp 2-2 individuals (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The amount of Hb associated with HDL is increased in Hp 2-2 diabetic individuals.</title><p>The binding of Hp to HDL and the high affinity of Hp for Hb suggested that Hp may tether Hb to HDL. Furthermore, the impaired clearance of Hp 2-2&#x02013;Hb in diabetes would suggest that there might be more of the complex associated with HDL in Hp 2-2 diabetic mice or humans. We first investigated this possibility by assessing <sup>125</sup>I-Hp-Hb in the HDL immunoprecipitate and found a dramatic increase, representing &#x0003e;25&#x00025; of all injected cpm, in the amount of Hp 2-2&#x02013;Hb associated with HDL in Hp 2-2 diabetic mice (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). However, in mice genetically deficient for Hp (Hp knockout), no <sup>125</sup>I-Hb was found associated with HDL (zero cpm in HDL immunoprecipitate), demonstrating that Hp is critical for binding of Hb to HDL.</p><p>Parallel studies were performed in humans. First, we incubated serum from Hp 1-1, Hp 2-2, or Hp 0 (individuals in whom Hp was not detectable by gel electrophoresis) with <sup>125</sup>I-Hb and assessed the amount of radioactive label in the HDL immunoprecipitate. We found significantly greater Hb associated with HDL in Hp 2-2 serum (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p>We then assessed the amount of endogenous Hb associated with HDL in Hp 1-1 and Hp 2-2 mice and humans with and without diabetes by Western blot. We detected substantial amounts of Hb associated with HDL in &#x0003e;90&#x00025; of Hp 2-2 diabetic individuals but failed to find Hb associated with HDL in any Hp 1-1 diabetic individuals or in any individuals (Hp 1-1 or Hp 2-2) without diabetes (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). Similarly, we found a marked increase in the amount of endogenous Hb associated with HDL in Hp 2-2 diabetic mice (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The HDL of Hp 2-2 diabetic humans contains redox active iron and has increased lipid peroxides.</title><p>The increased association of the pro-oxidant Hb with HDL in Hp 2-2 diabetic individuals may result in the increased oxidative modification of HDL-associated lipid and proteins and may paradoxically make the HDL a pro-oxidant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>). We assessed oxidation of HDL-associated lipids in the HDL of Hp 1-1 and Hp 2-2 diabetic individuals and found a marked increase in the amount of lipid peroxides in the HDL of Hp 2-2 diabetes (1.8 &#x000b1; 0.2 nmol/&#x003bc;g HDL vs. 1.2 &#x000b1; 0.2 nmol/&#x003bc;g HDL, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 20, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.04). HDL from Hp 2-2 diabetic individuals was also associated with an increased amount of iron capable of mediating oxidation (4.4 &#x000b1; 0.8 pmol redox active iron/&#x003bc;g HDL vs. 1.8 &#x000b1; 0.5 pmol redox active iron/&#x003bc;g HDL, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 20, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>The HDL in Hp 2-2 diabetes is dysfunctional.</title><p>We assessed the ability of serum from Hp 1-1 or Hp 2-2 diabetic mice or humans with type 1 or type 2 diabetes to promote cholesterol efflux from macrophages in vitro. We found a significant 30&#x02013;40&#x00025; decrease in HDL function in Hp 2-2 diabetes compared with Hp 1-1 diabetes (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). No differences were found between Hp 1-1 and Hp 2-2 in the absence of diabetes or between Hp 1-1 with and without diabetes (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>HDL oxidative modification and dysfunction can be corrected in Hp 2-2 diabetes with vitamin E.</title><p>We assessed the ability of vitamin E to reduce HDL oxidative modification (HDL-associated lipid peroxides) and to improve HDL function in Hp 1-1 or Hp 2-2 diabetic mice. We found that vitamin E had no effect on HDL lipid peroxides or function in Hp 1-1 diabetic mice. However, vitamin E significantly improved HDL function and reduced HDL lipid peroxides in Hp 2-2 diabetic mice, restoring function and reducing lipid peroxides to levels similar to those found in Hp 1-1 diabetes (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>In humans, we assessed the ability of vitamin E to improve HDL function and reduce HDL-associated lipid peroxides in Hp 2-2 diabetes in a crossover study. We found that vitamin E significantly improved HDL function by 30&#x02013;40&#x00025; and reduced HDL lipid peroxides by 20&#x02013;30&#x00025;. Notably, in this crossover design we found that after vitamin E had restored HDL function and reduced lipid peroxides and the vitamin E was then withdrawn, HDL function deteriorated, and HDL-associated lipid peroxides increased to levels seen at baseline within 2 months after cessation of vitamin E supplementation (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this translational study, we have provided a pathophysiological and pharmacogenomic rationale as to why vitamin E may provide cardiovascular benefit to individuals with the Hp 2-2 genotype and diabetes (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). The main reason why Hp 2-2 diabetic individuals appear to uniquely derive benefit from vitamin E is that there is substantially more Hb associated with the HDL of Hp 2-2 diabetic individuals. This key structural difference between HDL in Hp 1-1 and Hp 2-2 diabetic individuals is the result of an impairment in the CD163-mediated clearance of Hp-Hb in Hp 2-2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>).</p><p>The association of Hb with HDL results in the oxidative modification of HDL-associated proteins and lipids. The loss of function of HDL may be the direct result of its oxidative modification. Hb can oxidize ApoA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>), and oxidation of ApoA1 interferes with its ability to promote cholesterol efflux from macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>). Oxidative modification of HDL-associated lipids can result in the inactivation of HDL-associated antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase and paraoxonase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>).</p><p>A binding site for Hp on ApoA1 (amino acid residues 141&#x02013;164) has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>). Interestingly, lecithin acyl transferase (LCAT), whose activity is dependent on its binding to ApoA1, binds to ApoA1 residues 159&#x02013;170 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>). Hazen and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>) have shown that nitration or oxidation of Tyr166 in ApoA1 results in an inhibition of the binding of LCAT to ApoA1. We have previously demonstrated a marked decrease in LCAT activity in Hp 2-2 diabetic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). We propose that binding of Hp-Hb to a site adjacent to the LCAT binding site may result in the nitration or oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>) of Tyr166, resulting in an impairment in LCAT activity. An impairment in LCAT activity would be expected to impair the maturation of HDL and its ability to promote cholesterol efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>). We have found a very tight correlation between LCAT activity and cholesterol efflux in diabetic individuals (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.81, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0002) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>).</p><p>The ability of Hb associated with HDL in Hp 2-2 diabetic individuals to sequester nitric oxide (NO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>) may have a clinical significance that is of greater importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>) than the effect of Hb on the function of HDL in reverse cholesterol transport. HDL in Hp 2-2 diabetes may actually be proatherogenic and prothrombotic by limiting NO bioavailability.</p><p>These mechanisms are also relevant to the atherosclerotic plaque. Plaque hemorrhage is recognized as an important determinant of plaque stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>). The Hp genotype may determine the response to plaque hemorrhage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>). Impaired clearance of Hb in Hp 2-2 diabetic plaques may lead to oxidative modification of HDL within the plaque and an impairment of its ability to promote reverse cholesterol transport.</p><p>The current focus of the medical community toward HDL has been to increase its concentration. The hypothesis presented here may help to explain the dramatically increased CVD risk in patients with type 1 diabetes, despite a usually normal HDL and lipoprotein profile. Moreover, increasing the amount of HDL in individuals in whom the HDL is dysfunctional and potentially proatherogenic may actually be harmful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>). We believe that this is the first demonstration in humans that HDL function can be improved in a specific population with vitamin E. However, not all HDL dysfunction can be attributed to Hb-mediated oxidation, and consequently, not all individuals would be expected to improve the quality of their HDL with vitamin E, as we have demonstrated here with Hp 1-1 diabetes.</p><p>In conclusion, we believe that we have provided a pathophysiological and pharmacogenomic rationale as to why vitamin E may provide benefit to the Hp 2-2 diabetic cohort. The potential public health and economic benefits from application of this paradigm are enormous.

There was a significant improvement in efflux with vitamin E treatment (test 1-test 2 in cohort 1, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.004; test 2-test 3 in cohort 2, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.04) and no change with placebo treatment (test 1-test 2 in cohort 2, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.33). Of note in cohort 1, test 3 is not significantly different from the baseline value, demonstrating that even though vitamin E improved HDL function (compare test 1-test 2), after a 2-month period without vitamin E, HDL function deteriorated to baseline levels (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.13 comparing test 1-test 3 in cohort 1). <italic>B</italic>: Reduction in HDL-associated lipid peroxides with vitamin E. There was a significant reduction in lipid peroxides with vitamin E treatment (test 1-test 2 in cohort 1, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.03; test 2-test 3 in cohort 2, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.01) and no change with placebo treatment (test 1-test 2 in cohort 2, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.35). Of note in cohort 1, test 3 was not significantly different from the baseline value, demonstrating that even though vitamin E reduced lipid peroxides (compare test 1-test 2), 2 months after the vitamin E was stopped, lipid peroxides returned to baseline levels (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.31 comparing test 1-test 3 in cohort 1).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zdb0100854610006"></graphic></fig><fig position="float" id="f7"><label>FIG. 7.</label><caption><p>Hb released intravascularly from erythrocytes (RBC) is rapidly bound by Hp protein to form an Hp-Hb complex.
