Previous work identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) responsible for much of the response to selection on growth in mice, effecting a change in body mass of approximately 20&#x00025;. By fine-mapping, we have resolved the location of this QTL to a 660-kb region containing only two genes of known function, <italic>Gpc3</italic> and <italic>Gpc4,</italic> and two other putative genes of unknown function. There are no non-synonymous polymorphisms in any of these genes, indicating that the QTL affects gene regulation. Mice carrying the high-growth QTL allele have approximately 15&#x00025; lower <italic>Gpc3</italic> mRNA expression in kidney and liver, whereas expression differences at <italic>Gpc4</italic> are non-significant. Expression profiles of the two other genes within the region are inconsistent with a factor responsible for a general effect on growth. Polymorphisms in the 3&#x02032; untranslated region of <italic>Gpc3</italic> are strong candidates for the causal sequence variation. <italic>Gpc3</italic> loss-of-function mutations in humans and mice cause overgrowth and developmental abnormalities.

In cases where there is heritable variation in gene expression, it is not clear what magnitude of difference is sufficient to contribute to phenotypic variation without substantial deleterious effects. These issues are particularly relevant to the further identification of genes responsible for complex trait variation. Numerous studies use expression microarrays to identify genes underlying trait variation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030135-b07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030135-b08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030135-b09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030135-b10">10</xref>&#x0005d;, and yet such approaches will not detect coding sequence variation or subtle differences in expression.</p><p>An archetypal model for complex trait variation is body size, but with the exception of a few Mendelian mutations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030135-b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030135-b12">12</xref>&#x0005d;, no gene contributing to quantitative variation in this trait has been identified in animals. In previous work that examined lines of mice divergently selected for body size, we showed that much of the selection response is due to a large-effect QTL on chromosome (Chr) X that causes an approximately 20&#x00025; difference in growth rate between homozygotes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030135-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030135-b14">14</xref>&#x0005d; and explains 14&#x00025; of the phenotypic variance at 6 wk in an F<sub>2</sub> cross between the selection lines &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030135-b15">15</xref>&#x0005d;.

Rather, it is due to variation segregating within the initial population, which was derived from a cross between two inbred and one outbred strains. This scenario contrasts with the &#x0201c;high growth&#x0201d; mutation <italic>(hg),</italic> which arose during selection for increased growth rate in a different set of selection lines &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030135-b16">16</xref>&#x0005d; and resulted from a disruption of <italic>Socs2 (suppressor of cytokine signalling 2),</italic> which eliminated the expression of this gene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030135-b12">12</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>To determine the molecular basis of the X-linked QTL, we fine-mapped the QTL by progeny testing, searched for sequence polymorphisms in annotated coding regions, and examined the expression of all genes within the target region.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Fine-Mapping</title><p>The QTL had previously been mapped to a region of approximately 2 cM, or 2.6 Mb &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030135-b14">14</xref>&#x0005d;. By further progeny testing, we refined the location of the QTL to an approximately 660-kb region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030135-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The entire effect of the QTL is attributable to this region, as demonstrated by three recombinant families: families 103 and 105 segregate for the QTL region and for the phenotypic effect of the QTL, whereas family 101 does not segregate for either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030135-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030135-t001">Table 1</xref>).

There is no evidence of a significant effect of genotype on numbers of high- and low-allele mice at weaning (512 and 554, respectively; &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 1.65; <italic>p</italic> = 0.2). For litter size, congenic females homozygous for the high-line QTL allele have somewhat higher performance than females homozygous for the low-line allele (mean &#x000b1; standard error, 5.38 &#x000b1; 0.22 versus 4.78 &#x000b1; 0.18, respectively; <italic>t</italic><sub>198</sub> = 2.13; <italic>p</italic> = 0.03).</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we fine-mapped a growth QTL to a region containing only two genes of known function, found no coding sequence variation in these two genes, and demonstrated significant differences in the transcript levels of <italic>Gpc3</italic>. The phenotypic and expression differences between QTL genotypes are consistent with known loss-of-function mutations and knock-out phenotypes (i.e., reduced or absent <italic>Gpc3</italic> expression leads to increased body size). These results underscore the potential impact of relatively small changes in expression levels on phenotype.</p><p>Our results show that a gene underlying a Mendelian disease in humans can contribute to quantitative variation in mice. Unlike loss-of-function mutations, allelic variation in <italic>Gpc3</italic> had no pathological side-effects that we were able to detect; it affected growth rate only, and did so at all ages and in all tissues that we studied &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030135-b27">27</xref>&#x0005d;. This work provides further evidence that the glypicans are involved in normal growth processes in addition to their role in Simpson&#x02013;Golabi&#x02013;Behmel syndrome and a variety of cancers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030135-b32">32</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title/><sec id="s3a1"><title>Experimental mice</title><p>The inbred low line and a congenic for a high-line segment of Chr X were described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030135-b14">14</xref>&#x0005d;. We continued marker-assisted backcrossing to the low line to produce an interval-specific congenic strain containing a 14-cM segment of Chr X from the high line on the low-line background, with a contribution from high-line autosomes of less than 0.1&#x00025;. The mice used in this study were at backcross generation 10&#x02013;12. All experiments were carried out in accordance with U.K. Home Office regulations.</p></sec><sec id="s3a2"><title>Progeny testing</title><p>Heterozygous females from the interval-specific congenic strain were crossed with low-line males, and mice recombinant between DXMit226 and DXMit68 were used for progeny testing. Recombinant males and females were crossed with low-line mice to produce families that segregated for the recombinant segment. Body weights at 6 wk of age from the progeny were recorded and flanking markers genotyped. Further genotyping using a range of microsatellite markers established the recombination breakpoints; microsatellite primer sequences are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st004">Table S4</xref>. PCR genotyping was carried out on DNA extracted from ear clip or tail clip samples &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030135-b14">14</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s3a3"><title>Maximum likelihood analysis</title><p>The marker allelic states and phenotypes of the progeny test dataset were analysed by maximum likelihood interval mapping &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030135-b14">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Briefly, each recombination event was assumed to have been replicated across litters, and the phenotypic and flanking marker data at a given chromosomal position were used to estimate a hemizygous effect in males; homozygous and heterozygous effects in females; normally distributed litter effects; and effects for litter size, parity, and sex. Likelihood ratio for the model with a QTL relative to that for the reduced model with no QTL was calculated every 0.1 cM in the region of interest, and converted to a LOD score. There were 937 males and 972 females in the dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s3a4"><title>Post-mortem and histology analysis</title><p>A total of 34 mice, matched for genotype and sex, were sacrificed between 8 and 16 wk of age and immediately underwent a comprehensive post-mortem and histological investigation. Tissue samples were fixed in 10&#x00025; phosphate-buffered formalin and processed routinely. Sections were cut at 4 &#x003bc;m and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Samples of all major organ systems were examined (urinary, cardiovascular, respiratory, alimentary, endocrine, reproductive, haemolymphatic, integumentary, musculoskeletal, and central nervous systems). Standard histopathological analysis was carried out and morphologic abnormalities recorded (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st003">Table S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3a5"><title>DNA sequencing</title><p>Sequencing was carried out in forward and reverse directions using DYEnamic ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kits (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) on an ABI Prism 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States) according to manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing primer sequences are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st005">Table S5</xref>. <italic>Gpc3</italic> is a large gene with almost 340 kb of intronic sequence. We therefore sequenced only a subset of the intronic regions, focusing on regions with high sequence conservation between mouse and human to increase the likelihood of finding functional sequences. Conserved regions were identified using the &#x0201c;Detailed view&#x0201d; of ContigView at the Ensembl Web site &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030135-b20">20</xref>&#x0005d; (displayed using the &#x0201c;Compara&#x0201d; menu).</p></sec><sec id="s3a6"><title>RT-PCR</title><p>Transcript levels were examined in kidney and liver from 47 newborn mice from seven litters that were segregating for the QTL region (23 low-allele mice and 24 high-allele males or heterozygous females). Tissue samples were collected into RNAlater solution (Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States) and stored at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C until required. Total RNA was isolated from tissue using Qiashredder homogenisers (Qiagen) and RNAEasy Extraction kits (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. We performed RT-PCR using One Step RT-PCR kits (Qiagen) with the addition of RNAsin RNase inhibitor (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States). Reaction conditions were optimised for each gene tested and for each tissue type to ensure the PCR reactions did not reach saturation. Specifically, we determined the number of PCR cycles and starting RNA concentration such that the amount of product varied linearly with RNA concentration. RT-PCR primer sequences are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st006">Table S6</xref>, and RT-PCR conditions are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st007">Table S7</xref>.

For both genes, all three primer pairs yielded products of the expected size from &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; genotype RNA. Furthermore, because we sequenced the coding region using cDNA (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st005">Table S5</xref>), we know that the entire genes are expressed for both alleles. Quantitative measurement of expression levels was performed using only one of the primer pairs per gene (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st006">Table S6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3a7"><title>RT-PCR product quantification by DHPLC</title><p>RT-PCR products were quantified using a WAVE denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography instrument at an oven temperature of 50 &#x000b0;C. We sampled 5 &#x003bc;l of each RT-PCR product on a DNASep column. Samples were eluted from the column using an acetonitrile gradient in a 0.1 M triethylamine acetate buffer (pH 7), at a constant flow rate of 0.9 ml min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The gradient was created by mixing eluent A (0.1 M triethylamine acetate and 0.1 M tetrasodium EDTA) and eluent B (25&#x00025; acetonitrile in 0.1 M triethylamine acetate) according to the manufacturer's specifications (Transgenomic, Omaha, Nebraska, United States). Each litter of mice was measured for all three genes in one assay to eliminate variation due to differences between runs. Transcript levels of <italic>Gpc3</italic> and <italic>Gpc4</italic> were expressed relative to that of <italic>&#x003b2;-actin</italic> by dividing the amount of <italic>Gpc3</italic> or <italic>Gpc4</italic> product by that of <italic>&#x003b2;-actin</italic>. Because the RT-PCR and quantification provided only an index of transcript levels, these are in arbitrary units.
