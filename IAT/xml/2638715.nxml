In B-deficient areas, B is often supplied as fertilizer, but excess B can be toxic to both plants and animals. Generation of B deficiency-tolerant plants could reduce B fertilizer use. Improved fertility under B-limiting conditions in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> by overexpression of BOR1, a B transporter, has been reported, but the root growth was not improved by the BOR1 overexpression. In this study, we report that enhanced expression of <italic>NIP5;1</italic>, a boric acid channel for efficient B uptake, resulted in improved root elongation under B-limiting conditions in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. An <italic>NIP5;1</italic> activation tag line, which has a T-DNA insertion with enhancer sequences near the <italic>NIP5;1</italic> gene, showed improved root elongation under B limitation. We generated a construct which mimics the tag line: the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S RNA promoter was inserted at 1,357&#x02009;bp upstream of the <italic>NIP5;1</italic> transcription initiation site. Introduction of this construct into the <italic>nip5;1-1</italic> mutant and the <italic>BOR1</italic> overexpresser resulted in enhanced expression of <italic>NIP5;1</italic> and improved root elongation under low B supply. Furthermore, one of the transgenic lines exhibited improved fertility and short-term B uptake. Our results demonstrate successful improvement of B deficiency tolerance and the potential of enhancing expression of a mineral nutrient channel gene to improve growth under nutrient-limiting conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd>Boron</kwd><kwd>Channel</kwd><kwd>Deficiency tolerance</kwd><kwd>Nodulin 26-like intrinsic proteins</kwd><kwd>Transporter</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Boron (B) is an essential element for plants (Marschner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">1995</xref>). B is mainly present in cell walls and cross-links rhamnogalacturonan-II, a pectic polysaccharide (Kobayashi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">1996</xref>, Ishii and Matsunaga <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">1996</xref>, O&#x02019;Neill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">1996</xref>). Reduction of cross-linked rhamnogalacturonan-II resulted in suppressed growth of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (O&#x02019;Neill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2001</xref>), demonstrating that B is required as one of the cell wall components. B deficiency is reported in &#x0003e;80 countries (Shoroccks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">1997</xref>). B-deficient symptoms first appear in the growing point of plants, and typical symptoms include inhibition of root elongation, expansion of leaves and fertilization (Dell and Huang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">1997</xref>). Therefore, a continuous supply of B is important for normal growth through vegetative and reproductive stages. In the B-deficient areas, B is supplied as fertilizer, but the usage of B fertilization needs to be tightly controlled because B accumulation potentially causes toxicity problems. Generation of B deficiency-tolerant plants could reduce B fertilizer use and potential toxicity problems. Regulation of B transport is among the strategies to generate such plants.</p><p>Understanding of B transport mechanisms at the molecular level has advanced greatly in the last several years (for a review, see Takano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2008</xref>). Two different types of transporters, BOR1 and NIP5;1, were identified as B transport molecules required for efficient B translocation under B-limited conditions in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (Takano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2002</xref>, Takano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2006</xref>).</p><p>BOR1 is a boric acid/borate transporter for xylem loading (Takano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2002</xref>) identified as a causual gene for the <italic>bor1-1</italic> mutant of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. The <italic>bor1-1</italic> mutant exhibited severe shoot growth inhibition and reduced fertility under low B conditions (Noguchi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">1997</xref>) and is defective in B translocation from roots to shoots (Noguchi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2000</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>BOR1</italic> under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S RNA (CaMV 35S) promoter resulted in improved shoot growth and fertility under B-deficient conditions (Miwa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2006</xref>).</p><p>NIP5;1 is a member of the major intrinsic protein (MIP) family and has been identified as a boric acid channel required for plant growth under low B conditions in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (Takano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2006</xref>). MIPs are channels for water and/or small non-charged molecules (Wallace et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2006</xref>). MIPs are grouped into four subfamilies: the plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIPs), the tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs), the nodulin 26-like intrinsic proteins (NIPs) and the small basic intrinsic proteins (SIPs). NIP5;1 belongs to the NIP subfamily and mediates boric acid transport (Takano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2006</xref>). Under low B conditions, <italic>NIP5;1</italic> is up-regulated at the mRNA level and <italic>NIP5;1</italic> mutants exhibited severe growth reduction both in shoots and roots.</p><p>As overexpression of <italic>BOR1</italic> under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter improved shoot growth and fertility under B deficiency (Miwa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2006</xref>), we tried the same approach with <italic>NIP5;1</italic> without success (data not shown). However, we succeeded in generating plants with elevated tolerance to low B levels by inserting the CaMV 35S enhancer into the promoter region of <italic>NIP5;1</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Root growth was improved in the NIP5;1 activation tag lines under limited B conditions</title><p>Because overexpression of <italic>NIP5;1</italic> under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter did not result in improved growth under low B supply (data not shown), we tried another approach. Two independent <italic>NIP5;1</italic> activation tag lines (GABI 297G11 and 046C12), which carry T-DNA insertions upstream of the initiation codon of the <italic>NIP5;1</italic> gene (Rosso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2003</xref>), were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>A). <italic>NIP5;1</italic> mRNA levels in roots were increased by 2-fold in both lines compared with wild-type plants (<bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/pcn168/DC1">Supplementary data 1</ext-link></bold>). The activation tag lines were grown on solid medium containing various concentrations of B, and shoot fresh weights and primary root lengths were measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>B, C). In GABI 297G11, root length was 1.8 and 1.4 times longer than that of the wild-type plants on medium containing 0.03 and 0.1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M B, respectively. The root length of GABI 297G11 was similar to that of the wild type at 0.3 and 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;M B. There was no significant difference in shoot fresh weight compared with the wild-type plants under all conditions examined. In GABI 046C12, root lengths on medium containing 0.03&#x02009;&#x003bc;M B were 1.5 times longer than those of the wild-type plants; however, shoot fresh weight was reduced to about 50% of that of wild-type plants under B limitation. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Growth of <italic>NIP5</italic>;<italic>1</italic> activation tag lines.

GABI 297G11 was selected because, unlike the case of GABI 046C12, it exhibited growth enhancement without inhibitory effects on shoot growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>B, C).

There are several reports on improvement of growth by modulating expression of MIPs (for a review, see Hachez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2006</xref>). Overexpression of an <italic>A. thaliana</italic> PIP, PIP1b, resulted in an increased plant growth rate, transpiration rate, stomatal density and phytosynthetic efficiency in tobacco plants (Ahron et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2003</xref>). Stress-induced overexpression of OsPIP1;3/OsRWC3 leads to higher root osmotic hydraulic conductivity, leaf water potential and transpiration, but does not change morphology in rice plants (Lian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2004</xref>). These studies report changes of growth properties related to water conditions, but there has been no report of enhanced growth under nutrient deficiency by modulating expression of a MIP. This study represents the first successful demonstration of improved growth under nutrient deficiency by enhancement of MIP expression. Recently some MIPs have been shown to mediate transport of various physiologically important molecules, such as CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, silicon or lactic acid (Choi and Roberts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2007</xref>, for a review, see Maurel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2007</xref>). Enhancement of expression of these MIPs may improve plant growth under various conditions.</p><p>In the case of <italic>NIP5;1</italic> the situation is different from previous work in that introduction of <italic>NIP5;1</italic> under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter did not improve plant growth under B-limiting conditions (data not shown). The CaMV 35S promoter is a constitutive promoter that induces gene expression in all cell types and strongly in vascular tissues (Benfey and Chua <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">1990</xref>), and its expression is not induced by B deficiency (Takano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2005</xref>). <italic>NIP5;1</italic> is expressed in epidermal, cortical and endodermal cells, but weakly in stellar cells in roots, and it is strongly induced by low B conditions (Takano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2006</xref>). Incompatibility between cell type specificity and/or low B induction may be a reason why <italic>Pro35S:NIP5;1</italic> did not improve plant growth under B deficiency. Native promoter regions may be important to maintain specific expression patterns required for NIP5;1 function in B transport. In support of this hypothesis, induction of <italic>NIP5;1</italic> expression under B deficiency was maintained in <italic>Pro35S-NIP5;1:NIP5;1</italic> plants. As shown in <bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/pcn168/DC1">Supplementary data 1</ext-link></bold>, <italic>NIP5;1</italic> expression in <italic>Pro35S-NIP5;1:NIP5;1</italic> plants (n05, n19, B01, B02 and B22) was 9.1- to 13.0-fold higher under B-limiting conditions than under adequate B supply. This induction was similar to the case of wild-type plants which exhibited 14.5-fold induction.</p><p>NIP5;1 is a boric acid channel required for efficient import of B into roots (Takano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2006</xref>). The <italic>NIP5;1</italic> mutants exhibited severe growth defects in both roots and shoots under limited B supply (Takano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2006</xref>), suggesting that NIP5;1 is important for overall B intake into plants. In this study, we demonstrated that enhanced expression of <italic>NIP5;1</italic> improved root growth more effectively than shoot growth under B limitation, suggesting that NIP5;1 is important for supplying B to roots to be used for their elongation.</p><p>This observation also implies that enhanced expression of NIP5;1 is not sufficient to enhance shoot growth. It is likely that xylem loading needs to be improved for shoot growth in the transgenic plants with enhanced expression of <italic>NIP5;1</italic>. BOR1 is responsible for xylem loading of B under low B conditions in the wild-type plants. Overexpression of <italic>BOR1</italic> resulted in enhanced xylem loading of B and improved shoot growth but not root growth under low B (Miwa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2006</xref>). Given the different roles of <italic>NIP5;1</italic> and <italic>BOR1</italic> in B transport, we expected that enhancement of <italic>NIP5;1</italic> expression in the BOR1 overexpression background, in which xylem loading activity is enhanced, would result in shoot growth improvement. In our study we obtained such a line (line B01) with higher levels of both <italic>BOR1</italic> and <italic>NIP5;1</italic> expression. This line exhibited greatly enhanced shoot growth and improved fertility under low B conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). B translocation into shoots was increased more in B01 compared with BOR1OX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>) and this is likely to cause development of the branches and increased seed yields. We fully acknowledge that results from a single transgenic line cannot be conclusive, but highly expressed <italic>NIP5;1</italic>, a boric acid channel to facilitate the passive transport of boric acid from the soil to root cells, is likely to facilitate B flow effectively through the concentration gradient generated by BOR1 across the root diameter. We propose that collective enhancement of NIP5;1 and BOR1 is an effective strategy to improve B flow from soil to xylem across roots.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated successful improvement of B deficiency tolerance by enhanced expression of B transport proteins. The approach to enhance expression of transporters while keeping their cell type specificity or response to nutrient conditions might generate transgenic plants tolerant to many types of nutrient deficiency and toxicity around the world.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant material and plasmid constructions</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (L.)
