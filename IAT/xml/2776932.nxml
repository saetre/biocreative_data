The cytoplasmic Lsm1&#x02013;7p complex promotes mRNA decapping and localizes to processing bodies, whereas the Lsm2&#x02013;8p complex takes part in a variety of nuclear RNA processing events. The structural features that determine their different functions and localizations are not known. Here, we analyse a range of mutant and hybrid Lsm1 and Lsm8 proteins, shedding light on the relative importance of their various domains in determining their localization and ability to support growth. Although no single domain is either essential or sufficient for cellular localization, the Lsm1p N-terminus may act as part of a nuclear exclusion signal for Lsm1&#x02013;7p, and the shorter Lsm8p N-terminus contributes to nuclear accumulation of Lsm2&#x02013;8p. The C-terminal regions seem to play a secondary role in determining localization, with little or no contribution coming from the central Sm domains. The essential Lsm8 protein is remarkably resistant to mutation in terms of supporting viability, whereas Lsm1p appears more sensitive. These findings contribute to our understanding of how two very similar protein complexes can have different properties.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Lsm1&#x02013;7p</kwd><kwd>Lsm2&#x02013;8p</kwd><kwd>nuclear localization</kwd><kwd>P-bodies</kwd><kwd><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has at least two different heteroheptameric Sm-like (Lsm) complexes. The exclusively nuclear Lsm2&#x02013;8p complex consists of the Lsm2 to Lsm8 proteins and forms the core of the spliceosomal U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>]. It is required for the stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>] and nuclear localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>] of U6 snRNA, as well as for pre-mRNA turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>]. In addition, various nuclear Lsm proteins interact with and/or are required for the processing of stable RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>]. A second complex is formed by the Lsm1 to Lsm7 proteins and localizes exclusively to the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>]. This Lsm1&#x02013;7p complex promotes mRNA decapping by Dcp1p/Dcp2p and subsequent degradation by Xrn1p 5&#x02032;- to 3&#x02032;-exonuclease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>]. These and various other proteins involved in deadenylation, decapping and decay accumulate in cytoplasmic foci, termed processing bodies (P-bodies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>]. Under conditions that warrant high levels of mRNA turnover such as osmotic shock or glucose starvation, P-bodies increase in number and size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>]. The exact function of the Lsm1&#x02013;7p complex is still unknown, but it is thought to act as a chaperone, remodelling mRNPs at a step following deadenylation, thereby promoting decapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>]. A recent report that Lsm1&#x02013;7p has higher affinity for shortened poly(A) tails suggests that increased binding to partially deadenylated RNAs may initiate this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>]. Lsm2&#x02013;8p is similarly thought to act as a chaperone, promoting U4/U6 di-snRNP formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>].</p><p>Not much is known about what makes these two closely related complexes localize to different subcellular sites. We previously showed that nuclear accumulation of Lsm2&#x02013;8p depends on importin &#x003b2;/Kap95p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>] and Nup49p, and that nuclear exclusion of Lsm1&#x02013;7p does not depend on Xpo1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>], but existing information on localization determinants within these complexes is minimal. Complex formation itself seems to be essential for Lsm1p and Lsm8p to localize to P-bodies and nuclei, respectively, suggesting that sequences present in multiple subunits combine to act as localization signals. Human LSm4 was shown to lose its localization to P-bodies when mutations were introduced in residues that are predicted to be involved in complex formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>], and in yeast, Lsm2p and Lsm7p fail to localize to P-bodies in cells deleted for <italic>LSM1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>]. In yeast, Lsm8p fails to accumulate in the nucleus when cells are depleted of Lsm2p or Lsm4p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>], and in mammalian cells, injected recombinant LSm8 localizes throughout the cell, whereas recombinant LSm2&#x02013;8 accumulates in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>]. Finally, it was recently shown that the C-terminal asparagine-rich domain of Lsm4p plays a role in Lsm1&#x02013;7p P-body localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>] and in P-body assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>], emphasizing the importance of residues outside Lsm1p and Lsm8p for the localization and function of these complexes.</p><p>In budding yeast, only one form of the homologous Sm complex exists; it forms the core of non-U6 spliceosomal snRNPs and accumulates in the nucleus. Like the Lsm complexes, the Sm complex consists of seven different subunits forming a donut shape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>]. The basic residues in the C-terminal protuberances of two of the yeast Sm complex subunits, SmB and SmD1 proteins, have been shown to form separate nuclear localization signals that are functionally redundant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>]. The human SmB, SmD1 and SmD3 proteins were shown to contain similar signals important for nuclear localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>]. Yeast Lsm8p is most closely related to SmB, with its C-terminus also containing a high level of basic lysine residues. However, although deletion of most of the C-terminus abolishes nuclear accumulation of the N-terminally green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged mutant protein, simultaneous mutation of six of these residues to alanine does not significantly affect localization, nor does this domain suffice for nuclear accumulation when fused to GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>]. This suggests that the Sm and Lsm2&#x02013;8p complexes may not share the same mechanism to effect their nuclear accumulation.</p><p>Tharun <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>] performed extensive mutational analysis of Lsm1p showing the importance of residues proposed to be involved in RNA binding and complex formation, and of the C-terminal region for the functional competence of the Lsm1&#x02013;7p complex. Although complex formation was proposed to be essential, mutations in the putative RNA-binding residues did not significantly affect Lsm1&#x02013;7p localization to P-bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>]. To investigate the requirement for different domains of the Lsm1 and Lsm8 proteins in their function and localization, we created a series of mutant and hybrid proteins. We deleted or exchanged their N- and/or C-terminal domains, exchanged the central Sm domains or, in the case of Lsm8p, made point mutations in putative RNA-binding residues.</p><p>We investigated the cellular localization of GFP-tagged versions of these proteins, as well as their ability to support growth. Besides clarifying the relative importance of different regions of the Lsm1 and -8 polypeptides for localization and viability, our study highlights the effect that epitope tagging can have on the functional competence of proteins, with some mutant proteins supporting viability when tagged on one end but not when tagged on the other. Most importantly, we show that, although none of the Lsm1p and Lsm8p domains is absolutely essential for P-body or nuclear localization, their contribution to proper localization varies. We find that the N-terminal domains have the biggest impact on localization, whereas the C-terminal domains seem to play a secondary role, with apparently no or little contribution of the central Sm domain beyond its role in complex formation. Because it is known that complex formation is essential for correct localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>], it is likely that residues from the N- and/or C-terminal domains form a nuclear exclusion or localization signal in combination with parts of other Lsm proteins.</p><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Production of Lsm1p and Lsm8p hybrids and mutants</title><p>In order to determine which regions of Lsm1p and Lsm8p should be tested by deletion or fusion in hybrid polypeptides, their amino acid (aa) sequences were aligned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>), and the 2D structural features analysed using the online 3D-PSSM server (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>]. The Lsm1 and Lsm8 polypeptides are most similar in the regions of the Sm1 and Sm2 motifs. These motifs form the Sm-fold, the hallmark of the Sm-like proteins, consisting of a five-stranded anti-parallel &#x003b2; sheet which is involved in intersubunit and protein&#x02013;RNA contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>]. Crystal structures and cross-linking data have shown that RNA-binding residues in Sm(-like) proteins are located in loop 3 (between &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;3, i.e. the Sm1 motif) and loop 5 (between &#x003b2;4 and &#x003b2;5, i.e. the Sm2 motif) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>]. The consensus sequences for these so-called Knuckle motifs in eukaryotic Sm and archaeal Sm-like proteins are [His/Tyr]&#x02013;Met&#x02013;Asn for Knuckle I and Arg&#x02013;Gly&#x02013;Asp for Knuckle II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>].

In addition, both proteins show potential &#x003b1;-helical structures in their C-terminal extensions, although a different 3D prediction for Lsm1p based on homology to an Sm-like archaeal protein from <italic>Pyrobaculum aerophilum</italic> (1m5q) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>] shows three anti-parallel &#x003b2; sheets in addition to a short &#x003b1; helix in the C-terminus of Lsm1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C</xref>). Despite the differences between these models, both show a structured Lsm1p C-terminus, whereas most of the N-terminal extension of Lsm1p is predicted to be unstructured. Based on alignment and structure predictions, we define the N-terminal domain of Lsm1p as aa 1&#x02013;51 and that of Lsm8p as aa 1&#x02013;10 for the purpose of this study. The C-terminal domain of Lsm1p is defined as aa 122&#x02013;172 and that of Lsm8p is aa 74&#x02013;109, with the remaining residues representing the central Sm domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2A</xref>).

Lsm1p has a seven amino acid linker between the Sm1 and Sm2 motifs, which Lsm8p lacks.

This indicates that the terminal extensions of Lsm1p and Lsm8p by themselves do not suffice as localization signals.

Deletion of the central Sm domain was previously shown to abolish nuclear accumulation of Lsm8p, but this is most likely because of a loss of complex formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>]. Therefore, to test whether this domain is essential for nuclear localization it was replaced with that of Lsm1p in Lsm818p, and the Sm domain of Lsm1p was replaced with that of Lsm8p in Lsm181p. Localization of these mutant proteins GFP-tagged at the N- or C-terminus was examined in live cells.</p><p>The C-terminal domain of Lsm8p is not essential for nuclear accumulation because both Lsm8&#x00394;Cp and Lsm881p accumulate in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref>). However, compared with GFP&#x02013;Lsm8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4D</xref>), both show increased cytoplasmic staining (the extent of which depends strongly on the placement of the tag), suggesting that the Lsm8p C-terminal domain does contribute to efficient nuclear localization. The N-terminal domain of Lsm8p is not required absolutely for nuclear accumulation, because both Lsm&#x00394;N88p and Lsm188p accumulate in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4B</xref>). However, reduced nuclear and increased cytoplasmic localization, particularly for Lsm188p, suggests that the Lsm8p N-terminal domain contributes to nuclear accumulation and that the Lsm1p N-terminal domain likely favours cytoplasmic localization. This is confirmed with Lsm811p, which has only the N-terminal 10 amino acids and no other part of Lsm8p, and shows nuclear accumulation, at least when tagged at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4B</xref>). Finally, nuclear localization of Lsm818&#x02013;GFP and failure of Lsm181p to accumulate in the nucleus suggests that the Sm domain of Lsm8p is neither essential nor sufficient for nuclear accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Effects of mutations in Lsm8p on its nuclear localization.

For example, loss of nuclear accumulation of N-terminally tagged mutant Lsm8 proteins may either be caused by masking of (part of) a localization signal, or by reduced complex formation because of steric hindrance by the N-terminal GFP tag. However, the first 20 amino acids of Lsm8p allow for increased nuclear localization when replacing the N-terminus of Lsm1p, suggestive of a more direct role for these residues in localization.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of RNA-binding mutations on Lsm8p nuclear localization</title><p>Three different mutations were created in putative RNA-binding residues in Lsm8p: <italic>lsm8 rna1</italic> (N28A, D31A) and <italic>lsm8 rna2</italic> (T34A, N35A) in or near the Knuckle I motif, and <italic>lsm8 rna3</italic> (R57A, G58W, S59A) in the Knuckle II motif. Based on analogous residues in Lsm1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>] these would be expected to form the RNA-binding pocket (T34, N35, R57, S59) or to be important for the positioning of these residues (D31, G58).

This contrasts with Lsm881p lacking <italic>rna</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref>), and suggests that mutations in and around the Knuckle motifs have a weak effect on Lsm8p localization, which becomes more apparent when combined with other mutations. We note that the fluorescence was very weak for the Lsm881 proteins with <italic>rna</italic> mutations despite seemingly unaffected expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>, lanes 11&#x02013;16). We cannot rule out that loss of nuclear accumulation is indirect, through reduced complex formation.</p></sec><sec><title>No single domain of Lsm1p is required absolutely for P-body localization, although the N-terminus does contribute</title><p>Because Lsm1p localizes exclusively to the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>] it seems likely that it has a nuclear exclusion signal that is formed either by its own residues or in combination with other Lsm1&#x02013;7p subunits. GFP-tagged Lsm1p localizes throughout the cell, excluding vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figs 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5A</xref>), when expressed from the <italic>MET25</italic> promoter in our constructs, making it difficult to directly identify a nuclear exclusion signal. Because Lsm1&#x02013;7p concentrates in P-bodies under stress conditions, we investigated whether any Lsm1p domain is required for localization to these foci. We tested deletion of the N- and/or C-terminal domains or replacement of the N-, C-terminal or Sm domains by those of Lsm8p in live <italic>lsm1&#x00394;</italic> cells during log phase growth or under stress conditions.</p><p>The Lsm1p C-terminal domain is not absolutely required for P-body localization because Lsm1&#x00394;Cp and Lsm118p localize to P-bodies under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5A</xref>). The N-terminal domain is not essential either, nor is the central Sm domain, because Lsm811p, Lsm&#x00394;N11p and Lsm181p localize to cytoplasmic foci under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5B</xref>). Localization of these hybrid proteins to P-bodies was reduced, however, because only 5&#x02013;20% of cells expressing Lsm811p, Lsm&#x00394;N11p or Lsm181p showed foci, compared with up to 50% of cells expressing Lsm1&#x00394;Cp or Lsm118p and &#x0003e; 90% of cells with GFP&#x02013;Lsm1. Notably, Lsm188p accumulates in cytoplasmic foci in 5&#x02013;20% of cells under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5B</xref>), suggesting that the N-terminal domain of Lsm1p is sufficient in combination with the Sm and C-terminal domains of Lsm8p (i.e. presumably in the context of an Lsm complex) to allow concentration in P-bodies, albeit with low efficiency. It is likely that reduced incorporation of some of these mutant proteins into the Lsm1&#x02013;7p complex explains, at least in part, the reduced accumulation in cytoplasmic foci. Accumulation of these mutant proteins in foci under stress conditions suggests that these foci are P-bodies. This is confirmed by colocalization of GFP&#x02013;Lsm1, GFP&#x02013;Lsm1&#x00394;C and GFP&#x02013;Lsm118 with Dcp2&#x02013;RFP after glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig05" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>No single Lsm1p domain is essential for localization to P-bodies.

A bigger change in the localization of mutant proteins with the N-terminal domain deleted compared with those with the C-terminal domain deleted is consistent with this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figs 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>). Hybrid proteins carrying the N-terminus of one protein and the Sm domain of the other localize according to the N-terminal contribution: Lsm81&#x00394;Cp shows nuclear accumulation and Lsm18&#x00394;Cp accumulates in cytoplasmic foci under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref>). Thus, in the absence of the C-terminal domain, the N-terminal domain, not the Sm domain, determines the subcellular localization. By contrast, Lsm&#x00394;N18p and Lsm&#x00394;N81p both show nuclear as well as focal accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B</xref>), although the C-terminal contribution seems to determine the preferred site of localization: nuclear for Lsm&#x00394;N18p and focal for Lsm&#x00394;N81p, indicating that the C-terminal domain overrules any contribution of the Sm domain. Similarly, both Lsm&#x00394;N11p and Lsm&#x00394;N88p accumulate in the nucleus as well as in cytoplasmic foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6C</xref>), with more foci for the former and a higher level of nuclear accumulation for the latter, indicating that in the absence of an N-terminal domain distinct localization is lacking. Finally, the Lsm1p Sm domain by itself (Lsm&#x00394;N1&#x00394;Cp) accumulates in both the nucleus and the cytoplasmic foci. The Lsm8p Sm domain shows extremely weak fluorescence, some of which localizes to vacuoles, no obvious nuclear accumulation and only very rare foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6D</xref>). Thus, in the absence of both N- and C-terminal extensions, the Sm domains of Lsm1p and Lsm8p do not have distinct subcellular localizations. The potential for P-body localization and nuclear accumulation of Lsm&#x00394;N1&#x00394;Cp suggests incorporation into Lsm complexes, although this is likely to be reduced. Most N-terminal deletion mutants also showed some foci under normal growth conditions, whereas their number and intensity increased in the stationary phase or after hypo-osmotic stress (data not shown). This suggests that these mutant Lsm proteins lacking N-terminal domains may aggregate under normal growth conditions. It remains to be determined whether they aggregate as part of Lsm complexes or by themselves.</p><fig id="fig06" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>The Lsm1p and Lsm8p N-terminal domains are required for distinct localization.

Reduced viability may also be caused by impaired U6 snRNA-binding ability of Lsm2&#x02013;8p complex containing mutant or hybrid proteins. To investigate complex formation and U6 binding we performed immunoprecipitations using extracts from cells expressing GFP-tagged recombinant proteins that were able to support the growth of <italic>lsm8&#x00394;</italic>. All recombinant proteins that were tested pull-down Lsm7p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8</xref>), suggesting that all are able to incorporate into Lsm complexes, at least to some extent. Complex formation is not affected or only slightly reduced for the <italic>rna</italic> mutants, whereas Lsm8&#x00394;Cp and Lsm811p pull-down Lsm7p at &#x0003e; 70% of the wild-type level. Complex formation is reduced by &#x0003e; 50% for all other mutants, with Lsm&#x00394;N88p most severely affected (3% of wild-type). U6 snRNA binding is reduced for all proteins tested, with binding least affected with the <italic>rna1</italic> mutant, whereas the <italic>rna3</italic> mutant shows severely reduced U6 binding despite almost normal complex formation. U6 snRNA binding is more strongly affected than complex formation for all mutant proteins with the exception of Lsm&#x00394;N88p. This suggests that each of the Lsm8p domains contributes to proper U6 binding, either directly or indirectly, by affecting the RNA-binding ability of the resulting heteroheptameric Lsm complex (see Lsm8&#x00394;C, Lsm818, Lsm881 and Lsm188). Minimal U6 binding by Lsm&#x00394;N11p and Lsm811p, despite significant nuclear accumulation of these proteins, suggests that Lsm1&#x02013;7p may have an intrinsically low affinity for U6 snRNA. Lsm&#x00394;N88p binds U6 snRNA at almost 40% of wild-type levels despite strongly reduced complex formation. This means that either this protein can bind U6 without forming a complete heteroheptamer, or Lsm2&#x02013;8p complexes are normally in excess over U6 snRNA. In the latter case, the Lsm2&#x02013;&#x00394;N88p complexes that do form may have normal affinity for U6 snRNA, but pull-down less because U6 is in excess over Lsm2&#x02013;&#x00394;N88p. U4 snRNA binding is less severely affected than U6 snRNA binding for all mutants, suggesting that a higher proportion of the mutant proteins are bound to the U4/U6 di-snRNP, than to the U6 snRNP, compared with wild-type.</p><fig id="fig08" position="float"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Analysis of complex formation and U6 snRNA binding of Lsm8 mutant and hybrid proteins.

The N-terminus, Sm domain and C-terminus of Lsm8p can be replaced with those of Lsm1p and still support viability, at least when moderately overexpressed from the <italic>MET25</italic> promoter. Although none of the Lsm8p domains is required absolutely in order for some level of nuclear accumulation to take place, each contributes to its exclusively nuclear localization. It seems that the N-terminal domain has the greatest effect on localization, the C-terminus plays a secondary role and the Sm domain probably only plays an indirect role by ensuring complex formation (e.g. Lsm818 accumulated in nuclei, whereas Lsm181 did not; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4C</xref>). Point mutations in putative RNA-binding residues within the Sm domain did not significantly affect nuclear localization.</p><p>Lsm1p seems to be more sensitive than Lsm8p to deletion or replacement of its domains, because few of the mutant and hybrid proteins supported growth at the nonpermissive temperature. Despite this, most still allowed for (some) accumulation in P-bodies under stress conditions, showing that none of the Lsm1p domains is required absolutely for this localization. However, a strong reduction in P-body localization of many of these mutant proteins shows that each of the domains does contribute to the accumulation in cytoplasmic foci. Similar to what we found for Lsm8p, there appears to be a hierarchy to the contribution of the Lsm1p domains to its localization. The N-terminus has the biggest effect on localization; the C-terminus plays a secondary role, determining the preferred localization in the absence of the N-terminus and the Sm domain may only contribute to localization through complex formation.</p><p>Mutant and hybrid Lsm1 and -8 proteins without the usual N-terminal domains showed some focal accumulation under normal growth conditions. Although at this point we have not formally ruled out the possibility that mutant proteins lacking the N-terminal domains are more prone to aggregation themselves, this raises the interesting possibility that the Lsm1p and Lsm8p N-termini prevent aggregation of the Lsm complexes, potentially by interacting with the prion-like C-terminal domain of Lsm4p. This asparagine-rich region of Lsm4p plays a role in Lsm1&#x02013;7p accumulation in P-bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>], as well as in P-body assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>], and was recently shown to display many characteristics of a true prion protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>]. It is plausible that the N-terminal domains of the neighbouring Lsm1 and -8 proteins could play a role in preventing aggregation of Lsm4p-containing complexes under normal growth conditions. Similarly, one could envisage a role for the Lsm1p N-terminus in the regulated accumulation of Lsm1&#x02013;7p complexes in P-bodies under stress conditions. It may do so by effecting conformational change and/or post-translational modification of the Lsm4p C-terminus in response to stress.</p><p>Although apparently important for the specific subcellular localization of Lsm complexes, the N- or C-terminal domains of Lsm8p and Lsm1p are not by themselves sufficient for the nuclear localization of GFP or for its accumulation in P-bodies. This suggests a more complex localization signal that is likely to include sequences from other Lsm subunits, most likely the neighbouring Lsm2p and/or Lsm4p. Alternatively, Lsm1p and Lsm8p may affect the conformation of other subunits and/or of the entire complex, leading to nuclear accumulation or exclusion. Nuclear accumulation in budding yeast of GFP&#x02013;hLSm1 and GFP&#x02013;hLSm8, both of which lack a long N-terminal extension, and of hybrid and mutant proteins lacking the &#x003b1;1 helix suggests that Lsm complexes may localize to the nucleus by default. The longer budding yeast Lsm1p N-terminus is therefore likely to act as part of a nuclear exclusion signal. However, when we fused 36 or 49 residues of the yeast Lsm1p N-terminus to human LSm1 there was no significant decrease in its nuclear accumulation (data not shown).</p><p>Because stabilization of U6 snRNA was proposed to be the only essential function of the Lsm2 to Lsm8 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>], the Lsm8p mutants and hybrids that support viability would be expected to bind and stabilize U6 snRNA. However, we found only a weak correlation between levels of U6 and U4/U6 RNA and cell viability, suggesting that additional functions of Lsm8p/Lsm2&#x02013;8p may contribute to the growth phenotypes of the mutant strains. Interestingly, mutants that show reduced levels of U4/U6 also show increased levels of total U4 RNA. This was also observed for <italic>lsm6&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>lsm7&#x00394;</italic> and particularly <italic>lsm5&#x00394;</italic> strains (our unpublished data), but only when analysing total cellular RNA levels, not when looking at RNA levels in splicing extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>]. It is unclear why defects in Lsm2&#x02013;8p should lead to an increase in the total level of U4 snRNA, but, considering the importance of Lsm2&#x02013;8p for recycling snRNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>], it may suggest higher stability of newly synthesized U4 snRNA compared with recycled U4 snRNA. Alternatively, Lsm2&#x02013;8p may be more directly involved in processing and/or degradation of U4 snRNA.</p><p>Dissection of the Lsm1p and Lsm8p proteins has shown that their localization is not determined by any single feature, and has proved useful in determining the relative contributions of various domains for their localization. Further examination of the specific effects these mutants and hybrids may have on particular processes, for example, U4/U6 annealing, may further elucidate how the Lsm1&#x02013;7p and Lsm2&#x02013;8p complexes function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast media, strains and plasmids</title><p>Yeast media and manipulations were as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>].
