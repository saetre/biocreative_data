The maintenance of the patency of the airspaces at end-expiration is heavily dependent on the phospholipid components and their interaction with SP-B and SP-C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. SP-B is encoded by a single gene (<italic>SFTPB</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and translated in the alveolar type II cells into a preproprotein (~40 kDa). Post-translational processing of pro-SP-B to yield mature SP-B is a multistep entirely intracellular process involving multiple sites and enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. SP-C is encoded by the <italic>SFTPC </italic>gene on chromosome 8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and the SP-C proprotein processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] is integrally linked to the metabolism of SP-B in that infants and mice with genetic SP-B deficiency exhibit incompletely processed pro-SP-C peptides of 6&#x02013;14 kDa in intra- and extracellular surfactant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In lung homogenates of most infants with <italic>SFTPB </italic>mutations, aberrant pro-SP-C forms (Mr 6&#x02013;12 kD) are observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Similarly, pro-SP-B forms of variable sizes have been detected in lung homogenates from some children with chronic lung disease but were predominantly absent in patients with <italic>SFTPB </italic>mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a commonly used first line diagnostic tool to sample the alveolar space content and this technique is much less invasive than open lung biopsy. Thus the profiles of SP-B, SP-C and their propeptide precursors present in the extracellular, intraalveolar space represent a potential diagnostic tool for assessment of neonatal and childhood lung disease.</p><p>Neonates with respiratory distress of unknown cause are likely candidates for abnormalities of SP-B and SP-C metabolism. Similarly, but much less appreciated, SP-B and SP-C abnormalities might play a role in infants or older children with chronic respiratory distress developing beyond the neonatal period. Pediatric pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare abnormality of the surfactant metabolism, characterized by the accumulation of large amounts of surfactant in the alveolar space, leading to gas exchange abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In contrast to the adult form of acquired PAP where GM-CSF autoantibodies appear to play a pathogenic role, the causes of pediatric PAP are as yet unresolved. In particular the characteristics of SP-B and SP-C peptides and their precursors in the alveolar space of pediatric patients with lung disease have not been described.</p><p>Using defined pediatric patient populations, Western blotting of BAL identified several distinct banding profiles for the hydrophobic surfactant proteins and their precursors. These data support the feasibility of using immunoanalyses of BAL fluid to evaluate chronic pediatric pulmonary disorders in more detail.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients, Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>The lavage effluents from 15 children without lung disease and 19 children with chronic obstructive bronchitis were used as controls or disease controls, for comparison with the lavage effluents that were available from our previously described cohort of neonatal, pediatric or juvenile patients with respiratory distress of unknown cause. These children were seen in western European medical hospital centers (mainly from France and Germany) and were analyzed for a genetic defect leading to deficiency in SP-B and SP-C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The lavage effluents from the children without lung disease were aliquots obtained previously in a study that assessed inflammation in children with chronic tracheostoma in comparison to these controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The lavage effluents were obtained during anesthesia for elective surgery for minor conditions. The usage of this material and that of the children with chronic bronchitis for this study was approved by the ethics committee at the University of Munich. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients where appropriate from age and from the caregivers.</p><p>Children with chronic obstructive bronchitis in whom anomalies of the airways, cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, gastro-esophageal reflux, immuno deficiencies, allergic asthma and passive smoke exposure were excluded as causes and in whom a lavage was performed during the diagnostic work up, were used as a disease control group.

Those bands never reacted with NFPROX, but showed reactivity with NFLANK, demonstrating that this was a processing intermediate generated by removal of the proximal N-terminal amino acids. A similar, but somewhat more truncated, 19&#x02013;21 kDa pro-SP-B fragment was detected sporadically in these children (Tab. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The pro-SP-B forms at 25&#x02013;26 and 19&#x02013;21 kDa were glycosylated as treatment with N-glycosidase F resulted in a significant drop in size for both peptides (not shown). A 40&#x02013;42 kDa form and a 34&#x02013;36 kDa form of pro-SP-B were rarely detected. Except for a single case when a 9 kDa C-terminal cleavage fragment was observed, in these children no other cleavage products of pro-SP-B processing were identified. Mature SP-C with M<sub>r </sub>of 5.0 kDa was present in both controls and children with chronic bronchitis, whereas pro-SP-C forms were never detected in BAL (Tabs. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Children with chronic bronchitis.

The major findings are the presence of mature SP-B and SP-C in all children, except those with SP-B deficiency, supporting the view that analysis of BAL for these surfactant proteins may aid in the diagnostic work up of children with severe respiratory distress. Overall pro-SP-C forms were rarely detected, and their presence was specific, but not pathognomonic for a SP-B deficiency due to <italic>SFTPB </italic>mutations. In addition, using epitope specific antisera, we identified unique pro-SP-B forms containing residues 145&#x02013;160 of proSP-B (i.e. the "NFPROX" epitope) exclusively in BAL from patients with alveolar proteinosis and chronic respiratory distress. Taken together, the data suggest that immunobiochemical analysis of BAL can detect abnormalities in surfactant biosynthesis and metabolism associated with a variety of parenchymal lung diseases.</p><p>Of the 6 patients with SP-B deficiency defined as a lack of mature SP-B on Western blotting, 4 had mutations in <italic>SFTPB </italic>(Tab. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Based on our results, the biochemical analysis of BAL fluid for mature SP-B, previously thought to be diagnostic for SP-B deficiency, is not 100% specific, as there are additional cause(s) leading to a lack of SP-B. Possible mechanisms include mutations or secondary changes in regulatory elements or other defects in the synthesis and secretion of surfactant, as recently shown for the ABCA3 transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>An important finding of this study is the regular detection of certain pro-SP-B peptides in <bold>BAL </bold>from children without bronchoalveolar disease. Most prominent was a 25&#x02013;26 kDa band, detected in almost all patients. This protein corresponds to removal of N'-terminal peptides from pro-SP-B, liberating 13&#x02013;15 kDa fragments. SP-B is synthesized as a proprotein by alveolar type II epithelial cells and non-ciliated bronchiolar (Clara) cells; however, complete processing of the precursor to the biologically active, mature peptide occurs only in type II cells. Clara cells merely generate the 25 and 42 kDa precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Thus, this intermediate represents a normal pro-SP-B processing intermediate of SP-B biosynthesis and could result from either constitutive secretion of this form by type II cells or from the physiologic release of 25 kD pro-SP-B into the airways by Clara cells. The 25&#x02013;26 kD bands of pro-SP-B have previously been described in amniotic fluid from a 24-week-old human fetus, in lung tissue from an infant with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia at the time of lung transplantation, as well as in normal adult lung tissue and lavages and plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Here we show that these peptides are released into the bronchoalveolar space in normal patients. Since lamellar bodies do not contain pro-SP-B, this likely occurs via constitutive, non-regulated secretory pathways.</p><p>In children with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis we discovered increased amounts of a 19&#x02013;21 kD intermediate which reacted against C-terminal pro-SP-B antisera and with the NFLANK SP-B antibody. This finding of a complex pro-SP-B intermediate containing both the C-terminal propeptide and a vestigial N-terminal propeptide (approximate residues 186&#x02013;201) extends the work of Brasch and colleagues who also noted the presence of pro-SP-B forms containing C-terminal propeptide epitopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Consistent with our data, this group also found that, in contrast to patients with congenital respiratory distress due to SP-B deficiency, the appearance of pro-SP-C forms in these PAP patients was a rare occurrence. Thus, despite similar chest x-rays and histopathological findings, the BAL profile for SP-B, SP-C and their proforms appears useful in distinguishing PAP from SP-B deficiency of any etiology.</p><p>Children with chronic respiratory distress of unknown cause (cRD) exhibited the 40&#x02013;42 kD proprotein with increased frequency. The N'-terminal peptides liberated from pro-SP-B pre-protein during intracellular processing, i.e. 13&#x02013;15 kDa peptides or smaller fragments and reacting with NFPROX, were found exclusively in both cRD and PAP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Tab. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>, Tab. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). As such they may give diagnostic hints for the involvement of processing defects in, especially in pediatric PAP.</p><p>Other peptides reacted with the antibodies directed to the flanking aminoacids next to the SP-B core (NFLANK and CFLANK). The presence of these relatively rarely observed bands at 11 to 15 kDa was not related to specific clinical features of the subjects, i.e. more pronounced lung injury, high protein to phospholipids ratio or high abundance of SP-B. Both, a 9 kDa intermediate, reactive to NFLANK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and a 9 kDa band reacting with antibodies directed to the C'-terminal flanking of pro-SP-B, have previously been observed in human isolated type II cells and fetal lung. Such bands were indeed detected in the lavages we investigated, although very rarely.</p><p>Pro-SP-C peptides were never detected in the control groups. This is in agreement with an earlier observation on a limited number of samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, we found pro-SP-C forms that were clearly, but not exclusively, associated with SP-B deficiency or <italic>SFTPC </italic>mutation. On the other hand, not all infants with <italic>SFTPB </italic>(496delC) or <italic>SFTPC </italic>(R167Q) mutations had pro-SP-C in their lavages. Thus the presence of pro-SP-C in lavages may give strong, but surely not definitive, diagnostic evidence for SP-B and SP-C processing defects.</p><p>The aberrant pro-SP-C species observed in patients with SP-B deficiency carrying the 121ins2 mutation consists of a N-terminal extension of SP-C by the N-flanking 12 aminoacids of pro-SP-C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The pro-SP-C forms observed in patients not bearing a <italic>SFTPB </italic>mutation clearly differed in molecular weights from those detected in SP-B deficiency, suggesting that several processing defects may result in aberrant pro-SP-C in the alveolar space.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here we defined the presence and characteristics of SP-B, SP-C and their processing forms in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from children with severe chronic respiratory distress and in comparison groups of normal children and children with chronic obstructive bronchitis. Pro-SP-B of 25&#x02013;26 kD was commonly detected in all groups, suggesting that this form currently does not appear to be of great diagnostic value for processing defects. In contrast, pro-SP-B of 19&#x02013;21 kD was increased in children with alveolar proteinosis while the cleaved flanking propeptides liberated during intracellular processing of pro-SP-B were exclusively found in these children and in chronic respirator distress of unknown cause. Furthermore, although identified at low frequency, pro-SP-C forms when present in the BAL suggest the presence of one of the parenchymal diseases studied in this report. Though often associated with mutations in SFTPB and SFTPC genes, this was not an exclusive finding limiting the usage of pro-SP-C as a surrogate for SFTP/SFTPC diagnostic screening procedures. Taken together, our results demonstrate that significant perturbations in the metabolism of these hydrophobic surfactant proteins occur in a variety of chronic lung diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MG designed the study, categorized and organized the subjects, wrote initial drafts of the manuscript, SS performed the blots, MT and MB determined the genotype of the patients, MG, SS, MS, AB, MT and MB collected the case histories, reviewed the subjects data and clinical courses, SG and MFB participated in the design for the methods to blot for the surfactant proteins, helped to organize the data and the results, and to prepare the manuscript.
