LpxT-catalysed phosphorylation is dependent upon transport of lipid A across the inner membrane by MsbA, a lipid A flippase, indicating a periplasmic active site. In conclusion, we demonstrate a novel pathway in the periplasmic modification of lipid A that is directly linked to the synthesis of undecaprenyl phosphate, an essential carrier lipid required for the synthesis of various bacterial polymers, such as peptidoglycan.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The Gram-negative bacterial cell envelope consists of an inner membrane, an outer membrane and the periplasmic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Nikaido, 2003</xref>). The outer membrane is an asymmetric lipid bilayer with phospholipids forming the inner leaflet and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) forming the outer leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Nikaido, 2003</xref>), whereas the inner cytoplasmic membrane is composed of phospholipids. Within the periplasm resides a continuous cross-linked carbohydrate polymer that forms a homogeneous layer outside the cytoplasmic membrane, known as the peptidoglycan layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Schleifer and Kandler, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">van Heijenoort, 2001a</xref>). Both LPS and peptidoglycan are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the Gram-negative cell envelope, and are generally required for viability. LPS acts as an efficient permeability barrier against toxic compounds, such as antibacterial agents and detergents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Raetz and Whitfield, 2002</xref>), and peptidoglycan is important for both the shape of the bacterium and protection against internal osmotic pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Nanninga, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">van Heijenoort, 2001b</xref>).</p><p>Biosynthesis of LPS and peptidoglycan, as well as other bacterial cell wall polymers, requires an essential carrier lipid, undecaprenyl phosphate (C<sub>55</sub>-P) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). C<sub>55</sub>-P is generated initially from the dephosphorylation of undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (C<sub>55</sub>-PP), which is synthesized in the cytoplasm by UppS, a <italic>cis</italic>-prenyl-pyrophosphate synthase. UppS catalyses the addition of eight isoprene units to farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to form C<sub>55</sub>-PP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Apfel <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Kato <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). The C<sub>55</sub>-P carries various hydrophilic precursors in a pyrophosphate linkage (C<sub>55</sub>-PP-substrate) across the hydrophobic inner membrane serving as the donor substrate for various biosynthetic pathways within the periplasm. Following the polymerization reaction, the carrier lipid is released in its pyrophosphate form (C<sub>55</sub>-PP), requiring a second dephosphorylation event before the lipid can once again serve as a carrier molecule. An example of C<sub>55</sub>-P synthesis during the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">van Heijenoort, 2001a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Phosphorylation of lipid A by LpxT is linked to the recycling of C<sub>55</sub>-P. The carrier lipid C<sub>55</sub>-P is first synthesized in its pyrophosphate form (C<sub>55</sub>-PP) by UppS synthase on the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane. Prior to its use, the lipid must be dephosphorylated by an undecaprenyl pyrophosphatase. An example of the recycling of C<sub>55</sub>-P during the synthesis of the essential bacterial polymer peptidoglycan is shown. The MraY and MurG enzymes catalyse the successive transfers of the MurNAc-pentapeptide and GlcNAc motifs from the peptidoglycan nucleotide precursors onto C<sub>55</sub>-P, generating the lipid I and lipid II intermediates respectively. Following transport of lipid II across the inner membrane, reactions catalysed by the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) begin. This results in the generation of free C<sub>55</sub>-PP that must be dephosphorylated prior to its reuse for <italic>de novo</italic> peptidoglycan biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">van Heijenoort, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">b</xref>). LpxT (formerly YeiU) dephosphorylates C<sub>55</sub>-PP and transfers the phosphate group to lipid A to form lipid A 1-diphosphate contributing to the recycling of C<sub>55</sub>-P. It cannot be excluded that LpxT may dephosphorylate C<sub>55</sub>-PP that has been directly transported across the inner membrane (indicated by dashed arrow) as part of the C<sub>55</sub>-P <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis pathway. All enzymes are indicated in blue.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mmi0067-0264-f1"/></fig><p>Recently, several inner membrane proteins demonstrating undecaprenyl pryophosphate phosphatase activity were identified in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">El Ghachi <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">2005</xref>): BacA and three members from the phosphatidic acid-phosphatase superfamily of phosphatases (PgpB, YbjG and YeiU). Overproduction of the first, BacA (UppP, C<sub>55</sub>-PP phosphatase), has been shown to increase resistance to the cyclic polypeptide antibiotic bacitracin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bernard <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Bacitracin strongly binds to C<sub>55</sub>-PP, inhibiting its dephosphorylation to C<sub>55</sub>-P, thereby preventing synthesis of the essential carrier lipid. Presumably, overexpression of BacA results in an increase in the cellular pool of C<sub>55</sub>-P, thus overcoming the effects of the antibiotic. The second, PgpB, was previously identified as a phosphatidylglycerol phosphate phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Icho and Raetz, 1983</xref>) in the synthesis of phosphatidylglycerol, but also displays significant UppP activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. YbjG and YeiU had not been previously characterized.</p><p>Overexpression of BacA, PgpB or YbjG results in bacitracin resistance in whole cells, and increases the level of UppP activity in cellular extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">El Ghachi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, deletion of both <italic>ybjG</italic> and <italic>pgpB</italic> is required to abolish the growth of a <italic>bacA</italic> mutant. Complementation of a temperature-sensitive triple mutant harbouring deletions in <italic>bacA</italic>, <italic>ybjG</italic> and <italic>pgpB</italic> can be achieved with an intact chromosomal copy of only one of the <italic>bacA</italic>, <italic>ybjG</italic> and <italic>pgpB</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">El Ghachi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). YeiU also exhibits UppP activity <italic>in vitro</italic>; however, its expression was not able to complement the triple mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">El Ghachi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). This result suggested that YeiU may have other roles besides dephosphorylating C<sub>55</sub>-PP during carrier lipid synthesis.</p><p>We now report that YeiU (renamed LpxT) is involved in the modification of the lipid A domain of Gram-negative LPS. Lipid A serves as the hydrophobic anchor of LPS, and is required to maintain the integrity of the outer membrane barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Raetz and Whitfield, 2002</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12, lipid A consists of a &#x003b2;(1&#x02032;-6)-linked disaccharide of glucosamine that is acylated with <italic>R-</italic>3-hydroxymyristate at the 2, 3, 2&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; positions, and phosphorylated at the 1 and 4&#x02032; positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Raetz and Whitfield, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Trent <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). The majority of lipid A isolated from wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 contains monophosphate moieties at positions 1 and 4&#x02032; (designated lipid A 1-, 4&#x02032;-<italic>bis</italic>-phosphate). The genes encoding the enzymatic machinery required for the biosynthesis of <italic>bis</italic>-phosphorylated lipid A have been identified. Approximately one-third of the lipid A molecules in the <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 outer membrane contain a diphosphate unit at the 1 position (termed lipid A 1-diphosphate) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>) that originates by an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). We demonstrate that deletion of <italic>lpxT</italic> results in the production of LPS containing only the <italic>bis</italic>-phosphorylated lipid A species. Purified LpxT uses C<sub>55</sub>-PP as its phosphate donor substrate catalysing the formation of 1-diphosphate lipid A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>). Removal and transfer of the phosphate group from C<sub>55</sub>-PP within the bacterial cell is dependent upon MsbA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Doerrler and Raetz, 2002</xref>), an essential LPS flippase that transfers the lipid A-core domain to the periplasmic side of the inner membrane prior to addition of O-antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Raetz and Whitfield, 2002</xref>). However, MsbA is not required for enzymatic function of LpxT during <italic>in vitro</italic> assay. Sequestration of C<sub>55</sub>-PP by exposure of <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 to levels of bacitracin just below the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) inhibited lipid A 1-diphosphate formation in whole bacteria. Collectively, we have identified the last enzyme required for lipid A biosynthesis in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12, and demonstrated a novel pathway in the synthesis of LPS that is directly linked to the synthesis of C<sub>55</sub>-PP.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>LpxT transfers the distal phosphate from C<sub>55</sub>-PP to the 1-phosphate group of Kdo<sub>2</sub>-lipid A.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mmi0067-0264-f2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Formation of lipid A 1-diphosphate in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 is catalysed by LpxT</title><p>LpxT is predicted to be 249 amino acids long and contains five putative membrane-spanning regions [see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Sonnhammer <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>)].

LpxE<sub>HP</sub> was previously identified as a lipid A 1-phosphatase of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> involved in the two-step modification of the 1 position of <italic>H. pylori</italic> lipid A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Tran <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Like LpxT, LpxE<sub>HP</sub> is also a member of the PAP2 superfamily of phosphatases. As LpxT was not able to sustain cell growth in the triple mutant BWTsbacA, we wanted to examine another possible role for LpxT involving lipid A modification.</p><p>Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis of <sup>32</sup>P-labelled lipid A species isolated from wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BW25113 and its isogenic <italic>bacA</italic>, <italic>pgpB</italic> and <italic>ybjG</italic> mutants, previously generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">El Ghachi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), revealed the two typical lipid A species; hexa-acylated lipid A 1,4&#x02032;-<italic>bis</italic>-phosphate (lipid A) and hexa-acylated lipid A 1-diphosphate (lipid A 1-diphosphate), which contains a monophosphate group at position 4&#x02032; and an unsubstituted diphosphate unit at position 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;4). The ratio of lipid A to lipid A 1-diphosphate was not altered in these mutants when compared with wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;4), thus clearly demonstrating that both BacA and YbjG are not involved in lipid A 1-diphosphate formation or in lipid A modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>, lanes 2 and 4). Our result corroborates the previous findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>.

However, to our surprise, deletion of <italic>lpxT</italic> in BW25113 resulted in the total loss of the lipid A 1-diphosphate species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>, lane 5). This result indicates that in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 strains lipid A 1-diphosphate formation is dependent on the proper function of LpxT. Deletion of <italic>lpxT</italic> in BW25113 also revealed the presence of a minor lipid species.

Wild-type membranes catalysed the formation of two reaction products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4B</xref>, lane 2). Product B results from the addition of palmitate by the outer membrane enzyme PagP, which has been thoroughly characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bishop <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). Based upon its migration, Product A arises from conversion of the Kdo<sub>2</sub>-[4&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P]lipid A substrate to a more hydrophilic reaction product. Addition of a phosphate group to the free hydroxyl on the 1-phosphate group of Kdo<sub>2</sub>-[4&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P]lipid A would decrease the hydrophobicity of the lipid substrate, resulting in a slower-migrating lipid species when separated by the employed TLC system (see <italic>Experimental procedures</italic>).

This demonstrates that phosphate addition by LpxT occurs at the 1 position (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Also, as no exogenous source of phosphate was added to the assay milieu, it suggests that a membrane component serves as the donor substrate. Phosphotransferase activity was also observed when the tetra-acylated lipid A precursor Kdo<sub>2</sub>-[4&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P]lipid IV<sub>A</sub> was employed as the lipid acceptor, but not with substrates lacking the Kdo sugars (data not shown). The Kdo region has been shown to be required by enzymes involved in the latter steps of lipid A biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Clementz <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Trent <italic>et al</italic>., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Reynolds <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Also, it has been shown that mutants of <italic>E. coli</italic> unable to glycosylate their lipid A with Kdo produce a lipid A structure that is tetra-acylated lacking the 1-diphosphate modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Meredith <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Divalent cations are not required for LpxT activity, but inhibition can be seen with high concentrations of either CaCl<sub>2</sub> or MgCl<sub>2</sub> (&#x02265; 10 mM) (data not shown). The pH optimum of the reaction is 7.0, but significant activity is observed from pH 5.5&#x02013;7.5 (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>LpxT uses C<sub>55</sub>-PP as the phosphate donor</title><p>Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">El Ghachi <italic>et al</italic>. (2005)</xref> demonstrated that membranes isolated from <italic>E. coli</italic> overexpressing LpxT (YeiU) showed a 10-fold increase in the level of C<sub>55</sub>-PP phosphatase activity. Therefore, we wanted to examine if purified LpxT uses C<sub>55</sub>-PP as the phosphate donor during the formation of lipid A 1-diphosphate. To facilitate purification, LpxT was expressed with an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag in <italic>E. coli</italic> strain C43(DE3) and, as expected, was found to localize to the membrane fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>, lane 3). Following extraction of the enzyme from membranes using the detergent <italic>n</italic>-dodecyl-&#x003b2;-D-maltoside (DDM) (lane 4), the His<sub>6</sub>-LpxT was purified (lane 9) by affinity chromatography on Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA-agarose (see <italic>Experimental procedures</italic>). The purified LpxT was first tested for its ability to dephosphorylate C<sub>55</sub>-PP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref>). Pure LpxT clearly exhibited significant C<sub>55</sub>-PP phosphatase activity, with a specific activity at 100 &#x003bc;M C<sub>55</sub>-PP of 0.2 &#x003bc;mol min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. In contrast, LpxT was not able to dephosphorylate the resulting C<sub>55</sub>-P into C<sub>55</sub>-OH, whatever the amount of C<sub>55</sub>-P formed during the reaction. Importantly, the addition of lipid A acceptor (Kdo<sub>2</sub>-lipid A) did not enhance C<sub>55</sub>-PP phosphatase activity during <italic>in vitro</italic> assay, suggesting that the dephosphorylation and phosphate transfer reactions are uncoupled (data not shown). Next, pure enzyme was assayed with Kdo<sub>2</sub>-[4&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P]lipid A (5 &#x003bc;M) along with either C<sub>55</sub>-P or C<sub>55</sub>-PP (100 &#x003bc;M).

For example, in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, C<sub>55</sub>-P is required for the synthesis and transport of the hydrophilic GlcNAc-MurNAc-peptide monomeric motifs across the cytoplasmic membrane to the external sites of polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). Another example is that C<sub>55</sub>-P can serve as acceptor for oligosaccharides repeat units as in the biosynthesis of O-antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Whitfield, 1995</xref>). Biosynthesis of C<sub>55</sub>-P is initiated from the dephosphorylation of C<sub>55</sub>-PP either on the cytosolic face of the inner membrane or on the periplasmic side during the late polymerization steps of peptidoglycan biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">van Heijenoort, 2001a</xref>).</p><p>Recently, several inner membrane proteins, BacA, PgpB, YbjG and YeiU, were identified in <italic>E. coli</italic> as having UppP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">El Ghachi <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">2005</xref>). Overexpression of these proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 results in increased resistance to the cyclic polypeptide bacitracin, presumably by directly competing with the antibiotic for the available pool of free C<sub>55</sub>-PP. Multiple UppPs are thought to be involved in the metabolism of C<sub>55</sub>-P, because inactivation of at least three UppPs (BacA, YbjG and PgpB) enzymes are required to block cell wall synthesis and provoke cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">El Ghachi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, only one of the following genes, <italic>bacA</italic>, <italic>ybjG</italic> or <italic>pgpB</italic>, is necessary to support the growth of a temperature-sensitive UppP triple mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">El Ghachi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Although YeiU was shown to exhibit UppP activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, inactivation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">El Ghachi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) demonstrated that <italic>yeiU</italic> alone was not able to sustain growth of the temperature-sensitive UppP triple mutant. This result suggests that YeiU may have another role besides dephosphorylating C<sub>55</sub>-PP for peptidoglycan biosynthesis.</p><p>Lipid A isolated from wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 is typically a hexa-acylated disaccharide of glucosamine with a monophosphate unit at positions 1 and 4&#x02032; (lipid A). However, one-third of the lipid A also contains an unsubstituted diphosphate unit at the 1 position (lipid A 1-diphosphate). All of the enzymes required for making lipid A in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 have been described, with the exception of the reaction that generates the 1-diphosphate unit. We now provide concrete evidence that YeiU (renamed LpxT) is responsible for the 1-diphosphate moiety found at the C-1 position of <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 lipid A. Mutants lacking a functional copy of <italic>lpxT</italic> were deficient in synthesizing lipid A 1-diphosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). Using an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay, we determined that membranes of <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 <italic>lpxT</italic>-deficient mutant were unable to convert Kdo<sub>2</sub>-lipid A to Kdo<sub>2</sub>-lipid A 1-diphosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p><p>Our data demonstrate that LpxT specifically uses the carrier lipid C<sub>55</sub>-PP for phosphotransferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>), and that formation of lipid A 1-diphosphate <italic>in vivo</italic> is dependent upon the transfer of lipid A across the inner membrane by MsbA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>). The fact that LpxT requires MsbA <italic>in vivo</italic> provides compelling evidence to support the periplasmic orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Tatar <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) of its active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). This work provides the first biochemical evidence that dephosphorylation of C<sub>55</sub>-PP occurs on the periplasmic side of the inner membrane, and also corroborates the UppP activity of LpxT previously reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">El Ghachi <italic>et al</italic>. (2005)</xref>. However, it is yet to be determined on which side of the inner membrane dephosphorylation of C<sub>55</sub>-PP occurs with the other UppPs during peptidoglycan biosynthesis.</p><p>Modification of negatively charged phosphate groups of lipid A with positively charged amine-containing substituents is an important strategy employed by a wide variety of Gram-negative bacteria to increase resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Trent <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Raetz <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). In some organisms, these modifications are under the control of the PhoP/PhoQ and the PmrA/PmrB two-component regulatory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Guo <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Gunn <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). Pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 in which PmrA is constitutively active produces lipid A species modified with pEtN and/or L-Ara4N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), but not species containing the 1-diphosphate moiety. However, expression of LpxT from either <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 or <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> LT2 can successfully complement an <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 <italic>lpxT</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). Additionally, it has been shown that <italic>Salmonella pmrA</italic>-null mutants that are unable to modify their lipid A with pEtN or L-Ara4N synthesize the 1-diphosphate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that PmrA may play a role in the regulation of the 1-diphosphate species. Further studies are under way to determine if this regulation is occurring at the transcriptional level of <italic>lpxT</italic>, or possibly at the post-translational level within the bacterial membrane.</p><p>This work also provides another example of how undecaprenyl carrier lipids are not only involved in the biosynthesis of the O-antigen domain of LPS, but also in the modification of its hydrophobic anchor. For example, the periplasmic modification of lipid A by the aminoarabinose transferase requires undecaprenyl-phospho-L-Ara4N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Trent <italic>et al</italic>., 2001b</xref>). Similarly, the attachment of galacturonic acid residues to the lipid A and core domains of <italic>Rhizobium leguminosarum</italic> LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Kanjilal-Kolar and Raetz, 2006</xref>), and the incorporation of galactosamine units into lipid A in <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> subsp. <italic>novicida</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2006b</xref>) are dependent upon undecaprenyl-linked intermediates. The biological function of the diphosphate moiety on lipid A in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 is still unclear as LpxT was not essential for cell growth on nutrient broth. Of interest was that loss of LpxT function resulted in the formation of a minor lipid A species that resembled the addition of a single pEtN unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>). The presence of a diphosphate group or pyrophosphoethanolamine in the lipid A structure may provide some benefit to the bacterium by increasing the stability of the outer membrane under different environmental conditions. Perhaps the diphosphate moieties of lipid A are used as an energy source within the extracytoplasmic compartment of the bacterial cell as ATP is not available. Given that LpxT function is directly linked to the synthesis of C<sub>55</sub>-P, and that modification of the lipid A domain of LPS has been shown important for bacterial pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Guo <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">van Velkinburgh and Gunn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Gunn <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Gunn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Gibbons <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), further investigation of the function and regulation of LpxT is warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Chemicals and other materials</title><p>[&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP and <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> were obtained from GE Healthcare Bio-Science AB.
