The redox features of iron make it a useful cofactor for many proteins functioning in respiration, photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation and DNA biosynthesis, to name a few. However, iron also forms highly reactive oxygen species that can impose severe cellular damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Hence, intracellular iron concentration must be tightly controlled. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, iron-binding transporters located in the outer and inner membranes are induced to actively import iron under iron-limited conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. To facilitate the capture of iron, <italic>E. coli</italic> produces and releases the iron-chelating siderophores to the surrounding environment. Also, the iron storage proteins (ferritin and bacterioferritin) and non-essential iron-using proteins are repressed to release their sequestered iron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. When iron is sufficient, the iron uptake and homeostatic systems are coordinately regulated by a global transcriptional factor Fur (the ferric uptake regulator), which complexes with Fe<sup>2+</sup> and represses the transcription of a diverse array of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The DNA target recognized by Fe<sup>2+</sup>-Fur is a 19-bp inverted repeat sequence of GATAATGATAATCATTATC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The binding of Fur to this motif in the promoter regions of target genes effectively prevents the recruitment of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme and thus represses transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Although the major role of Fur is to regulate genes involved in iron homeostasis systems, Fur has also been demonstrated to be a pleiotropic transcriptional factor. As such, it functions in a variety of cellular processes including redox-stress responses, flagella chemotaxis, metabolic pathways, acid tolerance and virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Indeed, it has been estimated that Fur directly controls the expression of over ninety genes in <italic>E. coli</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Maintaining iron homeostasis is of particular interest for a &#x003b3;-proteobacterium <italic>Shewanella oneidensis</italic> for several reasons. First, <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> is capable of respiring with a variety of electron acceptors including oxygen, glycine, nitrate, nitrite, thiosulfate, elemental sulfur, fumarate, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), Fe(III), Mn(IV), Co(III), U(VI), Cr(VI) and Tc(VII) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Unlike most other &#x003b3;-proteobacteria, <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> is capable of respiring Fe(III). Therefore, iron serves as not only a protein cofactor but also an important electron acceptor for the bacterium. Second, <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> typically possesses an extraordinarily high content of cytochromes, which confers cells a characteristic pink or red color. The high content of cytochrome is suggestive of a high demand for iron, since iron is a co-factor of heme groups in the cytochromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Lastly, the majority of <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> genes are most similar to genes of <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, the &#x003b3;-proteobacterium causative of a diarrheal disease called cholera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It has been established that iron acquisition genes of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> are required for successful colonization in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Since <italic>Shewanella</italic> species are fish pathogens and infrequent opportunistic human pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], it is possible that iron in <italic>Shewanella</italic> species plays a similar role to <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and function to signal the entry into the host.</p><p>Much of iron homeostasis in <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> remains to be elucidated. The Fur gene of <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> shares 74% identity with the <italic>E. coli</italic> homolog. Previous transcriptomic studies of the <italic>fur</italic> mutants under anaerobic and aerobic conditions indicate that it regulates a variety of biological processes including iron uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. A highly conserved Fur binding motif has also been predicted. These results are consistent with a role of <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> Fur in iron acquisition. However, responses of the <italic>fur</italic> mutant to iron depletion have not yet been examined. It is also unclear how disruption of the pleiotropic regulator Fur affects other cellular processes. In addition, although Fur is regarded as the master regulator for iron response, it has been shown in <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> that a number of genes are regulated by iron independently of Fur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It is interesting to investigate such systems in <italic>S. oneidensis</italic>.</p><p>In the present study, we performed physiological and transcriptomic studies to characterize the function of <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> Fur. Our results demonstrated that Fur played a role in iron acquisition and acid resistance response. We also discovered that a number of genes including genes related to anaerobic energy transport were regulated by iron rather than Fur. This work provides useful information in understanding the complicated complex molecular networks coordinating the bacterial response to iron.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Phenotypic analyses of the <italic>fur</italic> mutant</title><p>A deletion mutant of Fur was constructed from wild-type <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> strain MR-1. The <italic>fur</italic> mutant formed smaller colonies than wild-type strain after two days' incubation at 30&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), suggestive of a growth deficiency caused by Fur inactivation. Moreover, colonies of the <italic>fur</italic> mutant appeared paler in color than MR-1 colonies. Wild-type <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> colonies have characteristic reddish or pink pigments, which is attributed to high heme content in the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The pale color of colonies of the <italic>fur</italic> mutant suggested that there was less heme, presumably due to the low level of intracellular iron as a heme co-factor. The low level of intracellular iron has been documented in an <italic>E. coli fur</italic> mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Growth of the <italic>fur</italic> mutant on solid LB medium.

LB medium contains ~17 uM iron, hence it is considered as an iron-rich medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In LB, the <italic>fur</italic> mutant displayed longer lag phase, slower growth rate at logarithmic phase and lower cell density at stationary phase than MR-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). When iron was depleted from the growth medium by addition of iron chelator, both strains clearly displayed growth inhibition. Interestingly, when both strains were grown with 160 uM iron chelator, no significant difference was detected between the mutant and MR-1. With 240 uM iron chelator, the <italic>fur</italic> mutant displayed a much shorter lag phase than MR-1 and reached a higher cell density at stationary phase, suggesting that the <italic>fur</italic> mutant better tolerated the iron depletion stress.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Comparative growth analyses of wild-type and the <italic>fur</italic> mutant. Growth curves for strains grown in liquid LB, LB-160uM and LB-240uM iron chelator are shown. Cells grown in mid-logarithmic phase were diluted 1/100 in fresh LB media and growth was monitored every thirty minutes during consecutive five days. Three replicates were used for both strains. The average growth and error bars are shown. The down arrows and up arrows indicate the range of mid-logarithmic phase of MR-1 and the <italic>fur</italic> mutant, respectively. The doubling time of MR-1 is 1.5 hrs.

Fur has been implicated in acid tolerance response, since <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> harboring <italic>fur</italic> mutations are acid-sensitive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Therefore, the acid tolerance of <italic>S. oneidensis</italic><italic>fur</italic> mutant was examined. Wild-type and the <italic>fur</italic> mutant were grown in LB medium buffered at pH5.5 and 7 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). At pH of 5.5, the <italic>fur</italic> mutant but not wild-type strain had severe growth defect, demonstrating that the <italic>fur</italic> mutant was more sensitive to acidic condition.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Growth of wild type MR-1 and the <italic>fur</italic> mutant strains at pH 5.5 and 7.0.

The average growth and error bars are shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-9-S1-S11-3"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Microarray experiments</title><p>For microarray experiments, mid-log phase grown <italic>fur</italic> mutant was treated with iron chelator for one hour and then ferrous sulfate. The concentration of 160 uM iron chelator was used for iron depletion during the microarray experiments because growth was clearly inhibited, but not completely abolished at this concentration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Samples were collected at multiple time points during iron depletion and repletion and used for global transcriptomic analyses. To allow for comparison of any pairs of samples, <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> genomic DNA was used as a common reference in each microarray experiment (see Methods and Materials for details). This strategy has been successfully employed in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In addition, since <italic>S. oneidensis</italic><italic>fur</italic> mutant in previous studies was generated from a rifampin-resistant strain (DSP10) instead of wild-type <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> MR-1, we decided to repeat the microarray comparison between the <italic>fur</italic> mutant and wild-type under aerobic condition, using the <italic>fur</italic> mutant derived from MR-1. Therefore, MR-1 was grown in LB to mid-logarithmic phase, RNA was prepared and used for microarray experiments. This allowed for comparison of gene expression profiles of the <italic>fur</italic> mutant and MR-1 (see below). To evaluate the reliability of microarray data, quantitative RT-PCR was performed on a few selected genes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>). A high Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.92 was observed between RT-PCR and microarray results.</p></sec><sec><title>Fur-regulated genes</title><p>Global gene expression profiles of the <italic>fur</italic> mutant and MR-1 grown in LB medium were compared. A total number of 118 and 56 genes were significantly up- and down- regulated, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). As commonly seen in microarray datasets, a large portion of up- or down-regulated genes corresponded to genes with unknown function, indicating a much broader modulon than deduced by gene annotation alone. Among the genes with defined functions (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), two groups of genes were most noticeable: genes encoding iron acquisition proteins and ribosome proteins. The high level induction of iron acquisition genes agreed with the expected role of Fur in regulating iron uptake and transport. It provided an explanation for the better growth of the <italic>fur</italic> mutant under iron-depleted condition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), since the up-regulation of iron acquisition genes imposed an advantage for rapid adaptation to the iron depletion. The induction of genes encoding ribosomal proteins was rather unexpected, as the <italic>fur</italic> mutant grown in LB medium displayed growth defects. It was possible that these genes were induced to accommodate the requirement to synthesize iron acquisition proteins induced by iron depletion. Alternatively, their induction could be due to cellular response to overcome the growth deficiency in LB. Notably, a conserved Fur binding motif could be identified in the promoter region of almost all of the iron acquisition genes in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, while no ribosome subunit gene except SO0232 had a Fur binding motif in its promoter (data not shown). Therefore, it was likely that genes encoding ribosome proteins were not the direct targets of Fur. Lastly, several acid resistance systems have been characterized in &#x003b3;-proteobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However, expression of components of these systems (e.g. Crp, RpoS, glutamate-, arginine- and lysine-decarboxylases) was not significantly altered in the <italic>fur</italic> mutant. Since the acid tolerance of the <italic>fur</italic> mutant was reduced, it was possible that these genes were regulated at post-transcriptional level, or the core components of these systems were not yet annotated in <italic>S. oneidensis</italic>, or <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> could employ a novel and yet unidentified mechanism for acid tolerance response.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Up-expressed (up) and down-expressed (down) genes (|log<sub>3</sub> ratio| &#x02265;1 with <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) in the <italic>fur</italic> mutant versus MR-1.

Few genes encoding iron acquisition or ribosome proteins were among those up or down regulated, suggesting that their regulation was strictly Fur-dependent. Meanwhile, a group of genes related to anaerobic energy transport was repressed by iron depletion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B), but not identified in Fur regulon shown above (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Therefore, this process was iron responsive but Fur independent. These genes include formate dehydrogenase and multiple <italic>c</italic>-type cytochromes that are involved in anaerobic energy respiration. For example, FccA is a fumarate reductase; CymA is a key protein controlling respiration with a variety of electron acceptors, while MtrC/OmcB is an outer membrane protein required for metal reduction. A logical explanation of the repression by iron is that under the tested condition, these genes are non-essential, iron-using proteins. Upon iron depletion, they are repressed to release previously sequestrated iron to increase free intracellular iron pool. This mechanism has been well documented in <italic>E. coli</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] as mediated by Fur and a small RNA RyhB. However, in <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> this biological process must be controlled by iron-responsive regulator(s) other than Fur. Another notable iron-responsive and Fur-independent process was aerobic energy transport, including TCA cycle enzymes malate dehydrogenase (Mdh), succinate dehydrogenase (SdhC), isocitrate dehydrogenase (SO1538) and citrate synthase (GltA). Other related genes include succinylarginine dihydrolase(AstB) and isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (Ivd). Notably, in contrast to the genes involved in anaerobic energy transport, these genes were induced by iron depletion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C), suggesting that it was more energy-consuming for coping with iron starvation than the energetic need for normal growth.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Numbers of genes predicted to be up-expressed or down-expressed (down) genes (|log<sub>3</sub> ratio| &#x02265;1 and p&#x0003c;0.05) of the <italic>fur</italic> mutant during the time course experiment.

Moreover, a large number of significantly regulated genes are linked to hypothetical proteins. To gain more insights into their functions, a gene co-expression network was constructed (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional file 2</xref>A). Microarray data have frequently been used for gene annotation based on the observation that genes with similar expression patterns are more likely to be functionally related, that is, &#x0201c;guilt by association&#x0201d;, despite the fact that co-expression does not necessarily indicate a causal relationship at the transcriptional level. This fact is exploited in the &#x0201c;majority-rule&#x0201d; method of network annotation in which a gene is annotated based on the most commonly occurring functions of its co-expressed partners.</p><p>Functionally related genes were indeed grouped together in all clusters of the gene network that we constructed (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional file 2</xref>A). For example, one cluster contains eleven genes encoding heat shock proteins (DnaK, DnaJ, HslV, HslU, HtpG, Lon, SecB, PrlC, ClpB, GroEL and GroES) and three unknown genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A). These heat shock proteins function to accelerate turnovers of denatured or unfolded proteins and respond to multiple stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Their identification in this study is expected since lack of iron as protein cofactor would impair the functionality of a number of proteins. Furthermore, it can be predicted based on the cluster that the unknown genes in this cluster might function in stress response. This prediction is further supported by their operon structures. SO4161 is immediately upstream of heat shock HslU and HslV and might form an operon together. Similarly, SO2017 could form another operon with the upstream gene encoding heat shock protein HtpG. Finally, when the Gibbs Motif Sampler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] was employed to search the promoter regions of genes in this cluster for common sequence motif(s), a conserved RpoH (&#x003c3;<sup>32</sup>) binding site was identified (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, RpoH directs the RNAP holoenzymes to specifically transcribed genes encoding heat shock proteins. Its presence in the promoter regions of SO2017 and SO4161 provides further evidence that these two genes play a role in stress response.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Two clusters of genes revealed in gene network.

Blue and gray lines indicate positive and negative correlation coefficients, respectively. Colors were assigned to nodes according to their functional categories: red represents known heat shock proteins in (A) or anaerobic energy transport in (B), white represents unknown genes and pink represents transcriptional regulators. The sequence logo of consensus sequence in the promoter regions of genes in the clusters was generated by the Weblogo program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-9-S1-S11-6"/></fig><p>Another large cluster contains many <italic>c</italic>-type cytochromes (e.g. CymA, MtrA, MtrC and OmcA) and their related genes such as heme exporters and alcohol dehydrogenases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B). Many of them were considered as iron-responsive but Fur-independent, as discussed in the previous section. When the Gibbs Motif Sampler was applied, a palindromic sequence of &#x0201c;AAATGTGATCNNGNTCACA NTT&#x0201d; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B) was identified with statistical significance. This sequence is almost identical to the known binding motif of an <italic>E. coli</italic> global transcriptional factor Crp (AAA<bold>TGTGA</bold>TCTAGA<bold>TCACA</bold> TTT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].

The identification of a highly conserved Crp-binding site at the promoters of genes in this cluster provides an explanation for the phenotypes of <italic>crp</italic> mutants. Crp might act as a master regulator of anaerobic energy transport; its inactivation leads to repression of multiple branches of anaerobic energy transport pathway. Notably, the regulation of Crp to anaerobic energy transport is iron-responsive but Fur-independent, since most genes in this cluster shows little expression difference between the <italic>fur</italic> mutant and wild-type.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The primary objective of the present study was to characterize the function of the pleiotropic regulator Fur and the iron response in <italic>S. oneidensis</italic>. Fur involvement in iron acquisition was evident, as shown by our physiological and transcriptomic studies. On the other hand, there were iron-responsive and Fur-independent systems (e.g. a large group of genes related to anaerobic energy transport). The identification of Crp binding site in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B is consistent with the role of Crp in anaerobic energy transport and supports the notion that Crp is the master regulator of this bioprocess. The identification of a number of transcriptional factors in this cluster is worthy of future investigation. Over 200 genes of regulatory functions have been annotated in <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tigr.org"/>), yet only a small number of them have been examined experimentally. The involvement of the identified regulators in anaerobic energy transport, once verified, will contribute to the understanding of the complex branched respiratory systems in <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> and hence the potential utilization of <italic>Shewanella</italic> species to remediate U.S. DOE uranium-contaminated sites.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and plasmids</title><p>To generate a <italic>fur</italic> deletion mutant from MR-1, a pDS3.1-<italic>fur</italic> suicide plasmid described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] was used.

Total RNA was extracted using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

Fluorescein labeled probes were purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen).

Pre-hybridization and hybridization were carried out in hybridization chambers (Corning). Slides were then washed on a shaker at room temperature in the following order: 7 min. in 1x SSC, 0.2% SDS; 7 min. in 0.1x SSC, 0.2% SDS; and 40 sec. in 0.1x SSC.</p><p>A ScanArray Express Microarray Scanner (PerkinElmer) was used to scan slides.

To calculate the ratios over different time points, samples during iron depletion (namely, C1', C5', C10', C20', C40' and C60') were compared to samples without addition of chelator (C0'), and samples during the iron repletion (F1', F5', F10', F20', F40' and F60') were compared to C60' (1' is 1 min., 5' is 5 min., <italic>etc</italic>.). Genes with |log<sub>3</sub> ratio| &#x02265;1 with <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 are considered significant.

Applying the RMT method to the microarray data revealed a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.87 as the minimal threshold to construct gene co-expression network. Since gene co-expression networks are known to be hierarchical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], higher thresholds have been used to recognize larger functional modules. As a result, nineteen modules were distinguished (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional file 2</xref>A).
