Deletion of the C-terminal five residues of &#x003b2; (&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup>) disrupted both clefts, severely impairing interactions of the clamp with the DnaX clamp loader, as well as the replicative DNA polymerase, Pol III. In order to determine whether both clefts were required for loading clamp onto DNA, stimulation of Pol III replication and removal of clamp from DNA after replication was complete, we developed a method for purification of heterodimeric clamp proteins comprised of one wild-type subunit (&#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>), and one &#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> subunit (&#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup>). The &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> heterodimer interacted normally with the DnaX clamp loader, and was loaded onto DNA slightly more efficiently than was &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>. Moreover, &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> interacted normally with Pol III, and stimulated replication to the same extent as did &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>. Finally, &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> was severely impaired for unloading from DNA using either DnaX or the &#x003b4; subunit of DnaX. Taken together, these findings indicate that a single cleft in the &#x003b2; clamp is sufficient for both loading and stimulation of Pol III replication, but both clefts are required for unloading clamp from DNA after replication is completed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> &#x003b2; sliding clamp, encoded by the <italic>dnaN</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), is the founding member of the ubiquitous &#x003b2; sliding clamp family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The &#x003b2; clamp was initially identified based on its ability to tether the replicative DNA polymerase (Pol) to the DNA template, effectively increasing its processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). However, it is now clear that sliding clamp proteins interact with a variety of proteins in addition to their cognate replicative Pols that act on DNA, and also play important roles in managing the activities of these proteins to coordinate initiation of DNA replication with elongation, as well as DNA repair, DNA damage tolerance and cell-cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Although several models have been proposed to describe the role(s) by which sliding clamps coordinate these processes, the precise mechanism(s) are still largely unknown.</p><p>In general, bacterial clamps (&#x003b2; clamps) exist as stable homodimers, whereas eukaryotic and archaeal clamps (proliferating cell nuclear antigen, or PCNA) are homotrimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Despite a lack of sequence similarity, crystallographic studies have revealed that their three-dimensional structures are nearly identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7 B8">4&#x02013;8</xref>). The head-to-tail arrangement of the protomers forms a ring with two distinct surfaces. This ring has a positively charged core of &#x003b1;-helices that associates with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and is flanked by &#x003b2;-sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The so-called N-side bears the N-terminus, while the C-side contains the C-terminus, which is part of a hydrophobic cleft that serves as a common docking site for most of its partner proteins. A structure for the &#x003b2; clamp on DNA was recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In the crystal, the clamp makes specific contacts with DNA, consistent with computational modeling studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). These contacts play poorly defined roles in clamp loading <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), and are essential for viability of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>Sliding clamps are loaded around DNA by a conserved multi-subunit AAA<sup>+</sup> ATPase (expanded group of <underline>A</underline>TPases <underline>A</underline>ssociated with various cellular <underline>A</underline>ctivities) referred to as the clamp loader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The complete form of the <italic>E. coli</italic> clamp loader, DnaX complex (also called &#x003b3; complex), is comprised of two copies of the &#x003c4; protein, and one copy each of &#x003b3;, &#x003b4;, &#x003b4;&#x02032;, &#x003c7;, and &#x003c8; (&#x003c4;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;&#x003b4;&#x02032;&#x003c7;&#x003c8;). In addition to &#x003c4;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;&#x003b4;&#x02032;&#x003c7;&#x003c8;, alternative forms of DnaX differing in the stoichiometry of &#x003c4; and &#x003b3; (i.e. &#x003c4;<sub>3</sub>&#x003b4;&#x003b4;&#x02032;&#x003c7;&#x003c8; or &#x003b3;<sub>3</sub>&#x003b4;&#x003b4;&#x02032;&#x003c7;&#x003c8;), and/or lacking &#x003c7;&#x003c8; (i.e. &#x003c4;<sub>3</sub>&#x003b4;&#x003b4;&#x02032; or &#x003b3;<sub>3</sub>&#x003b4;&#x003b4;&#x02032;) are active in clamp loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Both &#x003c4; and &#x003b3; are expressed from the same gene (<italic>dnaX</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15">13&#x02013;15</xref>). &#x003c4; represents the full-length product of <italic>dnaX</italic>, and is 643 amino acids (aa) in length, while &#x003b3;, which is 431-aa long, is the result of a programmed ribosomal frame shift. The &#x003c4;<sub>2</sub>, &#x003b3;, &#x003b4; and &#x003b4;&#x02032; subunits associate with each other forming a pentameric ring with a partial opening between &#x003b4; and &#x003b4;&#x02032; through which DNA can pass during clamp loading/unloading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The &#x003c8; subunit interacts with &#x003c7;, and also interacts with &#x003c4;/&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The DnaX complex associates with two Pol III core complexes, each of which consists of a single &#x003b1; catalytic (Pol III&#x003b1;), &#x003b5; proofreading and &#x003b8; subunit to form Pol III* ([&#x003c4;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;&#x003b4;&#x02032;&#x003c7;&#x003c8;]<sub>1</sub>[&#x003b1;&#x003b5;&#x003b8;]<sub>2</sub>). The complex consisting of Pol III* in association with two &#x003b2; clamps is referred to as Pol III holoenzyme (Pol III HE) and acts to replicate the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Similar to clamp loaders from other organisms, DnaX adopts an arc-shaped structure that is proposed to interact with and stabilize an open form of the &#x003b2; clamp without dissociating the clamp into monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). This form of the clamp, in which a single interface is broken, adopts a lock washer-like structure. The structure of the clamp loader matches the contour of both the open clamp and the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). A stable DnaX-&#x003b2; complex requires that the &#x003c4;/&#x003b3; subunits of DnaX first bind ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). This complex then associates with nicked or primed DNA, ratcheting itself over the 3&#x02032;-end of the primer like a screw cap on a bottle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Once properly positioned at the 3&#x02032;-end, the &#x003c4;/&#x003b3; subunits hydrolyze bound ATP, triggering the immediate dissociation of DnaX from both the clamp and DNA, leaving &#x003b2; behind to close over the dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>E. coli</italic> &#x003b2; clamp contains a hydrophobic cleft composed in part of C-terminal residues. This cleft interacts with a fairly well-conserved eubacterial clamp-binding motif (CBM) that is often reported to be QL[<sup>S</sup>/<sub>D</sub>]LF, but can be considerably more degenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Many binding partners make important contacts with the &#x003b2; clamp in addition to the CBM/cleft interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Another important paradigm that has become evident in recent years is that sliding clamps do not merely recruit partners to DNA, but can also stimulate their catalytic activity. For example, human PCNA enhances base excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In addition, interaction of eukaryotic Pol &#x003ba; with PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), as well as <italic>E. coli</italic> Pol IV with &#x003b2; clamp serves to markedly reduce their apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for dNTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). In light of these findings, sliding clamps should be viewed as dynamic coordinators of DNA replication, repair, and damage tolerance.</p><p>An important yet unanswered question pertains to how different partners exchange with each other, or switch, on a clamp encircling DNA. This is a particularly important issue in light of the fact that clamp proteins, and the processes that they manage, are so widely conserved throughout evolution. One well-conserved process, termed translesion DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), involves specialized Pols capable of replicating over lesions in the DNA. Most Pols capable of catalyzing TLS display low fidelity on undamaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27 B28">26&#x02013;28</xref>). Mismanagement of TLS Pol function is widely believed to contribute to mutations that lead to human diseases such as cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). One area that has received considerable attention in recent years pertains to Pol switching at a lesion in the DNA. One particularly popular yet untested model, referred to as the &#x02018;toolbelt model&#x02019;, postulates that two different Pols simultaneously bind to the same dimeric &#x003b2; clamp, with each Pol contacting a separate hydrophobic cleft in the dimeric clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29 B30 B31">29&#x02013;31</xref>). In this model, the clamp acts like a toggle switch to regulate access of the different Pols to the DNA template while coordinating high fidelity replication with potentially error-prone TLS.</p><p>Despite its reported ability to interact with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), the clamp nonetheless slides along double strand (ds) DNA with a half-life on circular DNA of &#x0003e;100 min <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Due to this remarkable stability, &#x003b2; clamps accumulate on DNA, particularly lagging strand during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). As there are only &#x0223c;300&#x02013;600 clamps/cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), and a new clamp is required for replication of each of the &#x0223c;4000 Okazaki fragments (assuming an average length of 1000 bp), it is postulated that the clamp must be actively unloaded (i.e. recycled) from DNA during replication/repair synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The DnaX complex, as well as the &#x003b4; subunit of DnaX, which is present in excess over the other DnaX subunits <italic>in vivo</italic>, can unload &#x003b2; from DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Taken together, these findings highlight the need to carefully regulate both the loading and the unloading of clamps in order to ensure that partner proteins, such as TLS Pols, cannot gain access to the DNA unless their function is required. The goal of the work discussed in this report was determine whether a single cleft in the dimeric &#x003b2; clamp was sufficient for clamp loading, Pol III* replication, and unloading clamp from DNA. To help answer these questions, we generated a mutant form of the &#x003b2; clamp, called &#x003b2;<sup>C</sup>, which lacks its C-terminal five aa residues. Using gel filtration chromatography, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we demonstrated that a single &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> clamp binds two &#x003b4; subunits of DnaX with negative cooperativity. In contrast, &#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> was severely impaired for interaction with &#x003b4;, DnaX, and, albeit to a lesser degree, Pol III&#x003b1;. Using a method that we developed for purification of heterodimeric &#x003b2; clamp proteins, we purified a &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> clamp comprised of one &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> protomer in complex with one &#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> protomer. Biochemical characterization of the &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> heterodimer revealed that it bound a single &#x003b4;, and interacted normally with DnaX and Pol III&#x003b1; <italic>in vitro</italic>. Moreover, the &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> heterodimer was proficient for loading onto DNA, as well as stimulation of Pol III* replication <italic>in vitro</italic>. In contrast, both clefts were required for efficient unloading of clamp from DNA by either DnaX or &#x003b4;. Taken together, these findings provide insight into models for how the &#x003b2; clamp may act to coordinate the actions of its different partners on DNA, as well as how clamp loading and unloading, or recycling, may contribute to this coordination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Proteins</title><p>The &#x003b3;<sub>3</sub>&#x003b4;&#x003b4;&#x02032;&#x003c7;&#x003c8; form of the DnaX clamp loader complex was reconstituted from the individually purified subunits as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).

Approximately 5000 response units (RUs) of either BSA free anti-Penta&#x02022;His Antibody (Qiagen), or 9E10 monoclonal anti-myc antibody (Covance) were covalently immobilized to either the CM5 or C1 sensor chip surface (GE Healthcare) by amine coupling in both flow cells according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The antibody surface in flow cell 1 was used to capture the appropriately tagged form of the &#x003b2; clamp, while antibody in the flow cell 2 was left free to monitor nonspecific interactions for background subtraction. Immediately following capture of the clamp in flow cell 1, the indicated concentrations of the each &#x003b2; binding partner were injected over the chip for 2 min at a flow rate of 30 &#x003bc;l/min. To limit effects resulting from dissociation of clamp dimers tethered to the chip, the antibody surface was regenerated by an injection of 10 mM glycine-HCl (pH 1.5) for 1 min at 50 &#x003bc;l/min. This removed all clamps and interacting proteins from the antibody surface following each interaction cycle, allowing for capture of a fresh aliquot of &#x003b2; dimer for each interaction that was analyzed.</p><p>In control experiments, the relative retention of &#x003b2; on the antibody chip was used to determine the stability of heterodimeric clamps as a function of time. Initially, &#x0003e;95% of each heterodimeric clamp contained both the myc- and his<sub>6</sub>-tags, and were readily captured on the chip surface using either the anti-myc or anti-Penta&#x02022;His antibody. Since clamp dimers dissociate into monomers and reassociate into a mixture of heterodimer and homodimers with time, we utilized an SPR assay to measure the level of each clamp captured by the tag-specific antibody over time. Results of these experiments indicated that the heterodimers were stable in the high salt buffer (Buffer B) in which they were purified for &#x0003e;180 min.

Briefly, the myc-tagged &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> and his<sub>6</sub>-tagged &#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> clamp proteins were co-expressed in the same <italic>E. coli</italic> cell, and the &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> heterodimer was purified away from both myc-tagged &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> and his<sub>6</sub>-tagged &#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> homodimers using cobalt affinity chromatography (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section). This same approach was also used to purify a myc-tagged &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/his<sub>6</sub>-tagged &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> heterodimer for use as a control in experiments discussed below as noted. As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, three distinct peaks were observed following cobalt chromatography. Based on western blot analysis using monoclonal antibodies specific to either the his<sub>6</sub>- or myc-tags, the first peak (peak 1) contained myc-tagged homodimeric clamp, the third peak (peak 3) contained his<sub>6</sub>-tagged homodimeric clamp, and the middle peak (peak 2) contained both the myc-tagged and his<sub>6</sub>-tagged clamps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), suggesting that it was heterodimeric. The presence of the heterodimer in peak 2 was directly demonstrated using an SPR assay. For this assay, we covalently attached either anti-Penta&#x02022;His or anti-myc antibody to the sensor chip surface. After antibody-capture of the appropriate his<sub>6</sub>- or myc-tagged clamp protein, we asked whether the second tag was present by injecting the corresponding antibody over the chip surface. As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, we were able to capture the clamp from peak 2 with either anti-Penta&#x02022;His or anti-myc antibodies. Subsequent injection of the anti-myc antibody over the anti-Penta&#x02022;His captured peak 2-clamp sample indicated that the myc-tag was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). Similar results were observed for the reciprocal experiment in which the peak 2-clamp sample was captured using anti-myc antibody, followed by injection of anti-Penta&#x02022;His antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). As controls, we verified that the anti-Penta&#x02022;His antibody was unable to capture the myc-tagged &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> clamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), and the anti-myc antibody was unable to capture the his<sub>6</sub>-tagged &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> clamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D).

Since the clamp has two clefts, we hypothesized that it could simultaneously interact with two &#x003b4; subunits.

In contrast, since the &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> heterodimer has only one functional cleft, we hypothesized that it would interact with only a single &#x003b4;. As a direct test of these hypotheses, we used an SPR assay similar to that discussed above to analyze interactions of &#x003b4; with &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>, &#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> and &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup>. Of relevance to these experiments, the magnitude of the maximal SPR signal (<italic>R</italic><sub>max</sub>) is directly proportional to molecular weight of the interacting partner. Thus, the stoichiometry of interacting partners within a complex can be determined.</p><p>As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> and &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> each interacted with &#x003b4;, while &#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> failed to do so. For these experiments, we captured &#x0223c;100 RU of each clamp on the chip surface. The &#x003b2; clamp is 81.2 kDa as dimer, and &#x003b4; is 38.7 kDa. Thus, if one &#x003b4; interacted with the clamp, the theoretical <italic>R</italic><sub>max</sub> would be 48 RU [theoretical <italic>R</italic><sub>max</sub> = (100 RU) &#x000d7; (38.7 kDa/81.2 kDa) &#x000d7; 1], while binding of two &#x003b4; subunits would yield an <italic>R</italic><sub>max</sub> of 96 RU [theoretical <italic>R</italic><sub>max</sub> = (100 RU) &#x000d7; (38.7 kDa/81.2 kDa)&#x000d7;2]. The binding response for &#x003b4; saturated at &#x0223c;100 RU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A), indicating that two &#x003b4; subunits bound a single &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> clamp. Identical results were obtained regardless of whether we utilized a his<sub>6</sub>-tagged form of &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> (&#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>), or a form of &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> comprised of one myc-tagged subunit in complex with a his<sub>6</sub>-tagged subunit (&#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Importantly, since this clamp was captured using anti-Penta&#x02022;His antibody, the result with &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> indicates that upon binding two &#x003b4; subunits, the clamp persists as a dimer in solution. If each &#x003b4; bound to a separate cleft, and binding of each &#x003b4; acted to open a dimer interface, binding of two &#x003b4; subunits would have broken the clamp dimer, releasing the myc-tagged protomer from the his<sub>6</sub>-tagged &#x003b2; subunit captured on the chip surface, reducing the RU signal.</p><p>We next determined the stoichiometry of the &#x003b4;&#x02013;&#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> complex. As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, the binding response for &#x003b4; saturated at &#x0223c;50 RU when &#x0223c;100 RU of &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> was captured on the chip surface. This value is similar to the theoretical <italic>R</italic><sub>max</sub> limit of 48 RU for 1:1 binding under these conditions, indicating that the &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> heterodimer bound a single &#x003b4; subunit. This result demonstrates that our &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> preparation is homogeneous.</p></sec><sec><title>Two &#x003b4; subunits interact cooperatively with a single &#x003b2; clamp</title><p>In addition to analyzing stoichiometries, we were also interested in determining kinetic constants for each clamp-&#x003b4; interaction.

Although the data for the &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup>&#x02013;&#x003b4; interaction fit well to the Langmuir model (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> = 9.38), the &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;&#x003b4; data did not (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> = 129), suggesting that it was not a simple 1:1 interaction. Thus, the 43 nM <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value based on Langmuir binding inaccurately describes the &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;&#x003b4; interaction. Closer inspection of the shapes of the association and dissociation phases of the sensorgrams suggested that the &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;&#x003b4; interaction involved negative cooperativity. For example, the shape of the dissociation phase of the sensorgram changed significantly as a function of the &#x003b4; concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). At low &#x003b4; concentrations (&#x0003c;50 nM), dissociation of &#x003b4; was slow (2.22 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), while at high &#x003b4; concentrations (&#x0003e;50 nM) its dissociation was 5.3-fold faster (1.17 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Recalculation of the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> for &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;&#x003b4; utilizing only the sensorgrams resulting from lower concentrations of &#x003b4; (0.1&#x02013;50 nM) using the Langmuir binding model, under the assumption that these results largely reflect binding of the first &#x003b4; to the clamp, revealed a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 17.5 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B and F), which is very close to the 15.6 nM <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value calculated for the &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup>&#x02013;&#x003b4; heterodimer. Furthermore, this data set fit well to the Langmuir binding model (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> = 3.25). Taken together, these results suggest that the &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> heterodimer is fully proficient for binding one &#x003b4; via the &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> subunit, but is unable to bind the second &#x003b4; due to the mutation affecting the cleft in the &#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> subunit. These findings also further demonstrate the purity of our &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> preparation.</p><p>In order to further characterize interactions of &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> with &#x003b4;, we took advantage of the fact that dissociation of &#x003b4; from the clamp was biphasic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B and C). Since only the slow dissociation phase (2.22 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was observed when low levels of &#x003b4; were injected, it must result from loss of the tightly bound &#x003b4;, while the rapid phase (1.17 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) reflects dissociation of the second, more loosely bound &#x003b4;. As a result of this binding mechanism, we were able to perform a &#x02018;double-injection&#x02019; experiment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E), in which we first injected a saturating level of &#x003b4; over captured &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> to form a &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;&#x003b4;<sub>2</sub> complex, allowed for dissociation of the more loosely bound &#x003b4; (&#x003b4;2), resulting in a &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;&#x003b4;<sub>1</sub> complex, and then injected increasing levels of &#x003b4; over the &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;&#x003b4;<sub>1</sub> complex to characterize binding of the second &#x003b4; (&#x003b4;2) to the clamp. Using this approach, &#x003b4;2 bound the &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;&#x003b4;<sub>1</sub> complex with a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 160 nM (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> = 1.43), or roughly 10-fold less tightly than our estimated <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> for binding of the first &#x003b4; (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>&#x003b4;1 = 17.5 nM; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E and F). To confirm that our double inject experiment accurately measured the affinity of the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;&#x003b4;<sub>1</sub> complex for &#x003b4;2 we also characterized this interaction using ITC. ITC isotherms fit well to the sequential binding sites model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), yielding <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values for binding of the two &#x003b4; subunits of 259 nM and 4 &#x003bc;M, respectively. The &#x0223c;15-fold different in <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values calculated by ITC is similar to the &#x0223c;10-fold difference observed by SPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>F). The <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values determined by ITC are weaker than those determined by SPR because the SPR experiments were performed at 25&#x000b0;C, while the ITC was performed at 37&#x000b0;C, and <italic>K</italic><sub>A</sub> decreases as temperature increases. Nevertheless, these findings indicate that two &#x003b4; subunits simultaneously bind a single &#x003b2; clamp with negative cooperativity. Finally, the intracellular concentration of &#x003b4; is reported to be &#x0223c;1.4 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).

Clamp unloading was evidenced by both the increased abundance of free clamp observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A, as well as the apparent increase in the level of clamp-free nicked circular DNA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B. Unloading was dependent on ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A and B, lane 7), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). These same conditions promoted unloading of &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup>, albeit with a significantly reduced efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C and D). Whereas &#x0223c;1 &#x000b5;M of DnaX was sufficient to unload &#x0223c;50% of &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> from DNA in 10 min, we were unable to achieve this level of unloading for &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> at concentrations of DnaX up to 5 &#x003bc;M.

Using this method, we purified a clamp (&#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup>) consisting of the &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> protomer in complex with &#x003b2;<sup>C</sup>, which bears a mutant cleft that we demonstrated to be severely, if not completely impaired for interaction with the eubacterial CBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Our biochemical characterization of the &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> heterodimer illustrated that a single cleft is sufficient for efficient loading of the clamp onto DNA by DnaX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), as well as stimulation of Pol III* replication <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>). In contrast, both clefts contributed to clamp unloading, regardless of whether it was catalyzed by DnaX or &#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8 F9">Figures 8 and 9</xref>). Our finding that &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> was loaded more efficiently than &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> (72% versus 46%; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>) may be the result of its reduced efficiency of unloading by DnaX. Regardless, these findings suggest that DnaX utilizes distinct mechanisms for loading and unloading clamps. Interactions of the clamp with the DNA template may underlie this difference. A crystal structure of the &#x003b2; clamp on DNA was recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In the crystal, residues R24 and Q149, among others, interacted specifically with dsDNA. In addition, the cleft of the clamp interacted with ssDNA located downstream of the 3&#x02032;-end of the primer. Thus, inefficient unloading of the &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> clamp catalyzed by DnaX may be due to competition between ssDNA and DnaX for the single cleft. Alternatively, interaction(s) of the clamp with DNA may contribute to unloading. Further work is required in order to test these hypotheses.</p><p>In the crystal structure of residues 1&#x02013;140 of &#x003b4; in complex with a mutant form of the clamp that exists as a monomer in solution (&#x003b2;<sub>monomer</sub>), residues L73-F74 of &#x003b4; contacted the CBM of &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Thus, the simplest interpretation of our results concerning interaction of &#x003b4; with the &#x003b2; clamp is that two &#x003b4; subunits bind a single dimeric clamp, with each &#x003b4; contacting a separate cleft. Our finding that &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> bound a single &#x003b4; is consistent with this conclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). It has been suggested that binding of &#x003b4; to the clamp destabilizes the adjacent dimer interface, effecting clamp opening/unloading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Results discussed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> demonstrate that binding of two &#x003b4; subunits to a single clamp fails to dissociate the clamp into monomers. Thus, the ability of &#x003b4; to open a dimer interface in the clamp appears to require more than it simply contacting the cleft region. This result, taken together with our finding that both clefts are required for &#x003b4; to unload the clamp from DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>), suggests that two &#x003b4; subunits may catalyze clamp unloading by simultaneously binding to both clefts and the DNA. In this way, &#x003b4; could utilize energy from DNA binding to induce a conformational change in &#x003b2; to open one, or possibly both dimer interfaces, effectively unloading the clamp from the DNA. Further work is required in order to test this model.</p><p>Our observation that &#x003b4; binds the clamp with negative cooperativity may be the result of steric clashing between the two &#x003b4; subunits. Based on the crystal structure, it was argued that the positioning of &#x003b4; on the &#x003b2;<sub>monomer</sub> would preclude a second &#x003b4; from binding the unoccupied cleft due to steric constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). However, it should be stressed that the actual conformation of &#x003b4; on a dimeric clamp, either in solution or encircling DNA is unknown. Alternatively, the observed negative cooperativity may result form conformational changes induced in the peptide backbone of the clamp upon binding of the first &#x003b4;. These conformational changes may influence the structure of the second cleft, and/or other surfaces of the clamp involved in interactions with one or more specific partner proteins. An interesting aspect of this model is that partners could impose a plastic hierarchy in clamp&#x02013;partner interactions. By inducing conformational changes in &#x003b2;, binding of one partner to the clamp could dictate both the identity(ies) and the order in which additional partners are recruited. Clamp&#x02013;DNA and partner&#x02013;DNA interactions likely influence these interactions, as well, and thus contribute to the switching mechanism(s).</p><p>Our finding that &#x003b4; requires both clefts in order to unload clamp from DNA suggests that that a clamp in complex with a partner that is doing work on DNA is protected from unloading, while a clamp that is not in complex with a partner is efficiently unloaded from DNA by &#x003b4;. Alternatively, since &#x003b4; binds the clamp with negative cooperativity, it could effect displacement of a resident partner, provided it had access to one cleft, and was able to influence affinity of the partner bound to the other cleft. Although it would be counter productive to unload a clamp that was in complex with a partner that was doing work on DNA, it would be advantageous to unload a clamp that was in complex with a partner that was for some reason precluded from functioning properly, such as Pol III* stalled at a lesion. Conformational differences between a moving Pol III* and a stalled Pol III* may influence access of &#x003b4; to the cleft of a &#x003b2; clamp that is not in complex with Pol III&#x003b1;. Upon binding, &#x003b4; may induce a conformational change in the polypeptide backbone of the &#x003b2; clamp, which, in turn, may destabilize interaction of the clamp with Pol III&#x003b1;, leading to dissociation of Pol III*. This would allow for recruitment of either another Pol capable of catalyzing TLS through its association with clamp persisting on the DNA, or a second &#x003b4; to effect unloading of the clamp. In the latter case, DnaX could then load a new clamp at the primer/template junction abutting the lesion for subsequent recruitment of a TLS Pol. Thus, &#x003b4; and/or DnaX may influence Pol switching either directly, by disassembling clamp-Pol complexes stalled at lesions, or indirectly, by loading new clamps at primer/template junctions abutting lesions.</p><p>Our finding that the &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> heterodimer was indistinguishable from &#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> with respect to its ability to stimulate Pol III* replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>) indicates that processive replication by Pol III* requires that Pol III&#x003b1; interact with only a single cleft in the clamp. As such, these findings provide support for the toolbelt model, in which Pol III* is bound to one cleft, and a TLS Pol is bound to the second cleft. Alternatively, the structure of the Pol IV little finger domain in complex with the &#x003b2; clamp, indicating that Pol IV contacts both the cleft and the rim of the clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), suggests that surfaces of the clamp in addition to the cleft play roles in Pol function and/or switching. Our finding that Pol III&#x003b1; retained weak affinity for &#x003b2;<sup>C</sup> is consistent with this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, Pol switching on the clamp may involve surfaces in addition to the cleft. Our method to purify heterodimeric clamp proteins will enable a detailed biochemical dissection of the mechanisms by which the clamp mediates Pol switching <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Human PCNA remains on circular DNA with a half-life of &#x0223c;24 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Since there are &#x0223c;2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> Okazaki fragments synthesized on lagging strand during each replication cycle, assuming an average length of 200 bp, and there are &#x0223c;10<sup>5</sup> PCNA trimers in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>), it seems likely that eukaryotes recycle their clamps on average &#x0223c;100 times each during replication/repair synthesis. The human clamp loader complex, RFC, as well as the 40-kDa subunit of RFC, RFC2, are each capable of unloading PCNA from DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). It will be interesting to determine whether interactions of RFC2 with PCNA involve negative cooperativity, as well as whether three RFC2 subunits are capable of binding a single PCNA clamp. Likewise, purification of differentially tagged heterotrimeric forms of PCNA would enable the determination of the number of clefts required for loading, processive replication by Pol &#x003b4; and Pol &#x003b5;, and unloading, as well as DNA repair and damage tolerance functions that are managed by the clamp.</p><p>In summary, findings discussed in this report indicate that interaction of the &#x003b2; clamp with &#x003b4;, as well as possibly other partner proteins, is far more complex than previously appreciated. Further work is required in order to understand the mechanistic basis for the observed negative cooperativity between &#x003b2; and &#x003b4;. Likewise, it will be interesting to determine whether additional partners interact with the clamp through positive or negative cooperativity, and whether cooperativity is observed <italic>in trans</italic> between different partners. Although the goal of the work discussed in this report was focused largely on determining the roles of the clefts in clamp loading, Pol III* replication and clamp unloading/recycling, our method for purification of heterodimeric clamp proteins will facilitate detailed biochemical dissection of the mechanistic roles of the clamp in DNA replication and repair, as well as in coordinating the actions of its multiple partners on the DNA during DNA replication, repair and TLS.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> grants <grant-num>GM066094</grant-num> (to M.D.S.); and <grant-num>F31GM073586</grant-num> (to S.K.S.P.).
