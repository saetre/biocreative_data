We have previously shown that semaphorin 4D (Sema4D), a ligand produced by different cell types, is a proangiogenic molecule that acts by binding to its receptor, plexin B1, expressed on endothelial cells (Conrotto, P., D. Valdembri, S. Corso, G. Serini, L. Tamagnone, P.M. Comoglio, F. Bussolino, and S. Giordano. 2005. <italic>Blood</italic>. 105:4321&#x02013;4329). The present work highlights the role of Sema4D produced by the tumor microenvironment on neoplastic angiogenesis. We show that in an environment lacking Sema4D, the ability of cancer cells to generate tumor masses and metastases is severely impaired. This condition can be explained by a defective vascularization inside the tumor. We demonstrate that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the main cells producing Sema4D within the tumor stroma and that their ability to produce Sema4D is critical for tumor angiogenesis and vessel maturation. This study helps to explain the protumoral role of inflammatory cells of the tumor stroma and leads to the identification of an angiogenic molecule that might be a novel therapeutic target.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: b-FGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; EC, endothelial cell; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; MSR1, macrophage scavenger receptor 1; Sema4D, semaphorin 4D; TAM, tumor-associated macrophage; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus.</p></fn><fn><p>P.

These ligands exert their activities by binding to high affinity receptors known as plexins, a family of transmembrane molecules that share structural homology with semaphorins themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). An increasing amount of data show that these two protein families also exert their action outside the nervous system, as they play a critical role in cardiac and skeletal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), epithelial morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), and tumor growth and metastatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Moreover, studies suggest that these molecules are important players during angiogenesis, as they regulate blood vessel growth and endothelial cell (EC) homing during vessel development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Although secreted class III semaphorins inhibit EC migration and in vitro vessel formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), class IV semaphorins positively regulate angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Angiogenesis is a complex, multistep process in which ECs of preexisting blood vessels, challenged by appropriate biochemical and physical cues, dynamically remodel their cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix adhesions and reorganize themselves into a mature, hierarchically organized system of hollow endothelial tubes that is eventually stabilized by interaction with pericytes.</p><p>We and others have identified semaphorin 4D (Sema4D), also known as CD100, as a potent proangiogenic molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Sema4D, originally discovered in the immune system, where it regulates B cell aggregation and survival and T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), can be found either as a 150-kD membrane-bound form or as a 120-kD soluble molecule; the latter is originated as a consequence of a proteolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Sema4D acts by binding to its high affinity receptor, plexin B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), to an intermediate affinity receptor, plexin B2 (both of which are widely expressed) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), or to a low affinity receptor, CD72, which is mainly expressed by cells of the hematopoietic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Sema4D and plexin B1/B2 share structural homology with the tyrosine kinase receptors c-Met and Ron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). We have previously shown that activation of plexin B1 through Sema4D binding transactivates c-Met and promotes the invasive ability of tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Moreover, we have also demonstrated that Sema4D, upon binding plexin B1 and activating c-Met, promotes angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>).</p><p>Reports have recently pointed out the close correlation between inflammatory infiltration of the tumor stroma and a high vascular grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Because Sema4D is produced by inflammatory cells present in the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), we wanted to assess whether stroma-derived Sema4D could influence the tumorigenic ability of cells as well as their capacity to originate metastasis. In this paper, we show that in an environment lacking Sema4D, the ability of breast cancer cells to originate tumor masses and metastases is severely impaired. This impairment is paralleled by an altered vascularization inside the tumor. We also provide evidence that the main cells producing the semaphorin in the tumor stroma are the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and that TAM-derived Sema4D is critical for tumor angiogenesis and for the maturation of blood vessels. This work thus highlights a novel function of cells involved in the inflammatory response of tumors and identifies Sema4D as a new player in the complex interaction between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Tumor growth and metastatic ability of breast cancer cells is impaired in Sema4D KO mice</title><p>Previous works have shown that Sema4D is endowed with angiogenic properties, both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). However, Sema4D is dispensable for the formation of vessels during embryogenesis, as Sema4D KO mice are viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). To investigate if Sema4D might play a role in pathological vasculogenesis, such as that taking place in tumors, we grafted syngeneic tumor cells (TSA, breast cancer) both in WT and in Sema4D KO (KO) mice. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>, tumor growth was significantly impaired in mice lacking Sema4D in comparison to WT mice (an almost sixfold reduction at the end of the experiment; P &#x0003c; 0.0001). Similar experiments performed with three other breast cancer cell lines (66cl4, 4T1, and 168FARN) gave similar results, as the grafted cells originated smaller tumors in KO mice in comparison to the WT animals (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072602/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072602/DC1</ext-link>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Tumor growth and metastatic ability of breast cancer cells is impaired in Sema4D KO mice.</bold> (A) TSA breast cancer cells were subcutaneously injected in WT and Sema4D KO mice.

Failure of the interactions between these cell types has been described in some human pathologies, including tumor angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Because pericytes are recruited by stromal-derived cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>), we decided to verify if they were normally localized along the altered vessels of tumors grown in Sema4D KO mice. We thus stained tumor slices with anti-NG2, an antibody that identifies pericytes.

Most of them, in fact, were negative for the presence of pericytes, which were instead normally present in tumors that originated in control mice.

Similar results were also obtained from the analysis of human cells; in fact, although monocytes did not express Sema4D, activated macrophages did (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072602/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072602/DC1</ext-link>). Moreover, we found that, in vitro<italic>,</italic> Sema4D expression was not induced by differentiating stimuli (M-CSF, PMA, IL-10, or TGF-&#x003b2;), whereas it was induced by activating molecules (such as LPS; Fig. S4). All of these data suggest that the expression of Sema4D is not strictly liked to monocyte/macrophage differentiation, and that this molecule is expressed on different types of activated macrophages.</p><p>We then analyzed whether macrophages of KO mice behaved normally in term of response to activating stimuli and of cytokine production. As shown in Fig. S5 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072602/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072602/DC1</ext-link>), macrophages from Sema4D KO mice were indeed able to respond to LPS by increasing the production of cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;. Moreover, we did not observe significant differences in cytokine production between WT- and KO-derived TAMs (Fig. S5), or in their ability to differentiate in M2 TAMs (as shown by the expression of macrophage scavenger receptor 1 [MSR1], a marker of this cell type). However, we observed that the mean number of macrophages recruited to the tumor was lower in Sema4D KO than in WT mice (19.03 &#x000b1; 5.2 and 35.57 &#x000b1; 4.2 F4/80<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells/field, respectively).</p><p>To prove the role of TAM-produced Sema4D in tumor angiogenesis and growth, we performed several experiments. To begin, we purified and cultured TAMs from tumors grown both in WT and KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Although the supernatant of cultures of WT TAMs was able to efficiently promote EC migration, the supernatant of KO TAMs was significantly less effective; moreover, the chemoattractive activity of WT supernatant was partially lost in the presence of Sema4D or plexin B1 blocking antibodies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>).</p><p>Because we have previously shown that recruitment of the c-Met tyrosine kinase receptor by the activated Sema4D receptor (plexin B1) is required for the angiogenic ability of Sema4D, we wondered if c-Met inhibition impaired TAM-induced EC motility. In line with our previous results, inhibition of c-Met with the small molecule PHA-665752 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>) resulted in a significant decrease of EC motility in response to WT TAM supernatant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the in vivo angiogenic role of TAMs, Matrigel plugs containing either WT or KO TAMs were subcutaneously implanted in KO mice. After 14 d, mice received dextran-FITC and were killed. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>, Matrigel plugs containing known angiogenic factors (such as hepatocyte growth factor [HGF] or basic fibroblast growth factor [b-FGF]) displayed several well-organized vessels, plugs containing WT TAMs were also well vascularized and showed well-formed and branched vessels, and plugs containing KO TAMs displayed small and poorly organized vessels. Addition of blocking plexin B1 antibodies (ec6.9), as well as of the c-Met inhibitor PHA-665752, resulted in the lack of an organized vessel tree, suggesting that activation of these two receptors is mandatory for the Sema4D-induced angiogenic response.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Sema4D produced by TAMs promotes angiogenesis and increases the tumorigenic ability of cancer cells.</bold> (A) Matrigel plugs containing either WT or KO TAMs were subcutaneously implanted in KO mice.

In recent years, in fact, data collected both from experimental systems and clinical observations have strengthened the idea that the tumor microenvironment and neoplastic cells act in concert and contribute as a functional whole to the growth and progression of the tumor mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). This idea was originally proposed by Paget's famous &#x0201c;seed and soil&#x0201d; hypothesis, which highlighted the possible contribution of stromal cells to the process of tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms promoting tumor angiogenesis are not yet fully understood, but it is believed that the most important factor is tumor hypoxia, which induces the release of angiogenic molecules from tumor cells, attracting ECs and inflammatory cells. Recruited ECs migrate toward the hypoxic areas, whereas inflammatory cells, in turn, secrete molecules that intensify the angiogenic stimulus. Once ECs are engaged, perivascular support cells stabilize nascent vessels and guarantee appropriate blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Many molecules involved in these processes have been identified, and it has recently become clear that most of them originate from stromal cells recruited to the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Tumor-infiltrating inflammatory cells undergo a process of maturation or &#x0201c;education&#x0201d; within the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>), and pharmacological or genetic inhibition of molecules that are up-regulated in these cells was indeed shown to be able to impair tumor progression in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>).</p><p>In this scenario, a critical role has been demonstrated for TAMs that represent the major inflammatory component of the stroma of many tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Experimental models have demonstrated that the lack of recruitment of macrophages at the tumor site results in decreased tumorigenic ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>), and clinical evidence has shown that there is a correlation between a high TAM content inside the tumor and a poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). These results have been recently confirmed by gene profiling data showing that genes associated to leukocyte or macrophage infiltration are part of the molecular signatures linked to a poor prognosis in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). In this line, the identification of macrophage-derived molecules that support the protumoral activity of these cells becomes very important.</p><p>Sema4D is a proangiogenic factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), but this activity is dispensable for &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; angiogenesis because Sema4D KO mice are viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). It has been previously shown that tumor angiogenesis is partially different from the norm (in fact, tumor vessels are often abnormal in structure and function) and is characterized by an altered vessel maturation, possibly because of an inappropriate balance between vasculogenic and angiogenic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). We thus wondered if Sema4D could play any role in tumor angiogenesis. In this paper, we show that Sema4D is required for proper vessel maturation in tumors, as its deficiency results in the presence of vessels of smaller diameter that are poorly lined by perimural cells, such as pericytes. Interestingly, we have observed that the number of lymphatic vessels in the tumors is not altered in Sema4D KO mice (unpublished data). We also demonstrate that the angiogenic Sema4D is produced by stromal cells infiltrating the tumor. Although another paper has shown an angiogenic role of tumor-derived Sema4D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), we could not observe a different behavior of breast cancer cells, either producing Sema4D (TSA, 4T1, and 168FARN; unpublished data) or not (66cl4; reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>), when they where subcutaneously injected in KO mice. Moreover, when we silenced the expression of this semaphorin in the producing cells, we did not observe any significant difference compared with control cells (Fig. S6, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072602/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072602/DC1</ext-link>). A possible reason for these divergences can be caused by the different tumor types used in the two experimental systems. In breast cancer, in fact, a very good correlation has been established between the presence of a strong inflammatory component, mainly containing TAMs, and the malignant behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). It is possible that the head and neck carcinoma cells used by Basile et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>) rely on different mechanisms to promote angiogenesis and are less dependent on the tumor microenvironment.</p><p>The tumor stroma contains several cell types, either &#x0201c;resident&#x0201d; (such as fibroblasts or adipocytes) or &#x0201c;infiltrated.&#x0201d; Because most of the Sema4D<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were also positive for leukocyte markers, we hypothesized that they were blood-derived cells. Bone marrow transplantation experiments formally proved that the Sema4D-producing cells are indeed of hematopoietic origin, as we could recover the WT phenotype (concerning tumor growth and angiogenesis) by transplanting a WT bone marrow into Sema4D KO mice.</p><p>A recent report has highlighted the role of Sema4D in platelet activation and thrombus formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Because it is known that blood clotting contributes to tumor growth and dissemination by creating a fibrin clot surrounding tumor cells that can protect them from apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), we investigated whether platelet-derived Sema4D could contribute to tumor growth. Chronic treatment of mice with clopidogrel and aspirin did not result in significant changes in the growth of grafted tumors either in WT or KO mice. These results suggest that platelet-derived Sema4D is not required for tumor angiogenesis.</p><p>Among the cells of the tumor stroma, we found the highest levels of Sema4D in TAMs, expressing markers of the M2 type. These cells are known to tune inflammatory responses and adaptive Th2 immunity, to scavenge debris, and to promote angiogenesis, tissue remodeling, and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). We found that M2-type TAMs were also present in the microenvironment of Sema4D KO mice and that the absence of this molecule did not significantly affect their functional response to activating stimuli and their ability to produce cytokines. However, the inability of TAMs to produce Sema4D strongly decreased their capacity to attract ECs, in vitro and in vivo<italic>,</italic> and to promote vessel maturation. Moreover, WT-derived TAMs coinjected with tumor cells in KO animals were able to promote tumor growth at similar levels as in WT mice.</p><p>We show that Sema4D exerts its activity on ECs through its high affinity receptor plexin B1, as demonstrated by the lack of chemotactic and angiogenic responses in the presence of plexin B1 blocking antibodies. Moreover, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), plexin-induced c-Met activation is a crucial event in Sema4D signal transduction, as c-Met inhibition resulted in the loss of Sema4D-induced biological responses.</p><p>On the basis of the reported results and of data derived from the literature, how can we figure the activity of Sema4D in the tumor stroma? We propose the following model. Cancer cells start to grow and reach a mass that becomes hypoxic. Hypoxia induces several changes in cancer cells and is a strong recruiting factor for TAMs. TAMs, indeed, accumulate preferentially in poorly vascularized tumor regions, where they stop and &#x0201c;adapt&#x0201d; to hypoxia by increasing the expression of hypoxia-inducible and proangiogenic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). Most of these activities are mediated by the hypoxia-responsive transcription of hypoxia-inducible factor 1; its inhibition, in fact, resulted in in vivo impairment of macrophage motility and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). Among the genes induced by hypoxia are the <italic>c-Met</italic> tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>) and <italic>Sema4D</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). TAM-derived Sema4D can thus trigger the plexin expressed by macrophages and activate c-Met. This receptor, in turn, promotes the production of several cytokines that can contribute to the protumorigenic activity of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). Among the several proteases produced by TAMs is membrane type 1 metalloproteinase (whose expression is also induced by hypoxia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>), which can cleave the membrane-bound Sema4D and induce its release as a soluble protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) able to act on distant cells. Production of the soluble form has been shown to be critical for the angiogenic activity of Sema4D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), as it can diffuse and act on ECs, stimulating angiogenesis, and on mural cells, promoting their recruitment. Secreted Sema4D can also stimulate the invasive ability of cancer cells (which very frequently express its receptor). In previous works, we have shown that this biological activity requires the recruitment of c-Met, probably facilitated by hypoxia-induced c-Met overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). Loss of c-Met activation can be one of the mechanisms contributing to the decreased metastatic ability of cancer cells grown in KO mice.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified a novel molecule produced in the tumor stroma that can contribute to the interaction between the tumor microenvironment and tumor cells by promoting tumor angiogenesis and invasion. This molecule is produced by macrophages, a cell type that is strongly implicated in tumor progression and associated with a poor prognosis of several tumor types. As many attempts are now ongoing to target the tumor stroma, we propose Sema4D as a new candidate for antiangiogenic and antimetastatic cancer therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>TSA, 66cl4, 168FARN, MLP29, and 4T1 cells were cultured in DMEM and were supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin.

Fig. S2 provides information regarding the expression of plexin B1 (high affinity receptor for Sema4D) in TSA cells; it also shows that Sema4D is able to promote the motogenic/invasive ability of the examined breast cancer cells. Fig. S3 illustrates that Sema4D produced by platelets does not contribute to tumor growth. Fig. S4 shows that human macrophages, but not monocytes, express Sema4D; it also shows that Sema4D expression is probably linked to macrophage activation better than differentiation. Fig. S5 confirms that macrophages obtained from Sema4D KO mice are functionally similar to those taken from WT mice. Fig. S6 shows that Sema4D silencing in mammary tumor cells does not affect tumor growth.
