Poell, A. Ranft, U. Samulowitz, G. Fachinger, M. Golding, D.T. Shima, U. Deutsch, and D. Vestweber. 2002. <italic>EMBO J</italic>. 21:4885&#x02013;4895). We show that VE-PTP is indeed required for endothelial cell contact integrity, because down-regulation of its expression enhanced endothelial cell permeability, augmented leukocyte transmigration, and inhibited VE-cadherin&#x02013;mediated adhesion. Binding of neutrophils as well as lymphocytes to endothelial cells triggered rapid (5 min) dissociation of VE-PTP from VE-cadherin. This dissociation was only seen with tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1;&#x02013;activated, but not resting, endothelial cells. Besides leukocytes, vascular endothelial growth factor also rapidly dissociated VE-PTP from VE-cadherin, indicative of a more general role of VE-PTP in the regulation of endothelial cell contacts. Dissociation of VE-PTP and VE-cadherin in endothelial cells was accompanied by tyrosine phoshorylation of VE-cadherin, &#x003b2;-catenin, and plakoglobin. Surprisingly, only plakoglobin but not &#x003b2;-catenin was necessary for VE-PTP to support VE-cadherin adhesion in endothelial cells. In addition, inhibiting the expression of VE-PTP preferentially increased tyrosine phosphorylation of plakoglobin but not &#x003b2;-catenin. In conclusion, leukocytes interacting with endothelial cells rapidly dissociate VE-PTP from VE-cadherin, weakening endothelial cell contacts via a mechanism that requires plakoglobin but not &#x003b2;-catenin.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ESAM, endothelial cell&#x02013;selective adhesion molecule; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; JAM, junctional adhesion molecule; PECAM-1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule; siRNA, small interfering RNA; VE, vascular endothelial; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VE-PTP, vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Recruitment of leukocytes into sites of inflammation is very efficiently regulated by the endothelium. It provides a cascade of adhesion and signaling molecules, such as selectins, chemokines, and integrin ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>), that attract and capture leukocytes, and it provides well controlled but not yet fully understood mechanisms that open a path for leukocytes through the endothelial cell layer and the underlying basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>).</p><p>Although the molecular mechanisms mediating the capture, activation, and migration of leukocytes are well characterized, the actual diapedesis step, the migration of leukocytes through the blood vessel wall, is less well understood. There is good evidence that leukocytes can use two different pathways, either through the junctions of neighboring endothelial cells or through the body of single endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). The transcellular pathway was documented in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>) as well as in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>); however, quantitative comparison of both pathways showed that, at least in vitro, the junctional route seems to be the major pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), even though the importance of the transcellular pathway may vary depending on the vascular bed from which the endothelial cells originate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>).</p><p>The majority of the endothelial membrane proteins that participate in leukocyte diapedesis are found at endothelial cell contacts. Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), the small family of tight junction&#x02013;associated junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), the endothelial cell&#x02013;selective adhesion molecule (ESAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), CD99 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), and CD99L2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) are all required in vivo for the migration of leukocytes through the vessel wall, as was demonstrated either by blocking antibodies and/or by analyzing gene-deficient mice. Diapedesis was described as a process of sequential steps, with PECAM-1 being important for the entry of leukocytes into the contact area between endothelial cells and CD99 being required for the movement through the endothelial cell layer, as suggested from in vitro transmigration experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). In vivo, it was shown that mice deficient for PECAM-1 accumulate leukocytes between the endothelium and basement membrane, whereas leukocytes become trapped between endothelial contacts in JAM-A&#x02013;deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, vascular endothelial (VE)&#x02013;cadherin acts as a barrier in leukocyte diapedesis. It is of major importance for the stability of endothelial cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), and antibodies against VE-cadherin can disrupt endothelial junctions in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>) and can enhance leukocyte recruitment into inflamed peritoneum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that homophilic VE-cadherin trans interactions need to be opened to allow leukocytes to migrate through the endothelial cell barrier. Indeed, it has been described that VE-cadherin moves away from endothelial cell contacts at sites of leukocyte diapedesis, whereas other adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) 1 and PECAM-1 form a ringlike structure surrounding leukocytes at such sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>).</p><p>Tyrosine phosphorylation of adherens junction proteins has been correlated with the loosening of cadherin-mediated adhesion in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). For endothelial cells, soluble factors that increase vascular permeability, such as histamine, thrombin, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), as well as C5a-activated neutrophils, were shown to affect tyrosine phosphorylation of various components of the VE-cadherin&#x02013;catenin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). In addition, the docking of leukocytes to endothelial cells was found to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin, which was demonstrated to be essential for transmigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Very recently, it was shown that the binding of leukocytes to ICAM-1 stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin. Intriguingly, VE-cadherin mutant proteins deficient for certain tyrosine residues inhibited leukocyte diapedesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>).</p><p>Vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP) is an endothelial-specific membrane protein that can bind to the endothelial tyrosine kinase receptor Tie-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). VE-PTP is essential for vascular remodeling, and gene-disrupted mice die at E9.5 during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). We found that this tyrosine phosphatase associates specifically with VE-cadherin and enhances the adhesive function of VE-cadherin when cotransfected in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). Whether VE-PTP is indeed relevant for the function of VE-cadherin in endothelial cells has not yet been analyzed.</p><p>In this paper, we show that VE-PTP is indeed essential for the maintenance of endothelial cell contact integrity and for the adhesive function of VE-cadherin in endothelial cells. Consequently, knocking down VE-PTP expression by RNA interference increased diapedesis of leukocytes. Furthermore, docking of leukocytes to endothelial cells triggered the dissociation of VE-PTP from VE-cadherin within minutes, suggesting a mechanism that allows leukocytes to reduce the adhesive function of VE-cadherin and, thereby, to support the opening of endothelial cell contacts. Interestingly, VEGF triggers the dissociation of VE-PTP and VE-cadherin with similar kinetics. Searching for adherens junction proteins in endothelial cells, which could mediate the effect of VE-PTP on VE-cadherin, we found that it is plakoglobin but not &#x003b2;-catenin that is required for VE-PTP to support VE-cadherin&#x02013;mediated adhesion.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Redistribution of VE-PTP to endothelial cell contacts and increased VE-cadherin association with higher cell density</title><p>Because we had shown previously that VE-PTP supports VE-cadherin function when exogenously expressed in transfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>), we expected it to be expressed at endothelial cell contacts. Surprisingly, VE-PTP was hardly detectable at cell contacts of mouse bEnd.3 endothelioma cells when recently confluent cells were analyzed. Instead, VE-PTP was found at an intracellular compartment located close to the nucleus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Staining of this compartment for VE-PTP was gradually lost with increasing confluence, whereas cell contact staining increased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). At 8 d after plating (cells had been plated at a 12.5-fold lower density than normal; see Materials and methods), VE-PTP was much less visible at intracellular sites and colocalized with VE-cadherin at cell contacts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Immunoprecipitates of VE-PTP contained considerably more VE-cadherin when obtained from cells analyzed 8 d after plating compared with cells at 5 d after plating, although similar amounts of VE-PTP and VE-cadherin (standardized to the protein content of cell lysates) were expressed in both cell samples (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). A similar result was obtained for human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) plated at the same cell density but grown for 3, 4, and 5 d (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Thus, without affecting overall cellular expression levels, increasing cell density is accompanied by increasing amounts of VE-PTP at cell contacts and more VE-PTP associated with VE-cadherin.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>VE-PTP redistributes from an endosomal recycling compartment to endothelial cell contacts with increasing cell confluence.</bold> (A) Indirect immunofluorescence staining of mouse bEnd.3 endothelioma of increasing cell confluence (days after seeding are indicated) with an mAb against VE-PTP.

We could demonstrate that VE-PTP&#x02013;VE-cadherin association occurs in intact cells and not just subsequently to the lysis procedure, because both proteins were coprecipitated from lysates of CHO cells that coexpressed the proteins but not from mixed lysates of two CHO cell lines, each expressing only one of the two proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>).</p><p>To characterize the intracellular compartment that accumulates VE-PTP at low cell density, we allowed endothelial cells to endocytose Texas red&#x02013;labeled transferrin for 30 min and costained the cells with antibodies against VE-PTP. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, a large fraction of the VE-PTP&#x02013;containing vesicles colocalized with endocytic vesicles. Comparison with Rab11, a marker for the endocytic recycling compartment, again showed a partial overlap with the staining for VE-PTP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Thus, VE-PTP seems to reside in an endocytic compartment until it is translocated to endothelial cell contacts once the junctions have matured.</p></sec><sec><title>VE-PTP is required for endothelial cell contact integrity and VE-cadherin function</title><p>To investigate the relevance of VE-PTP for endothelial cell contact integrity, we inhibited the expression of VE-PTP in endothelial cells by small interfering RNA (siRNA). As shown in immunoblots (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>), with this technique we could inhibit the expression of VE-PTP in bEnd.5 mouse endothelioma cells by up to 95% and in HUVECs by up to 90% when compared with negative control siRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). VE-PTP staining was undetectable in endothelioma cells after siRNA (not depicted). Silencing of VE-PTP did not cause loss of confluence of endothelial cells, and immunofluorescence staining for VE-cadherin, JAM-A, ESAM, and PECAM-1 at cell contacts was essentially unchanged (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080406/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080406/DC1</ext-link>). Using this technique, we tested whether inhibition of VE-PTP expression would affect the permeability of a monolayer of mouse endothelioma cells for the diffusion of 250 kD FITC-dextran. bEnd.5 cells transfected with the VE-PTP&#x02013;specific siRNA or with a negative control siRNA were plated on Transwell filters for 24 h before the assay. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, inhibition of VE-PTP expression by siRNA increased the cell layer permeability by 60 &#x000b1; 15% as compared with the control.

For negative controls we immobilized E-selectin&#x02013;Fc. No specific binding of endothelial cells to E-selectin&#x02013;Fc was observed, whereas strong binding was seen to VE-cadherin&#x02013;Fc and this binding was reduced to background levels by siRNA for VE-PTP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>).</p><p>Because we know that VE-cadherin represents a barrier for extravasating neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), we tested whether the inhibition of VE-PTP expression would enhance the migration of neutrophils across a monolayer of endothelial cells. At 24 h before the transmigration assay, endothelial cells were transfected with VE-PTP or control siRNAs. Inhibition of VE-PTP in mouse endothelioma cells increased transendothelial migration of mouse neutrophils by 44 &#x000b1; 9% when compared with control transfected cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Similar results were obtained for HUVECs. hPTP-&#x003b2; (the human homologue of VE-PTP) siRNA increased transmigration of human neutrophils by 60 &#x000b1; 8% compared with negative control siRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>). This was quite a substantial increase, because an adhesion-blocking mAb against human VE-cadherin, known to disrupt endothelial cell junctions, increased transmigration of neutrophils by 105 &#x000b1; 19% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Docking of neutrophils and lymphocytes to the surface of endothelial cells triggers the dissociation of VE-PTP from VE-cadherin</title><p>The results described above led us to conclude that VE-PTP supports the function of endothelial cells as a barrier for neutrophils, most likely by interacting with VE-cadherin and thereby enhancing its adhesive function. This raised the idea that neutrophils might interfere with the association of VE-PTP with VE-cadherin to open endothelial cell contacts. We looked into this by testing whether the coprecipitation of VE-cadherin with anti&#x02013;VE-PTP antibodies would be affected by the binding of neutrophils to the surface of cultured mouse endothelioma cells. Neutrophils were allowed to bind to the monolayer of TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;activated endothelial cells for 5 min. Then the neutrophils were carefully and completely removed by washing the cells with PBS before lysing endothelial cells for immunoprecipitations, because we showed previously that VE-cadherin is easily degraded during experimentation by neutrophil proteases if neutrophils are not removed before analyzing the endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Endothelial cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitations for VE-PTP, and the amount of VE-cadherin coprecipitated with VE-PTP was analyzed in immunoblots. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, the amount of coprecipiated VE-cadherin was reduced by 80% upon docking of neutrophils to the endothelium, whereas the amount of precipitated VE-PTP and the expression levels of VE-cadherin in the cell lysates were unaffected. Of note, aliquots of cell lysates for subsequent VE-cadherin immunoblots were set aside and handled in the same way as the aliquots that were subjected to immunoprecipitations. Similar experiments were performed with ovalbumin-specific antigen-stimulated T cells, resulting in a 75% reduction of coprecipitated VE-cadherin upon 5 min of binding of T cells to the endothelium (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Thus, neutrophils as well as lymphocytes reduce the association of VE-cadherin with VE-PTP within minutes.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Leukocytes binding to endothelial cells rapidly dissociate VE-cadherin from VE-PTP in a TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;dependent manner.</bold> Mouse neutrophils (A) or antigen-stimulated ovalbumin-specific mouse T cells (B) were added to 6-h TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;treated or untreated, highly confluent bEnd.5 cells, and no leukocytes were added to negative control cells. After 5 min, leukocytes were removed by washing with PBS, and VE-PTP was immunoprecipitated from endothelial cells and analyzed by immunoblotting for coprecipitated VE-cadherin or VE-PTP (as indicated on the right).

To this end, either resting or 6-h TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;activated endothelial cells were incubated with mouse neutrophils for 5 min, and VE-cadherin coprecipitation was probed as described above.

Similar results were observed with lymphocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). TNF-&#x003b1; was carefully removed from endothelial cells by washing the cells before adding the leukocytes.

We found that neutrophils or lymphocytes still triggered dissociation of the complex despite the lack of these adhesion molecules (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Similarly, leukocyte-triggered dissociation of VE-PTP from VE-cadherin was also observed with endothelial cells deficient for only ICAM-1 or only ICAM-2 (not depicted). In addition, antibodies against CD99 that block neutrophil and lymphocyte extravasation in vivo and transendothelial migration of leukocytes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) were unable to inhibit the leukocyte-induced dissociation of the VE-PTP&#x02013;VE-cadherin complex (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Thus, either different endothelial cell&#x02013;surface receptors are involved in this process, or soluble mediators released by leukocytes may trigger the complex dissociation. Oxygen radicals potentially released by neutrophils could be excluded as relevant in this assay because incubating neutrophils with endothelial cells in the presence of superoxide dismutase and catalase did not inhibit leukocyte-triggered dissociation of VE-cadherin and VE-PTP (not depicted). Furthermore, &#x0201c;conditioned&#x0201d; medium taken from endothelial cells that had been incubated with neutrophils, when transferred to new endothelial cell layers, did not have any dissociation activity, arguing against a soluble factor that would trigger the effect (not depicted).

VEGFR-2 was required for tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). The three different mutant proteins comprised a form of VE-cadherin in which all eight tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic tail were replaced by phenylalanines (VE-YallF) and two truncated forms of VE-cadherin lacking either the last 83 (VE-&#x00394;83) or the last 42 (VE-&#x00394;42) amino acids of the intracellular domain, thus deleting the &#x003b2;-catenin/plakoglobin binding site. As read out for VE-cadherin function, we analyzed cell aggregation of the transfected CHO cells. We have shown previously that induction of VE-PTP in such triple-transfected CHO cells leads to a decrease of cell monolayer permeability if WT VE-cadherin is coexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). In agreement with this, we found now that induction of VE-PTP clearly increased cell aggregation of cells that expressed the WT form of VE-cadherin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Interestingly, a similar effect was seen in cells that expressed the VE-YallF mutant (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>), demonstrating that the tyrosine residues in VE-cadherin are not essential for the effect of VE-PTP on VE-cadherin.

We show that VE-PTP is an important component of the VE-cadherin&#x02013;catenin complex, which is required for the maintenance of the endothelial barrier function. Leukocytes rapidly dissociate VE-PTP from this complex, suggesting that this receptor-type phosphatase represents a switch that leukocytes can use to open endothelial cell contacts. In addition, VE-PTP may be more generally relevant for the regulation of endothelial cell contacts because the vascular permeability&#x02013;inducing growth factor VEGF is also able to dissociate the phosphatase from VE-cadherin. Importantly, plakoglobin is an essential component of the cadherin complex, which is necessary for VE-PTP to support cell adhesion, whereas neither the tyrosine residues of the intracellular domain of VE-cadherin nor &#x003b2;-catenin are required for this effect of VE-PTP.</p><p>Regulation of cadherin adhesive function has been attributed to tyrosine phosphorylation of adherens junction proteins in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). Of these proteins, &#x003b2;-catenin and p120 are among the best characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). Several papers describe the dissociation of &#x003b2;-catenin from the respective cadherin as a central step in regulating adhesion. For the vascular system, numerous lines of evidence have demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of adherens junction proteins, especially &#x003b2;-catenin, correlate with the dissociation of endothelial cell contacts. Tyrosine phosphatases that were found to affect the stability of endothelial junctions are the &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;associated SHP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>), and the receptor-type RPTP-&#x003bc; that directly associates with the cytoplasmic tail of VE-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). However, none of them has yet been studied in the context of leukocyte transmigration.</p><p>With VE-PTP, we have found the first tyrosine phosphatase that is relevant for the control of endothelial cell contacts during leukocyte transmigration. In addition, we demonstrate that it is plakoglobin that is required for VE-PTP to stimulate VE-cadherin function in endothelial cells, whereas &#x003b2;-catenin is dispensable (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). This selectivity for only one of the two catenins that connect VE-cadherin with &#x003b1;-catenin clearly suggests that VE-PTP either affects plakoglobin directly as a substrate or affects factors that indirectly influence plakoglobin. Our results indeed suggest that plakoglobin is a substrate of VE-PTP, because a substrate-trapping mutant of VE-PTP binds to plakoglobin in cadherin-free L929 cell lysates and silencing of VE-PTP in endothelial cells predominantly affects the tyrosine phosphorylation of plakoglobin.</p><p>The selective plakoglobin dependence of the VE-PTP influence on VE-cadherin function is remarkable for two reasons. First, in contrast to the numerous reports on the relevance of &#x003b2;-catenin for the regulation of cadherin adhesiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>), our results establish a mechanism that regulates VE-cadherin function selectively via plakoglobin. Very few papers have yet analyzed the impact of the phosphorylation of plakoglobin on the association with a cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). Second, several years ago it was reported that plakoglobin is absent from recently confluent endothelial cell contacts. The synthesis of plakoglobin is up-regulated and becomes assembled with VE-cadherin in junctional complexes only when the cells have reached high confluence after several days of culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). It is intriguing, that similar to plakoglobin, VE-PTP is also located at endothelial cell contacts only days after cells have reached confluence. At the same time, VE-PTP is lost from an intracellular location that is at least in part overlapping with the endocytic compartment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Thus, maturation of endothelial junctions is accompanied by the redistribution of VE-PTP from an endosome-like compartment to cell contacts and by increased association of plakoglobin and VE-PTP with VE-cadherin. We suggest that VE-PTP and plakoglobin are both required for the stabilization of endothelial cell contacts, and VE-PTP exerts this function through plakoglobin.</p><p>Despite the selective dependence on plakoglobin, we do not yet precisely know how VE-PTP supports cell contact integrity. It is interesting that the induction of VE-PTP in CHO cells cotransfected with VE-cadherin and VEGFR-2 selectively enhanced the association between plakoglobin and VE-cadherin, whereas no effect was seen for &#x003b2;-catenin. This could suggest that VE-PTP might stabilize the association of plakoglobin with VE-cadherin. However, we were not able to detect in endothelial cells that the dissociation of VE-PTP from VE-cadherin, triggered by leukocytes, would lead to the dissociation of plakoglobin from VE-cadherin (indirectly implicated in the results of <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). Although this discrepancy cannot yet be fully explained, we have to consider that much less VE-PTP than VE-cadherin is expressed in endothelial cells and that it is well possible that a considerable fraction of plakoglobin molecules is associated with VE-cadherin independently of VE-PTP. If this were the case, a large fraction of plakoglobin molecules would perhaps not be immediately affected by the dissociation of VE-PTP, and the small fraction of potentially dissociating plakoglobin molecules might be too small to be detectable in our assays. Nevertheless, regardless of whatever mechanism might be established in the future, plakoglobin is a key to understand how VE-PTP affects VE-cadherin.</p><p>Very recently, it was reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin itself is involved in the transmigration of leukocytes. Lymphocyte and monocyte binding to endothelial cells, as well as cross-linking of ICAM-1, stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin. In addition, point-mutated VE-cadherin with certain tyrosine residues replaced by phenylalanine reduced leukocyte transmigration through endothelial cell layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). In this context, it is remarkable that induction of VE-PTP in CHO cells still enhanced VE-cadherin function despite the absence of all tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of VE-cadherin. This demonstrates that yet other substrates besides VE-cadherin exist that mediate the enhancing effect of VE-PTP on VE-cadherin function. However this does not exclude that in endothelial cells in a situation where leukocytes are bound, VE-PTP may contribute to the dephosphorylation of those VE-cadherin tyrosine residues that are relevant for the regulation of VE-cadherin function. Indeed, tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin is reduced by VE-PTP in COS-7 and CHO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). In addition, we found that inhibiting the expression of VE-PTP in plakoglobin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> endothelial cells had a much reduced but still significant inhibitory effect on VE-cadherin function, suggesting that besides plakoglobin there are yet other adherens junction proteins that could serve as adhesion-affecting substrates, including VE-cadherin itself.</p><p>We were surprised that none of the endothelial adhesion receptors that interact with neutrophils and lymphocytes (ICAM-1, ICAM-2, E- and P-selectin, PECAM-1, and CD99) were essential for leukocyte-induced dissociation of the VE-PTP&#x02013;VE-cadherin complex. VCAM-1 was not analyzed because it is not of importance for neutrophils. Even the combined deletion of ICAM-1 and -2 or of P- and E-selectin did not abrogate the effect. Soluble factors including oxygen radicals are unlikely to be involved, because scavenging of oxygen radicals did not inhibit the effect. Several potential soluble factors that can be released by neutrophils could be excluded, because lymphocytes had the same activity. Furthermore, the dissociation activity could not be transferred to fresh endothelial cells with medium taken from endothelial cells that had been preincubated with neutrophils. Thus, elucidating the receptor mechanism that transmits the leukocyte-triggered effect on dissociating the VE-PTP&#x02013;VE-cadherin complex will require more experimental work in the future. Interestingly, we found with the VEGF-receptor a leukocyte-independent mechanism that also triggers the dissociation of VE-PTP from VE-cadherin. Thus, different stimuli that affect endothelial cell contact stability seem to converge on the stability of the same complex. The attractive possibility, however, that VEGF itself might be mediating the leukocyte effect as secreted mediator could be excluded, because blocking anti-VEGF antibodies did not inhibit the complex-dissociating activity of leukocytes (unpublished data).</p><p>ICAM-1 cross-linking on resting endothelial cells only increases tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin, but not of the catenins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). We could confirm this for the binding of lymphocytes to resting endothelium (unpublished data). In contrast, binding of lymphocytes to TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;activated endothelial cells clearly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin, &#x003b2;-catenin, and plakoglobin. Thus, leukocyte-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of catenins and dissociation of VE-PTP from VE-cadherin both require preactivation of the endothelium with TNF-&#x003b1;. This further supports the concept that the dissociation of VE-PTP from the VE-cadherin complex indeed participates in leukocyte-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of catenins. In addition, the fact that leukocytes cannot dissociate VE-PTP from VE-cadherin in resting cells suggests that VE-PTP may provide a mechanism that maintains endothelial cell contact integrity in nonactivated endothelial cells that are not actively supporting transmigation. Only in the presence of inflammatory stimuli are leukocytes able to operate this &#x0201c;switch&#x0201d; and destabilize endothelial contacts via dissociation of VE-PTP from VE-cadherin. Whether this switch would be operational without the requirement of TNF activation in high endothelial cells specialized for efficient lymphocyte entry into lymph nodes will be an interesting question to study.</p><p>In conclusion, our results establish VE-PTP as a new membrane protein at endothelial junctions that is involved in the regulation of endothelial cell contacts during leukocyte transmigration. Because VE-PTP is the first known endothelial-specific tyrosine phosphatase and because it is a receptor-type protein with a large extracellular domain accessible from within the vasculature, VE-PTP represents a very interesting novel pharmacological target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Reagents and antibodies.</title><p>Transferrin&#x02013;Texas red (Rockland), soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich), DNase (Roche), laminin (Sigma-Aldrich), recombinant human TNF-&#x003b1; (PeproTech), gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich), fluorescent mounting medium (Dako), 250 kD FITC-dextran (Sigma-Aldrich), VEGF165 (PeproTech), and proteasome inhibitor MG 132 (EMD) were all used.</p><p>The following antibodies were used: mAb 109.1 against VE-PTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>); pAb VE&#x02013;PTP-C against VE-PTP (cross-reactive to the human homologue hPTP-&#x003b2;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>); mAb 11D4.1 against mouse VE-cadherin and pAb C5 against mouse VE-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>); pAb against mouse CD99 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) and mAb 1G8 against ESAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>); pAb against human ESAM; mAb against PECAM-1 1G5.1 and 5D2.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>); pAb against JAM-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>), mAb cadherin-5 against human VE-cadherin, mAb against &#x003b2;-catenin, mAb against plakoglobin, and mAb against &#x003b1;-catenin (BD Biosciences); pAb C-19 against human VE-cadherin and pAb Z-5 against GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); pAb against Rab11 (Invitrogen); mAb 4G10 against phosphotyrosine (Millipore); and mAb against &#x003b1;-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich).
