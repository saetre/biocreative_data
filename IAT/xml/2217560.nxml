Immunoblot analysis was used to measure the expression of &#x003b4;EF1 at the protein level in &#x003b4;EF1-overexpressing and &#x003b4;EF1-interfered MDA-MB-231 cells. Luciferase assay was used to determine the rhBMP-6 or &#x003b4;EF1 driven transcriptional activity of the E-cadherin promoter in MDA-MB-231 cells. Quantitative CHIP assay was used to detect the direct association of &#x003b4;EF1 with the E-cadherin proximal promoter in MDA-MB-231 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>MCF-7 breast cancer cells, an ER<sup>+ </sup>cell line that expressed high levels of BMP-6 and E-cadherin exhibited very low levels of &#x003b4;EF1 transcript. In contrast, MDA-MB-231 cells, an ER<sup>- </sup>cell line had significantly reduced BMP-6 and E-cadherin mRNA levels, suggesting an inverse correlation between BMP-6/E-cadherin and &#x003b4;EF1. To determine if the same relationship exists in human tumors, we examined tissue samples of breast cancer from human subjects. In 16 breast cancer specimens, the inverse correlation between BMP-6/E-cadherin and &#x003b4;EF1 was observed in both ER<sup>+ </sup>cases (4 of 8 cases) and ER<sup>- </sup>cases (7 of 8 cases). Further, we found that BMP-6 inhibited &#x003b4;EF1 transcription, resulting in an up-regulation of E-cadherin mRNA expression. This is consistent with our analysis of the E-cadherin promoter demonstrating that BMP-6 was a potent transcriptional activator. Interestingly, ectopic expression of &#x003b4;EF1 was able to block BMP-6-induced transactivation of E-cadherin, whereas RNA interference-mediated down-regulation of endogenous &#x003b4;EF1 in breast cancer cells abolished E-cadherin transactivation by BMP-6. In addition to down-regulating the expression of &#x003b4;EF1, BMP-6 also physically dislodged &#x003b4;EF1 from E-cadherin promoter to allow the activation of E-cadherin transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that repression of &#x003b4;EF1 plays a key role in mediating BMP-6-induced transcriptional activation of E-cadherin in breast cancer cells. Consistent with the fact that higher level of &#x003b4;EF1 expression is associated with more invasive phenotype of breast cancer cells, our collective data suggests that &#x003b4;EF1 is likely the switch through which BMP-6 restores E-cadherin-mediated cell-to-cell adhesion and prevents breast cancer metastasis.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Breast cancer is the most common neoplasm in women. The unique histological features of breast cancer are prominent proliferation of epithelial cells and the formation of ectopic mesenchymal tissue, including cartilage and bone, especially in complex adenomas and benign mixed tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The association between loss or down-regulation of E-cadherin, an epithelial cell-cell adhesion protein, and progression of breast cancer has been extensively documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Tumor cells acquire invasive properties when E-cadherin-mediated adhesion is inhibited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In line with these findings, ectopic expression of E-cadherin in a transgenic mouse model prevented tumor cell invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Several epigenetic mechanisms are implicated in E-cadherin loss during breast cancer, including hypermethylation of the E-cadherin promoter region at CpG islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and transrepression by specific transcriptional factors. Several zinc finger transcription factors, such as Twist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], Snail1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], Snail2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], SIP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and E12/E47 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], have been found to bind to the E-box elements in the proximal E-cadherin promoter and repress its transcription. Moreover, a few factors, including ErbB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], TGF-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and estrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], were reported to regulate E-cadherin expression.</p><p>Bone morphogenetic protein-6 (BMP-6), a member of TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily, has been characterized as a multifunctional molecule with a distinct ability to induce ectopic cartilage and bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic>, BMP-6 inhibits cell division, promotes cell differentiation, induces ectopic bone formation, and regulates epithelial-mesenchymal interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, a number of recent studies have shown that BMP-6 expression is associated with progression of tumorigenesis. BMP-6 is detected in several human neoplastic epithelial cells including breast, prostate, salivary, rectal, and thyroid carcinomas, and is speculated to be closely associated with tumor metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>&#x003b4;EF1, a member of the zinc finger-homeodomain family of transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], was originally identified as a binding protein of the lens-specific &#x003b4;1-crystalline enhancer in chicken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Studies revealed that &#x003b4;EF1 is a widely expressed transcriptional repressor, working through its zinc finger clusters binding to consensus E-box-like sequences, 5'-CA(G/C)(G/C)TG-3' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Several recently reported properties mark &#x003b4;EF1 as a potential regulatory factor in various cellular processes during tumor progression. In lung and breast tumor cells, &#x003b4;EF1 has been implicated in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], a process associated with tumor metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Moreover, &#x003b4;EF1 can itself be regulated by hormones in target tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In one example, &#x003b4;EF1 is up-regulated by estrogen in the chick oviduct and is responsible for estrogen-mediated regulation of the ovalbumin gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In human T47D breast carcinoma cells, &#x003b4;EF1 is up-regulated by progesterone via both isoforms of the progesterone receptor (PR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>In this communication, we report that BMP-6 up-regulates the expression of E-cadherin at the mRNA level in breast cancer cells, determined by quantitative RT-PCR and luciferase assay. We demonstrate that this effect is a direct result of BMP-6-indcued down-regulation of &#x003b4;EF1. The inverse relationship between BMP-6/E-cadherin and &#x003b4;EF1 were validated in 16 breast cancer specimens using quantitative RT-PCR. This finding contributes significantly to our understanding of the potential role of BMP-6 and &#x003b4;EF1 in breast tumorigenesis and metastasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tumor Samples</title><p>Fresh breast cancer tissues of invasive ductal carcinoma (stage II) were obtained from the Tissue Banking Facility Jointly Supported by TMUCIH (Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital) &#x00026; NFCR (National Foundation for Cancer Research).

The following antibodies (10 &#x003bc;g) were used: anti-ZEB, a polyclonal antibody raised against N-terminal epitopes of &#x003b4;EF1, or unrelated anti-FLAG control antibody (F-3165, Sigma, MO, USA) with 100 &#x003bc;g of chromatin per CHIP. Purified immunoprecipitated DNA was used for quantitative PCR reactions. The primers used for this analysis were as follows: 5'-AGGCTAGAGGGTCACCGCGTC-3' (forward), and 5'-GCTTTGCAGTTCCGACGCCAC-3' (reverse). Copy numbers for the DNA fragments (-175 to +21) of E-cadherin promoter in each anti-ZEB sample with or without BMP-6 induction were determined and compared to copy numbers of the DNA fragment without IP (input DNA). Anti-FLAG antibody was used as a control for IP reactions. The percentage of the input was then calculated. The final value was the percentage input obtained with specific antibody minus the percentage input obtained with anti-FLAG control antibody.

The mutant E-cadherin promoter constructs were then co-transfected with &#x003b4;EF1 expression plasmid in the presence of rhBMP-6. A measurement of luciferase activity indicated that &#x003b4;EF1 expression inhibited BMP-6-induced reporter activity of the E-cadherin promoter harboring mutations in either E-box 1 or E-box 3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>, lane 6 verse 8, lane 10 verse 12), an effect similar to that of &#x003b4;EF1 on the wild-type E-cadherin promoter. However, mutations within both E-box elements abolished the repressive effect of &#x003b4;EF1 on the BMP-6-induced reporter gene activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>, lane 13 verse 15, lane 14 verse 16). These data suggested that ectopic expression of &#x003b4;EF1 can attenuate BMP-6-induced transactivation of the E-cadherin promoter through either the E-box 1 or E-box 3 binding sites in MDA-MB-231 cells. Mutation of both E-boxes is required to efficiently interfere with the repressive effect of &#x003b4;EF1 on BMP-6-regulated E-cadherin expression. Moreover, the double mutation of E-boxes not only abolishes the repressive effect of &#x003b4;EF1, it also blunts the induction effect by BMP-6 on E-cadherin promoter. Collectively, we can conclude that in MDA-MB-231 cells, the BMP-6 medicated activation of E-cadherin gene is closely associated with the ability of E-cadherin promoter to bind to its putative suppressors (such as &#x003b4;EF1) through its E-box 1 and E-box 3.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Scheme of the cloned promoter region of human E-cadherin</bold>.

To do so, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting &#x003b4;EF1 or a scrambled control siRNA were stably transfected into MDA-MB-231 cells, followed by treatments with 200 ng/ml rhBMP-6. The knockdown of &#x003b4;EF1 expression was confirmed by western blot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>), accompanied by a significant increase in the promoter activity of E-cadherin with or without BMP-6 treatment, compared to the cells transfected with the control siRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>). The data verified that depletion of &#x003b4;EF1 in MDA-MB-231 cells is sufficient to allow a native expression of the silenced E-cadherin gene. Furthermore, a knockdown of &#x003b4;EF1 abolished the E-cadherin promoter stimulation by rhBMP-6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>), suggesting that the stimulatory effect of BMP-6 on E-cadherin transcription occurs indirectly. Down-regulation of &#x003b4;EF1 is a pre-requisite for BMP-6 to induce the expression of E-cadherin. While the &#x003b4;EF1 suppression of the BMP-6-stimulated E-cadherin promoter activity was dose-dependent, double mutation of E-boxes causes a total abolishment of the &#x003b4;EF1 effect, given that the molecule was unable to exhibit a repression at any dose when both E-boxes were mutated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Repression of endogenous &#x003b4;EF1 abolishes BMP-6-induced transactivation of the E-cadherin promoter in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells</bold>.

Several studies have reported that breast cancer produces a variety of growth factors that can play a role in the progression and metastasis of breast cancer. In the current study, we have uncovered that one of these factors, BMP-6, contributes to the regulation of E-cadherin-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition of breast cancer <italic>in vitro</italic>. In addition, we have shown that the stimulatory effect of BMP-6 on E-cadherin transcription occurs through reducing the expression and activity of &#x003b4;EF1, which we have found to be a strong transcriptional repressor of the E-cadherin gene. Importantly, the reverse relationship between BMP-6/E-cadherin and &#x003b4;EF1 expressions in cancer cell lines has been verified in clinical tumor specimens. Our results provide the first evidence, at the cellular level, to support the hypothesis that breast cancers may progress and metastasize through the regulation of E-cadherin expression by BMP-6 and &#x003b4;EF1.</p><p>Expression of BMPs has been reported to increase with breast cancer progression. Several studies on the overexpression of BMPs, such as BMP-2, BMP-4, and BMP-7 in mammary tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] are suggestive of a role of BMPs in breast cancer development. Clement <italic>et al</italic>. were the first to report that BMP-6 is detectable, not only in breast cancer cell lines, such as MCF-7, SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-453, BT-20, and ZR-75-1, but also in most tumor specimens, using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Importantly, BMP-6 expression was significantly increased and was most intense in the vicinity of chondroid matrix of complex adenomas and mixed benign tumors of canine mammary glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In agreement with these reports, we present here our finding that significantly higher levels of BMP-6 were observed in breast cancer cell lines and clinical tumor specimens, using quantitative RT-PCR. Moreover, BMP-6 expression is higher in the ER<sup>+ </sup>breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, compared to the ER<sup>- </sup>breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231. Although BMP-6 expression levels varied widely among tumor specimens, it was relatively higher in ER<sup>+ </sup>cases than in ER<sup>- </sup>cases. This coincides with our previous finding that BMP-6 promoter methylation status is correlated with ER status in breast cancer. In that study, we observed significantly lower levels of BMP-6 mRNA in ER<sup>- </sup>breast cancer cells compared with ER<sup>+ </sup>breast cancer cells, an effect attributed to hypermethylation status in the ER<sup>- </sup>breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In addition to breast cancer, BMP-6 has been found in a variety of other cancer cell types, including prostate, kidney, esophagus, and osteosarcoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], suggesting its association with the progression of tumorigenesis.</p><p>E-cadherin is ubiquitously expressed by epithelial cells, from which most cancers are derived. E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion prevents cells in a primary tumor from breaking away and invading near or distant sites. It has been well documented that loss of E-cadherin in mammary epithelial cells can promote breast cancer progression and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Recently, several factors, including ErbB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], TGF-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and estrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], were reported to regulate E-cadherin expression through different mechanisms. In this study, we have determined that BMP-6 is a novel stimulus of E-cadherin expression in breast cancer cells, providing evidence for a potential role of BMP-6 in tumor progression and metastasis. In addition, our results indicate that BMP-6-induced expression of E-cadherin is correlated with ER status. Higher levels of BMP-6 and E-cadherin transcripts were observed in ER<sup>+ </sup>breast cancer cells, while lower amounts were detected in ER<sup>- </sup>cells. These observations are in line with a previous finding that loss of E-cadherin expression was associated with the lack of ER expression and a more aggressive phenotype of breast cancer with poor clinical prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Thus, our observations lead us to propose that BMP-6 may cooperate with other factors, such as estrogen, to participate in attenuating breast caner progression.</p><p>Several epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in E-cadherin regulation in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], among these, a few zinc-finger transcription factors are known to bind to E-box elements of the E-cadherin promoter and repress transcription, including Snail1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], Snail2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and SIP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. &#x003b4;EF1, a close homolog of SIP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], was previously shown to directly bind to E-box elements of the E-cadherin promoter and inhibit the expression of endogenous E-cadherin mRNA and protein in mammary epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. These previous observations are consistent with our results demonstrating that overexpression of &#x003b4;EF1 is sufficient to block transactivation of E-cadherin in MDA-MB-231 cells. In line with our findings, a recent paper has also supported a role of &#x003b4;EF1 in E-cadherin repression in lung cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In spite of these findings, the upstream factors responsible for regulating the &#x003b4;EF1/E-cadherin loop in breast cancer have not yet been identified. Our current work has provided two novel findings in this context, (1) &#x003b4;EF1 can repress BMP-6-mediated up-regulation of E-cadherin and (2) the integrity of a single &#x003b4;EF1-binding element in the proximal E-cadherin promoter is sufficient for the repression effect of &#x003b4;EF1, providing evidence that BMP-6 may affect E-cadherin-mediated progression and metastasis through the regulation of specific genes, such as &#x003b4;EF1, during breast tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the fact that artificial removal of &#x003b4;EF1 by RNAi enhances gene expression of E-cadherin supports the important role of &#x003b4;EF1 to be down-regulated by BMP-6 in the native state in order for BMP-6 to induce E-cadherin expression. RNAi does it by mediating mRNA degradation, whereas BMP-6 does it by (1) inhibiting the expression of &#x003b4;EF1, and (2) by dislodging &#x003b4;EF1 that has already bound to the E-cadherin gene. Our overall data demonstrates that &#x003b4;EF1 is a native repressor of E-cadherin gene. Factors that remove/decrease &#x003b4;EF1 level would subsequently increase the expression of E-cadherin.</p><p>Previous research from our group indicated that &#x003b4;EF1 represses BMP-2-induced differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into the osteoblast lineage, an effect that is not mediated via the canonical BMP/Smad signaling pathway, but instead by differential regulation of the AP-1 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. In the study reported here, we found that overexpression of R-Smads (Smad 1 and 5) failed to augment BMP-6-induced transactivation of E-cadherin, which is mediated by suppression of &#x003b4;EF1 (data not shown). However, further studies will be required for a better understanding of the signal transduction mechanisms regulated by BMP-6 and &#x003b4;EF1 in breast cancer cells.</p><p>Breast cancer metastasis is a complicated process, during which the important functions of estrogen and the estrogen receptor have been consistently recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. In this study, we observed that, in breast cancer cell lines and clinical tumor specimens, &#x003b4;EF1 was expressed at a higher level in ER<sup>- </sup>cells compared to ER<sup>+ </sup>cells, indicating that &#x003b4;EF1 might contribute to the malignant conversion of breast cancer cells towards invasive and metastatic phenotypes. On the other hand, the contribution of BMP-6 to tumor metastasis has been recently studied in prostate cancer, suggesting that BMP-6 plays an important role in regulating tumor cell invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We recently showed that BMP-6 in ER<sup>+ </sup>breast cancer cells could be activated by estrogen through promoter demethylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Considering our finding that BMP-6-induced E-cadherin transactivation occurs indirectly, through the reduction of &#x003b4;EF1 expression, we speculate that overexpression of BMP-6 by breast cancer cells may represent a novel mechanism that regulates specific target genes such as E-cadherin and &#x003b4;EF1, in modulating metastasis and invasion of breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data suggest that the stimulatory effect of BMP-6 on E-cadherin transcription in breast cancer cells occurs indirectly, through the reduced expression and activity of &#x003b4;EF1. Repressors of BMP-6 and E-cadherin, such as &#x003b4;EF1, may regulate breast tumor progression and metastasis at different stages, including the initial de-differentiation of primary tumor cells and the maintenance of migratory and/or undifferentiated phenotypes. Further studies should be focused on better understanding of the signal transduction mechanisms and the relationship between BMP-6 and &#x003b4;EF1 in breast cancer formation, progression, and metastasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SY conceived the study, carried out the cell culture, luciferase assay, and Q-CHIP assay experiments, and drafted the manuscript.
