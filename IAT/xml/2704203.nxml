The longitudinal axonal tracks of each neuronal population self-fasciculate to form dI1- and dI2-specific bundles. The dI1 bundles are spatially located ventral relative to dI2 bundles. To examine the functional contribution of Lim-HD proteins to establishment of dI axonal projections, the Lim-HD code of dI neurons was altered by cell-specific ectopic expression. Expression of Lhx1 in dI1 neurons caused a repression of Lhx2/9 and imposed caudal projection to the caudal commissural dI1 neurons.

Neurons differ from each other by their type of afferent input, cell body positioning along the body axis, axonal trajectory and axonal target. The projection of axons to their targets occurs in a stepwise manner, under the control of guidance cues arrayed at discrete locations along the pathway of axonal growth. A specific axonal pathway of a neuron, governed by a transcriptional code, is manifested by the expression of receptors for guidance molecules that interpret the guidance cues <italic>en route </italic>and at their putative target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In vertebrates, the coordinated development of neurons and their targets has been well documented in the context of the peripheral projections of spinal motor neurons. Motor neurons innervate many different muscle targets, and the location of motor neurons within the spinal cord is linked to target position. Lim-HD proteins control aspects of neuronal differentiation, such as subtype identity and axonal guidance (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]). The broad repertoire of specification by Lim-HD factors is exemplified in the development of motor neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. While the early expression of Isl1 is required for the differentiation of all the motor neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], later in development, Isl1 confers LMCm subtype identity to motor neurons and directs LMCm axons to the ventral limb. In a contrasting and complementary manner, Lhx1 confers LMCl subtype identity and directs LMCl axons to the dorsal limb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The uncertainty about the role of Lim-HD proteins in the control of motor axon pathfinding stems from the fact that many genes of this class control earlier developmental decisions &#x02013; the regulation of neural pattern, cell specification, and cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A replacement of the Lim-HD code of LMC neurons, via ectopic expression of Isl1 or Lhx1, causes a binary switch in cell fate, where ectopic Isl1-expressing motor neurons adopt LMCm subtype identity, and ectopic Lhx1-expressing motor neurons become LMCl neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Similarly, the LIM homeobox genes <italic>Lhx3 </italic>(<italic>Lim3</italic>) and <italic>Lhx4 </italic>(<italic>Gsh4</italic>) are transiently expressed by spinal motor neurons but appear to specify neuronal subtype identity and migratory behaviour, indirectly influencing the position at which motor axons emerge from the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, studies in <italic>Drosophila </italic>have shown that Lim-HD proteins direct motor axon projections without influencing neuronal fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], suggesting that some of their vertebrate counterparts may have similar roles.</p><p>Spinal sensory neurons are derived from several populations of dorsal interneurons (dI1-6) in the embryonic dorsal spinal cord that are distinguished by a transcriptional code and differentiated cell body positions. dI1-3 neurons differentiate from distinct groups of ventricular zone progenitor cells that express the basic helix loop helix (bHLH) transcription factors Atoh1, Ngn1/2 or Mash1, respectively. As the dI1-3 neurons differentiate, Lim-HD transcription factors are expressed: Lhx2 and Lhx9 in dI1, Lhx1 and Lhx5 in dI2, and Isl1 in dI3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Gene targeting and transgenesis in mice have revealed that dI1 neurons project their axons ipsi- and contra-laterally toward the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and dI2 neurons project their axons contra-laterally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, the precise <italic>en route </italic>axonal pathway, as well the topographic organization of dI axons within the neural tube, is not known.</p><p>In this study we used genetic assays in chick embryos to address the basis of the selection of interneuron axonal trajectory within the developing neural tube. Initially, taking advantage of novel enhancer elements, we mapped the axonal trajectories of dI1 and dI2 neurons. Each dI has a unique pattern of axonal projections. dI1 neurons project their axons rostrally along two pathways: either ipsi- or contra-laterally. dI2 are mostly commissural neurons. After crossing the floor plate the rostral dI2 axons turn rostrally, while the caudal dI2 axons turn caudally. To begin to understand the possible role of Lim-HD in patterning the axonal trajectories of spinal interneurons, the Lim-HD code of dI1 and dI2 neurons was altered by cell type-specific ectopic expression. We found that Lhx1, ectopically expressed in dI1 neurons, confers caudal projection to the otherwise rostrally projecting commissural dI1 axons; while Lhx9, expressed in dI2 neurons, causes a rostral bias to the caudally projecting dI2 axons. Thus, Lim-HD proteins control the longitudinal axonal choice of dI1 and dI2 neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Enhancer elements</title><p>Employment of enhancer elements to drive expression of reporter genes in neurons is a widely used paradigm for tracking axonal projection. For tracking axonal projection of spinal interneurons in vertebrates, germ line-targeted reporter genes yield bilaterally symmetric labelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, it is hard to distinguish between the ipsi- and contra-laterally projecting axons. Unilateral electroporation into the chick neural tube provides a useful means to restrict expression of a reporter gene to one side of the central nervous system, and to follow axonal projection on both sides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Mouse enhancer elements are appropriately active in the chick neural tube. Thus, Atoh1, HB9, and HoxA1 enhancer elements drive expression in dI1, motor neurons and floor plate cells, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Large-scale transgenic mouse screens of highly conserved non-coding sequences in the human genome have revealed several hundred enhancer elements that target &#x003b2;-galactosidase reporter gene expression to specific developmental structures and cell types in transgenic mice at embryonic day (E)11.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Two enhancer elements, seemingly expressed in dI neurons, were further analyzed employing <italic>in ovo </italic>electroporation: #284, located between the <italic>Pou3f2 </italic>gene and the <italic>C6orf167 </italic>open reading frame on human chromosome 6; and #169, located between <italic>Foxd3 </italic>and <italic>Atg4c </italic>genes on human chromosome 1. The mouse #284 and #169 elements were cloned upstream to Cre recombinase. To verify the specificity to dorsal interneurons, the Enhancers::Cre plasmids were electroporated into stage 16 to 17 chick hemi-tube along with a Cre-dependent mCherry/green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmid [pCAGG-LoxP-mCherry-LoxP-GFP], which enables the simultaneous detection of the electroporated cells (expressing mCherry) and the enhancer-expressing cells (expressing GFP) (for more details, see Materials and methods). GFP expression is restricted to dorsal neurons (#284; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) or the medial lateral neurons (#169, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), while mCherry is expressed along the entire ventral/dorsal aspect of the electroporated hemi-tube (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Characterization of the dI1 enhancer</bold>.

To determine the identity of reporter-expressing cells, embryos were analyzed at stage 23 to 24 by co-staining with dI-specific antibodies to Lhx2/9 (dI1), Lhx1/5 (dI2, dI4, dI6, V0, V1), Isl1 (dI3), Pax2 (dI4, dI6, V0, V1) and Engrailed1 (V1) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>). nGFP expression under the control of #284 is restricted to dI1 neurons, as indicated by co-staining with Lhx2/9 Ab (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, C</xref>) and the segregation from Lhx1- (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) and Isl1-positive neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Of the nGFP-positive neurons, 95.7% (n = 139) are Lhx2/9, and 4.3% (6 of 139) were nGFP-positive but negative to all the above interneuron markers. This minor population may represent progenitors of dI1 that have not upregulated the expression of Lhx2 and Lhx9 yet. The #284 enhancer is herein indicated as EdI1.</p><p>Of the neurons that express nGFP under the control of #169, 56% (n = 166) are dI2, as indicated by the co-localization to the dorsal Lhx1/5<sup>+ </sup>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) and Lhx1/5<sup>+</sup>/Pax2<sup>- </sup>cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>) and the segregation from Lhx2/9<sup>+ </sup>and Isl1<sup>+ </sup>neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, C</xref>); 35.5% are V1 neurons as indicated by the localization to the medial Pax<sup>+</sup>/En1<sup>+</sup>/Lhx1/5<sup>+ </sup>neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D, E</xref>). Of the nGFP neurons, 8.5% are presumed to be progenitors of dI2 and V1, since no expression of any cell fate marker was scored. Its proximity to the dI2/V1-specific gene <italic>Foxd3 </italic>suggests that #169 is a dI2/V1-specific enhancer of Foxd3 (herein indicated as EdI2/V1).</p><p>For further focusing on the axonal projection pattern of dI2 neurons, the dI2-specific enhancer element (13G) of the <italic>Ngn1 </italic>gene was studied in the chick neural tube [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], utilizing the Cre-dependent nGFP system. Expression of nGFP was detected in dorsal/lateral interneurons that express either Lhx2/9 or Lhx1/5 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Numerous dorsal interneurons located between the ventricular and marginal zones express nGFP. These neurons are presumed to be progenitors of dI1 and dI2 neurons. The expression of Ngn1 in progenitor neurons supports this assumption. The leakage in dI1 neurons while using the Ngn1-13G enhancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], versus the entire Ngn1 enhancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], suggests that <italic>cis </italic>elements that are required for repression of expression in dI1 neurons are absent in the 13G enhancer. Hence, in the chick, the Ngn1 13G enhancer is a dI1/2-specific enhancer (herein indicated as Ed1/2).</p></sec><sec><title>Axonal projection of dI1 axons</title><p>dI1 neurons give rise to two subpopulations that differ in their cell position, axonal projection and transcription of the Lim-HD proteins: the dI1<sub>comm </sub>population, located at the dorsal neural tube and more ventral/medially, which projects axons toward and across the floor plate; and the dI1<sub>ipsi </sub>population, located in a ventral/lateral position, which projects axons ipsi-laterally. The division into two subpopulations is also evident in the transcription of the Lim-HD proteins Lhx2 and Lhx9. dI1<sub>comm </sub>neurons express Lhx2<sub>high </sub>and Lhx9<sub>low</sub>, while dI1<sub>ipsi </sub>neurons express Lhx9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>The axonal projection pattern of dI1 neurons within the neural tube was studied at E6 utilizing an open-book preparation of electroporated neural tubes. dI1 neurons, labeled with GFP under the control of EdI1 enhancer, project their axons ipsi- and contra-laterally (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B</xref>). The neural tubes of ten embryos were analyzed and yielded similar axonal patterns (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The contra-laterally projecting axons cross the floor plate, turn rostrally and elongate along the floor plate at the ventral funiculus (VF) for a few segments. They are subsequently deflected diagonally and laterally away from the floor plate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, A2, A3</xref>). At the lateral funiculus (LF), dI1<sub>comm </sub>axons turn rostrally whilst converging to a longitudinal bundle. At the cervical level, a longitudinal fascicule is evidenced only in the LF. All the axons at the contra-lateral VF turn toward the LF. dI1<sub>ipsi </sub>axons turn rostrally at the LF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, A4, A5</xref>). At sacral levels, few caudally projecting axons are visible (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, A1, A3</xref>, magenta arrows). The number of caudally versus rostrally projecting axons at the sacral level on the contra-lateral side was scored. 12.5 &#x000b1; 4.4% (n = 6) of the axons turned caudally.

At the rostral two-thirds of the thoracic level and the brachial and cervical levels, dI2 axons grow toward and across the floor plate. At the contra-lateral side of the floor plate, axons turn rostrally (dI2<sub>rost</sub>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A, A3</xref>).

Caudal to the hindlimb, at the lumbar and sacral levels, dI2 axons turn caudally in a mirror-image pattern to the rostrally projecting axons (dI2<sub>caud</sub>). Specifically, they grow ventrally toward the floor plate and turn caudally at the contra-lateral side of it (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A, A1</xref>). Then, they turn laterally and form a dI2<sub>caud </sub>fascicle at the contra-LF.

In order to label neurons that co-express EdI2/V1 and EdI1/2 enhancers, we combined the Cre/LoxP and the Gal4/UAS systems. Cre was expressed under the EdI1/2 enhancer, and Gal4 under the EdI2/V1 enhancer. The reporter plasmid contains GFP under a dual control of Gal4 and Cre (UAS-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-GFP; for more details, see Materials and methods).

The axonal patterning of the commissural dI2 axons, labeled exclusively by the intersection technique, is similar to the pattern observed with EdI2/V1 and EdI1/2 enhancers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Namely, dI2<sub>rost </sub>axons turn rostrally from the rostral two-thirds of the thoracic level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, A4</xref>) and either rostrally or caudally at the caudal third of the thoracic level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, A2, A3</xref>), and dI2<sub>caud </sub>axons turn caudally from the hindlimb level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, A1</xref>). It is difficult to estimate the extent of caudal versus rostral turning at each level due to the axonal abundance of dI2 neurons at the contra-lateral side.

This hypothesis is supported by the reciprocal downregulation of Lhx9 via ectopic expression of Lhx2 (YH and AS, data not shown). Atoh1 is expressed in dI1 progenitor neurons, and its expression is down-regulated in differentiated post-mitotic dI1 neurons. Ectopic expression of Lhx9 causes down-regulation of Atoh1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E, F</xref>), suggesting that Lhx9, when up-regulated in post-mitotic dI1 neurons, is a repressor of Atoh1. <italic>Barhl1</italic>/<italic>2 </italic>genes are expressed in rodent dI1 neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].

Foxd3 is not repressed in Lhx9-expressing neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7G, H</xref>). Lhx9 is thus insufficient for repressing dI2 cell fate. Thus, Lhx9 and Lhx1 cross-repress each other without changing the complete range of cell fate identity. Lhx9 and Lhx1 may nevertheless control some features of differentiated dI neurons.

To study the role of the Lim-HD code in the assignment of the axonal projection pattern of dI1 and dI2 neurons, their Lim-HD code was alternated. The following considerations were taken into account in the subsequent ectopic expression experiments. First, to study cell autonomous effects, Lim-HD proteins were expressed specifically in the reciprocal dI neurons utilizing EdI enhancers (Lhx9 in dI2, and Lhx1 in dI1). Second, to follow the axonal trajectories of the manipulated neurons, taumyc or GFP were co-expressed with the ectopic Lim-HD protein from the same plasmid. Third, ectopic expression of Lim-HD may lead to a change in cell properties and, subsequently, to its own down-regulation. For example, Lhx9 expressed in dI2 utilizing the EdI2/V1 enhancer may up-regulate certain dI1 characteristics, ultimately leading to down-regulation of the EdI2/V1 enhancer. The stable Cre/Lox systems were used to stabilize the ectopic expression. Fourth, ectopic expression may result in high, non-physiological levels of exogenous protein levels. The levels of ectopic Lhx9 were compared to the endogenous levels of Lhx2 and Lhx9 (in the non-electroporated side of the neural tube).

To map the topographic organization of dI1 and dI2 longitudinal tracks, dI1 and dI2 neurons were labeled unilaterally, using the Cre/LoxP method for the commissural dI2 neurons, and the Gal4/UAS method for the dI1 neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10A</xref>).

Thus, Lhx9 may control the homophilic interaction with dI1 axons along their longitudinal projection toward the brain. Alternatively, Lim-HD code may control the position of the LF along the dorsal/ventral axis, where Lhx9 directs a more ventral position than Lhx1, and the mis-expression of Lhx9 in dI2 axons shifts the dorsoventral position at which dI2 axons turn into the longitudinal plane.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Cell fate acquisition is manifested by the activation of transcription factors. Many features define the function of a neuron, including cell body positioning, dendritic tree morphology, axonal projection, neurotransmitters specificity and excitatory or inhibitory output. The specification of neurons might be governed by linear sequential activation of transcription factors, or by activation of a parallel pathway, each one driving a specific neuronal characteristic. In the current study we have combined molecular and morphological tools to follow the development and axonal patterning of molecularly defined groups of dorsal spinal interneurons. We provide evidence that the Lim-HD proteins Lhx1 and Lhx9 are sufficient to influence axonal patterning without affecting neuronal fate.</p><sec><title>Diversity of dI axonal projections</title><p>The combination of specific enhancers, augmentation of expression levels utilizing the Cre/LoxP and the Gal4/UAS systems, and chick electroporation provide quick and efficient tools for deciphering axonal pathways of a genetically defined group of neurons. The emerging picture is of a complex divergence of axonal cues that arises from dI1 and dI2 subpopulations. dI1 and dI2 give rise to two subpopulations each, defined by the direction of their axonal projections. The simultaneous molecular and spatially restricted labelling of two neuronal populations, dI1 + dI2 and dI1<sub>ipsi</sub>+ dI1<sub>comm</sub>, underscores the axonal architecture of dI1 and dI2 axons: dI1<sub>ipsi </sub>and dI1<sub>comm </sub>fasciculate together at the LF; dI1 and dI2 axonal tracks at the LF are segregated.</p><p>The axonal pathways of spinal internerons were mapped previously utilizing diI injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Kadison and Kaprielian described four main axonal projections of decussating axons: intermediate longitudinal commissural (ILC), medial longitudinal commissural (MLC), bifurcating longitudinal commissural (BLC), and forked transverse commissural (FTC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. ILC axons travelled rostrally in an arcuate manner, extending into VF regions of the spinal cord before executing a second turn into the longitudinal plane at the LF. The contra-laterally projecting dI1 and dI2 neurons project their axons in an ILC pattern. MLC axons, which extend along the floor plate boundary at the VF for distances greater than 100 mm, BLC axons, which bifurcate to rostral and caudal projections, and FTC axons, which form a trident-shaped or forked projection, were not identified in the current study. The labelling of multiple neurons achieved using the electroporation paradigm in the current study may obscure these projection patterns. A moderate number (10%) of decussated axons was observed to extend in the caudal direction following DiI injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However, our studies point to a larger quantity of caudally projecting neurons. At the sacral level dI1<sub>ipsi </sub>and all dI2<sub>caud </sub>axons extend caudally. At the lumbar region and the caudal third of thoracic levels, about half of dI2 axons project caudally. Hence, a rostral to caudal stepwise increase in caudal projection is evident. Injection of DiI into neurons at the sacral level may reveal more caudally projecting axons.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptional control of axonal guidance</title><p>The divergence in axonal growth along the ipsi/contra and the caudal/rostral axes may stem from a cell type-specific expression of transcription factors. Namely, dI1<sub>comm </sub>and dI2<sub>comm </sub>genes could theoretically be expressed in the contra-laterally projecting dI1<sub>comm </sub>and dI2 neurons, respectively. A possible candidate for such a mechanism is Lhx2, which is expressed only in dI1<sub>comm </sub>neurons. However, gene-targeting experiments of Lhx2 and Lhx9 have shown that a Lim-HD code does not control ipsi- versus contra-lateral axonal projection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Similarly, Lhx1 is expressed in the ipsi-only population V1 and the contra-mostly population dI2. Therefore, Lhx1 is probably not implicated in controlling of the contra-lateral projection of dI2 neurons. Alternatively, common <italic>dIcomm </italic>and <italic>dIipsi </italic>genes might be expressed in all the dIN<sub>comm </sub>and dIN<sub>ipsi </sub>neurons, respectively. Transcription factors such as Unc4 and NSCL1, which are expressed in all interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] in an overlapping pattern to the commissural-only genes <italic>TAG1 </italic>and <italic>Robo3</italic>, are candidates for controlling commissural guidance choice of dIs.</p><p>A similar transcriptional mechanism may account for the caudal versus rostral axonal choice. A transcriptional code may discriminate between the longitudinal levels. Hence, the combination of <italic>dIcaudal</italic>, expressed at the caudal neural tube, and <italic>Lhx1 </italic>may confer caudal projection. Potential <italic>dIcaudal </italic>and <italic>dIrostral </italic>factors may be the Hox proteins. A Hox code determines the rostral/caudal identity of motor neurons, and the combination of Hox and Lim-HD codes determines the subclassification of motor neuron pools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The caudally expressing <italic>Hox10 </italic>and <italic>Hox11 </italic>genes may confer caudal turning to the lumbosacral dI2 neurons, while the more rostral Hox, <italic>Hox8 </italic>and beyond, may confer rostral turning. The caudal thoracic crisscross pattern might be controlled by <italic>Hox9+</italic>/<italic>Hox8</italic>- code. The rostral to caudal change in axonal projection, following Lhx1 ectopic expression, may place Lhx1 as a positive activator of the <italic>Hoxcaudal </italic>genes <italic>Hox10 </italic>and <italic>Hox11</italic>. Complementarily, Lhx9 may suppress caudal turning by suppressing <italic>Lhx1 </italic>and/or <italic>Hox10 </italic>and <italic>Hox11 </italic>expression. Alternatively, Lhx9 may suppress <italic>Hox10 </italic>and <italic>Hox11 </italic>expression, and Lhx1 may reveal Hox10 and Hox11 activity by suppressing their suppressor, Lhx9.</p><p>What are the axonal cues that may govern caudal turning? Axons may turn in different directions due to different axonal cues or differential responsiveness to common cues. The differential cues theory is not supported by our data. At the caudal thoracic levels dI2 axons, at the same rostro/caudal level, turn either rostrally or caudally. The conversion in axonal directionality may be governed cell autonomously by receptors or signalling molecules that convert attraction to repulsion. The rostral turning of commissural neurons along the floor plate is mediated by increasing caudal-to-rostral levels of Wnt proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], which attract axons; and decreasing caudal-to-rostral levels of Shh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], which repel axons. Caudally turning neurons may express receptors or signalling molecules that convert Wnt attraction to repulsion and/or Shh repulsion to attraction. <italic>In vitro </italic>assays with caudal dI2 neurons challenged with Wnts and Shh should clarify whether a cell autonomous change in responsiveness governs dorsal and caudal turning.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of Lim-HD in cell fate determination</title><p>The emergence of interneuron divisions is marked by a mutual exclusion in the expression profile of bHLH proteins and Lim-HD proteins. Progenitor dI1/2 neurons express Atoh1 and Ngn1/2, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Loss and gain of function experiments have demonstrated that these proteins cross repress each other, and are both required and sufficient for the differentiation of dI1/2 neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Therefore, in the absence of Atoh1, dI1 neurons fail to differentiate, and are converted to dI2 neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Lim-HD genes, expressed in the post-mitotic dI1/2 neurons, are probably activated by the bHLH proteins. Our ectopic expression experiments demonstrate that Lim-HD proteins also cross-repress each other in dI1 and dI2 neurons. Thus, the distinct identity of adjacent neurons is guaranteed at the mitotic and post-mitotic stages by cross-repression of bHLH and Lim-HD proteins, respectively. Loss of function experiments have demonstrated that in the absence of Lhx2/9 or Lhx1/5, the fate of dI1 and dI2 neurons is not altered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In the Lhx2/9 double knockout mouse, dI1 cells express dI1-specific genes, and the Lim-HD code is not changed to Lhx1/5. It is conceivable that Atoh1, which acts upstream to Lhx2/9, is repressing Ngn1/2 and thus indirectly prevents the activation of Lhx1/5. It is also possible that bHLH proteins control dI1/2 cell fate by activating Lim-HD proteins and, in addition, in a feed forward mechanism, directly control cell fate. Thus, the elimination of Lim-HD can be compensated for by bHLH proteins. Ectopic Lim-HD proteins may play a dominant role in repressing other Lim-HD proteins and in repressing bHLH protein activity. This assumption is supported by the observation that ectopically expressed Lhx1 suppresses the expression of Atoh1 (YH and OA, unpublished results). The Lim-HD proteins Isl1 and Lhx1 play a similar role in determining the fate of LMC neurons. Retinoic acid induces LMCl neurons by activating Lhx1 and repressing Isl1 expression. In the absence of Lhx1, LMCl neurons differentiate, settle at the lateral LMC column and do not upregulate Isl1 expression. Thus, like bHLH proteins in dI1/2 neurons, retinoic acid is sufficient to confer LMCl identity, probably by bypassing Lhx1 signalling in a feed-forward mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The emergence of interneuron divisions is marked by mutual exclusion in the expression profile of bHLH and Lim-HD proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].
