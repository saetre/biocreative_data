In principle, there are two possibilities to explain this observation: (1) reduced dendritic growth is secondary to the abnormal position of dendrites, or (2) attenuation of cdk5 activity itself impairs dendritic growth directly.

At this time, it remains unclear whether ectopic synapses formed on aberrant cdk5-deficient dendrites undergo similar steps as nascent synapses under normal conditions.</p><p>The data presented here provide evidence of a functional dissociation between dendritic targeting and subsequent synapse formation. The finding that hilar dendrites extending from <italic>DNcdk5</italic>-expressing granule cells form synapses suggests that dendritic filopodia/spines might be sufficient to induce axodendritic synapse formation within the adult brain. However, it is also possible that ectopic synapses mature in a similar way to newborn granule cells, with correctly targeted dendrites forming, at least transiently, multiple synapse boutons &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060272-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Interestingly, the number of spines was only reduced in aberrant dendrites, whereas spine density in dendrites extending from <italic>DNcdk5</italic>-expressing granule cells that targeted the ML were not reduced compared to controls. This finding suggests that cdk5 inhibition does not, per se, reduce the number of spines. However, cdk5 inhibition impaired maturation of dendritic spines into mushroom spines in aberrant as well as in correctly targeted dendrites, indicating an involvement of cdk5 in spine maturation. Notably, overexpression of cdk5 itself affected neither spine number nor shape of newborn granule cells.

There is no &#x0201c;hard measure&#x0201d; as to when migration of a newborn cell has &#x0201c;failed&#x0201d; (as there was also a small population of control cells that did not migrate into the GCL). This is clearly different from dendritic orientation, which is completely consistent in the group of newborn granule cells of the control groups: all of them extend a dendrite toward the ML. Therefore, the functional association between failed migration and aberrant dendrite extension remains unknown. Notably, cdk5 has a well-characterized function during neuronal migration. One interesting target protein of cdk5 in the context of adult neurogenesis is the microtubule-associated protein, doublecortin (DCX, &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060272-b057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060272-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;).

Alternatively, pathfinding of apical dendrites from newborn granule cells could be impaired by cdk5 inhibition. Indeed, previous reports have shown that cdk5 is involved in the semaphorin-3A&#x02013;dependent extension of apical dendrites of glutamatergic principal neurons during cortical development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060272-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060272-b061">61</xref>&#x0005d;. Future studies will have to determine the downstream targets and upstream signals leading to altered migration and aberrant dendrite formation of <italic>DNcdk5</italic>-expressing, newborn granule cells. This search is complicated by the fact that the effects of cdk5 inhibition on migration and dendritic development in the context of adult hippocampal neurogenesis can best be adequately tested in vivo, within the context of the dentate area niche, as we found no substantial effects of cdk5 inhibition on cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation when we used NPCs in vitro.</p><p>The fact that aberrant dendrites are capable of forming synapses also has potential implications for transplantation-based approaches to treat neurological disease: our results indicate that aberrant neurites receive sufficient synaptic input leading to integration and long-term survival, which appears to require an activity-dependent mechanism in the adult hippocampus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060272-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.

Expression constructs for <italic>cdk5</italic>, <italic>DNcdk5</italic>, and <italic>p35</italic> were subcloned into a retroviral vector driving the transgene under the chicken &#x003b2;-actin (CAG) promoter and containing an IRES-GFP (gift from I. Verma, Salk Institute, La Jolla, California). The shRNA against <italic>cdk5</italic> was cloned into pAmbion Silencer 2.0 for in vitro experiments. The target sequence was GCTGTACTCCACGTCCATC. For in vivo retroviral shRNA experiments, the shRNA was cloned into a vector containing an U6-promoter multiple cloning site and CAG promoter-driven GFP (gift from V. M.
