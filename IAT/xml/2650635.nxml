The system has following advantages: (1) preparation of ORF clones and their transfer into other vectors can be achieved efficiently and at lower cost; (2) the system provides a seamless connection to the versatile HaloTag<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> labeling system, in which a single fusion tag can be used for various proteomic analyses; and (3) the resultant ORF clones show higher expression levels both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. With this system, we prepared ORF clones encoding 1929 human genes and characterized the HaloTag-fusion proteins of its subset that are expressed <italic>in vitro</italic> or in mammalian cells. Results thus obtained have demonstrated that our Flexi<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> ORF clones are efficient for the production of HaloTag-fusion proteins that can provide a new versatile set for a variety of functional analyses of human genes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>cDNA</kwd><kwd>HaloTag</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>Flexi cloning</kwd><kwd>ORFeome</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The entire human genome sequence has allowed us to create a provisional catalog of human transcripts and proteins by a combination of computational predictions and information from experimentally collected cDNA sequences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C1">1</xref></sup> Although approximately 23&#x000a0;000 protein-coding genes have been assigned to the human genome by the Ensembl database (NCBI built 36, Ensembl 48; <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/index.html">http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/index.html</uri>),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C2">2</xref></sup> the functional roles of the respective gene products remains to be experimentally explored. Because of the importance of these studies, many groups have started to collect a set of protein-coding sequences, conventionally termed open reading frames (ORFs), in a genome-wide manner, so-called &#x02018;ORFeome cloning&#x02019;. ORF clones serve as versatile reagents for the functional and structural studies of proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C5">5</xref></sup> Therefore, various systems have been developed to enable efficient large-scale cloning and expression of ORF clones. Currently available systems rely on either site-specific recombinases or rare-cutting restriction enzymes for the transfer of ORFs between expression vectors. These systems allow the correct orientation and reading frame to be maintained after transfer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C8">8</xref></sup> The Gateway and Creator cloning systems, which are representative of the recombinase-based systems, transfer ORFs by &#x003bb;-att recombination using the 25-bp <italic>att</italic>B site, and Cre-<italic>loxP</italic> recombination using the 34-bp lox-P site upstream of the ORF, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C7">7</xref></sup> On the other hand, restriction-enzyme-based systems are less frequently used at present, although a commercial system has recently emerged that is as efficient as those based on recombinases. The Flexi<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> cloning system can manipulate ORFs using rare-cutting restriction enzymes, <italic>Sgf</italic>I and <italic>Pme</italic>I, after the addition of these 8-bp restriction sites to the flanking 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of the ORFs, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C8">8</xref></sup> We previously prepared a set of ORF clones for human KIAA genes using a Gateway-type vector.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C9">9</xref></sup> Furthermore, we created the ORF clones as fusion proteins with green-fluorescent protein to analyze the subcellular localization of the proteins in cultured cells and to evaluate the <italic>in vitro</italic> expression of ORF clones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C9">9</xref></sup> However, when we wish to carry out alternative functional studies beyond bioimaging, the Gateway system requires re-construction of appropriate expression plasmids for the creation of differently tagged proteins. This creates a serious bottleneck in the use of our large ORF clone set for functional genomics analysis. Thus, we started to look for a more versatile tag system that would allow us to carry out both bioimaging and biochemical experiments using a single tag. Within this context, we considered a recently emerging technology, commercially designated as HaloTag<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> technology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C10">10</xref></sup> This technology is quite attractive since HaloTag can be used not only for bioimaging, but also for various proteomic applications involving fusion protein immobilization. Although similar technologies have been developed, such as SNAP-tag which uses a modified human O<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C6">6</xref></sup>-alkylguanine DNA alkyl transferase as the tag,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C12">12</xref></sup> we preferred HaloTag<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> technology because we felt it may be more suitable for studies in mammals. Haloalkane dehalogenase, the enzyme from which HaloTag is derived, does not exist in mammalian cells, unlike O<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C6">6</xref></sup>-alkylguanine DNA alkyl transferase. Since HaloTag<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> technology was available in the Flexi<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> cloning system, we were strongly motivated to examine whether the Flexi<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> cloning method was suitable for preparation of a large number of ORF clones, and whether it would be useful for downstream functional characterization.</p><p>In this study, we prepared nearly 2000 ORF clones using the Flexi<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> cloning method, and the resultant ORF clones were examined with respect to production in cell-free protein synthesis systems as HaloTag-fusion proteins. The results indicated that the Flexi<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> cloning method was as efficient as the Gateway cloning method and that the Flexi ORF clones consistently produced equal or larger amounts of HaloTag-fusion proteins than Gateway clones in <italic>in vitro</italic> protein production systems. We also examined the subcellular localizations of 40 HaloTag-fusion proteins in HEK293 cells and confirmed that the results were equivalent to those of the corresponding Monster Green<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Fluorescent Protein (MGFP)-fusion proteins. Taken together, these results indicate that the Flexi ORF clone set can perform efficient functional analyses of human genes and provide an alternative resource for the human ORFeome project.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1.</label><title>Materials</title><p>pTD1 plasmid was obtained from Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan). pF1Kof vector, which was constructed by flipping the <italic>Acc</italic>III&#x02013;<italic>Age</italic>I 832-bp DNA fragment including the origin of replication in the pF1KT7 (Promega, Madison, USA) vector, was kindly provided by Promega Corporation. pF3AHT vector was constructed by inserting the blunt-ended <italic>Eco</italic>ICRI&#x02013;<italic>Sal</italic>I 946-bp DNA fragment from the pFC8A (HT) vector (Promega) into the <italic>Eco</italic>ICRI site of the pF3A WG (BYDV) (Promega) vector backbone in the appropriate order for production of a C-terminal HaloTag-fusion protein. pFC8A (MGFP) was constructed by replacing the HaloTag gene with the MGFP gene from the phMGFP vector (Promega).

The list of the Flexi ORF clones is accessible at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org">www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org</uri> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dsn004/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>). These Flexi ORF clones contained relatively large ORFs derived from 1163 KIAA and 766 known genes, the average sizes of which are 2.8 and 2.4&#x000a0;kb, respectively. ORFs of 341 pF1K clones were PCR-cloned using PrimeStar HS or KOD plus high-fidelity DNA polymerases, as described in Section 2. All ORF clones obtained by PCR cloning were sequence-verified and we found that the PCR mutation occurrence rate was less than 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> mutations per residue under the conditions employed in this study. ORF clones with large ORFs are inevitably at higher risk of having artificial missense mutation(s) introduced by PCR, thus we previously developed and applied the ORF Tap cloning method for the construction of Flexi ORF clones for some relatively long ORFs (mainly those &#x0003e;2&#x000a0;kb).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C9">9</xref></sup> The method is based on a homologous recombination in <italic>E. coli</italic> JC8679 and thus is very unlikely to introduce mutation(s) into ORFs during cloning. We therefore considered that this method was also highly suited to the preparation of Flexi ORF clones because reconfirmation of the ORF sequence could be avoided.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C18">18</xref></sup> Within this context, 842 pF1K clones were constructed by the ORF Trap cloning method. The remaining 749 pF1K clones, termed Flexi_RBS type, were constructed by transferring ORF sequences from the Gateway entry clones we had previously prepared to the pF1K vector, because the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-untranslated sequences (UTRs) have been already trimmed out in the Gateway entry clones. These clones contained a 19-bp fragment, including a ribosome-binding site (RBS), between the <italic>Sgf</italic>I site and a translational initiation codon. These Flexi clones were distinguished from others by adding &#x02018;SD&#x02019;, representing a Shine-Dalgarno sequence as an indication of the presence of an RBS, to their clone IDs, whereas the other pF1K clones were simply termed Flexi type. The ORF flanking sequences in these Flexi clones are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN004F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A. The <italic>Sgf</italic>I site was placed one base upstream of the initiation codon, which allowed the production of recombinant proteins with the native translational initiation site or with N-terminal tags using appropriate Flexi<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> vectors. On the other hand, the <italic>Pme</italic>I site was placed just downstream from the original stop codon of the ORF, which resulted in an attachment of the Val in Flexi type or the Tyr&#x02013;Val&#x02013;Val in Flexi_RBS type to the carboxy end of the native ORF. When an ORF sequence flanked by <italic>Sgf</italic>I and <italic>Pme</italic>I was cloned between the <italic>Sgf</italic>I and <italic>Eco</italic>ICRI sites of a Flexi<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> vector, the translational stop codon was destroyed and thus the protein was expressed as a carboxy-terminal fusion.

To examine the utility of HaloTag<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> technology, HaloTag-fusion products were produced in <italic>in vitro</italic> translation systems. The expressed proteins were analyzed on SDS&#x02013;PAGE after labeling with a HaloTag-TMR ligand. This simple labeling procedure enabled us to fluorometrically detect only proteins carrying a HaloTag portion on SDS&#x02013;PAGE, and thereby made it easy to check whether the ORF encoded an appropriately sized protein. Using this analysis, quantities of HaloTag-fusion proteins with ligand-binding activity could be directly estimated from the fluorescence intensities of protein bands on SDS&#x02013;PAGE. In these experiments, we also compared the performance of two <italic>in vitro</italic> translation systems: one derived from a wheat germ extract and the second from an insect cell extract [commercially named WGEP and TransDirect (TD), respectively]. We used these systems because these eukaryotic cell extracts are known to produce larger amounts of proteins than conventional rabbit reticulocyte lysates. In parallel, we also compared the efficiency of protein synthesis by Gateway-type (pTD2-Gw) and Flexi-type (pTD2-Flx) expression constructs, where ORFs were flanked with different appended sequences that are associated with the respective cloning methods. These appended sequences may affect the translational activity of the HaloTag-fusion constructs <italic>in vitro</italic>. For this purpose, we constructed 13 sets of HaloTag-fusion protein expression plasmids using pTD2-Gw and pTD2-Flx vectors. pTD2-Flx is a simple Flexi-type HaloTag-fusion protein expression vector derived from the pTD1 vector for the TD system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C19">19</xref></sup> This vector has 8-bp restriction enzyme recognition sites (<italic>Sgf</italic>I and <italic>Pme</italic>I sites) flanked by the baculovirus polyhedrin 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-UTRs, respectively. pTD2-Gw is a hybrid expression vector derived from pTD2-Flx, which has 25-bp Gateway recombination sites, <italic>att</italic>B1 or <italic>att</italic>B2, between polyhedrin 5&#x02032;-UTR and <italic>Sgf</italic>I, or between <italic>Pme</italic>I and 3&#x02032;-UTR, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN004F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>A). In both systems, protein production was directed by <italic>in-vitro</italic>-synthesized RNAs. Many fluorescent bands, probably resulting from proteolytic degradation, were observed in most samples. The fluorescence signal intensities of the largest bands were the expected size for the respective protein products, and each HaloTag-fusion protein was recorded for comparing the protein productivities of pTD2-Flx and pTD2-Gw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN004F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>B, indicated by an arrow). In the TD system, the fluorescence intensities of 8 out of 13 HaloTag-fusion proteins in the pTD2-Gw format were less than 60% as intense as those derived from pTD2-Flx clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN004F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>B, upper lanes: 2, 3, 5, 8&#x02013;11, and 13).

Thus, we further pursued the cause of this apparent inhibitory effect of the Gateway recombination sites on <italic>in vitro</italic> protein production. To systematically examine the effects of the appended sequences flanking the ORFs on <italic>in vitro</italic> protein production, we constructed systematically modified versions of expression clones for <italic>luc2</italic>, HaloTag, and Venus autofluorescent proteins, with different flanking sequences for each ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN004F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>C). Protein production in the TD and WGEP systems was monitored by measuring luciferase activity, HaloTag-TMR ligand-binding activity, or the fluorescence intensity of Venus protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN004F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>D). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN004F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>C, these clones included flanking sequences derived from the Gateway <italic>att</italic>B sites (B1 and/or B2), or parts of the kanamycin-resistant gene (K1: ACTGGGCACAACAGACAATCGGCTG, or K2: CCTGTCATCTCACCTTGCTCCTGCC, as examples of non-specific sequences) between the translational enhancer (polyhedrin 5&#x02032;-UTR) and the initiation ATG codon, and/or between the stop codon and the polyhedrin 3&#x02032;-UTR. N&#x02013;N, an expression clone without any additional sequences, was the control clone. N&#x02013;B2 and N&#x02013;K2 carry additional sequences (B2 and K2, respectively) only at the 3&#x02032;-flanking site, whereas B1&#x02013;N and K1&#x02013;N have additional sequences (B1 and K1, respectively) only at the 5&#x02032;-flanking site. K1 and K2 were spacer sequences with equal sizes as B1 and B2 and were not expected to be involved with the Gateway recombination. We also compared protein production from the Gateway-type expression vector (B1&#x02013;B2) and the modified vector (B1&#x02013;K2) in parallel. In total, we examined seven different expression vectors in these experiments. Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN004F2">2</xref>D shows the relative activities of <italic>luc2</italic>, HaloTag, and Venus proteins produced in the TD and WGEP systems compared with the N&#x02013;N type of pTDFlexi vector. Under these experimental conditions, the luciferase expression clones with <italic>att</italic>B1 sequence upstream of the ORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN004F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>, B1&#x02013;N, B1&#x02013;B2, and B1&#x02013;K2) appeared to exhibit only a slight inhibitory effect in the TD and WGEP systems in comparison with the pTDFlexi-<italic>luc2</italic> construct (N&#x02013;N in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN004F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>C). This reduction in protein productivity seemed to depend on the distance (39 nucleotides) between the 5&#x02032; translational enhancer and the initiation ATG but not the specific nucleotide sequence, at least in insect TD systems. Expression clones with short nucleotide sequences of the same length derived from the kanamycin-resistant gene also reduced the production of <italic>luciferase</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN004F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>D, upper, K1&#x02013;N). Such an inhibitory effect was more evident for HaloTag and Venus protein production in the TD system. In fact, in the TD system, both HaloTag-TMR-ligand-binding activity and the fluorescence intensity of Venus decreased to less than 50% when the additional sequences were located upstream of the ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN004F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>D, upper, B1&#x02013;N, K1&#x02013;N, B1&#x02013;B2, and B1&#x02013;K2). These results indicated that protein productivity in the TD system was affected by the increase in distance between the polyhedrin 5&#x02032;-UTR and the start ATG, rather than by the flanking nucleotide sequence of the spacer.</p><p>It was reported that the polyhedrin 5&#x02032;-UTR in pTD1 displayed a strong translational enhancing activity, even in the wheat germ extract and rabbit reticulocyte lysate systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C19">19</xref></sup> The inhibitory effect of sequences upstream of the ORF was prominent in the TD system but only minor in the WGEP system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN004F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>D, lower). Our results also showed that the expression clone lacking 5&#x02032;-UTR considerably reduced the productivity of <italic>luciferase</italic> in both the TD and WGEP systems, indicating that the translational enhancer of 5&#x02032;-UTR in pTD1 was functional in each system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN004F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>D, D5). On the other hand, translational activity was largely unaffected by the spacing between the 3&#x02032;-translational enhancer and the translational stop codon in all experiments using <italic>luc2</italic>, HaloTag, and Venus proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN004F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>D, N&#x02013;B2, N&#x02013;K2). Taking all these results together, we concluded that the spacing between the 5&#x02032;-translational enhancer and the translational initiation codon affected protein productivity, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>. Although the mechanism of the inhibitory effect on translational activity by spacing remains to be elucidated, it appears that nucleotide spacing between the enhancer and the initiation codon can sometimes affect translational activity. Because the distance between the 5&#x02032;-translational enhancer and the initiation codon is shorter in the Flexi ORF clone than in the Gateway ORF clone, these results suggest that the Flexi ORF clone could be the clone of choice to consistently obtain high protein productivity in both the TD and WGEP systems. We consider this as another benefit of using the Flexi ORF clones, since production level is a serious concern, particularly when a recombinant protein is synthesized <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><label>3.4.</label><title>Quality check of ORF clones from the viewpoint of in vitro protein production</title><p>Based on the results described above, we confirmed the functionality of a number of Flexi ORF clones produced as HaloTag-fusions in <italic>in vitro</italic> protein production systems. For this purpose, we used a transcription/translation coupled wheat-germ-cell-free protein synthesis system [T<sc>n</sc>T SP6 High Yield Protein Expression System, hereafter abbreviated as (T<sc>n</sc>T SP6 HYPES)] because the coupled system is easier and faster to operate and gives a higher yield of recombinant protein production than other uncoupled cell-free protein synthesis systems. Eight hundred and fourteen ORF sequences in pF1K clones were transferred to pF3AHT, C-terminal HaloTag-fusion protein expression vectors, by Flexi<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> cloning methods. One practical problem we encountered was that the coupled system required a large amount of expression plasmids to obtain the best results. Since we planned to use a small volume of <italic>E. coli</italic> culture (about 1&#x000a0;mL) to produce the plasmids, we were concerned that we would not be able to produce enough DNA to obtain good results in the T<sc>n</sc>T system. To solve this problem, we took advantage of <italic>in vitro</italic> amplification of expression plasmids. We found that DNA amplified with a TempliPhi rolling circle amplification kit could be used as template DNA in the T<sc>n</sc>T SP6 HYPES without any purification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C20">20</xref></sup> This enabled us to examine the production of a number of HaloTag-fusions in a high-throughput manner. As a result, medium-sized and even relatively large proteins, composed of more than 1000 amino acid residues, were effectively produced and detected by Western blot analysis using anti-HaloTag IgG, with only small amounts of degraded or inappropriately initiated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN004F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>A). Moreover, most of the HaloTag-fusion proteins retained HaloTag ligand-binding activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN004F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>B). Of the 814 pF3AHT clones tested in the T<sc>n</sc>T system, 97% produced recombinant proteins that could be detected by TMR HaloTag ligand labeling and Western blot analysis using anti-HaloTag antibody. The apparent molecular masses of the recombinant proteins were estimated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using anti-HaloTag antibodies. Most of the proteins had apparent molecular masses that were consistent with the numbers of amino acid residues of the fused proteins (data not shown). Although the fluorescence intensity of TMR varied widely from protein to protein in a range of arbitrary fluorescence units from 10 to 10 000, HaloTag-fusions that retained the functional characteristics of TMR ligand-binding were efficiently produced. However, we did observe a tendency of HaloTag-TMR ligand binding to display decreases in fluorescence intensity with increases in protein size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN004F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>C). These results are most likely explained by decreases in the production levels of larger HaloTag-fusions. However, it could also be explained on the assumption that the partner proteins may affect HaloTag-TMR ligand-binding activities. To address this, we examined the relationship between protein yields and their HaloTag ligand-binding activities for 53 HaloTag-fusions. In this experiment, the HaloTag-fusion protein yields were expressed by the radioactivity of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine and [<sup>35</sup>S]cysteine incorporated into the proteins and divided by the number that contained methionine and cysteine, while the HaloTag ligand-binding activities were estimated from the fluorescence intensity of Cy5-labeled HaloTag ligand-bound HaloTag-fusion proteins on SDS&#x02013;PAGE. The HaloTag-fusion protein yields and the HaloTag ligand-binding activities are plotted against the number of their amino acid residues in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN004F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>D and E, respectively.

The results indicated that the molecular HaloTag ligand-binding activities did not vary widely from fusion to fusion. Based on this result, we consider that the low ligand-binding activities observed resulted from low production levels of HaloTag-fusion proteins, although there may have been some exceptions.</p><fig id="DSN004F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Expression of recombinant HaloTag-fusion proteins in an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription/translation coupled protein synthesis system.

Thus, we accumulated data of the subcellular localizations using green fluorescent protein (GFP)&#x02013;ORF fusions constructed using the Gateway system. It was important for us to confirm that the subcellular localization revealed by HaloTag-fusions was consistent with the subcellular localization observed for GFP-fusions. First, we examined whether or not the HaloTag protein could be located in an expected subcellular compartment upon fusion of localization signals in COS-7 cells. To do this, we prepared pFC8A expression clones for the HaloTag protein containing signal sequences, such as membane-localized signal (Memb),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C21">21</xref></sup> nuclear localization signal (NLS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C22">22</xref></sup> endoplasmic reticulum targeting sequence (ER),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C23">23</xref></sup> Golgi-localized signal (Golgi),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C24">24</xref></sup> and mitochondrial targeting sequence (Mito).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C25">25</xref></sup> These sequences were all placed at the N-terminal region of the HaloTag proteins. Eighteen hours after transfection of these constructs into COS-7 cells, the HaloTag-fusion proteins were labeled with the TMR ligand and observed with a fluorescence microscopy system. Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN004F4">4</xref>A shows that all fused proteins were detected in an expected subcellular compartment, indicating that HaloTag proteins do not inhibit the function of these subcellular localization signals. Next, we directly evaluated whether HaloTag-fusion proteins were co-localized with the same GFP-fusion proteins when both fusions were expressed in the same cells. C-terminal HaloTag- and MGFP-fusion protein expression clones were prepared by the Flexi<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> cloning system using the Flexi ORF clones we prepared and pFC8A (HaloTag) and pFC8A (MGFP) vectors. After co-transfection of HEK293 cells with the same ORF clone fused to the two different fusion tags, HaloTag-fusion proteins were labeled with the TMR ligand and then the fluorescence images were obtained for TMR- (red) and MGFP-labeled (green) proteins for 40 ORFs. Examples of the cellular localization of the fusion proteins are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN004F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>B. Among them, subcellular locations of glucocorticoid modulatory element-binding protein 2 (GMEB-2/KIAA1269), phosphatidylserine synthase 1 (PTDSS1/KIAA0024), membrane-bound transcription factor site-1 protease (MBTPS1/KIAA0091), and transmembrane protein 127 (TMEM127/KIBB2508) are reported in the UniProt Knowledgebase as nucleus/cytoplasm, membrane, endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus, and membrane, respectively (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://ca.expasy.org/sprot/">http://ca.expasy.org/sprot/</uri>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C26">26</xref></sup> In contrast, the subcellular location of Mesoderm development candidate 2 (MESDC2/KIAA0081) is not mentioned and Secernin-1 (SCRN1/KIAA0193) is predicted to exist in the cytoplasm from similarities found in the database. The subcellular localizations of the 40 HaloTag-fusion proteins analyzed here were the same as those for MGFP-fusion proteins. These results indicate that HaloTag-fusion proteins can be used as an alternative for subcellular localization analysis in place of conventional autofluorescent proteins.</p><fig id="DSN004F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Subcellular localization of HaloTag-fusion proteins in cultured cells.

The rapid, easy, and assured transfer of ORF sequences into different expression vectors is highly critical for this purpose, since many ORF clones are used in combination with protein fusion tags that allow functional analysis. Within this context, we selected a HaloTag protein as a fusion partner because we considered that HaloTag<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> technology would provide a wide range of utilities that include detection and purification as well as adaptability in functional studies. In fact, we have successfully used HaloTag-fusion proteins in other studies for pulse-chase labeling, protein&#x02013;protein interaction, and chromosomal immunoprecipitation-like analyses along with bioimaging (unpublished data). In this report, we have shown that the Flexi<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> cloning method is suitable for the preparation of a large number of ORF clones into the pF1K vector and allows seamless implementation of HaloTag<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> interchangeable technology. Moreover, we have demonstrated that most human proteins were efficiently expressed as HaloTag-fusions in an <italic>in vitro</italic> coupled protein expression system, as well as in cultured mammalian cells. The resultant HaloTag-fusion proteins were biochemically active and successfully used for analyses of subcellular localization as an alternative to conventional autofluorescent proteins. Based on these results, we will accumulate a number of human ORF clones in the form of expression plasmids for HaloTag-fusion proteins, either C- or N-terminal fusions, in our ORFeome project since they will be directly used for functional studies, as well as for further transfer to another vector. HaloTag<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> technology provides a single fusion tag that can be utilized for a variety of structural and functional proteomic studies. Although there are a number of ORFeome resources for human genes that have been generated by Gateway recombinational cloning,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN004C27">27</xref></sup> a set of human Flexi ORF clones prepared as described would provide the research community with an important alternative for large-scale proteomic studies and a tool for individual research laboratories.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Supplementary material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dsn004/DC1">Supplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>This project was supported in part by a grant for Promega&#x02010;Kazusa scientific collaboration from Promega Corporation and by a special grant for acceleration of the practical application of biotechnology from Chiba Prefectural Government.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="dsn004_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" xlink:href="dsn004_dsn004supp_table.xls"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank J.
