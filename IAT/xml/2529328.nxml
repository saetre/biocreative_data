If a curative surgical resection is impossible, these cancers respond very poorly to chemotherapy and resulting in a poor prognosis. In gastric cancer patients, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) based combination chemotherapy have been attempted in order to improve the treatment outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. With colorectal cancer, 5-FU has been the most widely used drug for more than 40 years. However, other agents such as irinotecan or oxaliplatin have been used to improve the antitumor efficacy in combination with 5-FU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. 5-FU interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the production of pyrimidine nucleotide dTMP from dUMP during <italic>de novo </italic>DNA synthesis through the inhibition of thymidylate synthase as well as through the incorporation of fluoro-nucleotides into the DNA and RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>P-glycoprotein (Pgp) encoded by the multidrug resistance 1 (<italic>MDR1</italic>) gene is a representative membrane efflux pump of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Pgp functions as energy-dependent efflux pumps of a variety of structurally diverse chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin, vincristine, vinblastine, paclitaxel, colhicine, actinomycin D and mitomycin C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], which can decrease the intracellular level of drug accumulation. As a result, overexpression of these proteins confers MDR to cancer cells by evading the cytotoxic effects of drugs. In the human intestine, Pgp is strongly expressed on the apical surface of the superficial columnar epithelial cells of the ileum and colon, and its expression level decreases gradually proximally into the jejunum, duodenum and stomach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Regulation of the transcriptional activity of the <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene is dependent on several trans-acting proteins that bind the consensus cis-elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The accessibility of the promoter elements to their binding factors is regulated at the level of chromatin assembly. The levels of both DNA methylation and histone deacetylation regulate <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. So far, the transcriptional regulation of <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms has been reported in expression in colon cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] but none in gastric cancers cells. Furthermore, the relationships between the transcriptional expression of <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene expression and epigenetic mechanisms in gastric and colon cancer cells have not been compared. Therefore, it is unclear why chemotherapy regimens have been differently used to treat gastric and colorectal cancers and why <italic>MDR1 </italic>mRNA is expressed differentially in gastric and colorectal cancer cells. Therefore, this study examined whether or not the degree of methylation at the promoter site of the <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene is closely associated with <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene expression in both cancer cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The 10 human gastric cancer cell lines (SNU-1, -5, -16, -216, -484, -601, -620, -638, -668 and -719) and 9 colon cancer cell lines (SNU-C1, -C4, -C5, Colo320HSR, LoVo, DLD-1, HT-29, HCT-8 and HCT-116) were obtained from the Cancer Research Center at Seoul National University (South Korea). All the cells were cultured at 37&#x000b0;C in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere using RPMI 1640 medium (GibcoBRL, Gland Island, NY, USA) with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma, ST.

For quantitation, 3 &#x003bc;Ci of [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P] dCTP were added to each reaction mixture. After PCR, the PCR products were combined and then electrophoresed on a 7.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The bands were scanned with a densitometer (Pdi, Huntington Station, NY, USA).

DNA was sheared by sonication and Western blotting analysis was performed using a slight modification of the method first described by Towbin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting using a current of 60 V overnight. The membrane was incubated in blocking solution (5% skim milk) for 1 hr at room temperature, washed, and then incubated with primary goat polyclonal antibody (1:1000, Santa Cruz, Biotechnology, CA, USA) for Pgp. The membrane was washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted 1:1000) against each IgG for hosts of primary antibodies for 1 hr.

One microgram of total RNA was reversely transcribed into cDNA in a volume of 20 &#x003bc;l with 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Gibco-Bethesta Research Laboratory, Grand Island, NY, USA) and 0.18 &#x003bc;g/ml oligo (dT<sub>20</sub>) primers (Promega, Madison, USA) according to the manufacture's manual. Real-time PCR was performed with the Light Cycler 2.0 Instrument (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) using the Fast Start DNA Master SYBR Green I Kit (Roche). For verification of the correct amplification product, PCRs were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The sequences of the primers are as follows: for <italic>&#x003b2;-actin</italic>, 5'-GACTATGACTTAGTTGCGTTA-3' and 5'-GTTGAACTCTCTACATACTTCCG-3'; for <italic>MDR1</italic>, 5'-CTGGTTTGATGTGCACGATGTTGG-3' and 5'-TGCCAAGACCTCTTCAGCTACTG-3'.

The amplification procedure of target genes was as follows: pre-denaturing at 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min, 40 cycles of denaturing at 95&#x000b0;C for 15 sec, annealing for <italic>MDR1 </italic>at 67&#x000b0;C (<italic>&#x003b2;-actin </italic>at 55&#x000b0;C) for 5 sec, and extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 7 sec (<italic>&#x003b2;-actin </italic>for 21 sec). Melting curve analysis was performed to confirm production of a single product. Negative controls without template were produced for each run. Gene expression values (relative mRNA levels) are expressed as ratios (difference between the Ct values = The point on the curve in which the amount of fluorescence begins to increase rapidly, usually a few standard deviations above the baseline, is termed the threshold cycle (Ct value).) between the gene of interest (<italic>MDR1 </italic>mRNA) and an internal reference gene (<italic>&#x003b2;-actin </italic>mRNA) that provide a normalization factor for the amount of RNA isolated from a specimen.

After shaking for 1 min, the plate was incubated for 5 hr. Formazan crystals of the suspension culture were dissolved in 150 &#x003bc;l of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) after removing the supernatant. The optical density of the wells was measured with a microplate reader (&#x003bc;Quant, Bio-tek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) at 540 nm.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification PCR-based methylation analysis</title><p>Five micrograms of the genomic DNA was digested with 50 U of <italic>Msp </italic>I or <italic>Hpa </italic>II (Fermentas MBI, Vilnius, Lithuania) at 37&#x000b0;C for 16 hours, added to a 1/15 volume of 0.6 M Tris (pH 7.5) and 1.5 M NaCl, and digested with 50 U of <italic>Pst </italic>I (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) at 37&#x000b0;C for 8 hours.

These results are consistent with a report showing that Pgp is strongly expressed on the ileum and colon, at a level that gradually decreases proximally into the jejunum, duodenum and stomach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Since the stomach and colon play major roles in digestion and absorption, respectively, it is not surprising that transporters such as Pgp were differentially expressed in the two normal tissues. Our finding that the differential expression of <italic>MDR1 </italic>mRNA in cancer cell lines derived from the stomach and colon is also consistent with published reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Immunopathological studies revealed that Pgp expression on human tumors was most commonly detected in colon, renal, and adrenal carcinomas but rarely in lung and gastric carcinomas and certain germ cell tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>The three-way connection between DNA methylation, chromatin structure and gene expression was recently reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. An important consequence of CpG methylation is the local silencing of gene expression, which can be mediated by the direct interference of methylation with the binding of various transcription factors. The major component of silencing of gene expression appears to be the binding of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCp2), which has an affinity for methyl-CpG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. DNA demethylation by 5AC causes the release of the MeCp2 from the promoter, which activates transcriptional gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It is known that MeCp2 is also enriched on the <italic>MDR1 </italic>promoter and is related to its silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. 5AC alters the methylation pattern of the <italic>MDR</italic>1 promoter in Pgp-negative cells to resemble that of Pgp-positive cells and activates the promoter such that <italic>MDR1 </italic>mRNA is detectable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>In this study, the methylation status was also analyzed in order to determine if the <italic>MDR1 </italic>silencing is due to hypermethylation of the promoter region. Quantification PCR-based methylation analysis showed methylation in 9 (90%) out of 10 gastric cancer cell lines but only 3 (33%) out of 9 colon cancer cells, which were completely matched with the results obtained by bisulfite DNA sequencing assay. The latter frequency is relatively high compared with a different study showing <italic>MDR1 </italic>methylation in 24% of 275 colorectal cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. As showed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, complete but not partial methylation in the extended MS1 site was responsible for increased <italic>MDR1 </italic>mRNA expression by the treatment with 5AC. In addition, MS1 site derived from exon 1 of <italic>MDR1 </italic>promoter has shown to be more important with respect to gene expression than MS2 site from intron 1 of <italic>MDR1 </italic>promoter.</p><p>The histone-modifying enzymes such as histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and HDAC enzymes also modulate transcription of <italic>MDR1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Therefore, we have investigated how epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone deacetylation, are involved in the differential expression of <italic>MDR1 </italic>mRNA between gastric and colon cancer cells using 5AC and/or TSA. The following summarizes the results obtained after the 5AC and/or TSA treatment. Effects of 5AC and/or TSA are defined as positive when &#x0003e; 1.5-fold is increased after treatment.</p><p>1) In gastric cancer cells, 5AC and TSA induced <italic>MDR1 </italic>mRNA expression at a frequency of 6/10 (60%) and 7/10 (70%), respectively. On the other hand, in colon cancer cells, 5AC and TSA induced <italic>MDR1 </italic>mRNA expression at a frequency of 1/9 (11%) and 5/9 (55%), respectively. This suggest that DNA methylation is at least partly responsible for the low level of <italic>MDR1 </italic>mRNA expression in gastric cancer cells but is rarely involved in colon cancer cells whereas HDAC may play important roles in <italic>MDR1 </italic>mRNA expression in both cells.</p><p>2) 5AC alone had no effect but combined with TSA synergistically increased the <italic>MDR1 </italic>mRNA expression level in 20% (SNU-16 and -668) of gastric cancer cells but only the SNU-C5 colon cancer cells. This suggests that the expression of a methylated <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene insensitive to 5AC alone increased with the assistance of TSA. This result is consistent with a previous report that silencing conferred by MeCp2 and methylated DNA can be also relieved by inhibition of HDAC, facilitating the remodelling of chromatin and transcriptional activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Although TSA alone cannot activate hypermethylted <italic>MDR1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], it can lead to upregulation of non-methylated or sparely methylated promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Thus, epigenetic modifications of DNA and histone have been shown to be responsible for <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene silencing. However, it is still unclear which one is first, DNA methylation or histone modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Moreover, combined effect of 5AC with TSA was less than that of 5AC or TSA alone in gastric (SNU-1) and colon (SNU-C1, Colo320HSR and DLD-1) cancer cells, indicating a more complex relation between the methylated DNA and HDAC.</p><p>3) TSA but not 5AC induced <italic>MDR1 </italic>mRNA expression in 30% (SNU 16, -216 and &#x02013; 668) of gastric cancer cells and 40% (SNU-C1, COLO32HSR, DLD-1 and HT-29) of colon cancer cells. These findings suggest that HDAC is dominant over DNA methylation in cancer cells whose <italic>MDR1 </italic>genes are not methylated. However, synergistic effects of TSA when combined with 5AC showing no effect in gastric cancer cells (SNU-16 and -668) with unmethylated <italic>MDR1</italic>gene are not fully understood. The possibility of involvement of histone methylation in silencing of <italic>MDR1 </italic>expression remains to be determined.</p><p>4) The combined treatment of 5AC with TSA increased <italic>MDR1 </italic>mRNA expression either additively 20% (SNU-5 and -638) or synergistically 40% (SNU-16, -601, -668 and -719) in the gastric cancer cells but only synergistically in the SNU-C5 colon cancer cells. The synergistic effect of 5AC and TSA in gastric cancer cells can be explained on the basis of a report showing that the methylated gene binds MeCP2, which in turn recruits HDAC resulting in the suppression of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>5) Neither 5AC nor TSA induced <italic>MDR1 </italic>mRNA expression even in gastric (SNU-484) and colon (SNU-C4, -C5 and Lovo) cancer cells even though combination of 5AC and TSA increased <italic>MDR1 </italic>mRNA expression in the SNU-C5 cells. This suggests the involvement of other factors in <italic>MDR1 </italic>mRNA expression or inappropriate concentrations and incubation period of each inhibitor.</p><p>One of the aims of this study was to explain why the different 5-FU-based anticancer therapies have been used in gastric and colorectal cancers using differential <italic>MDR1 </italic>expression. It has been well known that high levels of thymidylate synthase activity are responsible for the resistance to 5-FU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. However, antimetabolites such as 5-FU are not substrates for the ATP-dependent efflux transporters such as Pgp expressed on the apical (brush-border) membrane of intestinal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Therefore, the <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>anticancer efficacy of 5-FU can be explained not only by the increase in its intracellular accumulation in cancer cells but also by the enhancement of its bioavailability when administered orally. In gastric cancer, even anthracyclines (doxorubicin or epirubicin) and mitomycin C, which are good Pgp substrates, have been used to treat gastric cancer cells, which are characterized by zero or low levels of Pgp, which would make them sensitive to these anticancer drugs. In colon cancer, a number of novel anticancer drugs including oxaliplatin and irinotecan have been used in various combinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Platinum compounds such as oxaliplatin, which are not substrates for Pgp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), have been used as effective agents against colorectal cancer. Even though irinotecan is a BCRP substrate, it has been shown to be effective in colon cancers with a significantly lower BCRP expression level than that of the normal colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Nevertheless, it is essential that substrate drugs (topotecan, irinotecan, anthracyclines, mitomycin C and trimetrexate) for Pgp and/or BCRPS used clinically in colon cancer be administered in conjunction with chemosensitizers (VX-710 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], GF120918 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], and XR-9576 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]), which can reverse both Pgp and BCRP.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The <italic>MDR1 </italic>mRNA levels in the gastric cancer cell lines were significantly lower than those in the colon cancer cell lines, which is at least in part due to differential epigenetic regulations such as DNA methylation and/or HDAC. Therefore, <italic>MDR1/</italic>Pgp plays more important roles in the transporting function in colon cancer cells than in gastric cancer cells.
