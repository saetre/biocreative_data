To achieve plasticity in circadian regulation, proteins constituting the molecular clock machinery undergo various post-translational modifications (PTMs), which influence their activity and intracellular localization.

Circadian control provides an evolutionary advantage to organisms in adapting their behavior and physiology to the appropriate time of day <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Sahar1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Wijnen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Feeding behavior, sleep-wake cycles, hormonal levels and body temperature are just a few examples of physiological circadian rhythms.</p><p>From a molecular standpoint, circadian rhythms are regulated by transcriptional and post-translational feedback loops generated by a set of interplaying clock proteins. The positive limb of the mammalian clock machinery is comprised of CLOCK and BMAL1, which are transcription factors that heterodimerize through the PAS domain and induce the expression of clock-controlled genes by binding to their promoters at E-boxes. Cryptochromes (<italic>Cry 1</italic>, <italic>Cry2</italic>) and Period genes (<italic>Per1</italic>, <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Per3</italic>) are clock-controlled genes that encode proteins that form the negative limb of the circadian machinery. PER and CRY proteins are classically thought to translocate into the nucleus to inhibit CLOCK&#x02236;BMAL1 mediated transcription, thereby closing the negative feedback loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Sahar1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Various core clock proteins undergo post-translational modifications (PTMs), a feature that is likely to contribute significantly to the plasticity of the circadian system. PTMs have been shown to regulate distinct functions, including transcriptional activation and intracellular localization. PTMs have been proposed to participate in controlling the timing between the activation and the repression of circadian transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Gallego1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Yet, the signaling pathways controlling the stability of the BMAL1 protein have not been deciphered. In the present study we have identified GSK3&#x003b2; as a critical regulator of BMAL1 stability and activity. GSK3&#x003b2; is a ubiquitous kinase which regulates various cellular functions, ranging from glucose homeostasis, to cell survival and cell-fate specification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Doble1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

The first evidence was based on the observation that <italic>shaggy</italic> (<italic>sgg</italic>), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of GSK3, controls the period of circadian locomotor activity by phosphorylating TIMELESS and regulating nuclear translocation of the PERIOD/TIMELESS heterodimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Martinek1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Cyran1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

In mammals, GSK3&#x003b2; has been reported to phosphorylate PER2, CRY2 and Rev-erb&#x003b1;. It has also been reported that the kinase activity of GSK3&#x003b2; oscillates in the central mammalian clock, suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and in the peripheral clocks (liver and fibroblasts) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Iitaka1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. GSK3&#x003b2; mediated phosphorylation appears to have differential effect on the stability of the targeted substrates, since it has been shown to induce the degradation of CRY2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Harada1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and the stabilization of Rev-erb&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Yin1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

We noted that BMAL1 contains 15 sites with the consensus T/SXXXS/T phosphoacceptor sequence for GSK3&#x003b2;. This prompted us to determine whether GSK3&#x003b2; can phosphorylate BMAL1. We performed <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays on bacterially purified GST-BMAL1 or GST alone by incubating them with recombinant GSK3&#x003b2; in presence of &#x003b3;<sup>32</sup>P-ATP.

Thus, BMAL1 appears to be an efficient substrate of GSK3&#x003b2;. Furthermore, to detect physical association between BMAL1 and GSK3&#x003b2;, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing BMAL1 and CLOCK in the presence or absence of GSK3&#x003b2;. Immunoprecipitation of BMAL1, either in presence or absence of CLOCK, pulled down GSK3&#x003b2;, confirming that BMAL1 and GSK3&#x003b2; do interact physically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008561-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0008561-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008561.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>GSK3&#x003b2; phosphorylates BMAL1 and primes it for ubiquitylation.</title><p>(A) <italic>In vitro</italic> Kinase assay.

Hence, we addressed the question of whether GSK3&#x003b2; affects BMAL1 ubiquitylation. We co-expressed HIS-tagged ubiquitin along with Myc-CLOCK and Flag-Myc-BMAL1 with or without constitutively active (CA, Ser9&#x0003e;Ala mutation) or kinase dead (KD, Lys85&#x0003e;Ala) mutants of HA-tagged GSK3&#x003b2;. Ubiquitylated proteins were pulled down using Ni-Sepharose beads under denaturing conditions and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Upon Western analysis using anti-Flag antibody to specifically detect BMAL1, we observed that co-expression of CA-GSK3&#x003b2; greatly enhanced BMAL1 ubiquitylation, whereas co-expression of KD-GSK3&#x003b2; had no effect on basal BMAL1 ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008561-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). This result confirmed that phosphorylation by GSK3&#x003b2; primes BMAL1 for ubiquitylation.

BMAL1 levels in GSK3&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs display only a mild oscillation, with total levels of the protein being much higher at all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008561-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>).

While the functional interactions between these PTMs have not been deciphered, phosphorylation by distinct kinases appears to regulate unique activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Kwon1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Kondratov2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Specifically, phosphorylation by Casein Kinase I&#x003b5; (CKI&#x003b5;) has been reported to activate BMAL1-mediated transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Eide1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, while phosphorylation by MAPK inhibits it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Sanada1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our present results indicate that GSK3&#x003b2; activity is circadian and that BMAL1 phosphorylation by this kinase controls its stability.</p><p>Our analysis identified S17 and T21 in BMAL1 as major target sites for GSK3&#x003b2;- mediated phosphorylation. While mutation of these residues leads to a reduction of phosphorylation and an increase in BMAL1 stability, we predict the presence of additional GSK3&#x003b2; phosphoacceptor sites on BMAL1. Importantly, multiple phosphorylation events on a clock protein, presumably by multiple kinases appear to be a common mode of regulation. For example, it has been recently shown that the <italic>Neurospora</italic> clock protein FREQUENCY is phosphorylated at 75 residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Baker1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. The phosphorylation status of several of these residues changes according to the time of the day and regulates period length. In mammals, PER2 has been shown to be phosphorylated at 21 sites, regulating its stability and localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Vanselow1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. While a detailed proteomic analysis of BMAL1 phosphorylation is warranted, our results reveal that GSK3&#x003b2; is pivotal in circadian function as it controls the stability of a core clock regulator. Further illustrating the importance of GSK3&#x003b2; in circadian regulation, a recent report demonstrated that GSK3&#x003b2; can also phosphorylate CLOCK and regulate its stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Spengler1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. It would be interesting to explore whether, similarly to what we describe here for dopamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008561-g005">Fig. 5</xref>), some specific pathways known to operate via GSK3&#x003b2;, such as the insulin signaling in liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Jope1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, regulate the circadian clock by altering the phosphorylation state and the stability of BMAL1. The implication of GSK3&#x003b2; in circadian control is significant, especially considering that this kinase has been linked to various diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer's, cancer and neuropsychiatric disorders. The link between D2R signaling and BMAL1 stability is challenging, as dopamine dysfunctions underlie neurological and psychiatric disorders which are disruptive of the circadian clock. Future studies will determine whether GSK3&#x003b2;-mediated disruption of normal circadian control is causally linked to some of these pathological conditions. In this sense, it is interesting that the activity of GSK3&#x003b1; also oscillates in circadian manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008561-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Although our data suggests that GSK3&#x003b1; might partially compensate for the loss of GSK3&#x003b2;, further studies are needed to determine whether BMAL1 and other clock components can be phosphorylated by GSK3&#x003b1;.</p><p>It could be argued that the effects of GSK3&#x003b2; on BMAL1 are indirect. It has indeed been shown that phosphorylation of Rev-erb&#x003b1; by GSK3&#x003b2; leads to its stabilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Yin1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Since Rev-erb&#x003b1; is a negative regulator of <italic>Bmal1</italic> transcription, it can be expected that when GSK3&#x003b2; is inhibited, Rev-erb&#x003b1; will be less stable, and hence, <italic>Bmal1</italic> transcription may be de-repressed. However, our results conclusively demonstrate that the observed stabilization of BMAL1 protein upon GSK3&#x003b2; inhibition is independent of Rev-erb&#x003b1;. The evidence in support of our argument is: (i) BMAL1 protein has a longer half-life in GSK3&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs when compared to WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008561-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>); (ii) BMAL1 accumulation upon GSK3&#x003b2; inhibition is evident not only on endogenous BMAL1, but also on ectopically expressed BMAL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008561-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The exogenous BMAL1 is not under control of the <italic>Bmal1</italic> promoter and hence can not be affected by Rev-erb&#x003b1;; and (iii) BMAL1 protein levels are higher in the GSK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs and D2R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice than in their wild type counterparts, although <italic>Bmal1</italic> circadian mRNA levels are virtually equivalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008561-g004">Figs. 4 A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008561-g005">5 A,B</xref>). Altogether, the present findings unequivocally show that phosphorylation of BMAL1 by GSK3&#x003b2; is a critical step in the control of its stability.</p><p>Recent reports have indicated that although circadian locomotor activity persists in mice displaying constitutively higher levels of BMAL1, either due to abolished Rev-erb&#x003b1; expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Preitner1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> or by transgenic re-expression in <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-McDearmon1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, the period length is rendered shorter. Moreover, robustness in tissue-specific circadian expression of certain clock genes (e.g. <italic>Cry1</italic>, <italic>Dbp</italic>) is compromised in these animals. These observations are in agreement with our data showing that increased BMAL1 protein levels in GSK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs and D2R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice does not abolish circadian gene expression, but affects its amplitude.</p><p>PTMs are often found in specific combinations in order to regulate protein activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Hunter1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Phosphorylation and ubiquitylation are often found to be coupled. In certain cases, such as &#x003b2;-catenin, I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, cyclin E, SREBP1, phosphorylation of a protein generates a &#x0201c;Phosphodegron&#x0201d; which promotes recognition by ubiquitin ligases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Hunter1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, in case of some transcription factors, their transcriptional activation domains (TAD) and degrons are overlapping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Muratani1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. The &#x0201c;Black Widow&#x0201d; model for transcription activation suggests that certain transcription factors are active only when unstable and their ubiquitylation status positively correlates with their activity. For example, stabilization of VP16 TAD causes its inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Salghetti1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. The VP16 TAD signals its ubiquitylation through the Met30 ubiquitin ligase. In the absence of Met30, VP16 is more stable but is unable to activate transcription. For BMAL1, it is notable that at specific times of the day when its abundance is low, its activity is high <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Lee2">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. The low abundance of BMAL1 also coincides with its high phosphorylation. Thus, we speculate that activation by BMAL1 also follows the &#x0201c;Black Widow&#x0201d; model: upon GSK3&#x003b2; mediated phosphorylation and generation of phosphodegrons, ubiquitylation by yet uncharacterized ubiquitin ligases would de-stabilize and thus, activate BMAL1. Identification of the E3 ubiquitin ligase specific for BMAL1, and the sites for ubiquitylation on BMAL1 should be the subject of future studies that would provide invaluable information on the control of circadian rhythms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>Generation of D2R-deficient mice has been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008561-Baik1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.
