Although DbpA has been extensively characterized biochemically, its biological function remains unknown. Previous work has shown that a DbpA deletion strain is viable with little or no effect on growth rate. In attempt to elucidate a phenotype for DbpA, point mutations were made at eleven conserved residues in the ATPase active site, which have exhibited dominant-negative phenotypes in other DExD/H proteins. Biochemical analysis of these DbpA mutants shows the expected decrease in RNA-dependent ATPase activity and helix unwinding activity. Only the least biochemically active mutation, R331A, produces small colony phenotype and a reduced growth rate. This dominant slow growth mutant will be valuable to determine the cellular function of DbpA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DbpA is an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DEAD-box protein that binds tightly and specifically to 23S rRNA and stimulates rapid ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Extensive truncation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4">2&#x02013;4</xref>) and footprinting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) experiments have shown that DbpA binds to a 153 nt region (153-mer) of 23S rRNA consisting of helices 89 through 93, which are all part of the peptidyltransferase center (PTC) of the ribosome. Shorter fragments that contain only hairpin 92 bind to DbpA with similar affinity as the 153-mer, demonstrating this hairpin as the primary binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In the presence of RNA duplexes containing hairpin 92, DbpA demonstrates weakly processive 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; RNA helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). However, mature ribosomes are poor substrates for DpbA because hairpin 92 is buried within the PTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>The N-terminal 381 amino acids of DbpA contains the ATPase core, 9 conserved motifs spanning two domains that define DExD/H proteins and are responsible for the ATP binding and hydrolysis activities. The C-terminal 76 amino acids form a basic domain that forms an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and is involved in RNA-binding specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The isolated C-terminal domain of YxiN, the <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> ortholog of DbpA, can bind hairpin 92 tightly and specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). However, the isolated N-terminal domain of YxiN binds RNA weakly and nonspecifically but does show ATPase activity, thus demonstrating the functional modularity of this DExD/H protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>Despite this extensive biochemical characterization, relatively little is known about the function of DbpA in <italic>E. coli</italic>. DbpA mRNA levels are found in low amounts in logarithmic cells, but they increase upon acid shock, addition of ciprofloxacin and at stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Several groups have deleted the <italic>dbpA</italic> gene using different methods, however no growth defects were observed in different culture media and growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) (Tsu,C. and Uhlenbeck,O.C., unpublished data). Because DbpA is activated by 23S rRNA <italic>in vitro</italic>, it was hypothesized that DbpA is either involved in the ribosome assembly pathway or in some specialized aspect of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Under many growth conditions, DbpA is not essential and therefore, either one of the other <italic>E. coli</italic> DExD/H proteins can substitute for its function or it is only required under certain growth conditions.</p><p>The goal of this article is to identify a dominant negative mutant of DbpA that can be used to better understand its cellular function. DbpA is a good candidate for creating a dominant negative mutant because its binding affinity and specificity lies almost completely in the CTD, while its ATPase and helicase activity are determined by the conserved ATPase core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). These modular characteristics make it possible to inactivate DbpA by mutating catalytic residues without affecting the ability of the CTD to bind substrate RNA. Unlike a knockout mutation of DbpA, a site-directed mutation would produce a protein that could compete with wild-type DbpA for the rRNA-binding site and subsequently block action at the normal site of function. Therefore, several point mutations were made in the conserved sequence motifs of DbpA that were identical to those showing dominant negative properties in other DExD/H proteins, including eIF-4A, Prp16, Prp22, Prp28, Prp43, Rok1p, Sub2p, Ded1p and Dbp8p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14 B15 B16 B17 B18 B19">11&#x02013;19</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Site-directed mutagenesis and purification of His-tagged DbpA mutations</title><p>The gene coding for DbpA with an N-terminal Met-His<sub>6</sub> sequence was cloned into the pET-3a vector between the NdeI and BamHI sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).

The fraction of bound protein was determined from the ratio of counts in the bound RNA band relative to the total counts of the free and bound RNA. The fraction of bound RNA versus DbpA concentration was plotted and fit to simple binding equilibria to determine the dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The binding affinity was also evaluated in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, AMPPNP.

A total of 1.2 &#x003bc;M 32-mer and 0.6 &#x003bc;M *9-mer were annealed by mixing in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 50 mM KCl and then heating to 95&#x000b0;C for 1 min, 80&#x000b0;C for 1 min, 75&#x000b0;C for 2 min, 70&#x000b0;C for 3 min. At 70&#x000b0;C, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> was added and the reaction was cooled to 24&#x000b0;C for 15 min and then to 4&#x000b0;C and used immediately. Helicase assays in the presence of excess protein were based on the previously described method in Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) and carried out at 24&#x000b0;C in binding buffer (as above). Seventy-five microliter aliquots of the RNA mixture (5 nM annealed substrate with 70 &#x003bc;M polyA) and protein mix (0.6 &#x003bc;M DbpA, 2 mM ATP, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) were combined to initiate unwinding. At various times, 9 &#x003bc;l of the reaction mixture was removed and mixed with 3 &#x003bc;l of quench dye [2.5 mM EDTA pH 8, 0.025% SDS (w/v), 1.25% glycerol (v/v), pinch xylene cyanol]. Then 9 &#x003bc;l of the quenched reaction was immediately loaded onto a 10% native acrylamide gel (29 : 1 acrylamide:bis) running at 150 V in 1/3&#x000d7; TBE buffer at 24&#x000b0;C. Gels were run at 200 V for 2 h, dried and exposed to a phosphor screen. The fraction of bi-substrate (*9-mer + 32-mer) was determined from the ratio of counts in the displaced RNA band (*9-mer alone) relative to the total counts of the annealed and displaced RNA bands. The fraction of duplex RNA was plotted versus time and fit to a single exponential curve. All reported rates of unwinding represent the average of at least three measurements and the error is within 2-fold.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blots</title><p>XL10-Gold&#x000ae; (Stratagene) or Tuner&#x02122; (DE3)pLacI (Novagen) modified to be RecA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (a gift from M.E.

This additional RNA-binding affinity is thought to be due to interactions with the catalytic domains that only form when their structure is pre-organized by the binding of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The RNA-binding affinity of each mutant was measured in the presence of 153-mer and AMPPNP to determine whether they have this additional affinity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Most of the mutants displayed little or no increase in affinity when AMPPNP was present (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) indicating that their ATP-binding site is either partially or fully disrupted thus preventing the additional contacts with the RNA. Only two of the mutants, K53A and D156A, show a greater than 5-fold increase in RNA-binding affinity in the presence of AMPPNP, suggesting that their ATP-binding site remains nearly fully intact (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>RNA-dependent ATPase activity</title><p>The ATPase activity of each mutant protein was initially assayed in the presence of 250 nM 23S rRNA and 5 mM ATP which are saturating for wild-type DbpA.

The mutants with high specific activity (D156A, S184A, T186A and H327A) make interdomain contacts but do not contact the ATP directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), suggesting that they are not directly involved in hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The two mutants with the lowest specific activity, R331A and K53A, both contact the phosphates of the ATP directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). This lysine is invariant in all ATPases, and when mutated usually abolishes hydrolysis and unwinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). As expected, the K53A mutant of DbpA shows very weak ATPase activity (<italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> = 0.7 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Interestingly, K53A still demonstrates increased RNA-binding affinity in the presence AMPPNP suggesting that the mutation affects catalysis without affecting ATP binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

Alanine substitutions of the other two arginines in motif VI of DbpA, R328 and R334, have more ATPase activity than R331A and thus are less likely to serve as the arginine finger.

Eleven point mutations were made using this <italic>dbpA</italic>-containing plasmid and Stratagene's QuikChange&#x000ae; XL Site-Directed mutagenesis kit. Plasmids were initially transformed into the T7-lacking <italic>E. coli</italic> XL10-Gold strain (Stratagene). When mutant DbpA plasmids were transformed into XL10-Gold, all eleven strains behaved the same as wild-type DbpA and wild-type XL10-Gold controls. In order to produce protein for biochemical studies, the same eleven plasmids were transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) pLysS (Stratagene), which harbors a T7 RNA polymerase gene under control of the lac repressor. During the course of this experiment, we noticed that strains containing the R331A mutant plasmid consistently produced a small colony phenotype while the other ten strains showed colony sizes similar to controls [BL21(DE3) pLysS with wild-type DbpA plasmid and BL21(DE3) pLysS expressing endogenous levels of DbpA]. This small colony phenotype for R331A is only seen in cells containing the T7 RNA polymerase gene and is likely the result of &#x02018;leaky&#x02019; expression of the mutant from the plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Presumably, the nonfunctional R331A protein from the multicopy plasmid competes with the endogenous DbpA to produce the small colony phenotype. It is striking that none of the other DbpA mutations show the small colony phenotype, even when cells are plated at 24&#x000b0;C instead of 37&#x000b0;C because mutations in DExD/H proteins are often cold sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). This may reflect the fact that of the eleven mutations tested, R331A shows the lowest amount of ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). To confirm that the small colony phenotype was a consequence of the R331A point mutation, the mutation was made a second time with identical results.</p><p>Two additional growth experiments support the idea that the small colony phenotype results from competition between the R331A protein and the endogenous wild-type DbpA. First, when the R331A plasmid is transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) cells, even smaller colonies are observed, consistent with an even greater amount of &#x02018;leaky&#x02019; plasmid expression in the absence of the pLysS gene encoding the T7 lysozyme, which inhibits T7 RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Second, when the R331A plasmid is transformed into an <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) strain with a deletion of the DbpA gene (provided by I. Iost), even smaller colonies were observed, which is expected when the competing wild-type protein is unavailable. Finally, if T7 RNA polymerase is induced by the addition of 1 mM IPTG to any of the strains discussed above, there is no significant change in the results. Presumably, the relatively large amount of &#x02018;leaky&#x02019; expression from the plasmid-encoded gene is more than sufficient to compete with the wild-type protein.</p><p>Further analysis of the R331A mutant in BL21(DE3) pLysS cells was complicated by the fact that when cells were grown in liquid culture for many hours, and then plated, the colony size was no longer homogenously small. Instead, a significant fraction of larger colonies was observed. This phenotypic instability is probably the result of recombination between the mutant plasmid gene and the genomic copy of the DbpA gene. Thus, the R331A plasmid and several other mutations were transformed into a Tuner&#x02122; (DE3) pLacI RecA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> strain. In this case, the small colony phenotype of R331A still occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A) and is much more stable at both 22&#x000b0;C and 37&#x000b0;C. When the R331A mutation in Tuner&#x02122; (DE3) pLacI RecA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> was grown in liquid culture at both temperatures, it had a modestly slower growth rate (1.6-fold at 37&#x000b0;C, 2.2-fold at 22&#x000b0;C) than either the wild-type DbpA or the empty vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). In addition, at both temperatures, cells harboring the R331A mutation took significantly longer to exit stationary phase and enter log phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wild-type DbpA and mutants K53A and R331A in Tuner&#x02122; (DE3) pLacI RecA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells at 37&#x000b0;C.

Saks). Doubling times are an average of 3&#x02013;4 growth experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm926f5"/></fig></p><p>To compare the expression of uninduced R331A mutant with that of endogenous DbpA, semi-quantitative western blot experiments using a polyclonal antibody against DbpA (provided by F. Fuller-Pace) were performed on the R331A mutant and wild-type DbpA expressed in Tuner&#x02122; (DE3) pLacI RecA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> along with K53A in Tuner&#x02122; (DE3) pLacI RecA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and wild-type Tuner&#x02122; (DE3) pLacI RecA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The amount of endogenous DbpA present in wild-type cells cannot be detected even when large amounts of lysate are analyzed. Based upon the detection limit of the DbpA antibody, we estimate that there are less than 1000 molecules of DbpA per cell. However, when plasmids containing wild-type DbpA, R331A or K53A are present, much larger amounts of protein were observed. Based on three separate experiments &#x0223c;75 000 copies per cell could be estimated for all three proteins. This high level of expression is observed as the result of &#x02018;leaky&#x02019; expression from T7 RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) compounded by the multiple copies of the plasmid. Because the amount of R331A protein is not significantly different from the others, its small colony phenotype is not due to the presence of a larger or smaller amount of protein. Furthermore, the 75-fold excess of R331A mutant protein over endogenous DbpA protein means that it can effectively compete for the available 23S rRNA hairpin 92 binding site, despite the fact that in the presence of ATP it binds less well than wild-type DbpA. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Western blot of cell lysates.

The classic ATPase motifs I and II, also known as the Walker A and B motifs, are highly conserved and important in the ATP hydrolysis cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In DbpA, alanine substitution of the strictly conserved residues of these motifs (K53, T54, D153 and E154) causes drastic reductions in ATP hydrolysis rates and helicase activities as expected. Residue K53 of motif I is expected to make contacts with the &#x003b2; and &#x003b3;-phosphates of ATP and, when mutated in DbpA, <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> is low (0.7 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and helicase activity is abolished. According to crystal structures and other mutagenesis data, motif II residue E154 coordinates a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion while the D153 residue binds to the ATP through that Mg<sup>2+</sup> and is proposed to catalyze hydrolysis of the &#x003b2;&#x02212;&#x003b3; phosphate bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Similar mutation of all these residues to alanine in yeast Prp22, Prp16 and Prp43, as well as more conservative mutation to other residues in human eIF-4A, also show little to no ATPase and no RNA helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In contrast with the Walker A and B residues, crystal structures of Vasa show that the last residue of motif II, D156, does not contact the ATP but instead makes interdomain contacts with the H327 of motif VI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). In DbpA, D156A is the only mutant from these two motifs that has significant ATPase activity and moderate helicase activity as also shown with similar mutations of this last residue (D/H) in HCV NS3, human eIF-4A, and yeast Prp16 and Prp43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>).</p><p>Motif III does not contact ATP directly but makes important interdomain contacts, i.e. S184 and T186 contact D156 in motif II and T186 contacts H327 in motif VI, which most likely assists in domain closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Individual mutations of S184 and T186 to alanine in DbpA only moderately decrease helicase and ATPase activity similar to Prp16 and Prp43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). However, simultaneous mutations of the serine and threonine in motif III of human eIF-4A causes a small decrease in ATP hydrolysis while almost completely abolishing unwinding, suggesting this motif is coupling the ATPase and helicase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p><p>Motif VI, unlike motifs I, II and III, is found in domain 2, along the ATP-binding pocket at the interface of the two domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). As mentioned above, H327 makes contacts to domain 1 and to motif III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and its mutation to alanine in DbpA, like the other interdomain contacting mutants, (D156A, S184A and T186A) only moderately affects the ATPase and helicase activities. However, individual mutations of each of the three arginines all have severe effects on ATPase and helicase activity as seen with yeast Prp16, Prp 22 and human eIF-4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Two of these arginines in the Vasa structure, R331 and R334, make contacts with the ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and when mutated to alanine in DbpA, <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> decreases to &#x0003c;12% of wild-type for R334A and &#x0003c;0.5% of wild-type for R331A (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). The first arginine of motif VI, R328, does not contact the ATP but also has severely decreased ATPase activity when mutated in DbpA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). The reduced binding affinity of the R328A mutant might explain the low <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) but it is unclear why the binding is affected. One of the arginines in motif VI is thought to act as an &#x02018;arginine finger&#x02019;, important in transition state stabilization of the ATP hydrolysis cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Out of the three arginine mutations in DbpA, the R331A mutant has the most dramatic effect, with no helicase activity, and the lowest <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> of 0.4 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Therefore, we propose that R331 is most likely to act as the &#x02018;arginine finger&#x02019; in DbpA.</p><p>The DbpA R331A mutant is also the only one of the eleven ATPase mutants that displays a dominant negative phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). It is interesting to compare its biochemical properties to the K53A mutation, which does not display a phenotype. In other DExD/H helicases, yeast Prp16, Prp22, Prp43 and human and yeast eIF-4A, mutations in either of the amino acids corresponding to K53 or R331 result in lethal or dominant negative phenotypes and greatly reduced ATPase and helicase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14">11&#x02013;14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In DbpA, the severely decreased ATPase activity for R331A and K53A are nearly the same (0.4 and 0.7 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively) and both show no helicase activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). They both can bind substrate well (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) and therefore both should block the binding and activity of the wild-type protein <italic>in vivo</italic>. Why then does only the R331A mutation show a phenotype? The only major biochemical difference between the two mutant proteins is that K53A binds RNA substrate 6-fold tighter in the presence of AMPPNP, similar to wild-type DbpA, where the R331A-binding affinity for RNA is only 3-fold tighter when AMPPNP is present (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This would suggest that the K53A mutation would be more effective than the R331A mutation in competing with wild-type protein <italic>in vivo</italic> where ATP is present. Thus a more likely explanation of this caveat lies in the specific activities of the two mutant proteins. It could be that the slightly higher residual ATPase activity of the K53A mutation is sufficient to permit the catalytic cycle and substrate rearrangement to occur and thus avoid the phenotype. In contrast, the R331A mutation eliminates the &#x02018;arginine finger&#x02019;, which thereby removes the ATP-dependent interdomain motion that is critical for helicase function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p><p>Until now, there has not been an available DbpA phenotype. This dominant slow growth mutation will be extremely useful to further investigate the molecular function of DbpA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). From what is known thus far, DbpA is expected to be important in some role of ribosome biogenesis or translation because it interacts with the 23S rRNA at the peptidyltransferase center. Initially, it will be interesting to study the ribosome populations in the mutant strains to hopefully begin to understand the actual function of DbpA <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The project described above was supported by R01-GM60268-08 from the National Institutes of Health, and 1C06RR018850-01from the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
