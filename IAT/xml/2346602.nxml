In addition to these roles in lesion bypass, recent studies have suggested additional functions of these specialized polymerases in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). These Y-family enzymes are found in all three life domains and are notably devoid of 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; exonuclease activities, which are genuine fidelity checking mechanisms inherent to replicative DNA polymerases. These lesion bypass DNA polymerases are also shown to possess conformationally flexible active sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8">3&#x02013;8</xref>), which contributes to both their observed lesion-bypass capabilities and low polymerization fidelities.</p><p>It has been shown previously that T7 phage DNA polymerase utilizes an induced-fit mechanism powered by the energy of nucleotide binding, to select a correct nucleotide from a pool of similar nucleotide substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Similar results have been provided as convincingly for DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). To our knowledge, pre-steady state kinetic studies have been performed for only three Y-family DNA polymerases with an undamaged DNA substrate. Both <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> polymerase &#x003b7; (pol&#x003b7;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> DNA polymerase IV (Dpo4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) have been shown to utilize an induced-fit mechanism for selecting a correct nucleotide while studies of <italic>Sulfolobus acidocaldarius</italic> DinB homolog (Dbh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) very unconvincingly concluded that Dbh uses the chemistry step to choose incoming nucleotides. In the latter study, Cramer and Restle surprisingly argue against an induced-fit mechanism for Dbh solely based on an observed elemental effect of 9.1 for correct nucleotide incorporation. In contrast, the same elemental effect determined by Potapova <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) in an earlier study is 4 and they conclude that Dbh uses the induced-fit mechanism to select a correct nucleotide. These contradictory conclusions are purely based on the measured elemental effect, which is largely considered an unreliable diagnostic for determining the rate-limiting step for DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Moreover, Cramer and Restle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) further report that the <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> rate (&#x0223c;63 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) for Dbh&#x02022;DNA dissociation is at least 10-fold higher than the polymerization rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>pol</sub>), yet are still able to observe a burst in the first turnover. They argue that the unexpected burst is due to a possibly reduced <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> rate in the presence of high nucleotide concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In order to account for a reduced <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>, it is more reasonable to argue that the existence of the induced-fit mechanism leads to the locking of DNA in a tight ternary complex Dbh&#x02032;&#x02022;DNA&#x02022;dNTP. Clearly, more kinetic studies of the Dbh catalytic mechanism need to be performed before a sound conclusion can be reached.</p><p>In two previous publications, we used Dpo4 and the methods of pre-steady state kinetics to determine the fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) of single nucleotide incorporation into undamaged DNA at 37&#x000b0;C. These studies demonstrated that similar to reports for other Y-family DNA polymerases, Dpo4 possesses very low incorporation fidelity (10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> to 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>), which is several orders of magnitude below that observed for replicative DNA polymerases. However, owing to the fact that the <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> species propagate in an environment where their physiological temperature varies between 75&#x000b0;C and 85&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), it becomes important to address what effect temperature may have on the kinetic mechanism of Dpo4 established previously at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Thus, we exploit the thermal stability of Dpo4 in order to probe key mechanistic parameters to determine the effect of temperature on the reaction mechanism. Here, we provide evidence indicating that both the fidelity and induced-fit mechanism remain unchanged with an increase in the reaction temperature although microscopic rate constants are dramatically altered.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>These chemicals were purchased from the following companies: [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]dTTP and [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP, GE Healthcare (Picataway, NJ, USA); dNTPs, Gibco-BRL (Rockville, MD, USA); Sp-dTTP&#x003b1;S and Sp-dGTP&#x003b1;S, Biolog &#x02013; Life Science Institute (Bremen, Germany); ddTTP, Trilink Biotechnologies (San Diego, CA, USA).

The ground-state binding affinity (1/<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) for each individual nucleotide was measured through the dNTP concentration dependence of the observed single turnover rate. Dpo4 (120 nM) and 5&#x02032;-[<sup>32</sup>P]-D-1 (30 nM) was first preincubated at room temperature, then at 37&#x000b0;C, and finally at 56&#x000b0;C prior to being mixed with various concentrations of a single dNTP to initiate nucleotide incorporation at 56&#x000b0;C.

For the correct incorporation of dTTP into the D-1 substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), the observed rates were obtained by fitting the data to a single exponential equation (Materials and Methods section) for each individual time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A).

A similar assay was carried out at 38&#x000b0;C for reasons explained below under the same conditions, where we obtained a <italic>k</italic><sub>p</sub> of 17.7 &#x000b1; 0.6 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 221 &#x000b1; 15 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, data not shown), which were both within 2-fold of the corresponding values at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). This indicated that with an 18&#x000b0;C increase in reaction temperature, the rate increased 11-fold to a rate that approached the upper limitation for accurate measurement by the rapid chemical quench flow instrument. Yet, the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for dTTP binding increased (decreased affinity) by only 1.7-fold.

Yet, the question as to whether or not this mechanism changes with an increase in reaction temperature remains to be determined. In an effort to elucidate the mechanism at a more physiologically relevant temperature for Dpo4, these same studies were performed at 56&#x000b0;C and not at 80&#x000b0;C (see Discussion section). To determine if Dpo4 follows the same biphasic kinetics that were reported at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), a pre-steady state kinetic assay at 56&#x000b0;C for the correct incorporation of dTTP into the D-1 substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) was performed by mixing a preincubated solution of 5&#x02032;-[<sup>32</sup>P]-D-1 (120 nM) and Dpo4 (30 nM) with dTTP (100 &#x000b5;M) in buffer D (Materials and Methods section). Reactions were then quenched with 0.37 M EDTA at times ranging from 5 ms to 4.5 s, analyzed via denaturing PAGE, and quantitated using a Phosphorimager. The resulting data were fit to Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M3">3</xref>) (Materials and Methods section) and demonstrated the same biphasic nature observed at 37&#x000b0;C, characterized by a fast-phase burst rate of 33.6 &#x000b1; 5.0 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> preceding a slow-phase rate of 0.11 &#x000b1; 0.01 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Thus, following the first turnover of the enzyme, the subsequent multi-turnovers occurred at a rate over 300-fold slower due to the dissociation of the DNA product (DNA<italic><sub>n</sub></italic><sub>+1</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="S1">Scheme 1</xref>) from the binary complex as observed with other enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26 B27 B28">24&#x02013;28</xref>). The observed slow phase rate was verified via a subsequent assay performed under steady-state conditions where the DNA substrate was in molar excess (&#x0223c;200-fold) over the concentration of Dpo4 (Materials and Methods section).

For reasons explained previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), we can measure the dependence of the burst amplitude on D-1 concentration to ascertain the equilibrium dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) of the Dpo4&#x02022;DNA binary complex at 56&#x000b0;C. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, the burst amplitude increased with the addition of the D-1 substrate, reaching maximum amplitude at 400 nM D-1.

If the incorporation of a correct ddNTP follows the kinetics of the incorporation of a correct dNTP, the latter assay was used to measure the rate of DNA dissociation from a ternary complex that was incapable of performing chemistry due to the incorporation of ddTTP yet could still bind the next correct nucleotide, while the former assay, lacking dCTP, directly measures the DNA dissociation rate from the E&#x02022;DNA binary complex. In the presence of ddTTP alone, the steady-state rate was measured to be 0.063 &#x000b1; 0.001 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). To examine whether or not the incorporation of ddTTP into D-1 also followed biphasic kinetics as observed with a correct dNTP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, we performed a similar burst experiment with ddTTP. The product formation with ddTTP (Supplementary Figure 1) does follow the biphasic pattern as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A. Due to the similarity of the incorporation kinetics observed with ddTTP and dTTP, we concluded that both the slow phase in the burst experiment (Supplemental Figure 1) and the steady-state phase in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> were limited by DNA dissociation from the E&#x02022;DNA binary complex. Interestingly, when assayed in the presence of ddTTP and dCTP, a 22-fold slower dissociation rate (0.0028 &#x000b1; 0.0004 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) and suggested that DNA dissociation was inhibited by the presence of dCTP.

Reactions were immediately quenched by the addition of 1 N HCl in the first experiment, while in the second experiment, reactions were instead chased with an excess of unlabeled dTTP before quenching with 1 N HCl. The nucleotide trap in the pulse-chase reactions precludes dissociated [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]-dTTP rebinding to the Dpo4&#x02022;D-1 complex while allowing any competently bound Dpo4&#x02022;D-1&#x02022;[&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]-dTTP complexes to partition between dissociation and product formation.

This wavelength lies in a region of the spectrum which detects the protein backbone conformation. Interestingly, the ellipticity slowly increases from 14&#x000b0;C to 86&#x000b0;C, where it then begins to increase sharply suggesting that the protein or specific protein domains begin to thermally unfold (Supplementary Figure 2). This correlates fairly well with the physiological temperature of the organism, which varies between 75&#x000b0;C and 85&#x000b0;C. In addition, we performed a stability assay whereby we incubated solutions containing 55 nM Dpo4 at the following temperatures for 10 min: 2&#x000b0;C, 14&#x000b0;C, 26&#x000b0;C, 32&#x000b0;C, 38&#x000b0;C, 44&#x000b0;C, 50&#x000b0;C, 56&#x000b0;C, 62&#x000b0;C, 70&#x000b0;C, 80&#x000b0;C, 90&#x000b0;C, 95&#x000b0;C and 100&#x000b0;C. Subsequent to the incubation, 10 &#x000b5;l aliquots of the above solutions were then added to 5&#x02032;-[<sup>32</sup>P]-D-1 (50 nM) and following a 10 min incubation at 37&#x000b0;C, were rapidly mixed with 1 mM dTTP for 1 min. A plot of relative extension as a function of temperature (Supplemental Figure 3) indicated that Dpo4 was stable over a range of temperatures from 2&#x000b0;C to 90&#x000b0;C, but then abruptly became inactivated at 95&#x000b0;C. These observations also correlate very well with results from our CD studies and strongly suggest that the decrease in activity at 95&#x000b0;C was due to thermal denaturation of the structure of Dpo4. Although one may expect a decrease in stability of Dpo4 at 90&#x000b0;C based on our CD results, we only observed a 5% decrease in relative product formation at this temperature. This could be due to the slight molar excess of Dpo4 over DNA in this assay but is also a function of the less significant conformational uncoupling of Dpo4 secondary structure observed in Supplementary Figure 2 at 90&#x000b0;C compared to 95&#x000b0;C. However, when coupled with our observation of a significant increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>p</sub> with temperature, the increase in ellipticity between 14&#x000b0;C and 86&#x000b0;C suggests an increase in the conformational dynamics of Dpo4 as discussed subsequently.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Thermostable enzymes catalyze reactions at much higher rates as the reaction temperature of the medium increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32 B33 B34 B35 B36 B37 B38">32&#x02013;38</xref>). These higher enzymatic activities are due to faster conformational dynamics of the enzyme at higher reaction temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) thought to be a function of a balanced relationship between molecular stability and structural flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Although the nucleotide incorporation rate has not been quantitatively determined for Dpo4 at 80&#x000b0;C, Dpo4 has been shown to remain active after being incubated for 5 min at a temperature in the range of 37&#x000b0;C to 95&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). We naturally expect that the microscopic rate constants in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="S1">Scheme 1</xref> will increase as the reaction temperature approaches the physiologically relevant temperature of Dpo4 from the work of Arrhenius. Yet, the pre-steady state kinetic parameters of single nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by Dpo4 on an undamaged DNA substrate have only been reported at 37&#x000b0;C. Therefore, the effects of temperature on the fidelity and mechanism of Dpo4 catalysis requires elucidation.</p><sec><title>Fidelity</title><p>We have incrementally determined the fidelity of nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by Dpo4 at several temperatures ranging from 26&#x000b0;C to 56&#x000b0;C using the same single turnover experiments described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). We were able to extract the maximum rate of nucleotide incorporation (<italic>k</italic><sub>p</sub>) and ground-state binding affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) for each nucleotide incorporation event into the undamaged DNA substrate, D-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). These parameters along with the substrate specificities and overall fidelity were calculated and listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The resulting <italic>k</italic><sub>p</sub><sup>correct</sup> values and average <italic>k</italic><sub>p</sub><sup>incorrect</sup> values were then plotted as a function of temperature including those <italic>k</italic><sub>p</sub> values estimated at 2&#x000b0;C and 14&#x000b0;C (Supplemental Figure 4). In addition, the average overall fidelity over this same temperature range was plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). We found that with an increase in the reaction temperature of 30&#x000b0;C (26&#x000b0;C to 56&#x000b0;C), the <italic>k</italic><sub>p</sub> for correct and incorrect nucleotides increase by 30-fold and 27- to 143-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Similar results were observed for another thermophilic Y-family member Dbh, a homolog from <italic>S. acidocaldarius</italic>, which demonstrated a 40-fold higher rate at 65&#x000b0;C compared to 22&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Conversely, the differences in ground-state binding affinities (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) for both correct and incorrect nucleotides differ by only 2- to 3-fold over this temperature range, therefore not significantly altering the &#x00394;&#x00394;G value nor the conclusion we reported previously for Dpo4 in regard to its inability to discriminate between correct and incorrect nucleotides in the ground-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Due to the lack of a significant change in the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> with temperature coupled with the observation of a similar magnitude change of <italic>k</italic><sub>p</sub> for both correct and incorrect incorporations, the overall fidelity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) from 26&#x000b0;C to 56&#x000b0;C decreased by a very modest 2.7-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Interestingly, the error frequency of <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase, a thermostable enzyme from <italic>Thermus aquaticus</italic>, has been shown to increase only 2-fold over a temperature range of 15&#x000b0;C, from 55&#x000b0;C to 70&#x000b0;C using a base substitution reversion assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). These differences could be a function of the experimental error inherent to these assays or due to the relative insensitivity of this assay, since a forward mutation assay for <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase showed no observable difference in the error frequency with the same increase in temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). A similar magnitude (&#x0223c;2-fold) difference in error frequency was also observed for <italic>Thermococcus litoralis</italic> DNA polymerase with a temperature difference of 17&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Unfortunately, our quest to perform analogous fidelity studies at temperatures exceeding 56&#x000b0;C employing the same single turnover experiments are limited by the following factors: (i) the instrument is not suitable for usage at temperatures above 70&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>); (ii) based on our kinetic results above for correct dNTP incorporation at 56&#x000b0;C, the expected rate at 80&#x000b0;C (&#x0003e;9900 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) will far exceed the capabilities of the instrument since the reaction will complete within the instrument's dead time of mixing (&#x0223c;1 ms); (iii) at 80&#x000b0;C the 21/41 mer D-1 substrate will be largely melted requiring the use of a considerably longer primer-template that would preclude comparison to our previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) not to mention the difficulty in separating the product from substrate via gel electrophoresis for this longer substrate. Thus we hypothesize that the fidelity of Dpo4 at 80&#x000b0;C will not be significantly different from its fidelity determined at 56&#x000b0;C in this report. Incidentally, a combination of steady-state kinetics and studies using a forward mutation assay reveal that the substitution error rate of Dpo4 with undamaged DNA (6.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>) at 70&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) does not differ significantly from the misinsertion fidelity (10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> to 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) estimated at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Temperature dependence of nucleotide incorporation fidelity.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn004f7"/></fig></p></sec><sec><title>Conformational flexibility and mechanism</title><p>As the temperature of a reaction is increased, there is an ensuing exponential increase in the rate for catalysis until the enzyme structure succumbs to thermal denaturation which is thought to be brought about by local or global unfolding of the catalytically competent conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). We have observed a similar exponential-like increase in the rates of Dpo4 for both correct and incorrect nucleotide incorporation when temperature is increased (Supplementary Figure 4). In both cases this exponential increase is preceded by a small angle linear increase in the rate. In this linear phase, which occurs at the lower reaction temperatures, the rates remain similar in magnitude and are relatively slow presumably due to the lack of sufficient energy for a relatively large portion of Dpo4 molecules to overcome the activation energy (<italic>E</italic><sub>a</sub>) to catalyze the reaction at these temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). This decrease in the ability of an enzyme performing the steps and conformational changes requisite for catalysis has been correlated with increased rigidity at these low nonphysiological temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). The data in Supplementary Figure 4 indicate that the rates for both correct and incorrect incorporations slowly transition to an exponential phase at roughly 40&#x000b0;C. However, the highest temperature that we have assayed for enzyme activity is 56&#x000b0;C, which is roughly 20&#x000b0;C to 30&#x000b0;C below its physiological temperature. This trend suggests that the rate for correct incorporation at its physiological temperature is over 9000 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Moreover, we observe a dramatic decrease of 18 900-fold in the rate for correct incorporation when the temperature decreases from 56&#x000b0;C to 2&#x000b0;C. Likewise, a 42&#x000b0;C decrease in temperature decreases the rate for incorrect incorporation 5000-fold and eliminates the observation of these events completely at 2&#x000b0;C under our assay conditions. These dramatic decreases are not due to protein denaturation based on the results from our CD spectroscopic analysis and stability assay (Supplementary Figures 2 and 3) but instead are a function of the rigid structure of Dpo4 at low and nonphysiological temperatures.</p><p>However, the increased conformational dynamics and decreased rigidity of Dpo4 at 56&#x000b0;C did not change the minimal mechanism for single nucleotide incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="S1">Scheme 1</xref>) which is analogous to that reported at 37&#x000b0;C and indicates Dpo4 still utilizes an induced-fit mechanism for the selection of correct nucleotides. Free Dpo4 and DNA associate with a second order rate constant of 2.8&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to form the Dpo4&#x02022;DNA binary complex. Once competently bound, free dNTP diffuses into the Dpo4 active site at an association rate constant assumed to be equivalent to diffusion control. Observation of the biphasic nature for correct incorporation from the burst experiment indicates that the slowest step in the overall reaction scheme occurs subsequent to the chemistry step and is due to DNA dissociation from the enzyme since the slow linear phase is quantitatively equivalent to our steady-state kinetic results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Further kinetic interrogation of the burst phase revealed several lines of evidence suggesting that the incorporation of a correct nucleotide was limited by a protein conformational change that preceded the chemistry step. First, we failed to observe an elemental effect for the incorporation of a correct dNTP analog containing a sulfur substitution at the &#x003b1;-phosphate position. This concept was originally proposed by Herschlag, Piccirilli, and Cech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) after observing that a rate-limiting chemical step involving the making or breaking of a phosphate bond in the hydrolysis of phosphate diesters shows a phosphorothioate elemental effect in the range of 4- to 11-fold. Although the elemental effect has been described as an unreliable diagnostic due to the possible steric clashes of the proposed pentacoordinated sulfur-containing intermediate with the enzyme, we believe that these studies may be relevant in the context of Dpo4, due to its significantly less restrictive active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) making it less likely to succumb to the steric effects that limit the reliability of this assay, or at least applicable to be used indirectly to probe whether or not the rate-limiting step is altered by reaction temperature. Secondly, using steady-state kinetics, we determined a significantly smaller DNA dissociation rate constant from a ternary complex formed in the presence of both ddTTP and dCTP (0.0028 &#x000b1; 0.0004 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) than form a ternary complex only in the presence of ddTTP (0.063 &#x000b1; 0.001 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). This observation provides evidence for the existence of two distinct ternary complexes with different affinities for DNA and suggests that the ternary complex in the presence of the next correct nucleotide (dCTP) undergoes certain changes in conformation to decrease its DNA dissociation rate constant while unable to perform the chemistry step. Finally, analysis of the reaction amplitudes of the pulse-quench/pulse-chase experiments have indicated that there exists a population of ternary complexes (E&#x02032;&#x02022;DNA<italic><sub>n</sub></italic>&#x02022;dNTP) that can proceed to product under chase conditions yet are not observed when quenched in the former assay. This provides direct evidence for the slow formation of an enzyme-bound ternary complex preceding the chemistry step as has been observed with T7 DNA polymerase (9), the Klenow fragment (11), HIV-RT (12) and pol&#x003b7; (13). The said conformational change was observed to occur at a rate of 189 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 56&#x000b0;C and was 30-fold faster than the proposed rate-limiting conformational change measured at 37&#x000b0;C. The argument for the nature of this rate-limiting conformational change was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) based on structural arguments and will not be discussed in detail here. In comparison to the corresponding rate constants gleaned at 37&#x000b0;C, all the rate constants determined at 56&#x000b0;C are faster (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). <table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Estimated kinetic constants of Dpo4</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Parameters</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Constants 37&#x000b0;C<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF3"><sup>a</sup></xref></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Constants 56&#x000b0;C</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.9 &#x003bc;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.8 &#x003bc;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>k</italic><sub>&#x02212;1</sub></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.02 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.10 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>K</italic><sub>d, DNA</sub></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.6 nM</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">39.9 nM</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 &#x003bc;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 &#x003bc;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>k</italic><sub>&#x02212;2</sub></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">23 000 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">38 300 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>K</italic><sub>d, dNTP</sub></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">230 &#x003bc;M</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">383 &#x003bc;M</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.4 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">189 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>k</italic><sub>8</sub></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.004 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0028 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TF3"><p><sup>a</sup>Results taken from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec><title>Activation energy</title><p>We would like to present additional evidence for the existence of a rate-limiting protein conformational change for Dpo4 using results from our dNTP concentration dependence studies described above.

In addition, Radhakrishnan and Schlick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>) used quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics dynamics simulations and quasi-harmonic free energy calculations to show that the rate-limiting chemistry step for correct incorporation catalyzed by DNA polymerase &#x003b2; occurred with a free energy of activation of 17 kcal/mol. Moreover, for uncatalyzed phosphodiester bond formation in solution, the <italic>E</italic><sub>a</sub> for its rate-limiting chemistry step is estimated to be 21.1 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). This value should be significantly lower when this rate-limiting chemical reaction occurs in an enzyme active site based on Pauling's transition state theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>) due to the likely stabilization of the ionic transition state from favorable interactions conferred from the enzyme. Our calculated <italic>E</italic><sub>a</sub> of 32.9 kcal/mol for the correct incorporation of dTTP into D-1 is considerably larger than that derived via these various simulation methods which each measured the <italic>E</italic><sub>a</sub> of the chemistry step and as such, suggests that <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub> (protein conformational change) rather than <italic>k</italic><sub>4</sub> (chemistry step) is limiting the correct nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by Dpo4. Although the precise nature of the proposed rate-limiting conformational change is unknown, this conclusion seems reasonable because even local structural rearrangements within an enzyme active site will involve movements of many chemical bonds and should have a relatively large activation energy. In addition, the large <italic>E</italic><sub>a</sub> reported here suggests that the structure of Dpo4 is rigid at low temperature and becomes more dynamic at higher temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>), leading to increasingly higher <italic>k</italic><sub>p</sub> values at more physiological temperatures (see above discussion). Moreover, our results above gleaned an elemental effect of 5.0 for the incorrect incorporation of dGTP into D-1 which lead us to suggest that the chemistry step limited incorrect nucleotide incorporation. Interestingly, we calculated an <italic>E</italic><sub>a</sub> of 24.2 kcal/mol for this incorrect incorporation which was close to the range of 12.3 to 21.1 kcal/mol estimated for a rate-limiting chemistry step (see above). Thus we propose that determination of <italic>E</italic><sub>a</sub> is a new mechanistic method of determining the rate-limiting step in a kinetic mechanism of DNA polymerase-catalyzed polymerization. <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Activation energy for correct nucleotide incorporation. The extracted <italic>k</italic><sub>p</sub> values were plotted as a function of reaction temperature according to Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M6">6</xref>) (Materials and Methods section) to yield an activation energy (<italic>E</italic><sub>a</sub>) of 32.9 kcal/mol.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn004f8"/></fig></p><p>In summary, we have probed the effects of reaction temperature on the fidelity and elementary steps of nucleotide incorporation into undamaged DNA catalyzed by a Y-family DNA polymerase. Our pre-steady state kinetic results reveal that Dpo4 uses an induced-fit mechanism to select correct nucleotides at 56&#x000b0;C. We also have shown that the overall fidelity remains unchanged over a range of 30&#x000b0;C, suggesting that the fidelity at 80&#x000b0;C will also be in the range of 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> to 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>. The direct implication of these results is that the conformational flexibility of Dpo4 does not impinge upon the faithfulness of Dpo4 to incorporate nucleotides into undamaged DNA at higher temperatures.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by the National Science Foundation Career Award to Z.S.
