Although current antithrombotic treatment is generally well tolerated and effective, many patients still experience cardiovascular problems, which may reflect the existence of alternative underlying regulatory mechanisms in platelets to those targeted by existing drugs. In this study, we define a role for peripherally distributed members of the tachykinin family of peptides, namely substance P and the newly discovered endokinins A and B that are present in platelets, in the activation of platelet function and thrombus formation. We have reported previously that the preferred pharmacologically characterized receptor for these peptides, the NK1 receptor, is present on platelets. Inhibition or deficiency of the NK1 receptor, or SP agonist activity, resulted in substantially reduced thrombus formation in vitro under arterial flow conditions, increased bleeding time in mice, and a decrease in experimentally induced thromboembolism. Inhibition of the NK1 receptor may therefore provide benefit in patients vulnerable to thrombosis and may offer an alternative therapeutic target.</p></abstract><contract-sponsor id="CS200" xlink:href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tissue damage results in the local exposure, generation, or release of factors such as collagen and thrombin that trigger the function of platelets, and thereby initiate hemostasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref></sup> Through the function of multiple cell adhesion and signaling receptors, platelets become entrapped at the injury site and become activated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup> This leads ultimately to the up-regulation in affinity of the integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> which, through binding ligands that include fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor, support the formation of a stable platelet thrombus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></sup> Effective thrombus formation in the arterial circulation is dependent on the secretion and release of factors such as ADP and thromboxane (TX) A<sub>2</sub> from activated platelets, which through binding G protein&#x02013;coupled receptors on the platelet surface, stimulate positive feedback activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup></p><p>Roles in thrombus formation have been discovered for a number of newly identified regulatory molecules, including gas6,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup> CD40L,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref></sup> semaphorin 3A,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref></sup> semaphorin 4D,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></sup> and ephrins/eph kinases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref></sup> We recently demonstrated that substance P (SP), a member of the tachykinin family, may also contribute to platelet regulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></sup> We showed that SP can stimulate activation and aggregation of platelets and that platelets contain SP immunoreactivity that is released upon activation.</p><p>Tachykinins are a family of peptides characterized by the conserved C-terminal motif Phe-X-Gly-Leu-Met-NH<sub>2</sub> (X is hydrophobic),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref></sup> which is central to their biological activity. Originally classified as neurotransmitters, this family of peptides comprising substance P, neurokinin A (NKA), and neurokinin B (NKB) mediates a variety of peripheral biological functions, including smooth muscle contraction, vasodilatation, plasma extravasation, neurogenic inflammation, and hematopoiesis, and there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that they may mediate their actions through endocrine/paracrine modes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref></sup> The secretion of NKB by the placenta and the SP-like immunoreactivity released by platelets upon activation (and the observation that synthetic substance P can stimulate aggregation) are 2 such examples.

It was also able to liberate arachidonic acid from platelet membranes, promoting the synthesis of the platelet agonist TXA<sub>2</sub>. Typical of other weak platelet agonists, EKA/B was capable of synergism with other agonists. It has been demonstrated that for platelet aggregation to occur, costimulation of both G<sub>i</sub> and G<sub>q</sub> signaling pathways is required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref></sup> Purinergic receptors P2Y<sub>1</sub> and P2Y<sub>12</sub> are coupled to G<sub>q</sub> and G<sub>i</sub> signaling pathways, respectively. Inhibition of either of these abolishes aggregation, which can be recovered by stimulation of an alternative receptor coupled to the inhibited pathway. The range of agonists with which EKA/B (and SP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></sup>) synergize are coupled to a variety of signaling pathways. It is therefore likely that the synergy achieved by costimulation with this peptide was in part through the effects of secondary agonists. This correlates with the significant increase in dense granule secretion upon stimulation with 1.25 &#x003bc;M EKA/B observed in this study.</p><p>The involvement of NK1 receptors on platelets on the responses of these cells to SP and EKA/B was confirmed through the use of a selective NK1 receptor antagonist that was able to reduce substantially platelet aggregation. Signaling downstream of the NK1 receptor is potentially complex with possible contributions from a range of G proteins. Experiments carried out in this study illustrate that in platelets the NK1 receptor couples to G<sub>q</sub>.</p><p>This study confirms the ability of NK1 receptor agonists SP and EKA/B to regulate platelet function. Furthermore, NK1 receptor&#x02013;blocking antibodies inhibit platelet responses to collagen,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></sup> indicating that NK1 agonists are released from activated platelets and act as paracrine agonists.</p><p>Due to the inability of existing antibodies or assays to distinguish between SP and EKA/B, it was initially unclear whether platelets secrete SP, EKA and EKB, or each of these. Antibodies were therefore raised to a peptide sequence that is present in endokinins A and B that lies upstream of the decapeptide that was used to stimulate platelet function and is therefore not shared with SP, and is unique to <italic>TAC4</italic> gene products. Immunofluorescence experiments demonatrated the presence of <italic>TAC4</italic>-derived peptides in these cells. These are the first experiments that confirm that the human <italic>TAC4</italic> gene is functional and that its products are translated in peripheral tissues. Furthermore, this indicates a potential role, along with SP, in the regulation of hemostasis. It is interesting to note that the <italic>TAC4</italic> gene is not well conserved across species, which is suggestive that this gene is evolving rapidly in humans and perhaps is selected for platelet activation.</p><p>The importance of the peripheral tachykinins for thrombus formation was demonstrated on immobilized collagen under arterial flow conditions, which was reduced in the presence of NK1 receptor antagonist L733060. Moreover, whole blood taken from NK1-deficient mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref></sup> produced markedly smaller thrombi compared with blood from control mice. These data illustrate a role for the NK1 receptor in thrombus formation and suggest that NK1 agonists are present in platelets and released upon activation, and at sufficiently high concentrations, act as positive feedback regulators.</p><p>Blood obtained from TAC1-deficient mice produced significantly smaller thrombi than blood obtained from litter-matched control mice. This reduction was comparable with that seen in blood obtained from NK1 receptor&#x02013;deficient mice, suggesting that physiologically, SP is a major NK1 agonist responsible for amplifying the platelet response through the NK1 receptor. The relatively high concentrations of NK1 receptor agonists required to stimulate platelet signaling indicate that concentrations in the vicinity of a developing thrombus are likely to be similarly high, although our data suggest that synergism with other agonists is also critical. Given the presence of EKA/B in platelets, it is likely that they also contribute to thrombus formation through the stimulation of NK1 signaling, although the future development of endokinin-specific immunoassays will be necessary to measure the levels secreted from platelets.</p><p>To examine the contribution of peripheral tachykinins and NK1 receptor signaling to hemostasis, tail bleeding assays were performed. Bleeding was prolonged moderately in NK1 receptor&#x02013;deficient mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref></sup> in comparison with littermate controls, with some mice bleeding beyond the 10-minute duration of the assay.

This is interesting, since it is indicative of redundancy, highlighting the potential involvement of <italic>TAC4</italic> gene products (HK-1 in mice, EKA/B in humans).</p><p>Since these data implicate tachykinin signaling in the control of hemostasis, we have begun to assess contribution of the NK1 receptor to thrombosis using a thromboembolic model in mice. The administration of an NK1 receptor antagonist to mice resulted in a 30% reduction in the embolic response compared with infusion of vehicle alone. While it will be important in the future to examine the role of the NK1 receptor and the peripheral tachykinins in thrombosis using additional experimental models in vivo, the results of this study indicate that the inhibition of the actions of tachykinins may provide a new therapeutic approach for the prevention of thrombosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Figures]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="blood_blood-2007-07-103424_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="blood_blood-2007-07-103424_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="blood_blood-2007-07-103424_2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>An Inside <italic>Blood</italic> analysis of this article appears at the front of this issue.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>The online version of this article contains a data supplement.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment.
