While characterizing epigenetic marks over the DMD, we observed that DNA and H3K27 trimethylation are mutually exclusive, with DNA and H3K27 methylation limited to the paternal and maternal sequences, respectively. The mutual exclusion arises because one mark prevents placement of the other. We demonstrated this in five ways: using 5-azacytidine treatments and mutations at the endogenous locus that disrupt DNA methylation; using a transgenic model in which the maternal DMD inappropriately acquired DNA methylation; and by analyzing materials from cells and embryos lacking SUZ12 and YY1. SUZ12 is part of the PRC2 complex, which is needed for placing H3K27me3, and YY1 recruits PRC2 to sites of action. Results from each experimental system consistently demonstrated antagonism between H3K27me3 and DNA methylation. When DNA methylation was lost, H3K27me3 encroached into sites where it had not been before; inappropriate acquisition of DNA methylation excluded normal placement of H3K27me3, and loss of factors needed for H3K27 methylation enabled DNA methylation to appear where it had been excluded. These data reveal the previously unknown antagonism between H3K27 and DNA methylation and identify a means by which epigenetic states may change during disease and development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Methylation of DNA and histones exert profound and inherited effects on gene expression. These occur without changes to the underlying DNA sequence and are considered epigenetic effects. Disrupting epigenetic states can cause developmental abnormalities and cancer. Very little is known about how locations in the mammalian genome are chosen to receive these chemical modifications, or how their placement is regulated. We have identified a DNA sequence that acts as a methylation programmer at the <italic>Rasgrf1</italic> locus in mice. It is required for methylation of nearby DNA sequences and can also influence the levels of local histone methylation. The methylation programmer has different effects on paternally and maternally derived chromosomes, directing DNA methylation on the paternal allele and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation on the maternal allele. These two methylation marks are not only mutually exclusive; they are also mutually antagonizing, whereby one blocks the placement of the other. Manipulations that cause aberrant changes in the levels of one of these marks had the opposite effect on the other mark. These observations identify novel mechanisms that specify epigenetic states <italic>in vivo</italic> and provide a framework for understanding how pathological epigenetic changes can arise, including those emerging at tumor suppressors during carcinogenesis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In mammals, imprinted loci are expressed from only one allele.

Within this region, there is a <underline>d</underline>ifferentially <underline>m</underline>ethylated <underline>d</underline>omain (DMD) that is subject to acquisition of epigenetic modifications, typically DNA methylation and histone modifications. These modifications are placed in a parent-of-origin specific manner and impose an epigenetic state that dictates allele-specific gene expression at imprinted loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000145-Edwards1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Previously, we characterized the mechanisms by which the ICR controls allele-specific methylation and expression at the imprinted <italic>Rasgrf1</italic> locus. The ICR, located 30 kbp upstream of the transcriptional start site, is a binary switch consisting of a repeated element and the DMD. The repeated element functions as a methylation programmer, that is necessary for the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation at the DMD on the paternal allele and sufficient for establishing gametic imprints in both germlines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000145-Yoon1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000145-Holmes1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and YJP, HH, AML, Ying Gao and PDS, in preparation). The DMD is a methylation sensitive enhancer blocker that binds CTCF on the unmethylated maternal allele and limits enhancer to promoter interactions, silencing the maternal allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000145-Yoon2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. DNA methylation that is directed to the paternal DMD by the repeats prevents CTCF binding, allowing expression of the paternal allele.

It is unclear if and how the primary DNA sequence controls each of these parent-specific marks. We have identified the DNA sequences that are necessary and sufficient for programming the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation on the paternal allele, however, nothing is known about the <italic>cis</italic>-acting DNA sequences that control placement of repressive histone modifications in this region, or whether there is any coordination between the histone and DNA methylation modifications. In many organisms, distinct epigenetic marks coordinately determine the transcriptional status of genes. For instance, recruitment of DNA methylation can depend upon pre-established histone H3 methylation at lysine 9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000145-Tamaru1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000145-Lehnertz1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>; histone modifications can be lost when DNA methylation is impaired <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000145-Espada1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>; and some histone modifications become redistributed in histone methyltransferase mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000145-Peters1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here we report the analysis of a 12 kbp region at <italic>Rasgrf1</italic> for locations bearing histone modifications and DNA methylation.

Furthermore, by experimentally manipulating the levels of DNA and H3K27 methylation possible at the locus, we demonstrate that these two marks are mutually antagonistic, whereby the placement of one mark prevents the placement of the other, and removal of one mark allows the encroachment of the other. Additionally, we found that the tandem repeat sequences, which are necessary and sufficient for programming DNA methylation marks, are also important for directing H3K27 and H3K9 modifications to the proximal DMD and that H3K9 methylation is needed for optimum establishment of DNA methylation on the paternal allele.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The <italic>Rasgrf1</italic> Repeats Program DNA Methylation Only at the 400 nt DMD in the Male Germline</title><p>There are two regions rich in C and G residues and CpG dinucleotides over a 200 kbp interval at the <italic>Rasgrf1</italic> locus.

Our analysis of methylation in the soma used DNA from neonatal brain and our analysis in the male germline used DNA isolated from sperm. Somatic DNAs were from F1 progeny of 129S4Jae and PWK strains. Polymorphisms between these strains allowed us to determine which bisulfite sequences were from the maternal and paternal alleles in the soma. The 129S4Jae-derived allele was either wild type or lacked the <italic>Rasgrf1</italic> tandem repeats constituting the DNA methylation programmer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000145-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Sperm DNAs were from mice homozygous for wild type or tandem repeat-deficient alleles of <italic>Rasgrf1</italic>. Our characterization of the somatic methylation states from animals carrying the wild type 129S4Jae allele was in strong agreement with the results of Kobayashi, even though sources of somatic DNAs differed: Kobayashi used midgestation embryos. In neonatal brain DNA, we detected paternal allele-specific DNA methylation, which covers at least the 7.6 kbp interval between segments D4 through D7 and includes the ICR. We also found a region of methylation on both alleles over a 1.4 kbp interval upstream of the ICR containing segments D1 and D2. None of the somatic DNA methylation patterns changed on either the paternal or maternal alleles in mice harboring a deletion of the tandem repeats on the maternal allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000145-g002">Figure 2C, D</xref>).

In mice with the intact repeats, we found that <italic>Rasgrf1</italic> methylation in sperm DNA was present not only the originally defined 400 bp DMD, but it extended an additional 1.6 kbp upstream, in agreement with results from Hisato Kobayashi and Hiroyuki Sasaki (unpublished).

Specifically, we sought to determine where histone modifications were distributed, if any modifications were allele-specific, if their placement required the same DNA methylation programmer that imprinted DNA methylation requires, and if there is any coordination between modification states on histones and DNA. We limited our analysis to di-, and tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 and 27 because they are associated with gene silencing and DNA methylation, which are observed at the maternal and paternal alleles respectively. For this analysis, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and antibodies specific to H3K9me2, H3K9me3, H3K27me2, and H3K27me3. Our initial tests were controls to verify that the antibodies detected histone modifications with proper specificity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000145.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

We did this by repeating the ChIP analysis using MEFs carrying a deletion of the repeats (Rep&#x00394;) and amplifying the wild type allele and the mutated allele separately. Our analysis showed that the repeat element indeed has a significant influence of histone modification status at the DMD, in addition to controlling its DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000145-g004">Figure 4D</xref>): When the repeats were absent from the maternal allele, the levels of maternal allele-specific H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 were respectively 1/2 and 1/6<sup>th</sup> the levels seen when the repeats were present. Similarly, when the repeats were absent from the paternal allele, the level of paternal allele-specific H3K9me3 was 1/3<sup>rd</sup> that seen when the methylation programmer was absent. Interestingly, deletion of the repeats from the paternal allele led to a three-fold increase in the accumulation of H3K27me3 on the paternal allele. This is consistent with our locus wide ChIP analysis spanning intervals C1 to C6, which suggested H3K27me3 can encroach into areas where it is normally absent, both 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; of the DMD, when the paternal repeats are deleted (see sites C2, C5, C6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000145-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

In one scenario, the two marks may be placed in different compartments of the nucleus and the DNA cannot reside in both places. Alternatively, distinct factors needed for H3K27me3 and DNA methylation may require the same DNA binding site, which cannot be simultaneously occupied by the two sets of factors. A third possibility is that DNA and H3K27 methylation are mutually antagonizing, whereby one inhibits placement of the other. This last possibility is mechanistically different from mere mutual exclusion. If antagonism between these two marks is occurring, then we can predict what happens to one mark if the other is experimentally manipulated.</p><p>In order to explore more directly the possible antagonism between DNA methylation and H3K27me3, we repeated our allele-specific ChIP studies using MEFs that had been treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine. If DNA methylation can antagonize H3K27 methylation, then we expected that 5-azacytidine treatments should increase the levels of H3K27me3 at the DMD as assayed by ChIP. This is precisely what we observed. 5-azacytidine treatments increased the signals from our ChIP analysis by more than six fold when we assayed H3K27me3 on the two parental alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000145-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Although the maternal allele lacks imprinted DNA methylation, there is DNA methylation at sites D1, D2 and D8.

To test this, we took advantage of a transgenic system we developed to test if the tandem repeats, which are necessary for programming DNA methylation at <italic>Rasgrf1</italic>, are sufficient to impart imprinted methylation to the DMD at an ectopic location in the genome. Independent transgenic founders harboring three to five ectopic copies of the <italic>Rasgrf1</italic> ICR underwent proper establishment of DNA methylation at the transgenic DMD in the male germline and erasure of that methylation in the female germline, recapitulating the essential features of imprinted methylation establishment seen at the endogenous locus (YJP, HH, AML, Ying Gao and PDS in preparation). We were able to distinguish the transgenic ICR from the endogenous copy because the transgenic repeats were flanked with loxP sites and had the same structure as the WT-flox allele shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000145-g002">Figure 2A</xref>. This allowed us to assay DNA methylation and perform ChIP analysis of the transgene. The transgene was useful for the studies we describe here because the unmethylated state that was established on the transgene after female transmission could not be maintained if there was any history in the pedigree of transmission through a male (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000145-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). This system of transgenerational epigenetic memory allowed us to generate two different sets of MEFs, both of which were derived by maternal transmission of the transgene from a common founder. For one set of MEFs, the transgene was unmethylated at the transgenic DMD, whereas in the second set, the same transgene was methylated on the DMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000145-g005">Figure 5B, upper two panels</xref>). If there is antagonism between H3K27me3 and DNA methylation at <italic>Rasgrf1</italic>, then we predicted our MEFs with a methylated transgene should exclude H3K27me3, whereas our MEFs with an unmethylated transgene should allow its placement. This is also precisely what we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000145-g005">Figure 5B, lower panel</xref>), providing additional independent evidence that DNA methylation antagonizes placement of H3K27me3.</p><p>We next wondered if the antagonism between DNA methylation and H3K27me3 might be reciprocal, meaning; H3K27me3 is able to exclude DNA methylation.

Because DNA methylation at the <italic>Rasgrf1</italic> DMD is normally restricted to the paternal allele, which is completely methylated, any increase in DNA methylation would arise on the maternal allele. To monitor the level of <italic>Rasgrf1</italic> DMD methylation in SUZ12- and YY1-deficient materials, we used COBRA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000145-Xiong1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. This involved treating DNAs with bisulfite and amplifying them using primers not overlapping with CpG dinucleotides, which will amplify templates without bias for either methylation state. We then digested the PCR products with <italic>BstUI</italic>. Methylated templates will retain the <italic>BstUI</italic> recognition site (CGCG) after amplification and will be digested, whereas unmethylated templates that underwent bisulfite conversion of either CG in the recognition site to TG will resist digestion. There should be an equal amount of digested and undigested PCR product when the maternal allele is completely unmethylated and the paternal allele is completely methylated. This is what we saw in embryoid bodies and blastocysts that were heterozygous respectively for the <italic>Suz12</italic> and <italic>Yy1</italic> mutations.

When we performed COBRA analysis on SUZ12-deficient embryoid bodies (EB) that had differentiated for six (P6) or nine (P9) days <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000145-g006">Figure 6A, B</xref>) or on trophoblast outgrowths from YY1-deficient blastocysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000145-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), we found a dramatic increase in the levels of the digested PCR product in three out of four samples of <italic>Suz12</italic> &#x02212;/&#x02212; material and in the <italic>Yy1</italic> &#x02212;/&#x02212; material, indicating that loss of SUZ12 or YY1 resulted in increased <italic>Rasgrf1</italic> DMD methylation. The near complete acquisition of DNA methylation in P9 EB lacking SUZ12 was confirmed by bisulfite sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000145-g006">Figure 6B lower panel</xref>), whereas unmethylated DNA was present in EB with a single functional allele of <italic>Suz12</italic>, though it is possible there is a quantitative increase in <italic>Rasgrf1</italic> DNA methylation when only one functional copy of <italic>Suz12</italic> is present. We do not know why only three out of four of the <italic>Suz12</italic> &#x02212;/&#x02212; DNAs show hypermethylation.

Paternal allele DNA methylation was particularly sensitive to these tandem repeats, which control establishment of DNA methylation in the male germline at a 400 nt core DMD lying just 5&#x02032; of the repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000145-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000145-Yoon1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>). The repeats also control spreading and maintenance of paternal allele DNA methylation in somatic tissue over a broader domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000145-g002">Figure 2B, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000145-Holmes1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>Marking the core DMD with DNA methylation on the paternal allele and H3K27me3 on the maternal allele are coordinated and mutually exclusive events in wild type cells with DNA methylation largely confined to the core DMD on the paternal allele and H3K27me3 on the maternal allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000145-g002">Figures 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000145-g003">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000145-g004">4</xref>). The mutual exclusion arises because one epigenetic mark antagonizes the placement of the other. Five independent lines of evidence led to this conclusion. First, MEFs taken from mice lacking DNA methylation on the paternal DMD inappropriately accumulated H3K27me3 on the paternal allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000145-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Second, MEFs treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-azacytidine, accumulate elevated levels of H3K27me3 marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000145-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Third, MEFs taken from mice with a maternally transmitted <italic>Rasgrf1</italic> ICR transgene that lacked DNA methylation had H3K27me3 on the transgenic DMD, whereas H3K27me3 was excluded by manipulations that inappropriately placed DNA methylation on the transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000145-g005">Figure 5B, lower panel</xref>). Fourth, mutation of the <italic>Suz12</italic> component of PRC2, which is needed for activity of the EZH2 H3K27 methyltransferase in PRC2, ablated normal placement of H3K27me3 and enabled the maternal allele to inappropriately acquire DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000145-g006">Figure 6A, B</xref>). Fifth, mutation of the <italic>Yy1</italic> gene, which is needed to recruit PRC2 to DNA and, like <italic>Suz12</italic>, is needed for effective placement of H3K27me3 also enabled the maternal allele to inappropriately acquire DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000145-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).

The studies described here provide evidence that H3K27me3 and DNA methylation are in fact mutually antagonizing epigenetic marks and that H3K27me3 facilitates allele-specific DNA methylation that exists at imprinted loci.</p><p>H3K9me3 was detected on both parental alleles indicating this mark is controlled differently from H3K27me3. However, it too participates in imprinted DNA methylation because the H3K9 methyltransferases, SUV39H1 and SUV39H2, are needed for optimal establishment of DNA methylation at the DMD in the male germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000145-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>We do not know how DNA and H3K27 methylation antagonize each other's placement; however, the literature highlights several molecular and developmental events, as well as protein factors that may be involved. Among these is the transcriptional state that is known to influence which of two mutually exclusive histone modifications is placed by the competing activities of polycomb (PcG) and trithorax (Trx) group proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000145-Papp1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

This raises the possibility that, in addition to its role in preventing DNA methylation at other imprinted loci, CTCF helps to place H3K27me3 at <italic>Rasgrf1</italic>.

Using ChIP analysis, we could not detect CHD8 on either <italic>Rasgrf1</italic> allele (data not shown), suggesting that at <italic>Rasgrf1</italic>, other CTCF binding partners and functions might be more important, such as YY1.</p><p>Normal placement of DNA methylation on the paternal allele and H3K27me3 on the maternal allele both require the same tandemly repeated DNA sequence element, which we previously showed has DNA methylation programming activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000145-Yoon1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000145-Holmes1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and YJP, HH and PDS unpublished). However, DNA methylation is more rigidly dependent on the repeated sequence than are the histone modifications. Whereas DNA methylation on the paternal core DMD was typically completely lost when the repeats were deleted, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 on the maternal DMD were respectively reduced to levels only 1/2 and 1/6 of those seen when the repeats were present. Repeated sequences have been shown to have methylation programming activity in other systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000145-Reinhart1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000145-Chan1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>.

Note that no polymorphisms were present in D3 and D6 so allele specific methylation was not determined (nd) in neonatal brain DNA from F1 mice in those regions.</p><p>(0.08 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000145.s006.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000145.s007"><label>Table S3</label><caption><p>Enhanced colocalization of CTCF and H3K27me3 at imprinted loci. Whole genome H3K27me3 ChIP data for imprinted and known genes in MEF cells were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/seq_platform/chip/">http://www.broad.mit.edu/seq_platform/chip/</ext-link> and experimentally verified CTCF site data were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://insulatordb.utmem.edu/browse.php">http://insulatordb.utmem.edu/browse.php</ext-link>. After filtering the H3K27me3 ChIP data for sites with a read score of two or higher, the data sets were added as custom tracks on the UCSC Genome Browser and intersected in the intervals spanning 17,553 known genes and 53 imprinted gene regions. The intervals examined included the 100 kb 5&#x02032; of each gene (&#x0002b;100), sequences between the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of the genes (G), 100 kb 3&#x02032; of the genes (&#x02212;100), and the entire stretch from 100 kb 5&#x02032; to 100 kb 3&#x02032; of each gene region (&#x0002b;100 to 100). The number of times H3K27me3 colocalized with CTCF in the indicated intervals is reported. The frequency of colocalization per kb was calculated for each interval examined, and the values for each of the known gene intervals were used to calculate an expected value for the corresponding imprinted gene intervals, given the total number of kbp in each of the imprinted gene intervals examined. The number of observed and expected colocalizations in the imprinted intervals was then used in Chi-square analysis.</p><p>(0.06 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000145.s007.doc"
