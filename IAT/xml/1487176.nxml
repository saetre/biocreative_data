LTA is expressed in atherosclerotic plaques and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CHD). Polymorphisms in the gene encoding lymphotoxin-&#x003b1; <italic>(LTA)</italic> on Chromosome 6p21 have been associated with susceptibility to CHD, but results in different studies appear to be conflicting. We examined the association of seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the <italic>LTA</italic> gene, and their related haplotypes, with risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in the International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS) case-control study involving 6,928 non-fatal MI cases and 2,712 unrelated controls. The seven SNPs (including the rs909253 and rs1041981 SNPs previously implicated in the risk of CHD) were in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other and contributed to six common haplotypes. Some of the haplotypes for <italic>LTA</italic> were associated with higher plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.004) and lower concentrations of albumin (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.023). However, none of the SNPs or related haplotypes were significantly associated with risk of MI. The results of the ISIS study were considered in the context of six previously published studies that had assessed this association, and this meta-analysis found no significant association with CHD risk using a recessive model and only a modest association using a dominant model (with narrow confidence intervals around these risk estimates). Overall, these studies provide reliable evidence that these common polymorphisms for the <italic>LTA</italic> gene are not strongly associated with susceptibility to coronary disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Lymphotoxin-&#x003b1; gene <italic>(LTA)</italic> encodes a cytokine involved in the immune system that has been linked with risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). In one of the first genome-wide association studies, a Japanese group reported that polymorphisms for the <italic>LTA</italic> gene were associated with a 1.8-fold higher risk of CHD. The authors of this current paper examined associations of several polymorphisms for the <italic>LTA</italic> gene with risk of CHD in a case-control study of 6,928 heart attack survivors and 2,712 unrelated controls in the United Kingdom. None of the polymorphisms for <italic>LTA</italic> (including those examined in the original Japanese study) were associated with CHD risk. Moreover, a meta-analysis of all published studies found no significant association of <italic>LTA</italic> with CHD risk. These findings emphasize the need for large-scale studies to have sufficient power to detect associations of genetic variants with CHD risk and the need for replication of any such associations in independent studies of even larger size.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Clarke R, Xu P, Bennett D, Lewington S, Zondervan K, et al.

The recruitment procedure used for controls in the ISIS case-control study (involving spouses of siblings and their children: see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) should have minimised the risk of population admixture between controls and cases. The seven SNPs studied included three that had been previously been reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020107-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;, as well as others identified by resequencing to be in high LD with each other (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), and covered a genomic region of about 1 kb in the <italic>LTA</italic> gene. The ISIS case-control study found no significant association of MI risk with any of these individual SNPs or with any of the six common haplotypes studied (including those associated with significantly higher plasma concentrations of CRP and albumin).</p><p>The present findings differ from those of the hypothesis-generating study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020107-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d; which reported that, in a recessive model, the SNPs rs909253 and rs1800683 in the <italic>LTA</italic> gene were associated with odds ratios for MI of 1.71 (95&#x00025; CI: 1.24&#x02013;2.36) and 1.78 (95&#x00025; CI: 1.39&#x02013;2.27), respectively. That study used a two-stage design in which 65,671 genetic markers in 13,738 genes were initially screened in 94 MI cases and 658 controls, and then the 1&#x00025; of markers that appeared most strongly associated with MI were re-examined in a further 1,133 MI cases and 1,006 controls. In that study, a third SNP in <italic>LTA</italic> (rs1041981) also appeared to be associated with risk of MI with an odds ratio of 1.78 (95&#x00025; CI: 1.39&#x02013;2.27) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020107-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. It is possible that those results represented false-positive results identified among the relatively small number of cases. Alternatively, it may reflect an imbalance in the control population which was selected from several different population sources, since significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were observed in the genotype distributions in case and control samples in the Ozaki et al. study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020107-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d; (possibly indicating population stratification) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020107-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;.

In principle, a study design involving the use of trios should eliminate the potential risk of population admixture that may occur in unrelated case-control studies. However, the apparent association in PROCARDIS could still reflect the play of chance in a study involving relatively small numbers of diseased cases. A subsequent larger, trio family study of 671 UK families reported no significant association of rs1041981 with risk of MI &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020107-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>An alternative explanation for these apparently discrepant findings might be that none of the SNPs in the <italic>LTA</italic> gene studied by Ozaki et al. is causally associated with MI, but are instead in high LD with some other SNP which is present in higher frequency in Japanese than in populations of European descent &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020107-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;.

However, the absence of an association in a large Japanese population by Yamada et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020107-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d; and in another large UK trio family study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020107-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d; does not support this alternative hypothesis. The ISIS study had more than 90&#x00025; power to detect a 10&#x00025; higher risk of MI associated with rs909253 and rs1041981 SNPs for the <italic>LTA</italic> gene (assuming an allele frequency of about 0.35) using co-dominant or recessive genetic models. The selection of controls in the ISIS study from spouses of siblings or spouses of children, together with the very small proportion of participants of non&#x02013;European descent in this study would indicate that the risk of population stratification is small.</p><p>A major problem in genetic association studies has been the high proportion of false-positive results suggested by studies involving relatively small numbers of diseased cases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020107-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020107-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;.

The apparent discrepancy between the results of studies of <italic>LTA</italic> and CHD risk reinforces the need for studies involving larger numbers of disease cases, unrelated controls selected from the same population as the cases, and genotyping of markers that provide good coverage of the gene of interest. The ISIS case-control study of nearly 7,000 cases with MI before age 65 y and of family-based controls, considered in the context of previously reported studies of this association, provides reliable evidence that these common polymorphisms for the <italic>LTA</italic> gene are not strongly associated with susceptibility to coronary disease. The present study cannot exclude the possibility of involvement of other variants near the <italic>LTA</italic> gene (e.g., in more distal regulatory regions), which were not considered.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Study population.</title><p>The design of the ISIS case-control study has been described in detail in previous publications &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020107-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020107-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.
