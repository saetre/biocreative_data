The accumulation of the misfolded protein and the associated extensive neuronal cell loss result in degenerative alterations of the brain as represented by an extensive vacuolation. This is characteristic for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) in human and animals. The neuronal cell death in prion disease was described as an apoptotic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hetz <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Cronier <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). However, the signal pathway from the recognition of the pathological agent by the host cell to the nuclear events preceding cell death is not completely understood. The activation of the effector caspase-3 represents a main event in apoptotic processes. This can occur directly upon auto-processing of caspase-8 to its active form after recruitment of death receptors. Another, indirect pathway involves the release of death-promoting factors like cytochrome <italic>c</italic> from the mitochondria. Here, the Bcl-2 family of proteins contains positive (Bax, Bak, Bcl-x<sub>s</sub>, Bad, Bid) and negative regulators (Bcl-2, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, Bcl-w) of apoptosis at the mitochondrial level. Both pathways have been described in neurodestructive processes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Polster and Fiskum, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B plays a central role in the regulation of a large variety of cellular events. Apart from its function as regulator of the expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, immunoreceptors and adhesion molecules, it influences apoptosis in several cell types (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Pahl, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Karin and Lin, 2002</xref>). Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) represents dimeric transcription factors that belong to the Rel family, which encompass five members: NF-&#x003ba;B1 (p105/p50), NF-&#x003ba;B2 (p100/p52), RelA (p65), RelB and c-Rel. Dimers containing RelA, RelB or c-Rel are transcriptional activators whereas homodimers of p50 and p52, which are devoid of a transcription activation domain, function as repressors. In non-stimulated cells, NF-&#x003ba;B is sequestered in an inactive form in the cytoplasm by the inhibitor of kappaB (I&#x003ba;B). After successive phosphorylation and degradation of I&#x003ba;B, NF-&#x003ba;B translocates to the nucleus and exerts its biological function (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bonizzi and Karin, 2004</xref>). In the brain NF-&#x003ba;B is an important regulator of biochemical and molecular cascades that can either prevent cell death and promote neuronal plasticity or induce apoptosis. NF-&#x003ba;B is activated by various intercellular signals including cytokines, neurotrophic factors and neurotransmitters. Depending on the cell type the same signal can either induce or prevent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Mattson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). In addition, alteration of NF-&#x003ba;B activity may represent an important mechanism for inducing or enhancing apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Barkett <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Mattson <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). Concerning neuronal cell death, considerable evidence has been presented that NF-&#x003ba;B induces the expression of anti-apoptotic gene products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Mattson <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bhakar <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). NF-&#x003ba;B was proposed to protect neurons temporarily from the amyloid &#x003b2;-mediated apoptosis leading to neurodegeneration during Alzheimer's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Kaltschmidt <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). Nevertheless, in a mouse model of stroke NF-&#x003ba;B activation enhances neuronal death, where the activation of IKK plays an essential role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Herrmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). In prion diseases very little is known on the role of NF-&#x003ba;B concerning neuropathology. An enhanced NF-&#x003ba;B activity has been described in the brain of scrapie-infected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, the synthetic peptide of the prion protein PrP 106&#x02013;126 activates NF-&#x003ba;B in microglial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Fabrizi <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). In order to elucidate the role of NF-&#x003ba;B in prion infection, we addressed the question whether NF-&#x003ba;B activity is altered after acute infection with the pathological prion protein in a neuroblastoma cell line (Bos2 cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bosque and Prusiner, 2000</xref>), and in the mouse model of prion infection. In particular, we were interested in the mechanism of neuronal cell death early after infection with the pathological prion protein. We found an enhanced NF-&#x003ba;B binding activity in infected Bos2 cells, whereas no activation of a NF-&#x003ba;B reporter was observed. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate an involvement of mitochondria in apoptosis induced early after prion infection. In order to generalize our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, we also investigated the role of NF-&#x003ba;B <italic>in vivo</italic> after prion infection of <italic>Nfkb1</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup>, <italic>Nfkb2</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> and <italic>Bcl3</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice and a mouse strain, where p65 (RelA) was deleted in the central nervous system (CNS). After intracerebral infection, the <italic>Nfkb2</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> and <italic>Bcl3</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> animals appeared to be more sensitive to prion infection and died at an earlier time point compared with wild-type control mice. We hypothesize a loss of protective function of NF-&#x003ba;B in the context of prion disease and propose a possible mechanism where anti-apoptotic genes like <italic>Bclx</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> are downregulated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>NF-&#x003ba;B binding but no transcriptional activity induced by PrP<sup>Sc</sup></title><p>The highly PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-susceptible subclone of the N2A neuroblastoma cell line (Bos2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bosque and Prusiner, 2000</xref>) was used for infection with PrP<sup>Sc</sup> scrapie strain RML6. Our study was focused on the use of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> from mouse brain. Therefore, a 0.2% brain homogenate of terminally sick PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-infected CD1 mice were used for infection. As controls, cells were treated with a non-infected brain homogenate (CD1) with equal concentrations. The dilution of brain homogenate used for either <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> infection was improbably sufficient to induce an unspecific response mediated by factors present in the brain (e.g. cytokines) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Brown <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). After acute PrP<sup>Sc</sup> inoculation of Bos2 cells infection was controlled by cell blot technique as described in <italic>Experimental procedures</italic> for each experiment (data not shown). To determine DNA binding activity of NF-&#x003ba;B after prion infection, the cell nuclei of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-infected and control cells were isolated and tested in an electromobility shift assay (EMSA). An increase of NF-&#x003ba;B binding was found as early as 1 day after incubation with RML6 compared with cells treated with non-infected brain homogenate and compared with untreated Bos2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). Enhanced NF-&#x003ba;B binding was also found after tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; treatment. This DNA/protein complex disappeared after competition with a 50-fold excess of non-radioactive NF-&#x003ba;B/DNA probe but not with a mutant probe. This control demonstrates the specificity of the signal on the autoradiography. Taken together, these results indicate that RML6 infection induces NF-&#x003ba;B binding activity in Bos2 cells above background levels of normal brain homogenate.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>No transcriptional NF-&#x003ba;B activity after PrP<sup>Sc</sup> infection.

The precipitates from either untreated controls, TNF-treated or RML6-infected Bos2 cells were divided and analysed in Western blots for the presence of the various NF-&#x003ba;B subunits. The immunoblot was quantified by scanning densitometry. The total signal intensities (p65 + p50, +p52 + Bcl-3) for the treated cells relative to the control cells and the portion of each subunits are given in percentage. C. Luciferase reporter gene assay showed no transcriptional NF-&#x003ba;B activity after PrP<sup>Sc</sup> infection (0.2% or 0.02%), the value of relative light unit (RLU) per &#x003bc;g protein being equivalent for RML6- and CD1-treated cells. Mean values and SEM of three independent transfections are shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cmi0009-2202-f1"/></fig><p>To elucidate the transcriptional activity of NF-&#x003ba;B, luciferase reporter gene assays were performed. Therefore, Bos2 cells were transiently transfected with a &#x003ba;B-responsive reporter construct and 6 h later cells were infected with RML6. After an incubation period of 20 h the cells were lysed and the cell extracts were used for luciferase activity measurement. No activation was found after incubation of Bos2 cells with RML6 compared with CD1-treated or -untreated control cells. However, NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activity was observed when Bos2 cells were treated with TNF-&#x003b1; as a positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C</xref>). These data indicate that the NF-&#x003ba;B binding complex induced by RML6 is not transcriptionally active in Bos2 cells.</p><p>To further characterize the nature of the NF-&#x003ba;B dimers presented in the nucleus after acute PrP<sup>Sc</sup> infection, precipitations of &#x003ba;B binding proteins with an agarose-conjugated consensus &#x003ba;B oligonucleotide were performed and the precipitates were analysed by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>). While p65 was detected in the nucleus of control and TNF-&#x003b1;-treated cells, almost no signal for p65 was found after RML6 infection. In contrast, p50, Bcl-3 and p52 were precipitated from the nucleus of RML6-infected cells. For further evaluation of these results the blots were quantified by scanning densitometry. While the p65 to p50 ratio reached a value of 0.72 in control cells it decreases to 0.42 after infection. The reduction of the transcriptional active NF-&#x003ba;B subunit p65 supports the formation of inactive homodimers like p50-p50. These results are in line with the lack of transcriptional activity in RML6-treated cells, as p50 and p52 lack a transcription activation domain.</p></sec><sec><title>PrP<sup>Sc</sup> induces apoptosis via mitochondrial disruption in Bos-2 cells</title><p>It is well known that PrP<sup>Sc</sup> induces apoptosis in neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Hetz and Soto, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Cronier <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, the mechanism of cell death is not completely understood. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a well described event in many cases of apoptosis and has been reported to play a central role in neuropathological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Polster and Fiskum, 2004</xref>). This pathway is characterized by loss of transmembrane potential (&#x003a8;m). Analysis of &#x003a8;m using the lipophilic fluorescent dye JC-1 showed an increased number of cells with depolarized &#x003a8;m in RML6-treated cells (23.5%) compared with CD1-treated control cells (5.7%), 18 h after RML6 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-induced mitochondrial disruption leads to apoptosis. A. JC-1 staining of staurosporine, CD1 (control) and RML6 cells. Cells treated with staurosporine (1 &#x003bc;M, 4 h), CD1 or RML6 for 18 h were stained with JC-1 according to the protocol and analysed on a BD FACS Calibur&#x02122; as described in <italic>Experimental procedures</italic>. JC-1 fluorescence is seen in both the FL-2 (red) and FL-1 channels (green).

For staurosporine-treated cells 67% showed decreased fluorescence in the FL-2, while only a small proportion of the population in CD1 control cells (5.7%) showed depolarization of the &#x00394;&#x003a8;. After RML treatment 23.5% of the cells mitochondria were found with a depolarized &#x00394;&#x003a8;. B.

In order to determine the localization of cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions of cells 18 h after incubation with RML6 or normal brain homogenates were prepared. Staurosporine-treated cells were used as positive control and the NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor BAY117082 was tested for its ability to induce cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release.

Consequently, our data show that infection of Bos2 cells with RML6 leads to an early induction of a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential, followed by cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release into the cytosol.</p><p>The mitochondrial permeabilization and the release of death-promoting factors into the cytosol depend on the regulation by proteins of the Bcl-2 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Kroemer, 1997</xref>). To further investigate the apoptotic pathway a cDNA microarray analysis was performed. Bos2 cells were inoculated with RML6 and RNA was extracted at 8, 18 and 30 h after treatment. CD1-treated Bos2 cells were used as controls. To assure biological relevance three independent experiments were performed, where the RNA from cells was extracted. The PIQOR&#x02122; Cell Death Microarray (Memorec) was used composed of genes encoding key proteins in apoptosis, stress-like caspases, TNF-receptor family members, Bcl-2 family members and heat shock proteins. Various genes showed different expression patterns at 8, 18 and 30 h after treatment and most of them were significantly regulated only at 18 h. At this time point 21 transcripts were differentially regulated. Their level of regulation in RML6-treated cells compared with control cells is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Interestingly among the 13 downregulated genes, five (<italic>Tnfrsf11a/Rank</italic>, <italic>CcnD1</italic>, <italic>Myc</italic>, <italic>Junb</italic> and <italic>Bclx</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub>) are known to be NF-&#x003ba;B targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Pahl, 1999</xref>). As Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial apoptosis, the differential expression of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> was further confirmed using real time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Here, a 28% downregulation of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>-specific mRNA in RML6-infected cells compared with control cells was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>). This finding that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>-specific mRNA is downregulated in Bos2 cells after acute PrP<sup>Sc</sup> infection perfectly correlates with the mitochondrial dysfunction and the cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Differential gene expression in Bos2 + RML6 versus Bos2 + CD1 18 h p.i.</p></caption><table

By immunohistochemistry activation of caspase-9 was found in the brain of prion-infected mice but only slight differences between the various mouse strains concerning the number of positive cells were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7A</xref>). This was most probably due to high caspase-9 expression in uninfected mouse brains. Therefore, in addition, immunohistological analysis of activated caspase-3 was performed. Activation of caspase-3 by cleavage of the pro-caspase-3 is a central step to induce apoptosis. Detection of active caspase-3 is a solid and useful marker to investigate apoptosis. By immunohistochemistry, even in a normal adult mouse brain active caspase-3-positive cells can be found in particular in the olfactory bulb and single positive cells can be detected throughout the brain. The picture of active caspase-3-positive cells totally changes in PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-infected mice at terminal disease stage. Here, intensive active caspase-3 staining can be found basically in all areas where spongiform vacuolation is found, and to lower extends also in areas of the brain without obvious neuropathological changes. When brains of either terminally diseased wild-type or NF-&#x003ba;B-deficient mice were analysed in immunohistochemistry with an antibody directed against active caspase-3, no differences in the amount and the distribution of active caspase-3 was found (data not shown). Therefore, we investigated brain sections at earlier time points after PrP<sup>Sc</sup> infection. According to the results of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> expression, brain sections were tested for caspase-3 activity at 11 weeks p.i. Here, we found increased caspase-3 activity in NF-&#x003ba;B2- and Bcl-3-deficient mice compared with C57Bl/6 and NF-&#x003ba;B1-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7A</xref>).

The reduction of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> correlates with the increased activation of caspase-9 and more obvious to an increased activation of caspase-3 that consequently leads to apoptosis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>A notable feature in prion disease is a progressive loss of neurons, gliosis and spongiform changes. The cellular mechanisms of nerve cell death is still poorly understood, but it has been shown that apoptosis plays a major role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Giese <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Lucassen <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hetz <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Our data suggest that NF-&#x003ba;B is involved in early events leading to apoptosis and show that apoptosis might not be the only factor involved in the pathology of the disease.</p><p>How can NF-&#x003ba;B's mode of action be envisioned? Activation of the transcription factor &#x003ba;B in the central nervous system prevents neuronal apoptosis in cell culture and in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Barger <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Kaltschmidt <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Mattson <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). Several studies have shown that neuronal dysfunction after prion infection occurs through a process of programmed cell death. This is true in the murine experimental models for scrapie but also for Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) in humans (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Hetz and Soto, 2003</xref>). Apoptosis was also found in primary cultured neurons, in a hypothalamic neuronal cell line and in neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Barger <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hetz <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Cronier <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Kristiansen <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Our experiments demonstrated that after acute prion infection of Bos2 neuroblastoma cells with PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (RML6), NF-&#x003ba;B binding activity was detectable but no transcriptional activity. This obvious discrepancy could be solved when the subunits of the NF-&#x003ba;B complex were identified to demonstrate that p65 did not translocate to the nucleus of RML6-infected Bos2 cells. Furthermore, <italic>in vivo</italic> a reduced expression of phospho-p65 was found in PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-infected C57Bl/6 mice at early stages of the disease (11 weeks) compared with uninfected mice. In contrast to p65, the NF-&#x003ba;B proteins p50 and p52 lack a transactivation domain and cannot achieve for the activation of transcription. Homodimeric complexes of p52-p52 or p50-p50 are associated with repression of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Bours <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Kastenbauer and Ziegler-Heitbrock, 1999</xref>). In fact, we observed a downregulation of NF-&#x003ba;B target genes like RANK, cyclinD1 and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in acute PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Pahl, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Shishodia <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). This is in agreement with results obtained from persistently infected ScN2A cells, where various genes involved in translation or protein synthesis were downregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Greenwood <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Our data on NF-&#x003ba;B DNA binding activity after PrP<sup>Sc</sup> infection are supported by the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Fabrizi <italic>et al</italic>. (2001</xref>) which described NF-&#x003ba;B activity in human microglial cells after stimulation with the prion protein fragment 106&#x02013;126. Furthermore, NF-&#x003ba;B activity has been found in brains of scrapie-infected mice at the terminal state of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>).</p><p>One might now raise the question whether the repression of NF-&#x003ba;B activity participates to neuronal cell death after PrP<sup>Sc</sup> infection. Our data support the view that PrP<sup>Sc</sup> leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release, activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and subsequently to apoptosis. In neuropathological processes mitochondrial dysfunction is often present, and it is well known that mitochondria are involved in neuronal cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Polster and Fiskum, 2004</xref>). Cytochrome <italic>c</italic> released from mitochondria together with other proteins leads to the production of active caspase-9 that again induces caspase-3 activation and results in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Shi, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, our data support earlier findings where the synthetic peptide PrP (106&#x02013;126) of prion protein was able to induce cell death by mitochondrial disruption in neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">O'Donovan <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>).</p><p>In the last decade, members of the Bcl-2 protein family have emerged as important regulators of the mitochondrial membrane potential (&#x003a8;m). Their exact mechanism is yet not completely understood but it is a general hypothesis that anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 inhibits the opening of pores at the mitochondrial outer membrane and thereby prevents the loss of &#x003a8;m, which consequently prevents the release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Kroemer, 1997</xref>). In our microarray analysis we found downregulation of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> after acute infection of Bos2 cells. The death antagonist Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> is a member of the Bcl-2 protein family. Interestingly, <italic>Bclx</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> was reported to be an NF-&#x003ba;B target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Pahl, 1999</xref>). Other inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAP, XIAP, NAIP) or FLIP block the activation of caspases, particularly those involved in engagement of the receptor-related, extrinsic apoptotic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Karin and Lin, 2002</xref>). In our microarray analysis we found no differences in the regulation of IAPs. One therefore might argue that apoptosis after acute PrP<sup>Sc</sup> infection is predominately regulated by the intrinsic, mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Using N2A cells stably expressing mutant form of Bcl-2, it has been described that Bcl-2 regulates the induction of apoptosis mediated by endoplastic reticulum (ER) stress rather than by mitochondrial dysfunction after PrP<sup>Sc</sup> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hetz <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). We cannot rule out that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> exerts another function than Bcl-2 and it could be possible that in addition to the mitochondial dysfunction, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> induced cell death over ER stress and caspase-12 activation. Nevertheless, in permanently PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-infected hypothalamic neurons (Sc-GT1 cells) an apoptotic pathway involving formation of aggresomes together with the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 was described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Kristiansen <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). While these cells contain high levels of prion protein, this cell culture model may rather reflect the situation at the late stage of the disease, whereas the NF-&#x003ba;B repression and the involvement of mitochondria leading to neuronal apoptosis within 24 h in acute infected Bos2 (N2A) cells may represent an early event after PrP<sup>Sc</sup> infection.</p><p>Consequently the question now arises, if our findings based on cell culture experiments also reflect the situation <italic>in vivo</italic>. To analyse various NF-&#x003ba;B signalling pathways we used NF-&#x003ba;B1-, NF-&#x003ba;B2- and Bcl-3-deficient mice and animals with p65 depletion in the CNS for infection with PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. Except the p65<sup>&#x02013;</sup>/<sup>&#x02013;</sup> line, these deficient mice have severe defects in their lymphoid organs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bonizzi and Karin, 2004</xref>), which are important sites of prion replication upon intra-peretonial (i.p.) prion inoculation. As we exclusively performed i.c. inoculation these mouse strains were adequate for our studies. Interestingly, the enhanced susceptibility of NF-&#x003ba;B2- and Bcl-3-deficient animals compared with NF-&#x003ba;B1-deficient mice and wild-type controls correlates with a reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> 11 weeks after prion infection. This is in line with our <italic>in vitro</italic> results, where Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> mRNA was downregulated in acute PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-infected cells. Furthermore, enhanced cleaved caspase-3 activity was found in NF-&#x003ba;B2- and Bcl-3-deficient mice at the same time point. The different patterns of caspase-3 expression and the reduced level of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in the NF-&#x003ba;B2- and Bcl-3-deficient animals argue for a Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>-dependent protection in the wild-type mice at early stages of the disease. This is in line with the previously reported neuroprotective role of NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Glasgow and Perez-Polo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Dhantapani <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). The involvement of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in mice suffering from prion disease is under debate. Bax-deficient mice inoculated with a mouse-adapted BSE strain, presented the same pathology compared with control animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Coulpier <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Recently, both Bax-dependent and Bax-independent neurotoxic pathways were found in mice with N-terminally deleted forms of the prion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our data provide new insides into the mechanism of neuronal cell death early after prion infection. By a so far unknown reason the NF-&#x003ba;B subunit p65 is reduced in early stages after PrP<sup>Sc</sup> infection. The NF-&#x003ba;B p50 homodimer that lacks transcriptional activity may bind to the promoter region, leading to downregulation of genes coding for anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>. From previous studies it is known that Bcl-3 can function as coactivator for p50 and p52 homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Bours <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bonizzi and Karin, 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, the role of Bcl-3 in the CNS is almost completely unidentified. A strong signal for Bcl-3 was found in the nucleus of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-infected Bos2 cells. Therefore, one might speculate that Bcl-3 reverses the repression and induces gene expression. This hypothesis is supported by the earlier onset and terminal stages of disease in mice with either disrupted <italic>Bcl-3</italic> or <italic>Nfkb2</italic> genes. As prion infection of wild-type mice and NF-&#x003ba;B-deficient mice equally resulted in death, one is tempted to argue about the contribution of NF-&#x003ba;B and apoptosis in prion disease. From our and from other studies it is clear that NF-&#x003ba;B activity is not the only factor leading to disease. At a late time point of the disease microglia and astrocytes are activated and produce chemokines and cytokines, which have been associated with the death of the surrounding neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Mallucci <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bate <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). These chemokines and cytokines probably induce apoptosis via a direct pathway independent of mitochondria and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> expression. This is in line with our finding of strong caspase-3 activation in all animals in the terminal stage of the disease. In addition, a neuroprotective mechanism against prion neurotoxicity was described, involving the early expression of the ER chaperones Grp58, which counterparted cell death after stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Hetz <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, the findings that in early stages of the developing disease mitochondrial defence mechanisms are involved in neuroprotective processes brings important aspects to the understanding of the development of prion disease. Interestingly, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and other anti-apoptotic proteins were induced by estrogen, a hormone that can protect neurons against neurodegenerative processes and which therapeutic application is considered for prevention or treatment of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Nilsen and Brinton, 2004</xref>). Targeting mitochondrial function would be an approach to achieve neuron viability and reflects new defence strategies against neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>NF-&#x003ba;B1-deficient mice with an unspecified background (129-derived E14 ES cell line was used) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory.

The &#x00394;&#x003a8; of normal, healthy mitochondria is polarized and JC-1 is rapidly taken up by such mitochondria. This uptake increases the concentration gradient of JC-1 leading to the formation of JC-1 aggregates within the mitochondria. JC-1 aggregates show a red spectral shift resulting in higher levels of red fluorescence emission which is measured in the Red (FL-2) channel. JC-1 does not accumulate in mitochondria with depolarized &#x00394;&#x003a8; and remains in the cytoplasm as monomers.

A Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>-specific antibody (NEB) was used in a 1/300 dilution and for the detection of activated p65 a phospho-specific antibody [pNF-&#x003ba;B(p65) NEB] at a 1/50 dilution was used. Staining reaction was enhanced by the use of a biotinylated secondary antibody (1/200). For detection an ABC kit was used as described by the manufacturer (Vector). For the detection of active caspase-9 the signal was amplified prior to substrate staining by the use of a TSA indirect kit (Perkin Elmer).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistological quantification</title><p>To quantify active caspase-3 and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> reactivity the total number of labelled cells in three different areas (1.87 mm<sup>2</sup>) of midsagittal sections of three animals were counted by two independent individuals. The three chosen areas, pons/medulla, entorhinal cortex and cerebellum correspond to regions where the vacuolation was found in terminally diseased mice. A total of nine sections were quantified for each mouse strain and the mean value and SEM was calculated and compared with the wild-type C57Bl/6 mice in percentage of control.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Lothar Stitz for helpful discussion and Elizabeta Gagulic, Ulrich Wulle, Silke Gaeth and Mandy Laukner for technical assistance.
