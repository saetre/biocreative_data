Noxious stimuli potentiate the glutamate synaptic transmission and enhance glutamate NMDA receptor expression in the PAG. However, little is known about roles of NMDA receptor subunits in the PAG in processing the persistent inflammatory pain. The present study was undertaken to investigate NR2A- and NR2B-containing NMDA receptors in the PAG and their modulation to the peripheral painful inflammation. Noxious stimuli induced by hind-paw injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) caused up-regulation of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors in the PAG, while NR2A-containing NMDA receptors were not altered. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed that NMDA receptor mediated mEPSCs were increased significantly in the PAG synapse during the chronic phases of inflammatory pain in mice. PAG local infusion of Ro 25-6981, an NR2B antagonist, notably prolonged the paw withdrawal latency to thermal radian heat stimuli bilaterally in rats. Hyperoside (Hyp), one of the flavonoids compound isolated from <italic>Rhododendron ponticum </italic>L., significantly reversed up-regulation of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors in the PAG and exhibited analgesic activities against persistent inflammatory stimuli in mice.

Considerable evidence has recently emerged regarding participation of this system in persistent pain conditions such as inflammation and neuropathy. Recent studies indicate that persistent pain after tissue or nerve injury is linked to an enhanced activation of descending modulatory circuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The increased excitability in the descending circuitry after injury likely reflects long-lasting changes in synaptic efficacy, similar to that seen in hippocampal synapses that are involved in learning and memory[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The increased net descending facilitatory drive leads to an amplification of the pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying injury-induced synaptic plasticity in PAG circuitry are poorly understood.</p><p>Although PAG has limited direct projections to the spinal cord, it has a key role in the descending modulation of nociception and uses the RVM as an important intermediate in pain modulation, a site that projects directly to the spinal cord dorsal horn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Glutamate and GABA play a critical role in processing pain at the PAG-RVM level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Studies have shown that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) contribute to persistent pain following nerve and tissue injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Native NMDARs are composed of NR1, NR2 (A, B, C, and D), and NR3 (A and B) subunits. The formation of functional NMDARs requires a combination of NR1, an essential channel-forming subunit, and at least one NR2 subunit. NMDARs are highly expressed in the brain and subunit compositions may occur during early development and in different brain areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Previous studies show that peripheral inflammation increases the expression of NR2B-containing NMDARs and enhanced neurotransmitter release in the anterior cingulate cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Inhibition of NR2B receptors by administering selective NR2B receptor antagonists locally into the anterior cingulate cortex or systemically, inhibits inflammation- related allodynia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Subcutaneous formalin injection has been shown to produce an immediate increase of glutamate and aspartate in the spinal cord, and antagonists administered peripherally or spinally reduce pain following formalin injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

It is hopeful this study could shed light on the clinical treatment of chronic pain with traditional herbs.</p><p>In present study, we assessed the role of PAG NR2B receptor in processing of persistent inflammatory pain induced by left hindpaw injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Our results demonstrate that NR2B receptor is up-regulated in the PAG and involves in the modulation to the prolonged peripheral injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Up-regulation of NR2B receptors in the PAG after peripheral injury</title><p>Transgenic over-expression of NR2B-containing NMDARs in forebrain areas enhances inflammatory pain in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Similarly, our previous results show that NR2B expression is increased in the anterior cingulated cortex after hindpaw CFA injection induced inflammatory pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. As PAG plays important roles in processing pain-related information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], it raises the possibility that NR2B expression is changed in the PAG after injury. To test this hypothesis, NR2B expression was examined by Western blot analysis on total PAG homogenates from mice. Western blot results showed that NR2B expression in PAG was notably increased at 3d after CFA-injection (234.4% &#x000b1; 41.5% of saline, n = 6, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Projections from PAG modulate the state of ON or OFF cells in RVM and trigger descending facilitation or inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>NMDARs in the cortex, PAG, and RVM play a key role in the ascending transmission of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Recently, chemical or electrical stimulation in the rat anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which sends projections to the PAG and thus communicates indirectly with the RVM, enhanced the tail-flick reflex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Persistent peripheral inflammation leads to enhanced presynaptic glutamate release in the ACC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Microinjection of NR2B antagonist into the ACC significantly reduces mechanical allodynia induced by hindpaw CFA-injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Microinjection of NMDA into the RVM facilitate the tail-flick reflex in a dose-dependent manner, an effect blocked by the NMDAR antagonist AP-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, little is known the roles of NR2B-containing NMDARs in the PAG in processing the peripheral persistent inflammatory pain.</p><p>In present investigation, we demonstrate for the first time that changes in NMDARs expression in the PAG is selective for NR2B subunits, not NR2A ones. The results demonstrate a significant increase in NR2B expression in the lateral areas of the PAG (LPAG). Up-regulation of NR2B is verified by the recordings of NMDAR-mediated mEPSCs. It is reasonable to conclude that the enhancement in NMDARs is due to the up-regulation of NR2B-containing NMDARs in the PAG. Different reports have shown that phosphorylation of the NMDAR NR1 subunit is associated with noxious stimulation demonstrated by capsaicin, carrageenan and formalin injection to rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. We do not exclude the possibility that NMDAR NR1 subunit is altered in our experiment condition.</p><p>The increased descending facilitatory drive from the PAG and RVM leads to an amplification of the pain. Hindpaw CFA-injection induced inflammation is an animal model for persistent inflammatory pain which nociceptive pathway involves anatomical sites at the level of the brain, spinal cord, and periphery. As shown in many other studies the inflamed ipsilateral paws show a significant decrease in PWL than control paws [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Also, the contralateral paws of CFA-injected group show a slight decrease in PWL than control paws, even though the decrease in PWL of contralateral paws is much smaller than that on the ipsilateral side [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. This indicates that in chronic inflammatory pain condition the decrease in PWL to thermal stimuli is not confined only to the CFA-inoculated paws but also affects the non-inoculated contralateral paws. Consistent with this report, we find that unilaterial CFA injection causes a bilateral decrease in PWL in present study. PAG infusion of NR2B antagonist, Ro 25-6981, leads to prolong PWL bilaterially, suggesting the NR2B-containg NMDARs in the PAG modulate the thermal hyperalgesia to peripheral inflammatory injury.</p><p>However, it is important to define in which circumstances the descending system is inhibitory and in which it is facilitatory. The problem is that, even for similar types of experiment, some laboratories conclude that the descending system has an inhibitory role in nociception while other laboratories conclude that it has a facilitatory role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The similar contradiction is observed in the experiments to define the role of NMDARs in the PAG in descending system. In some experiments show that activation of NMDARs in the PAG causes an inhibition of pain response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], while others show that NMDARs may play a critical role in induction of spinal hyperalgesia after prolonged noxious stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. One way to solve this apparent contradiction is to hypothesize that experiments are performed in different conditions, such as intense of noxious stimuli (acute or chronic), types of injury (inflammatory or neurophathic), time points after induction of injury.</p><p>Interestingly, present results indicate that basal excitatory synaptic transmission is not altered in the LPAG synapse following exposure to peripheral inflammation. This is demonstrated by unchanged AMPA receptor-mediated mEPSCs frequency and amplitude in PAG slice recordings. However, GluR1 subunits were found over-expressed in the PAG by Western-Blot detection. At least two possible mechanisms may explain this difference. First, mEPSC recordings could only detect the surface expression of AMPA receptors while Western-blot analysis indicates the total APMA receptors including the cytoplastic distribution. Previous reports suggest that synaptic delivery of the GluR1 subunit from extrasynaptic sites and cytoplasm is the key mechanism underlying synaptic plasticity and pain recessing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Second, mEPSC recordings were performed in the LPAG while the tissues for Western-blot analysis were from the whole PAG in present study.</p><p>To further confirm the selective changes of NMDARs subunits in PAG after CFA-injection, we treated the CFA-injected mice with Hyperoside (Hyp), a flavonoid compound isolated from a folk remedy, which shows anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In the present study, we found Hyp significantly reversed the up-regulated NR2B receptors in the PAG from mice with peripheral injury, whereas it did not affect the NR2B receptor expression in the normal physiological conditions. The down-regulated NR2B receptor is quite correlated with its analgesic effects on the thermal hyperalgesia induced by chronic inflammation. When evaluated its peripheral anti-inflammatory activities, we found that Hyp had marginal effect on the paw edema by CFA-injection. The data suggest analgesic effects of Hyp involving the modulation of synaptic transmission at the level of PAG. However, we could not exclude the possible effects of Hyp on the pain transmission through modulation of algesic mediators, e.g. TNF, substance P, bradykinin, or serotonin.</p><p>Taken together, our findings provide strong evidence that up-regulation of NR2B-containing NMDARs in the PAG involves in the modulation to the peripheral injury. It is hopeful this study could help further understand NR2B-containing NMDARs function during chronic pain processing and descending facilitation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Six- to eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice and Sprague Dawley rats were used in the experiments.

To induce inflammatory pain, 10 &#x003bc;l (for mouse) or 50 &#x003bc;l (for rat) of 50% CFA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was injected subcutaneously into the dorsal surface of left hindpaw. The degree of edema was evaluated by measuring hindpaw volume using a plethysmometer (UgoBasile, Varese, Italy). All experiments were performed 3-5 days after hindpaw CFA-injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot</title><p>Equal amounts of protein (50 &#x003bc;g) from the PAG of mice were separated and electrotransferred onto PDVF membranes (Invitrogen), which were probed with anti-NR2A, anti-NR2B, anti-GluR1 (Chemicon), and with &#x003b2;-actin (Sigma) as a loading control. The membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit IgG for the primary antibodies), and bands were visualized using an ECL system (Perkin Elmer).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Immunostaining was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Briefly, the PAG sections from mice were first treated with 0.75% Triton X-100 and 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in PBS for 1 h, and then processed for 30 min in 3% normal goat serum, followed by incubation with anti-NR2A and anti-NR2B, anti-GluR1 (Chemicon) monoclonal antibody overnight at room temperature. Secondary reactions with biotinylated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h were followed by avidin- biotin-peroxidase complexes (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h. A nickel-intensified diaminobenzidine with glucose oxidase was used as the final chromogen. Sections were washed several times, mounted on gelatinized slides, dehydrated through a series of ethanol solutions, cleared in xylene, and covered with glass coverslips.

Experiments were performed in a recording chamber on the stage of an Axioskop 2FS microscope with infrared DIC optics for visualization of whole-cell patch-clamp recording. Miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were recorded from LPAG neurons with an Axon 200B amplifier (MDS, Inc., CA). AMPA receptor-mediated mEPSCs were recorded from the neurons clamped at -70 mV. The recording pipettes (3-5 M&#x003a9;) were filled with solution containing (mM) 145 K-gluconate, 5 NaCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP, and 0.1 Na<sub>3</sub>-GTP (adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH). The NMDAR-mediated component of mEPSCs was pharmacologically isolated in ACSF containing CNQX (20 &#x003bc;M), glycine (1 &#x003bc;M), TTX (0.5 &#x003bc;M). The patch electrodes contained 102 mM cesium gluconate, 5 mM TEAchloride, 3.7 mM NaCl, 11 mM BAPTA, 0.2 mM EGTA, 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgATP, 0.3 mM NaGTP, and 5 mM QX-314 chloride (adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH). Neurons were voltage clamped at -30 mV. Picrotoxin (100 &#x003bc;M) was added in the ACSF for the all recordings. Access resistance was 15-30 M&#x003a9; and monitored throughout the experiment.

Rats were implanted with 7-mm stainless steel guide cannula (23-gauge) into the right sige of PAG (6.8 mm posterior to Bregma, 0.5 mm lateral from the midline, 4.5 mm beneath the surface of the skull) with the guide cannula angled 26&#x000b0; to the vertical. The dummy cannulas, cut 0.5 mm longer than guide cannulas, were inserted into the guide cannulas to prevent clogging and reduce the risk of infection. Rats were given at least 5 days to recover before experimentation. A 30-gauge injection cannula that was 1.5 mm lower than the guide was used for drug infusion. AP-5 (0.5 &#x003bc;g/0.5 &#x003bc;l), Ro25-6981 (0.5 &#x003bc;g/0.5 &#x003bc;l) or saline was delivered at the rate of 0.5 &#x003bc;l/min using a pump.

To assess thermal nociceptive responses, a commercially available plantar analgesia instrument (BME410A, Institute of Biological Medicine, Academy of Medical Science, China) was used. Animals were placed in individual plastic boxes and allowed to adjust to the environment for 1 h. Thermal hyperalgesia was assessed by measuring the latency of paw withdrawal in response to a radiant heat source. Rats were housed individually into Plexiglas chambers on an elevated glass platform, under which a radiant heat source was applied to the plantar surface of the hind paw through the glass plate. The heat source was turned off when the rat lifted the foot, allowing the measurement of time from onset of radiant heat application to withdrawal of the rat's hindpaw. This time was defined as the PWL. Both paws were tested alternately at 5-min intervals for a total of five trials. A 20 s cutoff was used to prevent tissue damage. Both hindpaw was tested independently with 10 min interval between trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Histological identification</title><p>To confirm the locations of the intra-PAG injection sites, brains were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and dehydrated through an ascending alcohol series.
