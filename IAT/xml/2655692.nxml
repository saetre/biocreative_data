To examine how changes in conserved methylated residues of histone H3 affect nucleotide excision repair (NER), viable H3K4R and H3K79R mutants were generated in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. These mutants show decreased UV survival and impaired NER at the transcriptionally silent <italic>HML</italic> locus, while maintaining normal NER in the constitutively expressed <italic>RPB2</italic> gene and transcriptionally repressed, nucleosome loaded <italic>GAL10</italic> gene. Moreover, the <italic>HML</italic> chromatin in these mutants has reduced accessibility to <italic>Micrococcal</italic> nuclease (MNase). Importantly, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates there is enhanced recruitment of the Sir complex at the <italic>HML</italic> locus of these mutants, and deletion of the <italic>SIR2</italic> or <italic>SIR3</italic> genes restores the MNase accessibility and DNA repair efficiency at this locus. Furthermore, following UV irradiation expression of NER genes in these mutants remains at <italic>wild type</italic> levels, with the exception of <italic>RAD16</italic> which decreases by more than 2-fold. These results indicate that impaired NER occurs in the silenced chromatin of H3K79R and H3K4,79R mutants as a result of increased binding of Sir complexes, which may reduce DNA lesion accessibility to repair enzymes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In eukaryotic cells, chromatin acts as the &#x02018;platform&#x02019; for various nuclear processes including replication, recombination, repair and transcription. The dynamic structure of chromatin and its ability to adopt numerous conformations acts as a control mechanism for different processes that target DNA. The fundamental unit of chromatin is the nucleosome which is comprised of a nucleoprotein core of 147 bp of DNA wrapped 1.65 times around an octamer of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). These nucleosome core particles are further assembled into arrays of oligonucleosomes to give the increasingly compact structural hierarchy of chromatin, which is inhibitory to protein factors that interact with DNA. Based on the compaction and accessibility to nuclear machinery, the eukaryotic genome is organised into active regions known as euchromatin and inactive regions known as heterochromatin. Unlike higher eukaryotes, the majority of chromatin in budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, is euchromatic in nature. Only a few regions, such as telomeres, the silent mating type loci (HM), and ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA), are packaged into transcriptionally silent heterochromatin-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Formation of silent chromatin at HM loci and telomeres is governed by the binding of silencing proteins Sir2, Sir3 and Sir4 (which form the Sir complex) to specific DNA sequences (called silencers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>)</p><p>Packaging of chromatin into silenced regions is also affected by post-translational modification of histone tails, including acetylation and methylation of the &#x003b5;-amino groups of specific lysine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). It has been observed that lysines in the tails of histone H3 and H4 are generally &#x02018;hyperactelyated&#x02019; in active chromatin and &#x02018;hypoacetylated&#x02019; in silenced chromatin, the latter facilitating binding of the Sir complex. Of particular importance is H4K16, which is the direct target of Sir2-mediated deacetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Apart from acetylation, Set1 and Dot1 (histone methyltransferases) methylate histone H3 at K4 and K79, respectively, and this &#x02018;signature&#x02019; is important for preventing heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9">6&#x02013;9</xref>). Indeed, methylation of H3K4 and H3K79 is extremely low in heterochromatin, and it has been suggested that Sir proteins predominantly associate with nucleosomes that are hypomethylated at H3K79 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In addition, formation of the Sir complex inhibits methylation of K79 by Dot1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Nucleotide excision repair plays a key role in removing bulky, helix distorting DNA damage such as DNA photoproducts produced by UV-light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>). It appears that the rate-limiting step in nucleotide excision repair (NER) is recognition of DNA lesions in different chromatin &#x02018;landscapes&#x02019;. Several <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated that chromatin is a barrier for efficient repair of various NER substrates including UV-induced DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16">14&#x02013;16</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, however, such lesions are efficiently repaired despite being assembled into nucleosomes because of alterations in nucleosome structure during NER. A popular model for NER in chromatin is the &#x02018;access-repair-restore&#x02019; model, which proposes that chromatin structure is altered during repair thereby exposing damage sites to repair factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Following repair, the site is restored to its original state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Recent studies have indicated that modifications in histones assist in the recognition and accessibility of DNA repair sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). For example, histone H3 is hyperacetylated <italic>in vivo</italic> following UV irradiation, which may aid in damage recognition and NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Furthermore, the human Gcn-5 containing HAT (histone acetyltransferase) complex TFTC has been shown to contain a DDB1 like protein, SAP130 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The DDB1 protein is a component of the UV-DDB heterodimer, which binds to UV lesions <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>Unlike histone acetylation, histone methylation does not appear to be induced by DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). However, methylation of histones appears to play a role in checkpoint control and methylated histones interact with checkpoint proteins following DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). For example, the checkpoint protein in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> Crb2, and its human homolog 53BP1, interacts with methylated histone H4K20 following ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Although p53BP1 also has an affinity for methylated H3K79 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), the biological significance of this interaction remains to be determined. Similar observations were made in budding yeast where Dot1p, which methylates H3K79, is required for the activation of rad53 checkpoint control following UV damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). In addition, a recent study shows that Dot1 null mutants and H3K79 point mutants are sensitive to UV radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Finally, epitasis analysis between dot1 and various UV repair genes indicates that H3K79 methylation plays overlapping roles in NER, post replication repair, and Rad9-mediated checkpoint function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>Since histone proteins can undergo a number of different modifications at various residues, it is unclear how these modifications work in concert in the cell. Therefore, to examine the role of these modifications in DNA repair in <italic>intact</italic> cells, we have begun exploring site-specific mutation of histone modification sites in yeast chromatin that preserve cell viability. In the present study, we examined how histone methylation in both the core domain and tail region affect DNA repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). The following histone H3 methylation mutants were used: H3 K4R, H3K79R and H3K4,79R where lysines 4, 79 or 4 and 79, respectively, are mutated to an arginine. Our results indicate that change at the methylation site in the core domain of histone H3 alters cell survivability following UV irradiation and impairs the rate of CPD removal from transcriptionally silent loci by enhancing binding of the Sir complex. In contrast, change in the methylation site in the tail domain of histone H3 alone does not exert an effect of similar magnitude on the UV damage sensitivity of the cell.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell growth and UV irradiation</title><p>For DNA repair studies, yeast cells were grown in YPD medium at 30&#x000b0;C until early log phase (<italic>A</italic><sub>600</sub> &#x0223c;0.6), harvested, washed and resuspended in ice-cold PBS (phosphate buffered saline).

This suggests that lysine to arginine mutations of histone H3K4,79 predominantly affects silenced chromatin.</p></sec><sec><title>Deletion of Sir2 or Sir3 increases repair of the HML locus</title><p>From the above results, it seems likely that nucleosome DNA in the <italic>HML</italic> locus is less accessible to exogenous enzymes in H3K79 mutants. To examine if this is due to enhanced binding of the Sir complex to <italic>HML</italic> nucleosomes, the effect of <italic>Sir2</italic> and <italic>Sir3</italic> deletion on NER was investigated. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and B, deletion of these genes from <italic>wt</italic> and mutant H3K4,79R cells significantly increases the rate of CPD removal at the <italic>HML</italic> locus.

The CPD removal was also measured at the <italic>RPB2</italic> locus in <italic>Sir2</italic> deleted strains. The results show there is no significant difference in the repair rate between <italic>wt</italic> and H3K4,79R, and their corresponding <italic>Sir2</italic> deletion strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). This suggests that decreased repair at the <italic>HML</italic> locus of H3K4,79R mutant cells is primarily due to enhanced binding of Sir proteins. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Deletion of <italic>SIR</italic> genes increases repair in the H3K4,79R mutant.

Moreover, the Sir2 protein level in both <italic>wt</italic> and H3K4,79R cells is comparable (Figure S3A), indicating that the difference in nucleosome organization between these two strains is not due to differences in SIR2 protein levels. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>MNase accessibility increases in <italic>Sir2</italic> deletion strains.

The accessibility to damaged DNA can be achieved by altering histone&#x02013;histone or histone&#x02013;DNA interactions in chromatin through the action of chromatin remodelers or histone modification enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). In the present study, we have focused on methylation of two conserved lysine residues, K4 and K79, which are located in the tail and histone fold domain, respectively, of histone H3. These residues were mutated to arginine and the mutants were tested for both UV sensitivity and NER efficiency. The H3K79 mutants were found to be more sensitive to UV irradiation compared to <italic>wt</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), while H3K4R mutants showed nearly the same sensitivity as <italic>wt</italic> (at least for UV doses &#x02264;150 J/m<sup>2</sup>). This suggests that H3K79 methylation plays a major role in cell survival following UV irradiation, in agreement with Thompson and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Interestingly, in our case, the double mutant H3K4,79R is more sensitive to UV radiation than either of the single mutants. It is possible that H3K79 methylation may (at least partially) compensate for the effect caused by the loss of H3K4 methylation, or vice versa. Alternatively, the combined methylation states of H3K4 and H3K79 may have a cumulatively greater effect on UV sensitivity than either residue individually. It has also been shown previously that H3K79 methylation not only plays a role in UV induced RAD9-mediated checkpoint function but also affects nucleotide excision repair and RAD5 post-replication repair pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Therefore, collectively these effects in combination can cause hypersensitivity to UV radiation. Moreover, lysine 79 methylation can also affect the structure of chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), but how it can influence the repair dynamics especially during NER is not known. In this study, we have addressed this aspect of histone modification by studying the efficiency of removal of CPDs in H3K79 methylation mutants.</p><p>We tested NER efficiency of the different mutants in three different, well-characterized chromatin loci of yeast. Compared to <italic>wt</italic> cells, all three methylation mutants exhibited reduced NER of UV-induced CPDs at the transcriptionally silenced <italic>HML</italic> locus, with H3K4,79R being the least efficient at carrying out CPD removal. On the other hand, there was no significant difference between these mutants and <italic>wt</italic> cells in repair of the transcriptionally active <italic>RPB2</italic> locus and the transcriptionally repressed <italic>GAL10</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Importantly, the amount of CPDs formed in each of the loci tested was similar for each strain (data not shown), indicating that these mutations do not affect CPD yields in these different loci.</p><sec><title>Mutation of H3 K4,79 affects chromatin accessibility at a silenced locus</title><p>The crystal structure of the nucleosome indicates that Lys79 of the two histone H3 proteins are located at the top and bottom surfaces of the nucleosome disk and most likely regulate interactions with exogenous proteins, like Dot1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that any change in this residue can affect the accessibility of nucleosome DNA to nuclear proteins. In agreement with this hypothesis, we found that DNA in the <italic>HML</italic> locus of H3K79R mutants was distinctly less accessible to MNase, compared to <italic>wt</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The <italic>HML</italic> locus is distinct from the other two loci examined in our study in that it is a transcriptionally silent locus that contains positioned nucleosomes along with bound Sir complexes. Although the exact mechanism of transcriptional silencing in the <italic>HML</italic> locus is not clear, various studies have proposed the &#x02018;steric hindrance model&#x02019; of reduced chromatin accessibility to DNA binding proteins in the silenced chromatin region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Our observation that deletion of Sir2 increases accessibility of MNase to nucleosome DNA and increases NER efficiency at the <italic>HML</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) supports this model. It is worth noting that deletion of Sir2 causes increased transcription of the <italic>HML</italic> gene (Figure S1B), indicating TCR could also play a role in repair of this locus, in addition to GGR, in Sir2 deletion cells. This situation, however, should be present in both <italic>wt</italic> and H3K4,79R cells, and the addition of TCR to the overall repair of <italic>HML</italic> would not be expected to change the NER response <italic>between</italic> the two cell types, as observed.</p><p>Dot1-mediated methylation of Lys79 plays an important role in establishing the transcriptional silencing and Sir protein association with heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). It has been found that &#x0223c;10% of the yeast genome is heterochromatic and is hypomethylated at H3K79, whereas the remaining &#x0223c;90% of the genome is hypermethylated at H3K79 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). It has been proposed that Sir proteins prefer to bind to the core nucleosome surface that have hypo-methylated Lys79 and maintain a stable heterochromatin condition by further preventing Dot1 mediated methylation of this residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Indeed, our ChIP analysis shows that in the H3K4,79R mutant more Sir2 protein is recruited to the <italic>HML</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C) than in <italic>wt</italic> cells. This is also in agreement with previous studies that have shown that the LRS mutant H3K79R has enhanced silencing at telomeres and mating-type loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) due to increased recruitment of Sir proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Furthermore, it has been suggested that the Lys79 to Arg79 mutation mimics the hypomethylation state of H3K79 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), which would imply that nucleosome cores of H3K4,79R cells have a permanent modification state that results in stronger Sir binding compared to <italic>wt</italic> cells and hinders accessibility of repair factors. Our results support this hypothesis, and was further strengthened by testing NER in H3 K4,79G and Dot1 mutant cells. The H3K79G mutation disrupts the interaction between Sir protein and the nucleosome core, leading to loss of Sir-mediated silencing, while deletion of Dot1 leads to random binding of Sir proteins throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In both mutant types, we found that NER at the <italic>HML</italic> locus was similar to <italic>wt</italic> cells (Figure S4A and S4C). Indeed, a small but consistent increase was observed in the overall repair rate of these mutants compared to <italic>wt</italic> cells. Furthermore, MNase digestion patterns show little difference in the chromatin accessibility of the <italic>HML</italic> locus between these mutants and <italic>wt</italic> cells (Figure S4B and S4D).</p><p>To date, only a few reports have appeared on the effect of Sir proteins on NER <italic>in vivo</italic>. Initially, it was reported that the silenced <italic>HML</italic> locus is repaired more slowly by NER than the active <italic>MAT&#x003b1;</italic> locus, which could be explained by TCR in the active <italic>MAT</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Another study showed that Sir3 protein interacts with NER protein Rad7 <italic>in vitro</italic> and that deletion of the <italic>SIR3</italic> gene rescues &#x0223c;25% of the UV sensitivity caused by deletion of Rad7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). It was suggested that this interaction may play a role in damage recognition during NER in transcriptionally silent chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). More recently, Thoma and colleagues examined repair of CPDs by UV photolyase and NER in yeast strains containing the <italic>URA3</italic> gene inserted near a telomere end of chromosome V, where <italic>URA3</italic> was transcriptionally active in <italic>sir3</italic> mutants, partially silenced in <italic>SIR3</italic> cells, or completely silenced by overexpression of <italic>SIR3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). These authors observed (i) efficient repair of active <italic>URA3</italic> by both pathways, (ii) reduced NER in partially silenced <italic>URA3</italic> and (iii) considerably reduced repair by both pathways in completely silenced <italic>URA3</italic>. Our results are in agreement with these studies, showing that increased binding of Sir proteins at the <italic>HML</italic> locus decreases UV survivability and reduces NER of the <italic>HML</italic> locus, while having no effect on NER in the active <italic>RPB2</italic> and repressed <italic>GAL10</italic> genes, in yeast cells.</p><p>An interesting observation in this report is that expression of <italic>RAD16</italic> decreases after UV irradiation in H3K4,79R cells compared to <italic>wt</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). It has been shown that Rad16 and Rad7 form an ATP-dependent DNA damage sensing complex that is needed for efficient NER of silenced chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Furthermore, it was reported that these proteins can interact with autonomously replicating sequence binding factor Abf1 to generate superhelicity in DNA, possibly required for nucleosome reloading after NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). In addition, it was recently reported that Rad16 mediates UV-induced acetylation of histone H3 in yeast, necessary for efficient NER of non-transcribed DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Therefore, Rad7 and Rad16 proteins may play a role in <italic>both</italic> early and late steps of NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>), and the increased expression of <italic>RAD16</italic> after UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>) is required for the later stages of NER. In our case, whether the decreased expression of Rad16 further retards the NER efficiency at the <italic>HML</italic> locus in H3K4,79R cells, is not clear and requires further investigation. It seems likely, however, that the presumed ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling activity of RAD16 is involved in NER of nucleosome bound regions, suggesting that low <italic>RAD16</italic> expression may indeed reduce the NER rate of silenced loci in H3K4,79R mutants.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that H3K79R methylation mutants have a constitutively altered nucleosome structure in the transcriptionally silent <italic>HML</italic> region. This altered chromatin structure arises from enhanced recruitment of Sir proteins to this locus, even though there is no apparent change in the overall level of Sir protein in these cells. These results indicate that increased recruitment of Sir proteins to the <italic>HML</italic> locus results in a &#x02018;less flexible&#x02019; chromatin structure, one in which NER is significantly impaired. Although subtle changes in chromatin structure of Sir independent (devoid/depleted) loci, like <italic>RPB2</italic> and GAL10, were also observed the exact reason for these changes is not clear at present. However, it is possible that exchange of lysine to arginine in H3 may cause some irregular binding of Sir proteins in these loci, which could, at least slightly, impede the access to nucleosome DNA. Nevertheless, these differences are minor compared to those observed for the <italic>HML</italic> locus. Thus, changes in the histone methylation pattern can promote abnormal silencing in chromatin and impair removal of DNA lesions in chromatin, which can enhance rates of mutagenesis in intact cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp003/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>ES002614</grant-num> to M.J.S.); American Cancer Society (RSG-03-181-01-GMC to J.J.W.).
