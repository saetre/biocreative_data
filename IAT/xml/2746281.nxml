Here, we characterise the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> profiles of masitinib (AB1010), a novel phenylaminothiazole-type tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets KIT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p><italic>In vitro</italic>, masitinib had greater activity and selectivity against KIT than imatinib, inhibiting recombinant human wild-type KIT with an half inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 200&#x000b1;40 nM and blocking stem cell factor-induced proliferation and KIT tyrosine phosphorylation with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 150&#x000b1;80 nM in Ba/F3 cells expressing human or mouse wild-type KIT. Masitinib also potently inhibited recombinant PDGFR and the intracellular kinase Lyn, and to a lesser extent, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. In contrast, masitinib demonstrated weak inhibition of ABL and c-Fms and was inactive against a variety of other tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases. This highly selective nature of masitinib suggests that it will exhibit a better safety profile than other tyrosine kinase inhibitors; indeed, masitinib-induced cardiotoxicity or genotoxicity has not been observed in animal studies. Molecular modelling and kinetic analysis suggest a different mode of binding than imatinib, and masitinib more strongly inhibited degranulation, cytokine production, and bone marrow mast cell migration than imatinib. Furthermore, masitinib potently inhibited human and murine KIT with activating mutations in the juxtamembrane domain. <italic>In vivo</italic>, masitinib blocked tumour growth in mice with subcutaneous grafts of Ba/F3 cells expressing a juxtamembrane KIT mutant.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Masitinib is a potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting KIT that is active, orally bioavailable <italic>in vivo</italic>, and has low toxicity.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The stem cell factor (SCF) receptor, KIT, also called CD117 or c-KIT receptor, is a member of the type III receptor protein-tyrosine kinase family (RTK) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Roskoski1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. This family also includes Flt3, the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor, and the receptor for macrophage colony-stimulating factor/colony-stimulating factor-1 (c-Fms). SCF and KIT regulate erythropoiesis, lymphopoiesis, megakaryopoiesis, gametogenesis, melanogenesis, with SCF also serving as an important growth factor and activator of mast cells and eosinophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Roskoski1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Broudy1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. It is known that SCF is up-regulated in inflammatory conditions and therefore presents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Reber1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, gain-of-function mutations in KIT, that is mutations that cause constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase (TK), have been implicated in a variety of neoplasms including, gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST), mastocytosis, acute leukaemias, melanomas and other cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Tests1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Lennarttson1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. These mutations are concentrated in the fifth extracellular domain (exons 8 and 9), the juxtamembrane region (exon 11), and the kinase domain (exon 17) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Orfao1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, autocrine or paracrine activation of KIT is thought to be involved in ovarian neoplasms and small-cell lung cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Roskoski1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Orfao1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In the last decade, several inhibitors of TK have been developed for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, STI-571; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) was the first TK inhibitor approved for clinical use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Arora1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. This compound is a potent inhibitor of the PDGF receptor (PDGFR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Buchdunger1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> and also BCR-ABL, which causes chronic myelogenous leukaemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Buchdunger2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, imatinib inhibits KIT, c-Fms and Syk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Dewar1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Atwell1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, and has been approved for the treatment of patients with KIT-positive nonresectable and/or malignant GIST. However, imatinib has a number of short-comings, including the development of resistance by most if not all patients with subsequent disease progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Rubin1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as resistance of the D<sup>816</sup>V mutant, which is frequently associated with mastocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Orfao1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Ma1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Ueda1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, imatinib may be cardiotoxic due to its inhibition of ABL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Kerkela1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Fernandez1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, novel TK inhibitors with improved selectivity are being developed for the treatment of diseases associated with KIT activation. Masitinib (AB1010), a protein TK developed by AB Science, S.A. (France), is one such new drug. The objective of this preclinical study was to provide a primary characterisation of the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of masitinib (mesylate salt) and to compare it against the benchmark protein TK inhibitor imatinib.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Masitinib is an inhibitor of recombinant human KIT</title><p>Activity of the synthetic TK inhibitor masitinib (mesylate salt; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007258-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) was assessed using a recombinant human wild-type KIT protein corresponding to the intracellular domain (amino acids 567&#x02013;976).

There are close similarities between the modes of KIT and ABL binding for imatinib and masitinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007258-g006">Figures 6B and 6D</xref>).

Of the protein kinases tested, the most sensitive to masitinib were KIT and PDGFR, both of which had submicromolar IC<sub>50</sub> values. In addition, masitinib was a good inhibitor of Lyn kinase (IC<sub>50</sub> of 510&#x000b1;130 nM compared to 2200&#x000b1;100 nM for imatinib, see Supporting Information; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007258.s002">Table S1</xref>), and to a lesser extent, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. In contrast to many other KIT inhibitors, such as imatinib, masitinib is a relatively weak inhibitor of ABL (IC<sub>50</sub> for recombinant KIT&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.2&#x000b1;0.34 &#x000b5;M for masitinib versus0.27&#x000b1;0.13 &#x000b5;M for imatinib), and the relative selectivity for KIT versus ABL was 10-fold higher for masitinib than for imatinib (ABL IC<sub>50</sub>/KIT IC<sub>50</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6.0 for masitinib versus 0.6 for imatanib). Masitinib was shown to be inactive against Flt3 and a relatively weak inhibitor of c-Fms, which are two members of the class III RTKs. Masitinib was also inactive against the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, a RTK often inhibited by KIT inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Small1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Wilhelm1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Mendel1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, other KIT inhibitors, including imatinib, dasatinib (Sprycel, Bristol-Myers Squibb), and sunitinib (Sutent, Pfizer), also inhibit several other protein kinases, especially other members of the type III receptor TK family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Small1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Shchemelinin1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, masitinib appears to be the most specific inhibitor of KIT. Our molecular modelling studies suggest that this greater selectivity of masitinib may be due to an inability to form hydrogen bonds to three water molecules in the active site of ABL, despite both compounds binding to the active sites of KIT and ABL with similar conformations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Nagar1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The lack of specificity associated with other KIT inhibitors may lead to toxic side effects and recent studies suggest that imatinib may be cardiotoxic due to inhibition of ABL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Kerkela1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Fernandez1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

In contrast, the pharmacological profile of masitinib shows that it does not target the kinases presumably involved in cardiotoxicity, e.g. SRC, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR), endothelial growth factor receptors (EGFR) and Abelson proto-oncogene ABL. Thus, the risk of cardiotoxicity appears to be lower with masitinib than with imatinib. In addition to cardiotoxicity, imatinib has been shown to be genotoxic as indicated by a positive chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells and in a bacterial reverse mutation test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Imatinib1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Masitinib, in contrast, is not mutagenic in bacterial reverse mutation tests using <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and does not cause chromosome aberrations in cultured human lymphocytes. Masitinib also does not cause damage to chromosomes or the mitotic apparatus in mouse bone marrow cells following two daily administrations at 437.5, 875, or 1750 mg/kg/day, and it is not mutagenic in a mouse lymphoma assay (our unpublished results).</p><p>Importantly, masitinib was a potent inhibitor of several gain-of-function KIT mutants, including V<sup>559</sup>D (exon 11), which is associated with GIST <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Orfao1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, and a murine KIT mutant with a deletion of nine amino acids in the juxtamembrane domain (&#x00394;27 mutant; exon 11). This suggests that masitinib will be effective for the treatment of diseases linked to activating mutations in KIT, which includes mastocytosis, GIST, and canine mast cell tumours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Orfao1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, exon 11 mutants, which appear to be the most common type of KIT mutation in these diseases, were more sensitive to masitinib (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 to 20 nM) than the wild-type receptor (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;150 nM). In support of this, we found that mastocytoma cell lines carrying KIT juxtamembrane mutants had IC<sub>50</sub> values for masitinib between 10 and 30 nM, whereas in murine primary BMMCs expressing wild-type KIT, the IC<sub>50</sub> for masitinib was 200 nM. This higher sensitivity of juxtamembrane mutants than the wild-type receptor has also been reported for imatinib <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Zermati1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Frost1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Masitinib was a potent inhibitor of mutant PDGFR &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; receptors found in GIST and Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukaemia, respectively.

Intraperitoneal or oral administration of masitinib inhibited tumour growth in mice with subcutaneous grafts of Ba/F3 cells expressing the &#x00394;27 KIT mutant. Furthermore, in an intraperitoneal model, masitinib significantly enhanced survival with no indication of general toxicity, as indicated by a lack of weight loss at the administered doses. These results demonstrate that masitinib is orally bioavailable and that it is effective at inhibiting tumour growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. This agrees with our phase 3 study in dogs showing that orally administered masitinib is safe and effective for the treatment of nonresectable or recurrent grade 2 or 3 nonmetastatic mast cell tumours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Hahn1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, our results show that masitinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of the KIT TK.

Masitinib also potently inhibits recombinant PDGFR, the intracellular kinase Lyn, and, to a lesser extent, FGFR3. Additionally, masitinib was active and orally bioavailable. Thus, we anticipate that masitinib will be effective for the treatment of KIT and PDGFR-dependent diseases, which include various cancer and inflammatory diseases, and that it will have a better safety profile, especially regarding cardiotoxicity, than other KIT inhibitors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Drug product</title><p>Masitinib was identified using a medicinal chemical approach to improve the selectivity of the phenylaminopyrimidine class of TK inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Buchdunger1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007258-Buchdunger2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.
