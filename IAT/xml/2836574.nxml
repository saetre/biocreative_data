On the other hand, DNA repair at inactive genes or silent areas of the genome is not regulated by Rad26p. However, how Rad26p recognizes DNA lesions at the actively transcribing genes to facilitate DNA repair is not clearly understood <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here, we show that Rad26p associates with the coding sequences of genes in a transcription-dependent manner, but independently of DNA lesions induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Further, histone H3 lysine 36 methylation that occurs at the active coding sequence stimulates the recruitment of Rad26p. Intriguingly, we find that Rad26p is recruited to the site of DNA lesion in an elongating RNA polymerase II-dependent manner. However, Rad26p does not recognize DNA lesions in the absence of active transcription. Together, these results provide an important insight as to how Rad26p is delivered to the damage sites at the active, but not inactive, genes to stimulate repair <italic>in vivo</italic>, shedding much light on the early steps of transcription-coupled repair in living eukaryotic cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Genomic DNA is continuously challenged by a variety of damaging agents which can be of either exogenous or endogenous origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The deficiencies in repairing DNA lesions are fundamental to the etiology of most cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11">2&#x02013;11</xref>). However, a cell employs a number of repair pathways to maintain its genomic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15 B16 B17 B18 B19 B20 B21 B22 B23 B24 B25 B26 B27 B28 B29 B30">7&#x02013;30</xref>). One such repair mechanism utilized by the cell is nucleotide excision repair (NER). NER removes a wide variety of DNA lesions including UV-induced pyrimidine dimers (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts) and DNA-helix distorting bulky chemical adducts [e.g. 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) adduct], and thus, is the most flexible DNA repair pathway. It is a complex process that requires stepwise action of many proteins for damage recognition, local opening of DNA duplex around the lesion, dual incision of the damaged DNA strand, gap repair synthesis and strand ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>Significant insight was gained in human NER through the study of two autosomal recessive disorders, namely xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne syndrome (CS). The patients with either one of these disorders show severe UV hypersensitivity. XP disorder is caused by mutation in one of the seven genes (i.e. <italic>XPA</italic>, <italic>XPB</italic>, <italic>XPC</italic>, <italic>XPD</italic>, <italic>XPE</italic>, <italic>XPF</italic> and <italic>XPG</italic>), while the defect in the <italic>CSA</italic> or <italic>CSB</italic> gene leads to CS disease. The XP gene products perform various functions during damage recognition, DNA unwinding and incision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17 B18 B19">15&#x02013;19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). For example, XPC (Rad4p in yeast)/HHR23B (Rad23p in yeast) initially detects DNA lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and subsequently, XPA (Rad14p in yeast) and heterotrimeric replication protein A (RPA) bind to the site of DNA lesion to further aid in damage recognition. The XPB (Rad25p in yeast) and XPD (Rad3p in yeast) helicases (components of transcription factor, TFIIH) then unwind duplex DNA in the vicinity of lesion followed by XPG (Rad2p in yeast) and ERCC1 (Rad10p in yeast)/XPF (Rad1p in yeast) endonuclease-mediated incision of one strand of DNA at positions 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; to the damage, respectively, generating &#x0223c;30 base oligonucleotide containing lesion. On the other hand, the CS gene products participate in the NER process specifically at the transcriptionally active genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22 B23 B24">20&#x02013;24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Thus, NER removes DNA lesion from the active and inactive genes. Accordingly, NER has been classified into two types, namely global genomic NER (GG-NER) and transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER). The DNA lesions in the transcriptionally inactive or silent areas of the genome are repaired by GG-NER pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The TC-NER process repairs DNA lesions at the coding sequence of the transcriptionally active gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27 B28 B29 B30 B31 B32 B33 B34 B35 B36 B37 B38 B39 B40">26&#x02013;40</xref>).</p><p>Both the subpathways of NER are fundamentally identical except their mechanisms of damage recognition. Interestingly, TC-NER functions at a much faster rate than GG-NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27 B28 B29 B30 B31 B32 B33 B34 B35 B36 B37 B38 B39 B40">26&#x02013;40</xref>) as damage is promptly recognized in TC-NER. In GG-NER, the XPC/HHR23B participates in initial recognition of DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). However, the recognition of the damaged DNA during TC-NER does not require XPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). In TC-NER, the transcription elongation machinery stalls at the site of DNA lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41 B42 B43 B44 B45 B46">41&#x02013;46</xref>), and subsequently, elongating RNA polymerase II is disassembled through specific degradation of its largest subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Such a disassembly of RNA polymerase II has been proposed to allow the TC-NER-specific proteins such as CSA and CSB to gain access to the damaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). However, how TC-NER-specific factors are recruited to the site of DNA lesion at the active gene in eukaryotes remains unknown <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here, primarily using a formaldehyde-based <italic>in vivo</italic> cross-linking and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we show that Rad26p, a yeast homologue of human CSB with a DNA-dependent ATPase activity, is recruited to the sites of 4NQO-induced DNA lesions at the coding sequences of the active genes with the help of RNA polymerase II and histone H3 lysine 36 (H3 K36) methylation in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisae.</italic> Such targeting of Rad26p confers it to be a TC-NER-specific factor, and stimulates its recognition of DNA lesions at the active genes, eventually leading to a faster TC-NER as compared to relatively slow GG-NER.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The plasmids, pFA6a-13Myc-KanMX6 and pFA6a-3HA-His3MX6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>) were used for genomic tagging of the proteins of interest by myc and HA epitopes, respectively.

Briefly, yeast cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde, collected and resuspended in lysis buffer. Following sonication, cell lysate (400 &#x000b5;l lysate from 50 ml of yeast culture) was precleared by centrifugation, and then 100 &#x000b5;l lysate was used for each immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitated protein&#x02013;DNA complexes were treated with protease K, the cross-links were reversed, and DNA was purified. Immunoprecipitated DNA was dissolved in 20 &#x000b5;l TE 8.0 (10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.0 and 1 mM EDTA), and 1 &#x000b5;l of immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by PCR. PCR reactions contained [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]dATP (2.5 &#x000b5;Ci for each 25 &#x000b5;l reaction), and the PCR products were detected by autoradiography after separation on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. As a control, &#x02018;input&#x02019; DNA was isolated from 5 &#x000b5;l lysate without going through the immunoprecipitation step, and dissolved in 100 &#x000b5;l TE 8.0. To compare PCR signal arising from the immunoprecipitated DNA with the input DNA, 1 &#x000b5;l of input DNA was used in the PCR analysis. Serial dilutions of input and IP DNAs were used to assess the linear range of PCR amplification as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). All the PCR data presented in this article are within the linear range of the PCR analysis.</p><p>For analysis of Rad26p and Rad3p recruitment, we modified the above ChIP protocol as follows. A total of 800 &#x000b5;l lysate was prepared from 100 ml of yeast culture.

In parallel, the PCR analysis for &#x02018;input&#x02019; DNA was performed using 1 &#x000b5;l DNA that was prepared by dissolving purified DNA from 5 &#x000b5;l lysate in 100 &#x000b5;l TE 8.0.</p><p>All ChIP experiments were repeated multiple times, and consistent results were obtained. The primer pairs used for PCR analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Autoradiograms were scanned and quantitated by the National Institutes of Health image 1.62 program. Immunoprecipitated (IP) DNAs were quantitated as the ratio of IP to input. The input DNA was isolated from 5% of the lysate that was used for immunoprecipitation in the normal ChIP assay. In case of modified ChIP assay for analysis of the recruitment of Rad26p to the gene loci, the input DNA was prepared from 1.25% of the lysate that was used for immunoprecipitation.

To test this possibility, we next analyzed the association of Rad26p with the <italic>GAL1</italic> coding sequence under non-inducible conditions. We find that, like RNA polymerase II, Rad26p was also not associated with the <italic>GAL1</italic> coding sequence when <italic>GAL1</italic> transcription was switched off under non-inducible conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>B and C). Consistent with this observation, we also find that the association of Rad26p with the <italic>GAL1</italic> coding sequence was significantly impaired in the <italic>rpb1</italic>-ts mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). However, such an impaired association of Rad26p could be due to the loss of its stability in the <italic>rpb1</italic>-ts mutant strain at non-permissive temperature. To test this possibility, we analyzed the global level of Rad26p in the <italic>RPB1</italic> wild-type and ts mutant strains at permissive (23&#x000b0;C) as well as non-permissive (37&#x000b0;C) temperatures. We find that the stability of Rad26p was not altered in the <italic>rpb1</italic>-ts mutant strain while Rpb1p was significantly degraded at non-permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E). The level of TBP was monitored as a loading control, and it was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E). Thus, RNA polymerase II or active transcription plays an important role in association of Rad26p with the <italic>GAL1</italic> coding sequence.</p><p>Since Rad26p and RNA polymerase II were associated with the <italic>GAL1</italic> coding sequence, it seems likely that Rad26p might be associated with RNA polymerase II either directly or indirectly during transcriptional elongation. To test this possibility, we analyzed the association of Rad26p with RNA polymerase II using a cross-linking-based co-immunoprecipitation assay as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). In this direction, we generated a strain carrying myc-tagged Rad26p and HA-tagged Rpb3p subunit of RNA polymerase II. Using this strain, we performed the co-immunoprecipitation assay as schematically shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>F (top panel). An anti-Flag was used as a non-specific antibody in this assay. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>F (bottom panel) shows the association of Rad26p with RNA polymerase II. Such an association was significantly impaired in the <italic>rpb1</italic>-ts mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>G), thus implying the association of Rad26p with structurally and/or functionally intact RNA polymerase II, since Rpb1p maintains the structural/functional integrity of RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68 B69 B70 B71 B72">68&#x02013;72</xref>). Further, this association is not mediated by DNA as the treatment of WCE with DNAase did not alter the interaction of Rad26p with RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>H and I). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that DNA might be playing an important role to bring Rad26p and RNA polymerase II in proximity prior to cross-linking. Nonetheless, our data demonstrate that Rad26p is associated with RNA polymerase II. However, whether this association is either direct or indirect remains to be elucidated. Consistent with our observations, Li and Smerdon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>) have also demonstrated the genetic interaction between Rad26p and RNA polymerase II.</p><p>Next, we asked whether Rad26p is associated with other genes in a transcription-dependent manner. To address this question, we analyzed the association of Rad26p with the promoters and coding sequences of two other inducible <italic>GAL</italic> genes, namely <italic>GAL7</italic> and <italic>GAL10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, right panel), under both inducible and non-inducible conditions. We find that Rad26p was associated with the coding sequences but not promoters of <italic>GAL7</italic> and <italic>GAL10</italic> under inducible conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>A and B). Thus, like <italic>GAL1</italic>, the <italic>GAL7</italic> and <italic>GAL10</italic> genes recruit Rad26p at their coding sequences in a transcription-dependent manner. Likewise, Rad26p was also found to be associated with the coding sequence, but not promoter, of a different class of inducible gene, <italic>INO1</italic>, in a transcription-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). Similar association of Rad26p was also observed at the constitutively active gene, <italic>RPS5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). Taken together, our data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> demonstrate that Rad26p associates with the coding sequences of the active genes, indicating a possible role of Rad26p in transcriptional elongation.

Such a possibility could lead to our inability to detect the recruitment of Rad26p at the inactive coding sequence in response to 4NQO-induced DNA damage. Furthermore, the presence of DNA lesion within the ChIP PCR region will inhibit PCR, and thus, the recruitment of Rad26p to the lesion within the ChIP PCR region would not be detected. However, our data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B show that PCR signal at the ChIP PCR region (i.e. <italic>GAL1</italic>-ORF1) is not significantly altered, thus indicating insufficient damage at the ChIP PCR region. This is consistent with our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). However, the recruitment of Rad26p at the DNA lesions around the ChIP PCR region can be detected in the ChIP analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C), since DNA fragments of &#x0223c;500 bp or less are generated by sonication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) and significant fractions (&#x0223c;50%) of cells have DNA lesions within 300&#x02013;500 bp fragments of the <italic>GAL1</italic> coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Thus, if Rad26p is recruited within &#x0223c;500 bp fragment around the ChIP PCR region of the <italic>GAL1</italic> ORF (i.e. <italic>GAL1</italic>-ORF1), we would detect it in the ChIP assay as schematically shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C. However, we do not observe the recruitment of Rad26p to the <italic>GAL1-</italic>ORF1 in response to 4NQO-induced DNA damage in raffinose-containing growth medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B and H). Thus, DNA lesions alone do not appear to recruit Rad26p in the absence of transcription. However, it may be quite possible that the recruitment of Rad26 to the site of DNA lesion may make the site more vulnerable to sonication, which in turn could lead to our inability to observe the Rad26p ChIP signal as schematically shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C. In fact, we observe the recruitment of Rad26p to the <italic>GAL1</italic> coding sequence following 4NQO-induced DNA damage in a transcription-dependent manner (see below; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B and C). Further, we observe the recruitment of Rad3p to the active <italic>GAL1</italic> coding sequence in response to 4NQO-induced DNA damage (see below; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). Therefore, the DNA lesion sites associated with Rad26p do not seem to be more readily broken during chromatin shearing than those not associated with Rad26p. This is further supported by the fact that the association of Gal4p with the <italic>GAL1</italic> UAS was not altered following 4NQO-induced DNA damage in our ChIP analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1147/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>). <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Analysis of DNA lesion in the <italic>GAL1</italic> coding sequence.

Further, we have recently demonstrated that elongating RNA polymerase II is disassembled through the degradation of its largest subunit at the coding sequences of several active genes in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Based on these observations, we hypothesize that elongating RNA polymerase II promotes the recruitment of Rad26p to the site of damaged DNA followed by its disassembly through degradation of its largest subunit. According to this hypothesis, if elongating RNA polymerase II delivers Rad26p to DNA lesion, Rad26p would remain associated with the coding sequence even after the disassembly of elongating RNA polymerase II from the site of DNA lesion. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the association of RNA polymerase II (Rpb1p) and Rad26p with the <italic>GAL1</italic> coding sequence at 20 min following 4NQO-treatment in galactose-containing growth medium. The 4NQO-treatment time was chosen to be 20 min based on our recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Within this 4NQO-treatment time, the association of RNA polymerase II with the <italic>GAL1</italic> ORF was significantly lost due to the disassembly of RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). As a control, the association of RNA polymerase II and Rad26p with the <italic>GAL1</italic> coding sequence was also analyzed without 4NQO-treatment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A (left panel) shows significant loss of RNA polymerase II association with the 5&#x02032;-end of the <italic>GAL1</italic> coding sequence (ORF1) in 4NQO-treated cells as compared to that of the untreated cells. Such a loss of RNA polymerase II association with the <italic>GAL1</italic> coding sequence has been attributed in our recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) to the disassembly of elongating RNA polymerase II through the degradation of its largest subunit at the site of DNA lesion. Interestingly, even when association of RNA polymerase II with the <italic>GAL1</italic> ORF1 was significantly lost in 4NQO-treated cells, Rad26p was retained at the <italic>GAL1</italic> ORF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, left panel).

Together, these observations support the retention of Rad26p at the <italic>GAL1</italic> coding sequence following the disassembly of RNA polymerase II in response to 4NQO-induced DNA damage. As a negative control, we show the absence of the Rad26p ChIP signal in the strain bearing untagged Rad26p, using an anti-myc antibody in the ChIP assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). To verify as a positive control whether DNA lesions in the active coding sequence can also induce the recruitment of other DNA repair factors, like Rad26p, we analyzed the recruitment of Rad3p, a DNA repair factor with a helicase activity that is involved in unwinding DNA duplex around the lesion, to the active <italic>GAL1</italic> coding sequence in response to 4NQO-induced DNA damage. We find that Rad3p is recruited to the active <italic>GAL1</italic> coding sequence in response to 4NQO-induced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). Thus, like Rad26p, Rad3p is also recruited to the coding sequence of active gene following 4NQO-induced DNA damage.</p><p>Next, we analyzed the association of RNA polymerase II and Rad26p with the 3&#x02032;-end of the <italic>GAL1</italic> coding sequence following 20 min 4NQO-treatment.

Such an observation can be attributed to the fact that RNA polymerase II did not reach the 3&#x02032;-end of the <italic>GAL1</italic> coding sequence due to the presence of multiple DNA lesions (within &#x0223c;1200 base pair fragment) ahead of the 3&#x02032;-end in the continuously 4NQO-treated cells as shown in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>).

Since RNA polymerase II did not reach the 3&#x02032;-end of the <italic>GAL1</italic> coding sequence, it did not carry Rad26p.

Next, we extended this study to a different inducible gene, <italic>INO1</italic>.

Next, we asked whether RNA polymerase II plays a direct or indirect role in recruitment of Rad26p. There can be at least three different scenarios: (i) elongating RNA polymerase II evicts histones, and, subsequently, allows free DNA to interact with Rad26p; (ii) Rad26p is associated with the coding sequence in a RNA polymerase II-dependent manner; and (iii) RNA polymerase II covalently modifies nucleosomal histones at the coding sequence indirectly by recruiting histone modification enzymes, and such modifications may trigger association of Rad26p. We rule out the first possibility based on the fact that Rad26p was not associated with the relatively nucleosome-free promoter region of <italic>GAL1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Our data support the second possibility, since the recruitment of Rad26p is dependent on RNA polymerase II or active transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C&#x02013;I). However, histone covalent modifications that are mediated by RNA polymerase II or active transcription at the coding sequence could also stimulate the association of Rad26p. Thus, to test this third possibility, we analyzed the roles of histone H3 K4 and K36 methylation in recruitment of Rad26p, since these covalent modifications are mediated by elongating RNA polymerase II or active transcription through Set1p and Set2p histone methyltransferases, respectively. We find that histone H3 K4 methylation or Set1p is dispensable for the recruitment of Rad26p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). Interestingly, the recruitment of Rad26p to <italic>GAL1</italic> was significantly impaired in the absence of Set2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A) that is essential for histone H3 K36 methylation at the <italic>GAL1</italic> coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B and C). However, such an impaired recruitment of Rad26p in the absence of histone H3 K36 methylation could be due to the reduced association of elongating RNA polymerase II or the decreased stability of Rad26p. To test these possibilities, we analyzed the association of Rpb1p with the <italic>GAL1</italic> coding sequence in the <italic>SET2</italic> deletion mutant and its isogenic wild-type equivalent. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D shows that the association of Rpb1p with the <italic>GAL1</italic> coding sequence was modestly altered in the absence of histone H3 K36 methylation or Set2p. In contrast, a dramatic decrease of Rad26p recruitment was observed in <italic>&#x00394;set2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). Further, the stabilities of Rad26p and Rpb1p were not altered in <italic>&#x00394;set2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>E). Thus, our data demonstrate that histone H3 K36 methylation stimulates the association of Rad26p with the coding sequence of the active gene, and hence the factors (e.g. Ctk1p, RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors) involved in histone H3 K36 methylation are likely to alter indirectly the recruitment of Rad26p. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Methylation of K36 but not K4 on histone H3 stimulates the association of Rad26p with the coding sequence of the active gene.

Therefore, it is likely that the stimulation of Rad26p recruitment to the coding sequence of the active gene is mediated by one of the above methylated-lysine recognition domains. To test this possibility, we performed the bioinformatic analysis which revealed the absence of the methylated-lysine recognition domain in Rad26p. Thus, Rad26p seems to interact indirectly with methylated-K36 on histone H3. In support of this model, Krogan <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>) have demonstrated the genetic interaction of Rad26p with Sin3p which is a common component of Rpd3S (the smaller version of a multi-subunit complex with histone deacetylase activity) and Rpd3L (the larger version of a multi-subunit complex with histone deacetylase activity). Rpd3L is recruited to the promoter while Rpd3S associates with the coding sequence of the active gene to prevent cryptic transcriptional initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90 B91 B92 B93">90&#x02013;93</xref>). The association of Rpd3S with the coding sequence depends on histone H3K36 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90 B91 B92 B93">90&#x02013;93</xref>).

Thus, histone H3 K36 methylation appears to exert its stimulatory role in recruitment of Rad26p via the interaction of Rad26p with the Sin3p component of Rpd3S. However, such a model remains to be elucidated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>TC-NER and GG-NER fundamentally follow similar mechanisms except the recognition step of DNA lesion. Such a recognition step has been implicated in differential kinetics of these two repair processes. Here, we show that a TCR-specific factor, Rad26p, is recruited to the coding sequence of the active genes in response to 4NQO-induced DNA damage with the help of RNA polymerase II. On the other hand, search for the damaged DNA at the inactive genes or silent areas of the genome by Rad4p/Rad23p (XPC/HHR23B in human) is not augmented by elongating RNA polymerase II in GG-NER, since elongating RNA polymerase II is not associated with the inactive genes or silent areas of genome. Thus, our study provides important information for the rapid rate of TC-NER as compared to the slower GG-NER.</p><p>How is Rad26p recruited to the site of DNA lesion in the presence of elongating RNA polymerase II? Our data support that Rad26p is co-recruited with elongating RNA polymerase II to the coding sequences of the active genes. When RNA polymerase II stalls at the damaged DNA site, it is disassembled through the degradation of its largest subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), leaving behind Rad26p to the site of DNA lesion. This is consistent with previous biochemical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">95</xref>) that demonstrated the formation of a stable complex of the human homologue of Rad26p with elongating RNA polymerase II at the DNA pause site. Here, we find that elongating RNA polymerase II-mediated histone H3K36 methylation also enhances the association of Rad26p with the coding sequence of the active gene. Further, following its pause at the 4NQO-induced damaged DNA site, elongating RNA polymerase II might be changing its conformation <italic>in vivo</italic>, and such a conformational change may help Rad26p to interact more stably with DNA lesion. Moreover, Rad26p might be recognizing DNA lesion at the active gene in the presence of other, yet unknown, factor(s) <italic>in vivo</italic>. Additionally, Rad26p might be efficiently binding to the site of DNA lesion that has an altered conformation via the modulation of local base-stacking as well as Watson&#x02013;Crick hydrogen bonding as has been structurally shown for the recognization of DNA lesion by Rad4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">96</xref>). However, these possibilities of Rad26p recognition of the DNA lesion in TC-NER remain to be further investigated. Nonetheless, our study demonstrates <italic>in vivo</italic> that Rad26p is recruited to 4NQO-induced DNA lesion with the help of elongating RNA polymerase II, and subsequently, RNA polymerase II is disassembled through the degradation of its largest subunit. Once Rad26p is recruited to the DNA lesion, it becomes independent on the retention of RNA polymerase II. Similar results were also obtained in case of UV-induced DNA lesions (Zhen Duan and S.R.B., unpublished data). Thus, the mode of Rad26p recognition of the lesion at the active genes seems to be independent of the nature of the single strand DNA damaging agents.</p><p>We find the loss of RNA polymerase II at the coding sequences, but not promoters, of the active <italic>GAL1</italic>, <italic>GAL7</italic>, <italic>GAL10</italic> and <italic>INO1</italic> genes following 4NQO-induced DNA damage. Such a loss of RNA polymerase II has been attributed in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) to the disassembly of elongating RNA polymerase II through the degradation of its largest subunit in response to 4NQO-induced DNA damage <italic>in vivo</italic>. Consistent with our data in yeast, a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>) has also reported similar results in living mammalian cells. Such disassembly of elongating RNA polymerase II makes the damaged DNA accessible to the DNA repair factors, since elongating RNA polymerase II masks DNA lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">98</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">99</xref>). Following the disassembly of elongating RNA polymerase II, Rad26p is left behind at the site of DNA lesion <italic>in vivo</italic>. Is Rad26p recruited to the DNA lesion after the disassembly of RNA polymerase II? We rule out this possibility, based on the fact that the DNA lesion at the coding sequence of inactive gene fails to recruit Rad26p. Thus, Rad26p is recruited to the site of DNA lesion prior to the disassembly of elongating RNA polymerase II.</p><p>Following its recruitment, how does Rad26p participate in DNA repair? Rad26p has a DNA-dependent ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">100</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">101</xref>), and thus, upon its recruitment to the site of DNA lesion, Rad26p might be altering the chromatin structure around the damaged DNA, hence facilitating the access of the DNA repair factors to the site of DNA lesion. Indeed, a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>) has demonstrated the requirement of the chromatin remodeling activity of Rad26p in DNA repair. Furthermore, Rad26p might be contributing to the DNA repair process by recruiting DNA repair factors through its direct physical interaction. In support of this model, several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79 B80 B81">79&#x02013;81</xref>) have previously demonstrated the physical interaction of Rad26p with Rad3p. Rad3p, in turn, facilitates the incision of the DNA strand containing the lesion for subsequent steps of DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>). Thus, Rad26p appears to facilitate DNA repair at the coding sequences of the active genes by modulating the chromatin structure to enhance recruitment of the DNA repair factors and/or by directly interacting with the DNA repair factor(s). However, this model remains to be elucidated <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1147/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>American Heart Association - National Scientist Development Grant (0635008N); American Cancer Society - Research Scholar Grant (06-52); an Edward Mallinckrodt, Jr. Foundation award; a Southern Illinois University Cancer Institute - RFA Grant; several internal grants of Southern Illinois University; pre-doctoral fellowship (0710187Z) from American Heart Association (to A.S.).
