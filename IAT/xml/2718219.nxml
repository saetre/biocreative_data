The situation is unclear for membrane-anchored proteins such as SNAREs, which are anchored to the membrane by their TMD at the C-terminus. For example, in plants, Sec22 and SYP31 (a yeast Sed5 homologue) have a 17 aa TMD but different locations (ER/Golgi and Golgi), indicating that TMD length alone is not sufficient to explain their targeting. To establish the identity of factors that influence SNARE targeting, mutagenesis and live cell imaging experiments were performed on SYP31. It was found that deletion of the entire N-terminus domain of SYP31 blocked the protein in the ER. Several deletion mutants of different parts of this N-terminus domain indicated that a region between the SNARE helices Hb and Hc is required for Golgi targeting. In this region, replacement of the aa sequence MELAD by GAGAG or MALAG retained the protein in the ER, suggesting that MELAD may function as a di-acidic ER export motif EXXD. This suggestion was further verified by replacing the established di-acidic ER export motif DLE of a type II Golgi protein <italic>At</italic>CASP and a membrane-anchored type I chimaera, TMcCCASP, by MELAD or GAGAG. The MELAD motif allowed the proteins to reach the Golgi, whereas the motif GAGAG was found to be insufficient to facilitate ER protein export. Our analyses indicate that we have identified a novel and transplantable di-acidic motif that facilitates ER export of SYP31 and may function for type I and type II proteins in plants.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Di-acidic motif</kwd><kwd>ER export</kwd><kwd>ER&#x02013;Golgi interface</kwd><kwd>SNARE</kwd><kwd>syntaxin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>SNAREs (<underline>s</underline>oluble <underline>N</underline>-ethyl-maleimide sensitive factor <underline>a</underline>ttachment <underline>re</underline>ceptor proteins) are critical components of the molecular machinery that facilitates vesicular transport in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hong, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lipka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moreau <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). These proteins favour membrane fusion of apposing lipid bilayers, and contribute to the targeting of membrane components through the secretory pathway. SNAREs are engaged in several processes in plant biology (cell growth and development, autophagy, gravitropism, stress responses, and resistance to pathogens) that are related directly or indirectly to their fusogenic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pratelli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Surpin and Raikhel, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Most SNAREs and SYP31 are type IV proteins anchored to the membrane via a C-terminal (C-ter) transmembrane domain (TMD) anchor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borgese <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burri and Lithgow, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chou and Shen, 2007</xref>); only a few SNAREs are either isoprenylated or bi-palmitoylated (e.g. SNAP-25) to be anchored to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hong, 2005</xref>). SNAREs are also characterised by (i) a basic domain close to the membrane, (ii) one, or rarely two SNARE motifs (coiled-coil domains), which are responsible for SNARE pairing and membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), and (iii) a regulatory N-terminal (N-ter) domain. Although the central role of SNAREs in membrane fusion has been largely investigated, only a few studies have been devoted to the question of how these proteins are targeted to specific membranes. For Ykt6, a C-ter isoprenylated SNARE, targeting is dependent on the N-ter longin domain and not driven by the isoprenylation itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hasegawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). It has also been proposed that the longin domain may interact with a targeting component on the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hasegawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>In the case of type IV SNARE proteins (C-ter TMD anchor), it is clear that the length of their TMD is not sufficient to explain their location. Although TMD influences the localization of type I membrane proteins depending on their length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandizzi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002<italic>a</italic></xref>), this criterion seems not to be sufficient to explain most of the locations of the ER/Golgi SNAREs which have a different topology from type I with the N-ter facing the cytosol. For type I membrane protein, a 17 amino acid (aa) TMD caused protein retention in the ER; whereas a 20 aa and a 23 aa TMDs caused protein re-distribution to the Golgi and the plasma membrane, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandizzi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002<italic>a</italic></xref>). However, in yeast, Bet1, Gos1, Sft1, and Sed5 that have a 15 aa TMD are located in the Golgi whereas Sec22 and Slt1, which are located in the ER, have a 19&#x02013;20 aa TMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burri and Lithgow, 2004</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, Sec22 and SYP31 (homologue to Sed5) have both a 17 aa TMD and different subcellular localizations, Sec22 in the ER/Golgi and SYP31 in the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uemura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chatre <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Although for type II TMD proteins, such as plant glycosyltransferases, some correlation was found between TMD length and ER/intraGolgi distribution (Saint-Jore Dupas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006), the correct targeting and subcompartmentation of these proteins in the early secretory pathway was also dependent on other signals present in their cytoplasmic tail (Saint-Jore Dupas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hanton <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref> showed that di-acidic DXE motifs can be functional in type I, type II, and multispanning membrane proteins. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yuasa <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref> found that a di-basic motif is involved in the ER export of the type II protein prolyl 4-hydroxylase. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schoberer <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref> have determined that single basic amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of N-glycan-processing enzymes are responsible for their ER export to the Golgi. In addition, the entire cytosolic N-ter longin domains of the vacuolar VAMP7 SNAREs appeared to be critical for their targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Uemura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Finally, it has also been shown that the longin domain of Sec22 can be critical for ER export in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Several ER export motifs have been shown to overcome the influence of the TMD on protein targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hanton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yuasa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Matheson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). However, the influence of such peptides on SNARE trafficking has yet to be demonstrated.</p><p>SYP31 is a type IV syntaxin that is required for anterograde trafficking between the ER and the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bubeck <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) and is localized in the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chatre <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bubeck <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In this work, it was investigated whether the N-ter cytosolic domain of SYP31 (beyond the SNARE domain) is required for ER export of this syntaxin to the Golgi. Deletions and mutations were used to screen the entire cytosolic N-ter domain sequence of SYP31 for its role in ER export to the Golgi. Deletion mutants in the N-ter domain indicated that a region between the helices Hb and Hc was required for Golgi targeting. In this region, it was found that the pentapeptide MELAD contains a novel di-acidic motif EXXD.

Therefore, a YFP fusion of a SNARE domain deletion of SYP31 was analysed first. Live cell imaging analyses of cells expressing this construct showed that the protein was exported to the Golgi (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp155/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S2</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). This result suggests that the SNARE domain of SYP31 is not required for ER export. We therefore focused on the reminder of the N-ter cytosolic part of SYP31. For this, several deletion and missense mutant forms of a SYP31-YFP construct (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>) were produced.

To determine whether this MELAD motif is involved in ER export of SYP31 to the Golgi, this sequence was replaced by GAGAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp155/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S3</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online).

A Golgi location of SYP31 was found from 24 h and 48 h of expression (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp155/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S5A, B</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online), whereas the ER location for the GAGAG mutant form was observed throughout this time period (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp155/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S5C, D</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online).

The pixel intensity was quantified within regions of interest of similar areas (see Materials and methods). For this, fluorescence intensities of 600 Golgi and ER regions were quantified in cells expressing either wild-type SYP31&#x02013;YFP or the SYP31<sup>GAGAG</sup> mutant. In order to be able to compare and validate the quantifications, cells with similar levels of fluorescence were used. This was established by comparing the average pixel intensity of the fluorescence associated with membranes. Therefore any difference in subcellular location cannot be attributed to a putative different saturation of the secretory pathway. The results were expressed as the ER/Golgi fluorescence intensity ratios. As expected with the wild-type protein construct SYP31, no fluorescence was found in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). By contrast, the fluorescence ratio of ER/Golgi reached a value of about 1 for the SYP31<sup>GAGAG</sup> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), confirming our qualitative observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2H</xref>) that the ER export of this mutant is defective.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Fluorescence intensity quantification of the localization of the wt SYP31, and the GAGAG and MALAG mutant constructs expressed in tobacco leaf epidermal cells.

The presence of an ER export signal either in the SNARE domain itself or in the cytoplasmic section of SYP31 is hypothesized. It has been shown that the SNARE motif of the rat Bet1 is required for its intracellular targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Joglekar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Similarly, a 10 aa stretch in the SNARE domain of Sec22 has been reported to be involved in efficient ER export of this v-SNARE in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Deletion of the SNARE domain did not result in ER retention of the constructs, ruling out a role for the SNARE domain in ER export to the Golgi, as has also been found for the animal homologue syntaxin 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Joglekar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>We found that deletion of the M domain comprising amino acids 108&#x02013;128 in the N-ter cytosolic section of SYP31 resulted in a redistribution of the construct to the ER. Within the M domain, the presence of a putative di-acidic motif (M)ELAD(G) of the type EXXD was identified. This motif was able to replace the DXE motif in a putative Golgi matrix protein and, as determined for the DXE motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hanton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), it was able to function in both orientations. Although the EXXD motif seemed weaker than the DXE motif in the type I and type II versions of CASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figs 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), it remained functional, overcoming the 17 aa TMD present in CASP that would be expected to retain the protein in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandizzi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002<italic>a</italic></xref>). Consequently, even though the EXXD motif seems weaker than the DXE in driving export out of the ER, the signal is hierarchically stronger than TMD length.</p><p>Interestingly, deletion of the entire N-ter cytosolic section up to the SNARE domain did not lead to a total retention/block of SYP31 in the ER (see the few dots and/or putative clustered Golgi stacks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>). This is reminiscent of what was observed for GONST1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hanton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), suggesting that, although the di-acidic motif can clearly contribute to the export of SYP31 out of the ER to the Golgi, other attributes may influence protein targeting. In adddition, the decrease of SYP31 transport to the Golgi, as quantified in this study, may have been underestimated for two reasons: (i) overexpression of the constructs may have favoured their diffusion through the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cosson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), and (ii) ER export sites are closely associated with the Golgi at the resolution of confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">daSilva <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and the puncta quantified as Golgi may have been, in fact, a mixture of Golgi bodies and ER export sites, therefore contributing towards an underestimation of the capacity of the di-acidic motif EXXD to drive SYP31 out of the ER. In spite of these methological limitations, our data clearly establish the function of the di-acidic motif EXXD in SYP31 for export of the protein out of the ER.</p><p>That a di-acidic motif contributes to ER export and Golgi targeting of SYP31 may imply an interaction of this motif with the COPII machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Votsmeier and Gallwitz, 2001</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hanton <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref> have shown that the recruitment of the Sec24 COPII coat protein to ER export sites is influenced by the expression of membrane cargo proteins, and that this recruitment can also be signal-dependent since TMcCCASP (with a functional DXE sequence), but not the non-functional mutant form TMcCCASP<sup>DXE1</sup>, induced the recruitment of Sec24. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sieben <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> demonstrated <italic>in vivo</italic> by a FRET approach that the interaction between the K<sup>+</sup> channel KAT1 protein and Sec24 required a di-acidic ER export motif. In addition, the work conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schoberer <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref> has suggested that single basic amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of N-glycan processing enzymes may interact with the COPII machinery for their ER export. It is therefore possible to envisage an interaction between SYP31 and Sec24 for its export out of the ER to reach the Golgi. A very close EXXD motif [(M)ELAD(L)] has recently been found in the SREBP escort protein Scap, and to be required for interaction with Sec23/Sec24 in animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sun <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). A specific interaction of Sed5 (yeast homologue of SYP31) with Sec24 has also been demonstrated in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peng <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), but whether this interaction was involved in the transport of Sed5 itself to the Golgi, in the selection of other cargo proteins, or in the targeting of COPII vesicles to the Golgi was not clear. The latter assumption is highly speculative since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao <italic>et al.</italic> (1998)</xref> reported that the docking of ER-derived vesicles in yeast was independent of SNARE proteins, and it has been reported that Sed5 is not required on the donor vesicle for Golgi fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>At least three independent cargo-binding sites have been demonstrated for the yeast Sec24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mossessova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003, 2005</xref>). It has been shown that the &#x02018;A-site&#x02019; and the &#x02018;B-site&#x02019; of Sec24 can interact with the Sed5 YNNSNPF and LXXLE motifs, respectively. The &#x02018;B-site&#x02019; of Sec24 can also interact with the DXE motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mossessova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). By comparing the sequences of Sed5 and SYP31, the sequences SSNPF (aa 192&#x02013;196), and LPPL (aa 204&#x02013;207)/MEMSLL (aa 231-236) in SYP31 are suggested as candidate motifs for interaction with the &#x02018;A-site&#x02019; and the &#x02018;B-site&#x02019; of Sec24, respectively. By analogy with yeast, it is hypothesized that the &#x02018;B-site&#x02019; of the plant Sec24 may interact with both the LPPL (aa 204&#x02013;207)/MEMSLL (aa 231&#x02013;236) sequences and the EXXD di-acidic motif of SYP31. It is also envisaged that the &#x02018;B-site&#x02019; of Sec24 would have access to the di-acidic EXXD motif of SYP31 in its ER conformation, and that the &#x02018;B-site&#x02019; of Sec24 would have access to the LPPL (aa 204&#x02013;207)/MEMSLL (aa 231&#x02013;236) sequences of SYP31 in its Golgi conformation (SNARE complex). As a consequence, a defined site in Sec24 may compete for different target motifs in SYP31 according to the subcellular location, the function, and environment of the target protein concerned.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp155/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp155/DC1">Table S1.</ext-link></bold> A.
