Deletion of either <italic>RPS0</italic> gene reduces growth rate, while deletion of both is lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c1">1</xref>). The Rps0 proteins are required for the maturation of the 3&#x02032; end of 18S rRNA. Specifically, Rps0 proteins are needed for efficient processing of the 20S rRNA precursor to 18S rRNA, a late step in the maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c3">3</xref>).</p><p>The yeast Rps0 proteins have over 60&#x00025; sequence identity with mammalian p40 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c1">1</xref>). The mammalian p40 proteins are associated with 40S ribosomal subunits, and both p40 and Rps0 proteins belong to the S2 family of ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c5">5</xref>). Members of the S2 family have been identified in all major lines of descent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c6">6</xref>). Given the high level of sequence conservation among S2 family members, it is likely that these proteins have conserved functions.</p><p>Numerous studies have linked mammalian p40 proteins to tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c14">14</xref>). The role of the p40 protein in tumor development is generally considered in the context of its function as a putative precursor to the high affinity laminin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c15">15</xref>). However, whether p40 functions as a laminin receptor precursor is controversial, and recent developments suggest that the role of p40 in tumorigenesis may be related to its function as a component of the translational machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c16">16</xref>). Studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have shown that recessive lethal mutations that severely reduce expression of the p40 protein give rise to a tumorous phenotype in hematopoietic organs during larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c17">17</xref>). A similar phenotype is observed in cells with mutant alleles of the gene encoding ribosomal protein Rps21. Moreover, depletion of both p40 and Rps21 proteins produces a more pronounced tumorous phenotype than depletion of either protein alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c17">17</xref>).</p><p>Mutations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes encoding components of the translational machinery generally result in a <italic>Minute</italic> phenotype characterized by small body size, delayed development, and short slender bristles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c18">18</xref>). While dominant mutations in p40 and Rps21 genes that result in haploinsufficiency display <italic>Minute</italic> phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c19">19</xref>), recessive phenotypes brought on by further reductions in expression of these proteins cause excessive cell proliferation and tissue overgrowth. The recessive phenotypes observed in p40 and Rps21 mutants are distinct from phenotypes reported for other ribosomal protein genes, thereby genetically linking the p40 and Rps21 proteins together and setting them apart from other ribosomal components. The observations that both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human p40 and Rps21 proteins physically interact provide further evidence linking these two ribosomal proteins together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c20">20</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> genome contains duplicated genes that encode members of the Rps21 family of ribosomal proteins. Here, we report that the disruption of the <italic>RPS21A</italic> or <italic>RPS21B</italic> gene results in a reduction in growth rate and a decrease in the steady-state level of 40S ribosomal subunits. Cells lacking both <italic>RPS21A</italic> and <italic>RPS21B</italic> genes are not viable, indicating that the Rps21 proteins are essential. The Rps21 proteins, like the Rps0 proteins, are required for efficient processing of the 20S rRNA precursor at the D cleavage site which gives rise to the mature 3&#x02032; end of 18S rRNA. Both Rps21 and Rps0 proteins are also needed for efficient processing at the A<sub>2</sub> cleavage site in the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region of the rRNA precursor transcript. Thus, in addition to studies that genetically and physically link the Rps21 and Rps0/p40 proteins, these data indicate that the two families of proteins are functionally related.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast and bacterial strains</title><p>The yeast strains used in this study were YMW1 (MAT<bold>a</bold>/MAT&#x003b1; <italic>ade2-1/ade2-1 ade3</italic>&#x00394; <italic>22/ade3</italic>&#x00394; <italic>22 can1-100/can1-100 his3-11,15/his3-11,15 leu2-3/leu2-3 trp1-1/trp1-1 ura3-1/ura3-1</italic>), W3031B (MAT&#x003b1; <italic>ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11,15 leu2-3 trp1-1 ura3-1</italic>), W3031A (MAT<bold>a</bold><italic>ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11,15 leu2-3 trp1-1 ura3-1</italic>), 1&#x02013;111x12 (MAT<bold>a</bold>/MAT&#x003b1; <italic>ade2-1/ade2-1 can1-100/can1-100 his3-11,15/his3-11,15 leu2-3/leu2-3 trp1-1/trp1-1 ura3-1/ura3-1 RPS21A/rps21A:: kanMX6</italic>), W8-3dx (MAT&#x003b1; <italic>ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11,15, ura3-1 leu2-3 trp1-1 rps0A::URA3</italic>) and W8-3dy (MAT<bold>a</bold><italic>ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11,15 ura3-1 leu2-3 trp1-1 rps0B:: HIS3</italic>).

The yeast Rps21A/B proteins are composed of 87 amino acids and have over 98&#x00025; sequence identity. The yeast proteins have over 55&#x00025; sequence identity with mammalian and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Rps21 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c17">17</xref>). This protein family appears restricted to the eukaryotic lineage and is distinct from the ribosomal protein S21 family in eubacteria.</p><p>The <italic>RPS21</italic> genes were disrupted either alone or together to determine if these genes are required for yeast cell growth and division. A diploid strain harboring heterozygous alleles <italic>RPS21A/rps21A::kanMX6</italic> and <italic>RPS21B/rsp21B::kanMX4</italic> was sporulated and tetrads dissected. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f1">1</xref> shows that disruption of either <italic>RPS21</italic> gene reduces the growth rate relative to the wild type, and that double mutants fail to germinate.</p><p>The effects of the <italic>RPS21A/B</italic> disruptions are similar to phenotypes reported for strains harboring disrupted alleles of either <italic>RPS0A</italic> or <italic>RPS0B</italic> and other essential ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c1">1</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, reduced expression of Rps21 and p40 (the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of Rps0A/B) enhances the tumorous phenotype beyond that observed with a reduction in either protein alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c17">17</xref>). Therefore, we sought to determine whether the yeast <italic>RPS21</italic> and <italic>RPS0</italic> genes displayed genetic interactions. Diploid strains heterozygous for <italic>RPS21A/rps21A:: kanMX6</italic> and <italic>RPS0A/rps0A::URA3</italic> alleles or <italic>RPS21A/rps21A::kanMX6</italic> and <italic>RPS0B/rps0B::HIS3</italic> alleles were sporulated and tetrads dissected. Growth rates of haploid progeny revealed that the effects of the <italic>RPS0A</italic> and <italic>RPS0B</italic> disruptions on growth rate were generally more severe than that of the <italic>RPS21A</italic> disruption (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg899tb1">1</xref>). Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg899tb1">1</xref> also shows that combining the <italic>RPS21A</italic> disruption with either <italic>RPS0A</italic> or <italic>RPS0B</italic> disruptions did not reveal a stronger phenotype than the <italic>RPS0</italic> disruptions alone, indicating that unlike the case in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mutant alleles of <italic>RPS21</italic> and <italic>RPS0</italic> family members in yeast do not enhance one another phenotypically.</p><p>To determine if the decrease in growth rate in <italic>RPS21</italic> mutants is due to a defect in some aspect of ribosome synthesis or function, we examined polysome profiles in these strains. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f2">2</xref> shows that relative to the wild type, the strain containing the <italic>rps21A::kanMX6</italic> allele has a reduced level of free 40S subunits, a reduction in the amount of large polysomes, and an increase in the amount of free 60S subunits. Similar results are observed for strains with a disrupted <italic>RPS21B</italic> allele (included in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f7">7</xref>). These data indicate that the decreased growth rates of strains containing disrupted alleles of <italic>RPS21A</italic> and <italic>RPS21B</italic> are linked to reductions in the amount of 40S ribosomal subunits.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the Rps0 proteins are required for maturation of 18S rRNA in the yeast rRNA processing pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c2">2</xref>). To determine whether the Rps21 proteins are also required for maturation of 18S rRNA, northern analysis was performed on strains derived from a tetrad exhibiting a tetratype segregation pattern of heterozygous <italic>RPS21A/rps21A::kanMX6</italic> and <italic>RPS0B/rps0B::HIS3</italic> alleles. Total RNA from each strain was fractionated on formaldehyde&#x02013;agarose gels, transferred to a solid support, and hybridized with oligonucleotides, described in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f3">3</xref>. Oligonucleotide 2, which hybridizes to mature 18S rRNA, shows a reduction in signal by 20&#x02013;40&#x00025; in <italic>RPS21A</italic> and <italic>RPS0B</italic> mutants relative to the wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f4">4</xref>A), consistent with the lower levels of 40S subunits observed in strains with disrupted alleles of <italic>RPS21A</italic> and <italic>RPS0B</italic>. A similar decrease in 18S rRNA is seen in the double mutant. Oligonucleotide 4, which hybridizes between the A<sub>2</sub> and A<sub>3</sub> cleavage sites within ITS1, shows a decreased signal for 27A<sub>2</sub> rRNA in mutants relative to the wild type, and a corresponding increase in a species that is most likely 21S rRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f4">4</xref>B). 21S rRNA extends from the 5&#x02032; end of mature 18S rRNA to the A<sub>3</sub> cleavage site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f3">3</xref>). This assignment was confirmed by showing that oligonucleotides upstream of the A<sub>1</sub> cleavage site and downstream of A<sub>3</sub> did not hybridize efficiently with this species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f4">4</xref>C and D). These data indicate that cleavage at the A<sub>2</sub> site in ITS1 is affected by the <italic>RSP0B</italic> and <italic>RPS21A</italic> disruptions.</p><p>In the absence of A<sub>2</sub> cleavage, processing within ITS1 occurs at the A<sub>3</sub> site generating 27SA<sub>3</sub> rRNA, which is rapidly processed by the exosome to 27SB<sub>S</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c27">27</xref>). The rapid processing of 27SA<sub>3</sub> by the exosome is responsible for the low steady-state levels of 27SA<sub>3</sub> observed in both mutants and wild-type strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f4">4</xref>D). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f4">4</xref>E shows a modest reduction in all 27S rRNA species in mutants relative to the wild type. Oligonucleotide 6, used in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f4">4</xref>E, hybridizes to sequences in ITS2. In mutant strains the predominant species recognized by this oligonucleotide is 27SB<sub>S</sub>, whereas in wild-type cells this oligonucleotide detects relatively high levels of both 27SA<sub>2</sub> and 27SB<sub>S</sub>. The global decrease in 27S rRNAs in mutants is likely to be the result of observed coupling between A<sub>2</sub> cleavage and cleavages at A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>0</sub> sites within the 5&#x02032; external transcribed spacer (ETS). Reduced cleavages at each of these sites gives rise to the increase in 35S rRNA in mutants relative to the wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f4">4</xref>B&#x02013;E). Thus, flux through the entire rRNA processing pathway is affected in the <italic>RPS0B</italic> and <italic>RPS21A</italic> mutants, resulting in lower levels of all 27S rRNA species.</p><p>Although flux through the entire rRNA processing pathway is affected in the <italic>RPS0B</italic> and <italic>RPS21A</italic> mutants, polysome profiles show a preferential reduction in 40S subunits relative to 60S subunits. This observation is routinely observed in mutants defective in A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> cleavages, since 35S precursors cleaved directly at the A<sub>3</sub> site can still give rise to 5.8S and 25S rRNA. 18S rRNA precursors generated by cleavage at A<sub>3</sub>, on the other hand, are inefficiently processed to 18S rRNA, accounting for the preferential reduction in 40S subunits in these mutants. Mutants defective in A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> cleavages have decreased levels of both 20S and 18S rRNA precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c30">30</xref>). 20S rRNA is the immediate precursor to 18S rRNA in the normal processing pathway (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f3">3</xref>). The 20S precursor has a mature 5&#x02032; end and is extended through the mature 3&#x02032; end of 18S rRNA to the A<sub>2</sub> cleavage site. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f4">4</xref>F shows that rather than a decrease in 20S rRNA as would be expected in strains defective in A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> cleavages, there is an increase in 20S rRNA in the <italic>RPS0B</italic> and <italic>RPS21A</italic> mutants. These data indicate that in addition to affecting cleavage at A<sub>2</sub>, the <italic>RPS0B</italic> and <italic>RPS21A</italic> mutants may also affect cleavage at site D, which gives rise to the mature 3&#x02032; end of 18S rRNA.</p><p>Since the 20S and 21S rRNA species are not resolved under the conditions used in the experiments described above, and oligonucleotide 3 recognizes both 20S and 21S rRNAs, it is possible that increased signal in the 20/21S region observed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f4">4</xref>F could be the result of an increase in 21S rRNA rather than 20S rRNA. If so, the data would indicate that it is A<sub>2</sub> cleavage alone, rather than cleavage at D and A<sub>2</sub>, that is affected by the Rps0 and Rps21 proteins. To facilitate the comparison between 20/21S and 21S signals in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f4">4</xref>B and F, respectively, signals in each panel were normalized through the 32/35S species, which hybridize with both oligonucleotides 3 and 4. The normalized data derived after phosphorimage analysis is shown below each lane in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f4">4</xref>B and F. It is apparent from this analysis that the 20/21S signals in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f4">4</xref>F are considerably greater than the 21S signals in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f4">4</xref>B. This difference is a reflection of the relative rates of A<sub>2</sub> versus A<sub>3</sub> cleavage of the 32S rRNA under normal conditions, which gives rise to high steady-state levels of 20S relative to 21S intermediates in the rRNA processing pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c31">31</xref>). Further analysis reveals that signals derived from Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f4">4</xref>B corresponding to 21S rRNA alone could account for at most 30&#x02013;40&#x00025; of increase in the combined 20S/21S hybridization signal observed in mutants (lanes 2&#x02013;4) relative to the wild type (lane 1) in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f4">4</xref>F.</p><p>Support for the conclusion that mutations in the <italic>RPS0</italic> and <italic>RPS21</italic> genes increase both 20S and 21S rRNA levels comes from the observation that mutations in another ribosomal protein gene, <italic>RPS18B</italic>, increase 21S rRNA without increasing 20S rRNA. A diploid strain heterozygous at the <italic>RPS18B</italic> and <italic>RPS21B</italic> loci was created to compare rRNA processing in <italic>RPS18B</italic> mutants with a representative mutant where both 20S and 21S rRNAs increase. This diploid was sporulated and the resulting tetrads dissected. One of the tetrads exhibiting a tetratype segregation pattern was used for northern analysis. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f5">5</xref>A shows that the 21S rRNA precursor is increased in strains harboring disrupted alleles of either <italic>RPS18B</italic> or <italic>RPS21B</italic>. In contrast, the increase in 20S/21S hybridization signal observed in strains with the disrupted <italic>RPS21B</italic> allele is not observed in the strain containing the <italic>RPS18B</italic> disruption alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f5">5</xref>B). Similar results were observed for the <italic>RPS18A</italic> gene (data not shown). These data indicate that in contrast to results obtained for the <italic>RPS0</italic> and <italic>RPS21</italic> genes where cleavages at both sites A<sub>2</sub> and D are affected, disruption of <italic>RPS18B</italic> affects cleavage at the A<sub>2</sub> site with little or no influence on processing at site D.</p><p>Cleavage at site D is the only rRNA processing step that occurs in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c26">26</xref>). Therefore, the increase in 20S rRNA observed in <italic>RPS0</italic> and <italic>RPS21</italic> mutants could be the consequence of inefficient transport of 40S subunit precursors from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm, or it could represent a direct effect on D site cleavage. To distinguish between these possibilities, we compared the distribution of rRNA precursors in total and cytoplasmic extracts of wild-type and mutant strains. Cytoplasmic extracts with minimal nuclear contamination were prepared using the procedure of Udem and Warner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c26">26</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f6">6</xref>A shows that, as expected, mature 18S rRNA is found in both total and cytoplasmic extracts from wild-type and mutant strains. In contrast, 21S rRNA is under- represented in cytoplasmic extracts relative to 18S rRNA, consistent with a predominantly nucleolar localization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f6">6</xref>B). The signal in the 20S/21S region in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f6">6</xref>A and C that is found in roughly equal proportions to 18S rRNA in total and cytoplasmic RNAs is therefore primarily derived from the 20S rRNA precursor. The 20S to 18S ratio is greater in the mutant strains relative to the wild type in both total and cytoplasmic extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f6">6</xref>). The decrease in this ratio in cytoplasmic relative to total RNA extracts reflects the additional contribution of the predominantly nucleolar 21S rRNA to the total RNA. These data demonstrate that the bulk of the 20S rRNA in mutant and wild-type strains is localized to the cytoplasm and as such, the increased 20S rRNA observed in the <italic>RPS0B</italic> and <italic>RPS21A</italic> mutants is a result of inefficient cleavage at site D as opposed to a block in nucleolus to cytoplasm transport.</p><p>Previous results have shown that the 20S rRNA that accumulates in <italic>RPS0</italic>-disrupted strains is under-represented in polysomes relative to 18S rRNA, indicating 40S precursors containing 20S rRNA have reduced or no translational activity compared with mature 40S subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c2">2</xref>). To address the translational activity of 40S subunit precursors that accumulate in <italic>RPS21</italic>-disrupted strains, extracts from an <italic>RPS21B</italic>-disrupted strain were fractionated on sucrose gradients and analyzed by northern blotting. Hybridization of RNAs from gradient fractions with oligonucleotide 2 shows that 18S rRNA is found in 40S, 80S and polysome fractions with the bulk of the 18S rRNA signal in polysomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f7">7</xref>, top). Also evident in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f7">7</xref>, top, is a signal just above 18S rRNA that is most abundant in fraction 4 on the leading edge of the 40S subunit peak. This signal is derived from immature 40S subunits containing 18S rRNA precursors. Hybridization with oligonucleotide 3 shows that the signal for 20S/21S rRNAs is most abundant in fractions 4 and 5 with relatively low amounts in 80S and polysome fractions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f7">7</xref>, middle). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f7">7</xref>, bottom, shows that a small amount of the 20S/21S signal in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f7">7</xref>, middle, is derived from 21S rRNA, with the bulk of this signal in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f7">7</xref>, middle, representing 20S rRNA. Whether the small amount of 21S rRNA-containing precursor is in the cytoplasm or instead, localized to the nucleolus, is unknown since other nucleolar precursors 27SA<sub>2</sub>, 32S and 35S rRNA precursors are also detected in the gradient. The fact that 20S and 21S rRNAs are under-represented in the 80S peak and polysomes relative to 18S rRNA indicates that immature subunits containing these rRNA precursors have little or no translational activity. Thus, the Rps21 proteins play a role similar to the Rps0 proteins in defining the level of active 40S subunits within yeast cells.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The results reported here indicate that the yeast Rps0 and Rps21 proteins have overlapping functions in the maturation of the 3&#x02032; end of 18S rRNA. The effects of <italic>RPS21</italic> disruptions on the protein synthetic apparatus in yeast are similar to those reported previously for the <italic>RPS0</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c1">1</xref>). In each case, the amount of 40S subunits decreases, larger polysomes are reduced, and the level of free 60S subunits increases. The reduced amounts of 40S subunits in strains disrupted in either of the <italic>RPS0</italic> or <italic>RPS21</italic> genes result from defects in rRNA processing and 40S subunit maturation. Specifically, these mutant strains are defective in processing of rRNA precursors at the A<sub>2</sub> and D cleavage sites involved in forming the mature 3&#x02032; end of 18S rRNA.</p><p>The Rps0 and Rps21 proteins could exert their effects on processing the 3&#x02032; end of 18S rRNA by direct interactions with rRNA precursors that facilitate cleavage at the D and A<sub>2</sub> sites in ITS1, or through more general effects on small subunit structure. The observation that disruption of another small subunit ribosomal protein gene, <italic>RPS18B</italic>, affects processing at the A<sub>2</sub> site without affecting cleavage at site D indicates that the influence of small subunit proteins on cleavages at these sites should be considered separately.</p><p>Analysis of structure of small ribosomal subunits suggests that the influence of the Rps0 and Rps21 proteins on cleavage at site D may be more direct, whereas their influence on cleavage at site A<sub>2</sub> may have more to do with more general aspects of subunit structure. Cryo-EM structures of the yeast 40S subunit place the Rps0 proteins on the solvent surface near the mRNA exit channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c32">32</xref>). This region contains the 3&#x02032; end of the 18S rRNA. However, these are relatively low-resolution structures that do not provide detail regarding the relationship between the Rps0 proteins and the 3&#x02032; end of 18S rRNA. The structure of the <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> 30S ribosomal subunit, on the other hand, has been solved at 3&#x000a0;&#x0212b; resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c33">33</xref>). This subunit contains ribosomal protein S2, the bacterial homolog of the Rps0 proteins. S2 is located on the solvent surface of the bacterial 30S subunit, at the base of head, near the bottom of the cleft in a position analogous to that of the Rps0 proteins on the yeast 40S subunit (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f8">8</xref>). The 3&#x02032; end of 16S rRNA enters the cleft from the subunit interface in a 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; orientation, and terminates within the cleft before exiting to the solvent surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c34">34</xref>). The bacterial S2 protein does not appear to be close enough to make contact with the 3&#x02032; end of mature 16S rRNA, but is positioned in such a manner that it could make contact with 3&#x02032; extended precursors. If a similar relationship were to occur in the yeast 40S subunit, the Rps0 proteins would be in a position to interact with sequences in ITS1 and promote cleavage at the D site.</p><p>The Rps18B protein, on the other hand, is homologous to ribosomal protein S13, which is located on the subunit interface of the <italic>T.thermophilus</italic> 30S subunit at the top of the head (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg899f8">8</xref>). This location places S13 on the surface of the small subunit opposite that of the 3&#x02032; end of small subunit rRNA. Thus, the effect of Rps18B on cleavage at site A<sub>2</sub> is likely to be indirect and related to some more general aspect of small subunit structure required for efficient processing at this site within the nucleolus. The effect of the Rps0 and Rps21 proteins on cleavage at A<sub>2</sub> site indicates that they too influence aspects of small subunit structure within the nucleolus that are necessary for efficient processing at this site.</p><p>In contrast to the Rps0 and Rps18 proteins, the Rps21 proteins have not been localized on the yeast 40S subunit, nor do they have a homolog on the bacterial 30S subunit from which their location could be inferred. It is known, however, that human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rps21 proteins physically interact with homologs of the Rps0 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c20">20</xref>). This observation suggests that the Rps0 and Rps21 proteins may make contact with one another on the 40S subunit. In this context, cryo-EM models of the yeast 40S subunit have a region of electron density just above the Rps0 proteins that is not accounted for in homology models with the bacterial 30S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c32">32</xref>). This electron density may be derived from the Rps21 proteins. In the bacterial structure, this region contains the H35&#x02013;H37 helices of the 3&#x02032; major domain of 16S rRNA that interact with an extended coiled-coil motif in the S2 protein. The S2 protein makes relatively few contacts with 16S rRNA, and of these, the strongest interactions are formed between the coiled-coil domain and the H35&#x02013;H37 helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c35">35</xref>). Intriguingly, the coiled-coil structure present in bacterial S2 proteins is absent in eukaryotic members of this family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c36">36</xref>). The absence of this domain would presumably make the eukaryotic S2-like proteins more dependent on protein&#x02013;protein interactions for their incorporation into 40S subunits. If so, an Rps0/Rps21 interaction could potentially compensate for the protein&#x02013;RNA interaction lost by the absence of the coiled-coil domain in Rps0 proteins. One explanation for the similar effects of <italic>RPS0</italic> and <italic>RPS21</italic> deletions on rRNA processing is therefore that the Rps21 proteins are involved in the binding of Rps0 proteins to the 40S ribosomal subunit.</p><p>How a severe reduction in the amounts of p40/Rps0 and Rps21 proteins leads to a loss of control of cellular proliferation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is unknown but may be relevant to human disease since the human p40 gene is found on the short arm of chromosome 3 in a region frequently subject to loss of heterozygosity in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c37">37</xref>). Recent results have provided intriguing links between factors involved in ribosome synthesis and cancer susceptibility syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c38">38</xref>). Dyskeratosis congenita is caused by mutations in <italic>DSK1</italic>, which encodes a pseudouracil synthase required for rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c39">39</xref>). Similarly, cartilage hair hypoplasia has been shown to result from mutations in the RNA subunit of RNase MRP, an endonuclease involved in rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c40">40</xref>). Finally, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, which has an associated increase in cancer incidence, has been linked to mutations in the gene encoding ribosomal protein S19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg899c42">42</xref>). Whether the link between disruption of ribosome synthesis and cancer susceptibility is general and potentially includes the hundreds of factors involved in ribosome assembly, processing, and transport or is instead restricted to particular aspects of the overall process of ribosome synthesis and function remains an open question.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg899f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Strains with disrupted alleles of <italic>RPS21A</italic> and <italic>RPS21B</italic> are not viable.
