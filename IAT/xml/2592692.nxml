These motors crosslink and slide microtubules in the spindle. Kinesin-5 motors are phosphorylated at a conserved site by Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) during mitosis. <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> kinesin-5 has also been reported to be phosphorylated by Aurora A <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We investigate here the effect of these phosphorylations on kinesin-5 from <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, called Eg5. We find that phosphorylation at threonine 937 in the C-terminal tail of Eg5 by Cdk1 does not affect the velocity of Eg5, but strongly increases its binding to microtubules assembled in buffer. Likewise, this phosphorylation promotes binding of Eg5 to microtubules in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract spindles. This enhancement of binding elevates the amount of Eg5 in spindles above a critical level required for bipolar spindle formation. We find furthermore that phosphorylation of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> Eg5 by Aurora A at serine 543 in the stalk is not required for spindle formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>These results show that phosphorylation of Eg5 by Cdk1 has a direct effect on the interaction of this motor with microtubules. In egg extract, phosphorylation of Eg5 by Cdk1 ensures that the amount of Eg5 in the spindle is above a level that is required for spindle formation. This enhanced targeting to the spindle appears therefore to be, at least in part, a direct consequence of the enhanced binding of Eg5 to microtubules upon phosphorylation by Cdk1. These findings advance our understanding of the regulation of this essential mitotic motor protein.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>During cell division the duplicated chromosomes need to be segregated accurately to the new daughter cells, which is achieved in eukaryotic cells by a multi-component machine called the mitotic spindle.

This shows that Eg5 does not saturate the available binding sites on spindle microtubules at the critical concentration. The increase of Eg5 on spindle microtubules beyond the critical amount does not disturb spindle formation, which might indicate that the Eg5 molecules do not experience a strong antagonistic force above the critical concentration. This agrees with the observation that the velocity of microtubule flux in the spindle is similar to Eg5 driven anti-parallel sliding of microtubules <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003936-Kapitein1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003936-Miyamoto1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. It is furthermore interesting to note that the native concentration of Eg5 in extract is above this critical concentration required for bipolarity. This might ensure robust spindle formation. The existence of a critical concentration for bipolarity might be a conserved feature of spindles in higher eukaryotes, as the efficiency of bipolar spindle formation was also found to be dependent on the amount of kinesin-5 on the spindle in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003936-Goshima1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>When native Eg5 was replaced by non-phosphorylatable Eg5<sub>T937A</sub>-GFP at roughly the endogenous concentration, the amount localizing to the spindles was clearly below the critical amount required for spindle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003936-g004">Fig. 4B, C</xref>).

Hence, this increase in binding efficiency is an intrinsic property of Eg5. Apart from a strongly reduced propensity to bind microtubules, non-phosphorylated wild-type Eg5 as well as a non-phosphorylatable Cdk1 mutant of Eg5 are mechanochemically functional as judged by their microtubule gliding activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. The minor, but significant decrease of the speed of the mutant as observed in our gliding assays is not expected to cause a drastic effect on spindle formation, because Eg5 mutants with reduced speeds were shown in the past to lead to the assembly of bipolar spindles in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003936-Kwok2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We compared our results with purified Eg5 in buffer with its behavior in the presence of all its potential binding partners, using spindle reconstitutions in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract.

After depletion of endogenous Eg5 from egg extract and addition of mutated Eg5 deficient for phosphorylation by Cdk1, we found that this mutant localized to microtubules in amounts that are far below the critical concentration that is required for bipolar spindle formation, unless added at unnaturally elevated concentrations. This explains why this mutant does not support spindle assembly.</p><p>Cdk1 activity therefore regulates the amount of Eg5 binding to spindle microtubules throughout mitosis in all metazoans tested so far for Eg5 function. In metaphase, when the kinase activity is high, Cdk1 ensures that the amount of Eg5 on microtubules is above the critical level required for bipolar spindle formation.

After retrieval of the Dynabeads with immunoprecipitated Eg5 using a magnet, the beads were boiled in SDS gel sample buffer and loaded on a 10&#x00025; SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was exposed to a Kodak Biomax film. The phoshorylation signals were quantified using Image J. First, the respective signal intensities on the autoradiograph and on the Coommasie stained SDS-PAGE gel were measured.

After usually 60 min, interphasic nuclei were observed and the extract was cycled back to mitosis with the addition of the other half of CSF extract.</p><p>For depletion/add back experiments, 80 &#x000b5;l of protein A Dynabeads coupled to anti-Eg5 antibody, or in controls an irrelevant IgG (&#x02018;mock&#x02019; depletion), were used to deplete 100 &#x000b5;l extract for 1 h on ice. Spindle assembly was performed as described above. Recombinant proteins or buffer as a control were added with depleted CSF extract as the reaction was cycled back to mitosis. The depletion efficiency and the concentration of Eg5 after add back were determined by Western Blot from 0.5 &#x000b5;l extract loaded onto a SDS gel.

For statistical analysis, the equality of the variances was first tested with a Levene's test for unparametric and unpaired data. As the variances were found equal, a t-test was performed thereafter.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Quantification of Eg5 in spindles</title><p>To quantify the amount of Eg5 on spindle microtubules, fluorescence images of fixed spindles formed in the presence of Eg5-GFP fusions were taken as described above. Using ImageJ, the mean intensity per area was measured in a region of interest drawn around randomly selected structures. After subtraction of background measured in areas not containing microtubules, the GFP and TAMRA intensities of at least 10 structures were averaged (except for the addition of 46 nM Eg5-GFP for which 6 structures were analyzed). From the averaged GFP intensities an averaged background signal of spindles in mock depleted extract not containing Eg5-GFP was then subtracted. Typically, 2 or 3 different conditions corresponding to different concentrations of added Eg5-GFP were analyzed per extract, and in total 6 different extracts were used. As the measured TAMRA fluorescence intensity of spindles varied from extract to extract, we used the total average of TAMRA intensities from spindle structures in all extracts divided by the average TAMRA intensity of spindle structures per extract to correct the measured TAMRA values of each spindle in order to be able to compare experiments performed in different extracts. Finally, the ratios of GFP intensities to corrected TAMRA intensities were calculated and then normalized so that the ratio was set to 1 at the Eg5-GFP concentration corresponding to 460 nM, which is roughly the endogenous concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003936-Kapoor1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.
