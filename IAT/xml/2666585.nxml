The exact mechanisms by which leptin alters this signaling pathway and how it relates to functional outputs are unclear at present. A previous study has established that leptin inhibits the activity of the phosphatase PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10), an important tumor suppressor and modifier of phosphoinositide signaling. In this study we demonstrate that leptin phosphorylates multiple sites on the C-terminal tail of PTEN in hypothalamic and pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells, an action not replicated by insulin. Inhibitors of the protein kinases CK2 and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) block leptin-mediated PTEN phosphorylation. PTEN phosphorylation mutants reveal the critical role these sites play in transmission of the leptin signal to F-actin depolymerization. CK2 and GSK3 inhibitors also prevent leptin-mediated F-actin depolymerization and consequent ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channel opening. GSK3 kinase activity is inhibited by insulin but not leptin in hypothalamic cells. Both hormones increase N-terminal GSK3 serine phosphorylation, but in hypothalamic cells this action of leptin is transient. Leptin, not insulin, increases GSK3 tyrosine phosphorylation in both cell types. These results demonstrate a significant role for PTEN in leptin signal transmission and identify GSK3 as a potential important signaling node contributing to divergent outputs for these hormones.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by <grant-sponsor>Wellcome Trust</grant-sponsor> Grant <grant-num>068692</grant-num> (to M.

In recent years there has been a significant increase in understanding the intracellular signaling processes associated with the actions of insulin on a wide variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). However, our knowledge of leptin signaling is less advanced, with most studies indicating that leptin and insulin share many signaling intermediates in common, often leading to similar cellular outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). In particular, signaling through the STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription), mitogen-activated protein kinase, and PI3K<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">3</xref> pathways have been reported extensively in numerous cell types for both leptin and insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, leptin and insulin can cause differing and sometimes opposing cellular outputs, even on the same cell type. This is demonstrated in hypothalamic neurons, where electrophysiological or imaging studies show differential outcomes for leptin and insulin action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Thus, although superficially leptin may utilize the same signaling pathways as insulin, the exact nature of the leptin-induced signaling intermediates and their interplay with one another and with individual effectors is still relatively unknown. Recently, it was demonstrated that although leptin, like insulin, raises PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels in hypothalamic cells, the mechanism underlying the increase by leptin differs from that of insulin. Whereas insulin increased PI3K activity, leptin had little effect on PI3K activity. Instead, leptin inhibited the lipid and protein phosphatase, PTEN, which resulted in increased PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels in the presence of active PI3K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Previously, PI3K-dependent leptin signaling had been shown to open ATP-sensitive (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels in rat hypothalamic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>) and in rat and mouse insulin-secreting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>), resulting in cell hyperpolarization and inhibition of firing. K<sub>ATP</sub> activation by leptin is dependent on actin depolymerization in both cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). The connection between leptin-driven PI3K activity, actin re-modeling, and K<sub>ATP</sub> opening appears not to be due simply to increased PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> but may also require coincident inhibition of PTEN protein and lipid phosphatase activity through increased PTEN phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>).</p><p>In this study we have focused on the mechanisms by which leptin alters PTEN phosphorylation in hypothalamic and insulin-secreting cells. The biological activity of PTEN toward anionic lipid substrates is considered to be dependent on its phosphorylation status at various residues between Ser-362 and Ser-385, located in the PTEN C-terminal tail (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>), with phosphorylation maintaining PTEN in an inactive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). The major sites of phosphorylation are Ser-370 and Ser-385 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>), with significant phosphorylation at a cluster of sites (Ser-380, Thr-382, and Thr-383) close to Ser-385. Mutations of the cluster site residues have significant effects on PTEN stability and membrane and protein binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). It is thought that PTEN is constitutively phosphorylated and not linked to physiological signaling events such as stimulation of cells with insulin or growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). However, we previously demonstrated that leptin stimulation of hypothalamic cells reduced PTEN phosphatase activity and increased PTEN phosphorylation at the cluster site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). This increased phosphorylation was sensitive to inhibition of protein kinase CK2, previously implicated as the main kinase phosphorylating PTEN at these residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). CK2 has also been reported to phosphorylate PTEN at Ser-370 and Ser-385 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>) using <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>), resulting in a 30% depression of PTEN phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). In addition, GSK3&#x003b2; has been reported to phosphorylate PTEN at Ser-362 and Thr-366 in human embryonic kidney 293T cells, with Thr-366 phosphorylation reducing the biological activity of PTEN.</p><p>Consequently, we have assessed whether leptin mediates phosphorylation of PTEN at Ser-370, Ser-385, and Thr-366 in a CK2- and GSK3-dependent manner and further examined the contribution of Ser-370 and Thr-366 to downstream events such as actin re-organization and K<sub>ATP</sub> channel opening using hypothalamic and insulin-secreting cells.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Cell Culture and Islet Isolation</italic>&#x02014;The mouse hypothalamic cell line N29/4 was cultured as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>).

Wild-type C57Bl/6 mice (20&#x02013;25 g) were used for islet isolation and killed by cervical dislocation immediately before the islet isolation procedure. All animal procedures conformed to the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and were approved by our institutional ethical review committee. Pancreatic islets were isolated from mice under sterile conditions, and isolated cells were cultured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>).</p><p><italic>Cell Transfection, Staining, and Actin Analysis</italic>&#x02014;N29/4 cells were plated in 6-well plates at 40% confluence 24 h before transfection. 5 &#x003bc;l of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and 2 &#x003bc;g of PTEN DNA were mixed with 100 &#x003bc;l of serum-free Opti medium, incubated at room temperature for 20 min to form the transfection complexes, and diluted with 500 &#x003bc;l of culture medium. The mixture was applied to the cells, left overnight at 37 &#x000b0;C, replaced with culture medium, and incubated for 48 h before use. In experiments where wild-type and mutant PTEN constructs were overexpressed, F-actin or PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels were determined from 60 cells for control and each treatment from a total of 4 experiments (comparing transfected cells, as determined by PTEN antibody staining, with control cells). Similarly, 72 cells were examined from 4 experiments to measure F-actin in control and leptin with or without CT99021 and/or 2-dimethyl-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1<italic>H</italic>-benzimidazole (DMAT).

For staining, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), permeabilized in PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min, rinsed, blocked with 20% goat serum (Sigma), and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin or 2 units ml<sup>-1</sup> Alexa 488-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for 90&#x02013;120 min. Immunocytochemical staining was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>) using a monoclonal antibody against PTEN (Chemicon) or PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> (Molecular Probes). The secondary antibodies were Cy3 or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Fluorescence-labeled proteins or lipids in cells were observed with a 63&#x000d7; oil objective, and images were acquired by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510). For quantitative analysis of F-actin and PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels, Aida/two-dimensional densitometry was used to measure pixel intensity of defined areas of transfected, treated, and control cells.

Monoclonal anti &#x003b2;-actin antibody (used at 1:10000) was from MP Biochemicals.

Leptin rapidly (&#x0003c;5 min) increased the level of p-PTEN at all three sites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>), an action sustained for at least 60 min for each site (data not shown). This leptin-mediated increase in p-PTEN was unaffected by the presence of the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 (10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>; <italic>n</italic> = 6 for each; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). Previous studies indicated that the cluster site, Ser-385 and Ser-370, may be phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>), and Thr-366 may be phosphorylated by GSK3&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). Consequently, we examined leptin phosphorylation of Thr-366, Ser-370, and Ser-385 PTEN residues in the absence and presence of DMAT (a CK2 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>) and CT99021 (a specific GSK3 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>)). DMAT (10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) prevented leptin from phosphorylating Ser-370 and Ser-385 but not Thr-366 in N29/4 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). Conversely, leptin phosphorylation of Thr-366 was prevented by CT99021 (2 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>), whereas phosphorylation of Ser-370 and Ser-385 was unaffected by this inhibitor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). In contrast, 10 n<sc>m</sc> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>) or 50 n<sc>m</sc> (data not shown) insulin had no effect on p-PTEN levels in N29/4 cells at Thr-366 or Ser-370 residues, with the Ser-385 site not tested.</p><p>Leptin re-organization of the actin cytoskeleton is dependent on PI3K activity and inhibition of the lipid and protein phosphatase activity of PTEN. Overexpression of cluster site p-PTEN mutants demonstrated that phosphorylation at this site was required to limit PTEN phosphatase activity and prevent leptin-induced F-actin depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Accordingly, we have examined whether phosphorylation of PTEN at Ser-370 and/or Thr-366 is also required for transmission of the leptin signal to F-actin. First, we sought to determine whether phosphorylation of Thr-366 or Ser-370 altered the activity of PTEN in cells by overexpression of PTEN mutants with alanine or aspartic acid substitutions. PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and F-actin levels were assessed by staining with a monoclonal PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> antibody and Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin respectively, after transfection of PTEN mutants into N29/4 cells. In control experiments overexpression of wild-type PTEN had no effect <italic>per se</italic> but prevented leptin from decreasing F-actin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Overexpression of T366A PTEN or S370A PTEN reduced PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels (data not shown), indicative of enhanced PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> phosphatase activity, did not affect F-actin in the absence of leptin and inhibited leptin-induced F-actin reduction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>). In contrast, overexpression of T366D PTEN or S370D PTEN increased PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). The presence of the 366D PTEN mutant in N29/4 cells decreased F-actin levels in the absence of leptin in a PI3K-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>D</italic></xref>).

The presence of the GSK3 inhibitor, CT99021 (2 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) or the CK2 inhibitor DMAT (10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) alone had no effect on F-actin (data not shown).

The combined presence of CT99021 and DMAT inhibited F-actin depolymerization by leptin significantly more than CT99021 alone but did not completely occlude leptin from affecting F-actin levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>F</italic></xref>). Nevertheless, the presence of the GSK3 and CK2 inhibitors at concentrations that significantly reduced PTEN phosphorylation also significantly reduced the ability of leptin to depolymerize F-actin.</p><p><italic>Phosphorylation of PTEN in</italic> &#x003b2;<italic>-Cells and K<sub>ATP</sub> Activation</italic>&#x02014;It was previously demonstrated that K<sub>ATP</sub> channel opening and hyperpolarization of mouse pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells by leptin could be inhibited by the lipid phosphatase dead G129E PTEN mutant and mimicked by the dual lipid and protein phosphatase dead C124S PTEN mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). This is consistent with inhibition of PTEN lipid and protein phosphatase activity for the successful transmission of the leptin signal to K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in &#x003b2;-cells. As leptin has not been shown to alter p-PTEN status in &#x003b2;-cells, we used MIN6 &#x003b2;-cells to explore this action of leptin. Although the effects of leptin on p-PTEN were not as robust as observed for N29/4 cells, leptin (10 n<sc>m</sc>) rapidly (&#x02264;1 min) increased phosphorylation of the cluster site, Ser-370 and Thr-366, actions sustained for at least 30 min in each case (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>).

The CK2 inhibitor DMAT (2 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) inhibited leptin-mediated PTEN phosphorylation at Ser-370 and Thr-366, whereas the GSK3 inhibitor CT99021 (10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) inhibited phosphorylation at Thr-366 only (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>).</p><p>Consequently, we predicted that the F-actin reduction and opening of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels by leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>) would be susceptible to inhibition of CK2 and GSK3. Therefore, we examined the ability of leptin to hyperpolarize the membrane potential and activate K<sub>ATP</sub> currents in whole-cell current and voltage clamp recordings, respectively, from mouse primary cultured pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells in the absence and presence of DMAT and various GSK3 inhibitors. In control experiments &#x003b2;-cells were dialyzed with an electrode solution containing 3 m<sc>m</sc> ATP, which resulted in a mean membrane potential of -41.8 &#x000b1; 1.5 mV (<italic>n</italic> = 22) under current clamp conditions. Application of leptin (10 n<sc>m</sc>) resulted in a slowly developing hyperpolarization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>) to a mean value of -69.4 &#x000b1; 1.6 mV (<italic>n</italic> = 22, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), which was reversibly inhibited (to -34.5 &#x000b1; 1.9 mV; <italic>n</italic> = 17, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) by the sulfonylurea tolbutamide (100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>). Voltage clamp analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>) showed that leptin increased the mean cell slope conductance from 0.73 &#x000b1; 0.11 to 1.62 &#x000b1; 0.22 nanosiemens (<italic>n</italic> = 19; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), an action reduced by tolbutamide to 0.42 &#x000b1; 0.04 nanosiemens (<italic>n</italic> = 14; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), indicating that the increase in current responsible for the augmented slope conductance and &#x003b2;-cell hyperpolarization by leptin is due to K<sub>ATP</sub> channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). The presence of DMAT (10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) in the electrode solution (and, therefore, cell interior) resulted in a mean resting membrane potential of -44.8 &#x000b1; 3.4 mV (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05 compared with control). Subsequent addition of leptin caused a small, insignificant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) hyperpolarization to -52.4 &#x000b1; 8.4 mV (<italic>n</italic> = 5; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>), which was significantly different (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) from the control leptin response.

The K<sub>ATP</sub> channels were operational in the presence of DMAT as &#x003b2;-cells were readily responsive (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>) to the direct-acting K<sub>ATP</sub> activator, diazoxide (200 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>), which caused hyperpolarization to -75.2 &#x000b1; 1.7 mV (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and increased slope conductance from 0.82 &#x000b1; 0.07 to 3.1 &#x000b1; 0.8 nanosiemens (<italic>n</italic> = 5; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). CT99021 (2 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>), in the electrode solution, resulted in a mean &#x003b2;-cell membrane potential of -41.5 &#x000b1; 3.3 mV. Application of leptin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>) caused hyperpolarization to -51.5 &#x000b1; 4.1 mV, which although less than the control leptin response, was significantly different (<italic>n</italic> = 5, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) from the mean resting potential before leptin challenge. However, voltage clamp analysis showed that in the presence of CT99021 leptin did not significantly increase the &#x003b2;-cell slope conductance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>). As a small, but significant hyperpolarization of &#x003b2;-cells was elicited by leptin in the presence of CT99021, we decided to confirm that GSK3 inhibition does occlude leptin-mediated &#x003b2;-cell hyperpolarization and increase in K<sub>ATP</sub> current. Consequently, we examined the effects of the GSK3 inhibitors, AR-A0144-18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>) and kenpaullone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>) on leptin-induced opening of K<sub>ATP</sub>.

Leptin (10 n<sc>m</sc>) caused a small hyperpolarization of the &#x003b2;-cells for both AR-A014418 (to -51.8 &#x000b1; 6.4; <italic>n</italic> = 5) and kenpaullone (to -45.5 &#x000b1; 4.6 mV; <italic>n</italic> = 6), which was not significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) for either inhibitor (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>).

These events appear to be mediated through CK2- and GSK3-dependent mechanisms. However, the dependence on PTEN Thr-366 phosphorylation on GSK3 activity and consequent influence on downstream signaling events such as K<sub>ATP</sub> channel regulation gives rise to a quandary. Leptin stimulation of rat arcuate increases PKB phosphorylation with subsequent GSK3 phosphorylation at Ser-9/Ser-21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>), actions also reported for leptin on mouse skeletal muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>), mouse cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>), and MCF-7 breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>). These latter actions of leptin replicate those of insulin, which increases PI3K activity and raises PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels with subsequent increased PKB and GSK3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Importantly, the phosphorylation of GSK3 at these serine residues by PKB is associated with reduced kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>).</p><p>This outcome is inconsistent with the requirement for active GSK3 causing phosphorylation of PTEN Thr-366 allowing subsequent downstream signaling. Indeed, leptin (10 n<sc>m</sc>) increases the phosphorylation of PKB (Ser-473) and GSK3 (Ser-9/Ser-21) in N29/4 hypothalamic cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>), although this is not well sustained in the hypothalamic cells, as previously reported for rat arcuate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>) and mouse muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). Insulin (10 n<sc>m</sc>) induced a sustained rise in PKB (Ser-473) and GSK3 (Ser-9/Ser-21) phosphorylation in N29/4 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). Similar results were obtained for MIN6 &#x003b2;-cells, although in this case both leptin (10 n<sc>m</sc>) and insulin (10 n<sc>m</sc>) produced sustained increases (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>) in the levels of phosphorylated PKB (Ser-473) and GSK3 (Ser-9/Ser-21). These results are ostensibly inconsistent with the view that leptin signaling to actin and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels requires GSK3-dependent phosphorylation and inhibition of PTEN activity. However, GSK3 also has a tyrosine residue in the activation loop of the enzyme (Tyr-216 in GSK3&#x003b2; and Tyr-279 in GSK3&#x003b1;), the phosphorylation of which is important for GSK3 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>). Most studies conclude that this site is not physiologically regulated by growth factors or cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>). Insulin (10 n<sc>m</sc>) did not affect GSK3 Tyr-216/Tyr-279 phosphorylation levels in either N29/4 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>) or MIN6 &#x003b2;-cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>). In contrast, leptin (10 n<sc>m</sc>) rapidly increased GSK3 phosphorylation at Tyr-216/Tyr-279 in N29/4 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>), and MIN6 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>D</italic></xref>) cells, which was sustained for at least 1 h. Thus, in contrast to insulin, which increases phosphorylation of GSK3 serine sites only (consistent with kinase inhibition), leptin increases the phosphorylation level of both serine and tyrosine sites on GSK3. To define the outcome of this dual phosphorylation of GSK3, we examined the effects of leptin (10 n<sc>m</sc>) and insulin (50 n<sc>m</sc>) on GSK3 activity in N29/4 cells. Stimulation of N29/4 cells by insulin for 30 min results in a substantial inhibition of GSK3 activity, as expected from increased PKB activity causing GSK3 Ser-9/Ser-21 phosphorylation. In contrast, stimulation of N29/4 cells with leptin (10 n<sc>m</sc>) for 30 min, a time when PTEN phosphorylation is increased, PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels are high, F-actin is depolymerized, and &#x003b2;-cells are hyperpolarized, results in maintained GSK3 activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>E</italic></xref>). This outcome is consistent with the finding that, although both hormones increase GSK3 Ser-9/Ser-21 phosphorylation levels, leptin, but not insulin, also increases GSK3 Tyr-216/Tyr-279 phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Leptin phosphorylation of PTEN at the cluster site is CK2-dependent and leads to inhibition of PTEN phosphatase activity with a consequent increase in PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels in N29/4 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Here, we show that leptin increases PTEN phosphorylation at three further sites, Thr-366, Ser-370, and Ser-385 in N29/4 cells. We also show that leptin increases p-PTEN at the cluster site, Thr-366 and Ser-370, in MIN6 pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells. As demonstrated for the cluster site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>), phosphorylation of PTEN in N29/4 cells at Thr-366 and Ser-370 is important for transfer of the leptin signal downstream to cause F-actin depolymerization. Leptin-mediated reduction in F-actin levels was previously shown to be dependent on basal PI3K activity and inhibition of both lipid and protein phosphatase activity of PTEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Correspondingly, overexpression of the PTEN phosphorylation site mutants, S370A PTEN and T366A PTEN, in N29/4 cells occluded leptin-driven reduction in F-actin. The Thr-366 and Ser-370 alanine and aspartic acid PTEN mutants, when overexpressed in N29/4 cells, alter PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels exactly as reported for the cluster site mutants. This outcome does not agree with <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, which show no alteration in enzyme activity associated with these mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>), unlike the corresponding mutations of the cluster site residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Thus, S370D and T366D both raised PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels, indicative of reduced lipid phosphatase activity <italic>per se</italic> and dominant negative behavior with respect to native PTEN activity. Interestingly, these mutants produced different outcomes on F-actin levels and leptin signal transduction. Overexpression of T366D PTEN <italic>per se</italic> mimicked the effects of leptin by increasing PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and inducing F-actin depolymerization in a PI3K-dependent manner. This replicates the effect of overexpression of C124S PTEN and D3PTEN (cluster site mutant) in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>) and is consistent with phosphorylation of the Thr-366 site reducing PTEN lipid and protein phosphatase activity. In contrast, overexpression of S370D PTEN was unable to elicit F-actin depolymerization <italic>per se</italic> even in the face of increased cellular PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels and did not occlude leptin-mediated F-actin depolymerization. Consequently, mimicking phosphorylation by aspartate substitution at Ser-370 does not exactly replicate the effect of aspartate substitution at Thr-366 or the cluster phosphorylation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>), with all three mutant forms of PTEN increasing PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels but only the latter two reducing F-actin levels. The S370D PTEN mutant also does not duplicate the action of the lipid phosphatase dead, protein phosphatase active, mutant G129E PTEN. Overexpression of G129E PTEN in N29/4 cells increases PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels with no reduction in F-actin and prevents leptin-mediated F-actin depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>), whereas the presence of S370D PTEN allows leptin depolymerization of actin. Our conclusion from these data is that S370D is lipid phosphatase dead but protein phosphatase active and that leptin inhibits the protein phosphatase activity by phosphorylation at the Thr-366 and cluster sites, whereas the protein phosphatase activity of G129E PTEN cannot be overcome by phosphorylation at these sites. Thus, phosphorylation of PTEN at Ser-370 is adequate to inhibit PTEN lipid phosphatase activity and increase PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> in N29/4 cells but is not sufficient <italic>per se</italic> for efficacious transmission of the leptin signal to F-actin.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Leptin and insulin increase PKB and GSK3 serine phosphorylation in N29/4 and MIN6 cells.</bold> PKB (Ser-473 (<italic>S</italic>)) and GSK3 (Ser-9/Ser-21) phosphorylation was determined in N29/4 (<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>) and MIN6 (<italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>) cells, stimulated with 10 n<sc>m</sc> leptin (<italic>A</italic> and <italic>C</italic>), or 10 n<sc>m</sc> insulin (<italic>B</italic> and <italic>D</italic>) for the indicated times (minutes).

PTEN protein stability and activity are considered to be dependent on phosphorylation status of the C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>), with phosphorylation argued to reduce association of PTEN with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>). It is presently unclear what effect leptin-induced phosphorylation will have on PTEN protein stability, as it has been reported that T366A and S370A are more stable than wild-type PTEN and GSK3 inhibition increases the stability of wild-type PTEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>), whereas alanine mutation of the cluster site results in reduced protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). The inhibition of leptin-induced phosphorylation of the cluster site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>), Ser-370 and Ser-385, in N29/4 cells and of the cluster site and Ser-370 in MIN6 cells by DMAT supports the view that CK2 is the kinase responsible for phosphorylation at these sites by this hormone. Inhibition of PI3K had no effect on leptin-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-370, Ser-385, or Thr-366 in N29/4 cells, indicating no evidence for PI3K-dependent feedback phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>) consistent with leptin-induced phosphorylation of the cluster site. For GSK3 to phosphorylate its substrate, the substrate has to be primed by phosphorylation of a site four or five residues C-terminal of the target Ser/Thr of GSK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>). Thus, phosphorylation of Ser-370 by CK2 is considered a priming event for subsequent GSK3 phosphorylation of Thr-366 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>), and inhibition of GSK3 blocks phosphorylation of PTEN on Thr-366 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>). Occlusion of leptin driven-increased p-PTEN on Thr-366 by the GSK3 inhibitor CT99021 in N29/4 and MIN6 cells agrees with these findings. Consequently, we expected DMAT to reduce or inhibit leptin-mediated phosphorylation of Thr-366 in these cells. This was observed for MIN6 pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells but not for the hypothalamic cells, where DMAT prevented leptin-induced phosphorylation of Ser-370 but not Thr-366. Thus, either an additional unidentified priming kinase is responsible or there is sufficient phosphorylation of Ser-370 remaining in DMAT-treated N29/4 cells to allow GSK3 priming. Interestingly, an <italic>in vitro</italic> study of PTEN phosphorylation has shown that phosphorylation of Ser-370 by CK2 is less efficient than that of the cluster site and that GSK3 is capable of phosphorylating PTEN at Thr-366 without priming, although at low efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>). Thus, we predicted that inhibition of CK2 and GSK3 would prevent or reduce transmission of the leptin signal via PTEN to actin filament restructuring and K<sub>ATP</sub> channel opening. Our results show that the GSK3 inhibitor CT99021 <italic>per se</italic> or in combination with DMAT significantly reduces leptin-mediated F-actin depolymerization. Furthermore, leptin-driven hyperpolarization of pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells by K<sub>ATP</sub> activation was prevented by the presence of DMAT or any one of three structurally dissimilar GSK3 inhibitors. This is consistent with the view that leptin-mediated phosphorylation of PTEN and subsequent inhibition of its phosphatase activity is a necessary step for signal transmission to K<sub>ATP</sub> channels.</p><p>In contrast, insulin does not cause F-actin depolymerization in N29/4 cells nor does it hyperpolarize pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells by opening K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, and this differential output may be mediated via PTEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). The results presented here indicate a key role for PTEN Thr-366 phosphorylation via GSK3 activity for successful transmission of the leptin signal. For this to occur, GSK3 activity has to be maintained or increased by leptin. However, leptin, like insulin, increases PKB phosphorylation with the resultant phosphorylation of GSK3 at Ser-9/Ser-21 consistent with inhibition of GSK3 activity. Indeed, both insulin and leptin increased the phosphorylation of GSK3 at Ser-9/Ser-21 in N29/4 and MIN6 cells. In contrast, leptin, but not insulin, caused a rapid and sustained increase in GSK3 phosphorylation at Tyr-216/Tyr-279 in both cell types. Phosphorylation of GSK3 at this site is considered to be activating and necessary for functional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>). Indeed, direct GSK3 kinase assay showed that insulin stimulation of N29/4 cells substantially reduced GSK3 activity, whereas leptin had no effect. Taken together, the semiquantitative Western blot data show that insulin significantly alters N-terminal serine phosphorylation of GSK3, which would reduce its activity toward primed substrates. However, phosphorylation of PTEN at Thr-366 in response to leptin does not appear to require priming (phosphorylation of this site is unaffected by DMAT), and this may explain why insulin does not reduce Thr-366 phosphorylation. In contrast, GSK3 in leptin-treated cells increased phosphate in Tyr-216/Tyr-279 compared with control or insulin-treated cells. This is a possible explanation why leptin and not insulin induces Thr-366 phosphorylation. However, there are other ways to regulate GSK3, including protein-protein interaction (<italic>e.g.</italic> Wnt signaling) and Thr-380 phosphorylation (<italic>e.g.</italic> cytokine signaling) that also require further investigation. Identification of the kinase (or phosphatase) responsible for the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of GSK3 and development of a quantitative multiple reaction monitoring liquid chromatographymass spectrometric approach for each of the phosphorylation sites on GSK3 would be required to elucidate the exact mechanism of control by leptin. These subtle signaling differences downstream of insulin and leptin receptors are likely to contribute to the ability of each to perform their distinct physiological actions through modulation of the same signaling pathways/molecules.</p><p>In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that leptin increases the phosphorylation of PTEN at multiple residues in a CK2- and GSK3-dependent manner. This action of leptin is required for successful transmission of the leptin signal to cause cytoskeletal remodeling, the opening of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, and subsequent hyperpolarization of membrane potential. Interestingly, complete loss of PTEN activity in mouse hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin neurons permanently activates K<sub>ATP</sub> channels and hyperpolarizes the neurons resulting in hyperphagia, leptin resistance, and diet-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). The role of GSK3 in PTEN regulation is intriguing. Insulin signaling inhibits GSK3 activity, and this may act via an alteration in PTEN Thr-366 phosphorylation as a negative feedback loop for leptin signaling in cells. In contrast, leptin, regardless of whether it stimulates PI3K activity in all cells or not, by maintaining GSK3 activity may result in a positive feedback to PI3K signaling in cells. Such interplay between leptin and insulin signaling in cells may have important implications for downstream signaling events. For example, inhibition of PTEN in peripheral tissues such as liver, muscle, and fat demonstrate improved insulin sensitivity and systemic glucose tolerance under normal and high fat diets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>). Dysregulation of PTEN (lipid and protein phosphatase) activity has also been implicated in certain cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>) and neurodegenerative disease (<italic>e.g.</italic> Parkinson disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>)). Thus, modulation of PTEN function plays multiple and important roles in numerous physiological and pathological phenomena.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Nick Leslie for providing the PTEN mutants and PTEN Ser-370 and Thr-366 phospho-antibodies and for helpful comments.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Schwartz, M.
