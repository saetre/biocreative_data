The aim of this study has been to examine <italic>NDRG2 </italic>mRNA expression in colon cancer.

Although the four members of this family contain a putative &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-hydrolase fold, it is unclear whether or not they have enzymatic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. <italic>NDRG1 </italic>was first identified as a gene under negative regulation by N-myc in early mouse development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. <italic>NDRG2 </italic>was identified through sequence homology and is implicated in cell growth, differentiation and neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Recently, it has been shown that expression of <italic>NDRG2 </italic>is transcriptionally repressed by c-Myc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have suggested that <italic>NDRG2 </italic>mRNA is down-regulated or undetectable in a number of human cancers and cancer cell-lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was used to demonstrate that <italic>NDRG2 </italic>expression levels were reduced in squamous cell carcinoma, pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma compared to normal tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. <italic>NDRG2 </italic>expression levels in gliomas and meningiomas were significantly attenuated in high-grade compared to low-grade tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In meningiomas, higher expression of <italic>NDRG2 </italic>mRNA correlated with clinically less aggressive tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>NDRG2 </italic>was identified as a gene whose expression in high-grade gliomas was positively correlated with survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Forced <italic>NDRG2 </italic>overexpression in a human glioblastoma cell-line markedly inhibited cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. These findings implicate <italic>NDRG2 </italic>as a possible tumor suppressor gene.</p><p>Prompted by the finding that <italic>NDRG2 </italic>expression correlates inversely with tumor grade in various cancers, we set out to analyse <italic>NDRG2 </italic>mRNA expression during colorectal carcinogenesis in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subject population</title><p>The KAM cohort (Kolorektal cancer, Arv og Milj&#x000f8;) is based primarily on the screening group of the Norwegian Colorectal Cancer Prevention study (the NORCCAP study, ID number at Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00119912) in the county of Telemark, Norway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Additionally, a series of colorectal cancer cases were recruited to the KAM cohort from routine clinical work at Telemark Hospital and Ulleval University Hospital in Oslo. A total of 20,780 men and women, age distribution 50&#x02013;64 years, randomly drawn from the population registries in Oslo (urban) and the county of Telemark (mixed urban and rural) were invited to have a flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) screening examination with or without (1:1) an additional faecal occult blood test (FOBT). A total of 777 (4%) individuals were excluded according to the exclusion criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The KAM biobank currently consists of 234 colorectal cancer, 1044 adenoma (229 high-risk, 762 low-risk and 53 hyperplastic polyps) and 400 control specimens. Controls were defined as individuals with normal findings at FS. The KAM study is approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics and the Norwegian Data Inspectorate. In the present study we have analyzed carcinomas (n = 50), adenomas (n = 72) and controls (n = 15). Each case was classified according to the degree of malignancy. A sample of control tissue was collected 30 cm from the anus of patients with adenomas, whereas two samples of control tissue were taken from the surgical specimen from patients with carcinomas: one sample in close proximity (normal adjacent) and one sample as far away from the tumor as possible (normal distant). Control samples were collected from individuals without adenomas or carcinomas. The histology of the adenomas was examined by two histopathologists independently. The degree of dysplasia was determined as either mild/moderate (n = 52) or severe (n = 20). The two pathologists reached the same conclusion in all cases. Furthermore, adenomas were classified as either low-risk (n = 15) or high-risk (n = 57). A high-risk adenoma is defined as an adenoma measuring &#x02265; 10 mm in diameter and/or with villous components and/or showing severe dysplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The vast majority of CRC samples had 75&#x02013;80% tumor cells surrounded by stroma, as evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining by a pathologist.

The 460 bp <italic>NDRG2 </italic>probe was generated by PCR using the primers 5'CTCACTCTGTGGAGACACCAT3' and 5'GGGTGATATCACCTCCACGCT3'. The hybridised array was exposed to a phosphorimaging screen for 24 hours and the intensity of each spot was quantified using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). The CPA consists of paired cDNA samples generated from the total RNA of normal and tumor tissue. Because the array is normalised for several housekeeping genes, quantification of the hybridisation signal provides an estimate of relative transcript abundance.</p></sec><sec><title>RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was purified from tissue as recommended by the manufacturers using an e.z.n.a. Gel Extraction kit (Omega Biotek). The tissue had been snap-frozen in liquid N<sub>2 </sub>and stored at -80&#x000b0;C before RNA purification. RNA purification included a DNAse treatment. The cDNA synthesis was performed on approximately 200 ng RNA per 10 &#x003bc;l using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, N&#x000e6;rum, Denmark). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on an ABI7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) in Universal Mastermix (Applied Biosystems) using 220 nM probe and 700 nM primers for <italic>NDRG2</italic>. <italic>NDRG2 </italic>primers were NDRG2F: 5'CGATCCTTACCTACCACGATGTG3' and NDRG2R: 5'GCATGTCCTCGAACTGAAACAGT3' and the probe was 5'FAM-CTCAACTATAAATCTTGCTTCC-MGB-NFQ-3'. Primers were designed using Primer Express v3.0 Software and obtained from DNA Technology A/S. Primers were designed within different exons and with a probe covering the exon-exon border to prevent amplification of genomic DNA. The probe recognises all splice forms of NDRG2. <italic>&#x003b2;-actin </italic>primers and probe were obtained from Applied Biosystems. In a validation experiment using a control sample, a dilution series was produced and assayed for <italic>NDRG2 </italic>and <italic>&#x003b2;-actin </italic>expression as described in the comparative C<sub>t </sub>method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. When C<sub>t </sub>values were plotted against log dilution it was shown that the assays are quantitative over a range of 128-fold dilution for both <italic>NDRG2 </italic>and <italic>&#x003b2;-actin </italic>and that the PCR reactions have similar efficiencies provided that a threshold of 0.2 is used for <italic>&#x003b2;-actin</italic>, while the threshold was 0.07 for <italic>NDRG2</italic>. The threshold is a fixed fluorescence signal above the baseline. The C<sub>t </sub>value of a sample is determined as the fractional cycle number when the sample's fluorescence signal exceeds the threshold. The threshold is thus assay-specific, determined in the validation experiment and depends on the background of the individual assay.</p><p><italic>NDRG2 </italic>and <italic>&#x003b2;-actin </italic>mRNAs were quantified separately in triplicates. The average standard deviations on triplicates were 15% and 11% for <italic>NDRG2 </italic>and <italic>&#x003b2;-actin </italic>respectively. The standard deviation on repeated measurements of the same sample (internal control) in separate experiments was 16% for <italic>NDRG2</italic>, indicating the day-to-day variation of the assay. Negative controls (where the RNA was not converted into cDNA) and positive controls were included in all sets. Two independent PCR reactions of 28 samples (5%) yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.95, indicating a high reproducibility of the assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>GraphPad Prism 4 was used for the statistic calculations.

This was observed using two distinct subject populations, one of which was a Norwegian cohort, the other a group of affected individuals based on a commercially available product. The difference in mRNA level is likely to be reflected at the level of NDRG2 protein, since <italic>NDRG2 </italic>mRNA levels have previously been shown to correlate well with protein levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>In the Norwegian cohort, <italic>NDRG2 </italic>mRNA levels were statistically significantly reduced in colorectal carcinoma when compared to the healthy controls. In order to examine whether the risk of carcinoma is affected by changes in the microenvironment, expression levels of <italic>NDRG2 </italic>in the lesion were compared to normal adjacent tissue as well as to normal tissue distant from the tumor. <italic>NDRG2 </italic>mRNA was statistically significantly reduced in tumor compared to either normal tissue sample. No difference was observed between the adjacent and distant samples, suggesting that changes in <italic>NDRG2 </italic>expression in the carcinoma are not attributable to the microenvironment.</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that colorectal cancer is a heterogenous disease with distinct molecular components. Distinct genetic or epigenetic alterations have been identified which correlate with the location of the tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Although it was not investigated in this study, it could be interesting to compare <italic>NDRG2 </italic>expression in tumors located in either the proximal or distal colon.</p><p>There was a tendency for decreasing <italic>NDRG2 </italic>mRNA levels with increasing tumor stage according to Dukes' staging of the CRC samples, and this trend was found to be significant using linear regression (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Our results are in agreement with that observed for other cancer types where <italic>NDRG2 </italic>expression is reduced in high-grade compared to low-grade tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This trend indicates either that the loss of <italic>NDRG2 </italic>promotes tumor progression or that <italic>NDRG2 </italic>is inactivated by factor(s) present at advanced tumor stages. <italic>NDRG2 </italic>has previously been shown to be negatively regulated by the c-Myc oncoprotein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and it is possible that elevated levels of c-Myc would result in reduced expression of <italic>NDRG2</italic>. Thus, it could be interesting to elucidate whether or not an increased level of c-Myc, which is a frequent event in colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], correlates with a decreased level of <italic>NDRG2</italic>. Measurement of c-Myc levels was not included in these studies. However, we have investigated a subset of the CRC samples (n = 54) from the KAM study for &#x003b2;-catenin expression by immunohistochemistry. All of the tested CRC samples are positive for cytoplasmic &#x003b2;-catenin and 72% are &#x003b2;-catenin positive in all nuclei (data not shown). The remaining samples contain nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin in occasional nuclei. This suggests that c-Myc levels are likely to be elevated since c-Myc is known to be positively regulated by nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>In order to determine the stage at which <italic>NDRG2 </italic>expression is down-regulated in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence we also examined normal and affected tissue from low- and high-risk adenomas. When comparing affected tissue with normal tissue from the same individual, we found a statistically significant difference for individuals with high-risk adenomas. However, when compared to the control group of healthy individuals, only the affected tissue from individuals with colorectal carcinoma shows a statistically significant reduction in <italic>NDRG2 </italic>mRNA levels. Our results suggest that down-regulation of <italic>NDRG2 </italic>expression occurs during the progression from adenoma to carcinoma.</p><p>Whether down-regulation of <italic>NDRG2 </italic>in colorectal carcinoma is a cause or a consequence of malignant progression is at present unclear. Although the structure of NDRG2 resembles that of a hydrolase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], its ability to function as an enzyme is presently unknown. It has recently been shown that overexpression of <italic>NDRG2 </italic>in a glioblastoma cell-line inhibits cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and that <italic>NDRG2 </italic>expression correlates positively with survival in high-grade glioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. <italic>NDRG2 </italic>levels are also reduced in several cancer types and cell-lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Thus, <italic>NDRG2 </italic>may have a general function in diverse tissues as a tumor suppressor gene. Future studies will be needed to examine whether increased <italic>NDRG2 </italic>levels in colorectal carcinoma correlate with improved prognosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, <italic>NDRG2 </italic>mRNA levels were decreased in both high-risk colorectal adenoma and in colorectal carcinoma compared to corresponding normal colonic mucosa from the same individual. Furthermore, <italic>NDRG2 </italic>expression was reduced in colorectal carcinoma compared to normal tissue from healthy individuals. Our results suggest that <italic>NDRG2 </italic>down-regulation correlates with the progression of dysplastic tissue to carcinoma. Future studies are needed to address whether <italic>NDRG2 </italic>down-regulation is a cause or consequence of colorectal carcinogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LKV and CM conceived the idea of the study and designed the primers and probes.
