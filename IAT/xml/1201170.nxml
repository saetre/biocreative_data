Our earlier studies on carriers of spontaneous mutations of mouse Sperm Adhesion Molecule 1 (Spam1) suggested that TRD results from biochemically different sperm, due to a lack of transcript sharing through the intercellular cytoplasmic bridges of spermatids. These bridges usually allow transcript sharing among genetically different spermatids which develop into biochemically and functionally equivalent sperm.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The goals of the study were to provide support for the lack of sharing (LOS) hypothesis, using transgene and null carriers of Spam1, and to determine the mechanism of Spam1-associated TRD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Carriers of Spam1-Hyal5 BAC transgenes were mated with wild-type female mice and the progeny analyzed for TRD by PCR genotyping. Sperm from transgene and Spam1 null carriers were analyzed using flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry to detect quantities of Spam1 and/or Hyal5. Transgene-bearing sperm with Spam1 overexpression were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization. In wild-type animals, EM studies of in situ transcript hybridization of testis sections and Northern analysis of biochemically fractionated testicular RNA were performed to localize Spam1 transcript. Finally, AU-rich motifs identified in the 3' UTR of Spam1 RNA were assayed by UV cross-linking to determine their ability to interact with testicular RNA binding proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The Tg8 line of transgene carriers had a significant (P &#x0003c; 0.001) TRD, due to reduced fertilizing ability of transgene-bearing sperm. These sperm retained large cytoplasmic droplets engorged with overexpressed Spam1 or Hyal5 protein. Caudal sperm from transgene carriers and caput sperm of null carriers showed a bimodal distribution of Spam1, indicating that the sperm in a male were biochemically different with respect to Spam1 quantities. Spam1 RNA was absent from the bridges, associated exclusively with the ER, and was shown to be anchored to the cytoskeleton. This compartmentalization of the transcript, mediated by cytoskeletal binding, occurs via protein interactions with 3' UTR AU-rich sequences that are likely involved in its stabilization.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We provide strong support for the LOS hypothesis, and have elucidated the mechanism of Spam1-associated TRD.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>A remarkable feature of mammalian testicular maturation of sperm is the syncytial organization that results from the presence of intercellular cytoplasmic bridges among the germ cells. These bridges allow transcript sharing among genetically different spermatids and provide a mechanism by which these cells develop synchronously into biochemically and functionally equivalent sperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Studies of spermatid-expressed genes for Protamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and several X-linked sperm-specific proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] provide strong evidence for transcript sharing. However sharing may not be a global phenomenon for all spermatid-expressed genes, particularly those encoding membrane proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Moreover there is compelling evidence for functionally different sperm in a male leading to TRD, as best exemplified by mice carrying different alleles at the <italic>t</italic>-complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The TRD seen for the <italic>t</italic>-haplotypes has been explained by unequal sharing of post-meiotic products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], but there is no evidence for this mechanism.</p><p>Earlier our laboratory provided evidence for a Lack-of-Sharing hypothesis (LOS) for TRDs that were discovered in the progeny of Robertsonian (Rb) translocation-bearing mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and shown to be associated with carriers of spontaneous mutations of the murine <italic>Sperm adhesion molecule1 (Spam1) </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. <italic>SPAM1 </italic>encodes a widely conserved sperm membrane protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] which has multiple essential roles in mammalian fertilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The murine gene which maps to proximal chromosome 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] in a cluster of hyaluronidase genes containing <italic>Hyalp1</italic>, <italic>Hyal4</italic>, and <italic>Hyal5 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], is spermatid-expressed and the RNA is transcriptionally regulated since it first appears together with the protein in the testis of postnatal Day 21.5 mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The TRDs were seen in heterozygotes of either of two Rb translocations, Rb(6.15) and Rb(6.16), in which multiple <italic>Spam1 </italic>point mutations were shown to be present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], leading to reduced expression of both the RNA and the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We have since observed that in these mice <italic>Hyalp1 </italic>and <italic>Hyal5 </italic>which have overlapping functions with <italic>Spam1 </italic>also have point mutations that would have contributed to the TRDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, the fact that <italic>Spam1 </italic>null mice are fertile suggests that other hyaluronidases are able to compensate for this gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Our LOS hypothesis for the <italic>Spam1</italic>-related TRDs is based on our finding of compartmentalization of the RNA, as assessed by RNA-FISH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This compartmentalization precludes transcript sharing in normal as well as mutant mice, and leads to biochemically different sperm with respect to the protein. Importantly, the protein is inserted in the acrosomal membrane soon after formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Our study showed that in males carrying different alleles of <italic>Spam1</italic>, compartmentalization leads to biochemically and functionally different sperm and the resulting TRD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The objectives of this study were to use transgene and null carriers of <italic>Spam1 </italic>to garner support for the LOS hypothesis and to study the transcript localization in normal mice to gain insights into the underlying mechanism leading to the TRD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Breeding and Transmission Study</title><p>The studies were approved by the Animal Care Committee at the University of Delaware and conform to the guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory animals published by the National Institutes of Health (publication 85-23, revised 1985).

Male trangenic founders, Tg8, Tg9, and Tg11, and their F<sub>1 </sub>progeny were mated to C57BL females, and transgenic and non-transgenic offspring identified by PCR genotyping at weaning. Tail DNA samples from progeny were screened using BAC vector-specific primers (F-5'AACATACGAGCCGGAAGCAT 3' and R-5'GATTCAGGTTCATCATGCCG 3') for PCR.

After several washes of the cells, fluorescence was measured (up to 30,000 sperm for each sample) using a FACScan (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA) flow cytometer with a Lysis II software package. The FACScan instrument uses an argon laser at 488 nm with detectors for FITC.

The specimens were examined using a Zeiss Axiophot (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with the appropriate FITC filter set, and imaged using a CCD-cooled camera and IPLab software. A total of 200 sperm were examined from each group to identify abnormal expression of Spam1.

Following perfusion, the testes were removed and immersed in the same fixative for 5 hr at 4&#x000b0;C. The tissues were then cut into small blocks of approximately 8 mm<sup>3</sup>, embedded in 2.5% melted agarose (at 60&#x000b0;C), and cut into 60 &#x003bc;m-thick frontal sections with a vibrotome. Groups of 10 sections were collected in autoclaved vials and washed three times in RNAse-free 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at room temperature. Glycine (1 M) was added to the buffer to neutralize aldehyde groups.</p><p>Prehybridization and hybridization procedures were performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

In most of the cases 50 silver grains were scored over each step spermatid cytoplasm. Since 85% of the silver grains were associated to the ER, a circle with a radius of 20 mm (equivalent to 0.23 &#x003bc;m resolution at 60,000x) was centered over silver grains that did not overlay any organelle. When an organelle was found within the circle, the radioautographic silver grain was attributed to such an organelle and considered as "exclusive".

Further, examination of 14-day fetuses retrieved from matings of four Tg8 hemizygous males with wild-type females showed 0/40 resorptions compared to 3/36 from congenic wild-type males. This indicated that progeny of Tg8 carriers had no greater tendency for post-implantation loss than those for wild-type males. Thus the progeny of Tg8 hemizygotes have a TRD that is likely not due to <italic>in utero </italic>selection, but rather to meiotic drive.</p><p>To determine if the sperm population in the Tg8 hemizygotes was heterogeneous with respect to Spam1 expression, caudal sperm from mature males were subjected to flow cytometric analysis. Unimodal distributions of sperm, with similar peaks, were seen for the congenic C57BL/6J wild-type and for Tg11 transgene carriers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>) which showed no TRD. On the other hand, Tg8 carriers showed a bimodal distribution with a shift to the right, indicating that there was a subpopulation of sperm with Spam1 overexpression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). To corroborate the flow cytometric finding of two phenotypic classes of sperm in Tg8 carriers we performed immunocytochemistry on aliquots of caudal (mature) sperm analyzed using flow cytometry in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>. Surprisingly, a highly significant (P &#x0003c; 0.01) proportion of the caudal sperm, (16.5%, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>) showed retention of enlarged cytoplasmic droplets (CDs) which were immunopositive for large deposits of Spam1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). Sperm with Spam1-containing CDs were lacking the protein on the heads, the normal location, and had far more Spam1 than was found on the heads of normal sperm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). Thus sperm with the retention of the CDs are consistent with transgenic overexpression of Spam1, as represented by the subpopulation in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref> with a shift to the right.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Flow cytometric analyses of sperm from hemizygotes for an overexpressed or a <italic>Spam1 </italic>null allele show bimodal distributions. <bold>a) </bold>Caudal sperm from the congenic wild-type, Tg11/+ and Tg8/+ show a bimodal distribution only for Tg8/+.

To confirm the significant increase of phenotypically abnormal caudal sperm with CDs in Tg8 carriers, we examined immature sperm from the caput of these mice. As might be expected, there were higher numbers of CDs containing large deposits of Spam1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>) and the difference between the Tg8 and wild-type mice was highly significant (P &#x0003c; 0.001) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). It should be noted that CDs in wild-type sperm were not only rare, but they were not enlarged (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c-A</xref>).</p><p>To unequivocally demonstrate that the Tg8/+ sperm with large amounts of Spam1 were a result of transgenic overexpression, sperm were sorted after flow cytometric analysis and the subpopulation with the more intense fluorescence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) recovered for analysis by fluorescence <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization (FISH). The <italic>Spam1-Hyal5 </italic>BAC used to generate the transgenic lines was used as the FISH probe, and 137/217 or 63.1% of the sperm had double hybridization signals representing the transgene and the endogenous locus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>) while 80/217 or 36.9% had a single signal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3e</xref>). Since double signal due to chromosome 6 disomy has a spontaneous frequency of only 0.9% (our unpublished data), these proportions of double and single signal sperm are highly significantly different from 1:1 (&#x003c7;<sup>2 </sup>= 14.96, P &#x0003c; 0.001). Thus they reveal that high Spam1 expression is a result of enrichment of transgene-bearing sperm or transgenic overexpression. The fact that a third of the sperm analyzed had a single signal can be explained by the overlapping peaks in the bimodal distribution (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>), resulting in collection of some of the subpopulation without Spam1 overexpression.</p><p>We also analyzed the CDs in Tg8 hemizygotes for the presence of the closely related Hyal5 protein encoded by <italic>Hyal5 </italic>which is present on the transgene. In Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c-B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c-C</xref> we show large amounts of Hyal5 in CDs at the neck of sperm and its absence on the head, similarly to what was seen for Spam1. These CDs are distinctly different from normal CDs which were devoid of the protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c-A</xref>), and were not seen in sperm from normal males. The overexpression of Hyal5 and its presence in retained CDs are consistent with the findings for Spam1 in Tg8 mice.</p><p>To test the LOS hypothesis using the <italic>Spam1 </italic>null carriers, caput sperm from sexually mature carriers and wild-type males were analyzed by flow cytometry for Spam1 quantities. There was a bimodal distribution including a subpopulation of sperm with only the baseline fluorescence, as can be seen for two animals in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, which was not seen for caput sperm in wild-type animals (data not shown). Note that in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> the position of the two peaks in A and B, are consistent with the presence of sperm carrying the null allele (background or baseline fluorescence) and those with the normal allele.</p><p>We addressed the underlying mechanism for the TRD by performing ultrastructural studies to examine the precise localization of <italic>Spam1 </italic>transcript.

These fractions were probed in Northern analysis with <italic>Spam1 </italic>cDNA, using &#x003b2;-actin (which is known to be cytoskeletal-bound) as an internal control.

Addition of ~100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor antisense DNA oligomers for all four AREs (C<sub>1</sub>) virtually abolished RNA-protein complex formation as seen in Lane C<sub>1 </sub>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), indicating the binding specificity of the ARE(s).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><italic>Spam1 </italic>RNA contains four AREs in the 3' UTR and UV-cross-linking reveals that one or two specifically bind testicular proteins. <bold>A) </bold>Four AU-rich motifs, 5' AUUUG...AUUUUA...AUUUUUA...AUUUUUG...3', are found in a 77 nucleotide sequence (nt 1909&#x02013;1985) in <italic>Spam1 </italic>3' UTR. <bold>B) </bold>In the upper panel the thin line represents the 77 nt riboprobe sequence containing the AU motifs while the thick lines show the antisense DNA oligomers used in competition assays.

However, the addition of ~100-fold excess unlabeled antisense DNA oligos for the two AREs in the 3' end of the RNA (C<sub>3</sub>) did not diminish the formation of the RNA-protein complexes as seen in Lane C<sub>3 </sub>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), indicating that these ARE's do not participate in the binding. When antisense oligos for these two 3' AREs were individually used in competition (C<sub>5 </sub>and C<sub>6</sub>), the formation of the RNA-protein complexes were also not diminished (data not shown). These results of <italic>in vitro </italic>binding are consistent with binding activity of <italic>Spam1 </italic>RNA, via one or both of the 5' AREs, to proteins that mediate cytoskeleton binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results show a highly significant (P &#x0003c; 0.001) heritable TRD in Tg8 carriers, in favor of normal sperm and against transgene-bearing ones with 10 copies of <italic>Spam1/Hyal5</italic>. [The Mendelian 1:1 transmission ratio that was detected for carriers of the other transgenic lines can be attributed to the difficulty in obtaining overexpression of these genes due to naturally occurring antisense RNA [Zhang et al., submitted]. Importantly the caudal sperm population of Tg8 carriers showed a bimodal distribution, reflecting the presence of sperm with different quantities of Spam1. FISH analysis showed that the high Spam1-expressing sperm were enriched for the transgene, indicating transgenic overexpression of Spam1. That transgene-bearing sperm produced significantly less progeny than normal sperm shows that optimal levels of Spam1 and Hyal5 are required for fertility, similar to &#x003b2;1,4-galactosyl transferase where overexpression is associated with acrosome instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>The failure of transgene-bearing sperm to effect fertilization in the expected ratio is a direct result of the retention of cytoplasmic droplets (CDs). A CD is an organelle with residual cytoplasm on the neck or tail of sperm. It results from a defect in the final stages of spermiogenesis and its presence in mature sperm renders them infertile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. It is interesting that sperm with overexpressed Spam1 and Hyal5 in CDs were lacking the proteins on the surface of the heads where they are normally found. Thus in addition to the sperm motility defects associated with CDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] there would be a decreased ability of penetration of the cumulus cells, leading to their infertility. It should be noted that in domestic animals CD-associated infertility has been shown to be due to poor passage through hyaluronate swim-up medium and failure to bind to the zona pellucida [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], both of which are functions of Spam1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However this is the first report of the presence of hyaluronidases in CDs, although a number of other enzymes have been identified in them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>The fact that the number of sperm with the enlarged CD phenotype is less than 50% and 100% in Tg8 hemizygotes and homozygotes, respectively, may be due to technical factors such as their loss during preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. It is also likely that the highly regulated <italic>Spam1 </italic>silencing which is mediated by antisense transcription [Zhang et al., submitted] could be responsible. This silencing would be adaptive since overexpression of Spam1 and Hyal5 leads to their mis-expression in CDs, which are abnormally retained and which lead to infertility. Thus in Tg8 carriers there are functionally different sperm within a male, due to their different quantities of Spam1 and Hyal5. It is not known if Spam1 and Hyal5 are overexpressed in the same CDs, consequently their co-localization will be investigated in future studies.</p><p>The finding of structurally and functionally different sperm in Tg8 transgene carriers is reminiscent of the findings for heterozygotes of spontaneous mutant alleles of <italic>Spam1 </italic>and is also consistent with compartmentalization of the RNA and protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The accumulation of the overexpressed Spam1 and Hyal5 protein in the CDs of trangene-bearing sperm is a result of a lack of transcript sharing between these sperm and those with the normal alleles. These observations on the transgenic model therefore provide support for the LOS Hypothesis in the etiology of TRDs.</p><p>Similarly, the LOS hypothesis is also supported by the findings from carriers of <italic>Spam1 </italic>null allele. Generated by insertion of a neo cassette in exon II (which contains the hyaluronidase domain) of <italic>Spam1 </italic>in the laboratory Tadashi Baba [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], null mice were shown to be fertile (despite a delay in cumulus penetration) due to the compensating effect of the redundant Hyal5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Carriers of <italic>Spam1 </italic>null showed a bimodal distribution of Spam1 in caput sperm, with one subpopulation having background levels of fluorescence, consistent with the presence of sperm with a null allele. Since Spam1 is expressed in the epididymis where it may be acquired by sperm during transit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] caput, but not cauda, sperm would reflect the spermatid phenotype, and the finding from these sperm is supportive of a lack of transcript sharing.</p><p>To determine the mechanism for the lack of transcript sharing we focused on RNA compartmentalization. It has been proposed that mRNA localization facilitates protein sorting and that nascent polypeptide chain targeting of membrane proteins is a major mechanism that accounts for mRNA localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We show that 85% of the grains from <italic>in situ </italic>transcript hybridization localized to the ER and the remaining 15% could be assigned to this region. This indicates that the transcripts are not dispersed in the cytoplasm where they would gain ready access to the bridges. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> shows that they are not associated with any major spermatid structure, such as the chromatoid bodies (which indicates that the RNA is not stored and is not translationally regulated), the radial bodies, or the microtubules of the manchette (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). Importantly, they are absent from the bridges although they may be in the vicinity. In this connection it should be pointed out that the absence of the transcript from the chromatoid bodies which have recently been seen to cross the bridges (Parvinen and Sassone-Corsi, personal communication), bolsters the evidence for the RNA compartmentalization.</p><p>The compartmentalization of <italic>Spam1 </italic>transcripts and their absence from the bridges suggest that they are anchored, and this would preclude sharing and support our LOS hypothesis. Based on the restricted location of the transcript at the ER, it was expected that Northern analysis would reveal its association with the membrane-bound fraction. However, this was not the case as <italic>Spam1 </italic>RNA was shown to be associated with the cytoskeletal fraction and therefore anchored. More importantly, we show that the transcript has AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' UTR that are known to bind cytoplasmic proteins (AUBPs) that mediate binding to the cytoskeleton. Interestingly, AREs are also present in the 3' UTR of the rodent-specific <italic>Hyal5 </italic>(Genbank Accession# <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="ABO85680">ABO85680</ext-link>) which (at the nucleotide level) is 71% homologous to <italic>Spam1 </italic>with which it shares all functional domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus <italic>Hyal5 </italic>transcripts are likely to be cytoskeletal-bound and compartmentalized.</p><p>While cytoskeletal-binding may assist with anchoring and maintaining a pool of <italic>Spam1 </italic>and <italic>Hyal5 </italic>transcripts which can be recruited to the ER for co-translational assembly which occurs for membrane proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], the data also suggest its involvement in posttranscriptional regulation. AREs are well-known to mediate RNA (in)stability by interacting with <italic>trans</italic>-acting proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Further, their protein interaction which mediates cytoskeletal binding is known to be involved in mRNA turnover and posttranscriptional regulation of RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We have recently observed that testicular <italic>Spam1 </italic>RNA may be stabilized by interactions with RNA-binding proteins [Zhang et al., submitted]. Therefore the presence of AREs in <italic>Spam1 </italic>RNA and the demonstration of their ability to specifically bind testicular proteins, potentially relates TRD with posttranscriptional regulation of the RNA. Simply put, the cytoarchitecture that facilitates the co-translational assembly of the transcript in the ER is involved in regulating mRNA decay and ultimately precludes RNA sharing via the bridges Taken together, our findings provide strong support for the LOS hypothesis. They also mechanistically relate RNA compartmentalization, mediated by cytoskeletal binding, and the regulation of the mRNA turnover to TRD.</p><p>TRD has been seen for a) the transmission of disease alleles such as delta F508 of the <italic>CFTR </italic>gene for cystic fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and b) the inheritance of the most common Robertsonian translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and is a phenomenon for which there is extensive evidence in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Based on the diversity of genes involved, it is likely that there may be many different underlying mechanisms. However the findings in this study have uncovered, to our knowledge, the first molecular mechanism for a mammalian TRD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Dr. Tadashi Baba for providing the <italic>Spam1 </italic>null mice.
