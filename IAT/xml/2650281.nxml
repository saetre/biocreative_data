Both mucosal and systemic immune responses to infection can induce IgA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> plasma cell formation, resulting in production of secretory and serum IgA respectively. In both pathways, isotype class-switching in B cells is tightly regulated by the cytokine-milieu. While it is believed that interleukin-6 (IL-6), originally described as a B-cell stimulating factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000338-Hirano1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, stimulates plasma cell differentiation and promotes IgA responses <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000338-Ramsay1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of IgA-secreting plasma cells remain poorly understood. In particular, detailed knowledge about proteins in the B cell membrane that control this process is lacking.</p><p>IgA-secreting plasma cells are predominantly found in the mucosal-associated lymphoid system (MALT) and bone marrow. During the mucosal immune response, intestinal dendritic cells present mucosal antigen to CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in Peyer's patches, or present antigen directly to B1 cells in a T cell-independent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000338-Mora1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000338-McGhee1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. This leads to the local production of secretory IgA, which is important in neutralizing intestinal microbes and controlling gut homeostasis. Secondly, systemic immune responses to T cell-dependent antigens lead to the development of germinal centers (GC) in spleen and peripheral lymph nodes that are the origin of long-lived plasma cells that produce high affinity IgG and IgA antibodies in serum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000338-Kelsoe1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000338-ShapiroShelef1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.
