CXCR4 is expressed in malignant tumor cells whereas its ligand SDF-1 (CXCL12) is expressed mainly by cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF). Similarly to CXCR4, the chemokine CCL20 is overexpressed in variety of tumors; however its role and regulation in tumors is not fully clear. Here, we show that the chemokine receptor CXCR4 stimulates the production of the chemokine CCL20 and that CCL20 stimulates the proliferation and adhesion to collagen of various tumor cells. Furthermore, overexpression of CCL20 in tumor cells promotes growth and adhesion in vitro and increased tumor growth and invasiveness in vivo. Moreover, neutralizing antibodies to CCL20 inhibit the in vivo growth of tumors that either overexpress CXCR4 or CCL20 or naturally express CCL20. These results reveal a role for CCL20 in CXCR4-dependent and -independent tumor growth and suggest a therapeutic potential for CCL20 and CCR6 antagonists in the treatment of CXCR4- and CCL20-dependent malignancies.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chemokines, a family of small (5&#x02013;20 kDa) pro-inflammatory cytokines, are primarily responsible for the directional migration, or chemotaxis, of lymphocytes to specific lymphoid tissues, and the recruitment of leukocytes to the sites of infection or tissue damage.

We found an increase in expression of the chemokine CCL20 following stimulation with CXCL12. To further study the possible role of CXCR4 in the regulation of CCL20 expression, we evaluated the mRNA expression of CCL20 in prostate cancer cells with low and high CXCR4 expression using real-time RT-PCR. We found a 41-fold increase in CCL20 mRNA in cells with high CXCR4 expression compared to the wild-type PC3 cells. Moreover, stimulation of both PC3 and PC3-CXCR4.5 cells with CXCL12, the ligand of CXCR4, increased CCL20 mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Next, we assessed whether the constitutive and regulated expression of CCL20 mRNA was paralleled by protein production, using an ELISA assay to CCL20. Corresponding with PCR results, CXCR4 over-expression in PC3 cells increased the constitutive levels of CCL20 secretion from 8.6&#x000b1;4.5 pg/ml in PC3 cells to 433&#x000b1;30 pg/ml in PC3-CXCR4.5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Moreover, the stimulation of both parental PC3 and PC3-CXCR4.5 cells with CXCL12 increased the secretion of CCL20 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). To determine the pattern of CCL20 release, we tested the protein levels of CCL20 in a culture medium and in lysed cells following different periods of incubation with CXCL12. PC3-CXCR4.5 cells were incubated with CXCL12 500 ng/ml for 6, 24 or 48 hours; culture medium was collected and the cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 1&#x00025; NP-40. Stimulation with CXCL12 increased the intracellular levels of CCL20 following 6 hours of incubation, however there was no release of CCL20 to the culture medium at this time point. Following 24 hours of incubation, intra-cellular levels of CCL20 in non-stimulated and in CXCL12-stimulated cells were increased, as well the secreted CCL20 was detected in the culture medium of CXCL12-stimulated PC3-CXCR4.5 cells (no secretion in non-treated cells versus 4.9 pg/ml of CCL20 in CXCL12-treated cells). After 48 hours of incubation, the levels of intra-cellular CCL20 were significantly elevated and higher CCL20 production was observed in CXCL12-stimulated cells, in addition, the secretion of CCL20 was increased. Both synthesized and secreted CCL20 levels increased in response to CXCL12 stimulation, and the cumulative pattern of synthesis and release was observed over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p><p>In order to find whether PC3 and PC3-CXCR4.5 cells secrete CCL20 in a CXCR4/CXCL12 dependent manner, we treated the cells with antibodies to CXCL12 and PTX. In PC3 cells, treatment with neutralizing antibodies against CXCL12 or with PTX (alone or in combination with CXCL12) effectively inhibited the secretion of CCL20. Surprisingly, in PC3-CXCR4.5 cells, anti-CXCL12 antibodies and PTX only partially inhibited the secretion of CCL20 whereas PTX failed to inhibit CXCL12- dependent increase of CCL20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p><p>CCL20 production from PC3 cells is dependent on CXCR4/CXCL12 interaction; however, it was not clear whether the expression and secretion of CCL20 from PC3-CXCR4.5 cells was dependent only on CXCR4. In order to determine the role of CXCR4 in the regulation of CCL20 production, we silenced CXCR4 by RNA interference in PC3-CXCR4.5 - prostate cancer cells with high CXCR4 expression. PC3-CXCR4.5 cells were transfected with Dicer-substrate anti-CXCR4 mRNA specific siRNA. The efficacy of CXCR4 silencing was assessed 48 hours post-transfection. We achieved over 90&#x00025; reduction in CXCR4 cell surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) and 75&#x00025; reduction in mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) using siRNA to CXCR4 RNA. Next, we sought to determine whether the reduction in CXCR4 might inhibit CCL20 production in PC3-CXCR4.5 cells. Forty eight hours following transfection with siRNA, PC3-CXCR4.5 cells were re-seeded and stimulated with CXCL12 for an additional 48 hours. CCL20 secretion levels in culture medium of the cells transfected with either nonspecific control siRNA or the CXCR4 siRNA were measured using ELISA assay. Silencing of CXCR4 significantly reduced both constitutive and CXCL12-stimulated levels of CCL20 production. In non-stimulated cells, the secretion of CCL20 was decreased from 350&#x000b1;56 pg/ml in control cell to 42&#x000b1;2.8 pg/ml in cells with CXCR4 siRNA (p&#x0003c;0.0054). In CXCL12-stimulated cells, the secretion of CCL20 was decreased from 600&#x000b1;113 pg/ml in control cells to 137.5&#x000b1;53 pg/ml in cells with CXCR4 siRNA (p&#x0003c;0.0035, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). In addition, we tested the effect of CXCR4 silencing on CCL20 mRNA level using real-time RT-PCR.

(D) PC3 and PC3-CXCR4 cells were incubated with various concentration of CCL20 for 6 days. Following 3 days of incubation, the medium with or without CCL20 was renewed. On day 6, the cells were harvested and viable cells were counted using PI staining and FACS analysis. In addition, in order to determine proliferation of PC3 cells, the cells were labeled with BrdU (10 &#x000b5;M) during the last 16 hours of incubation and processed for BrdU detection using specific anti-BrdU FITC-conjugated antibody and FACS analysis. Data is presented as mean&#x000b1;SD from triplicates (&#x0002a;&#x0002a; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Data is representative of two separate experiments. (E&#x02013;F) PC3 and PC3-CXCR4.5 cells either untreated or treated with various concentrations of CCL20 were placed on collagen I- or fibronectin-coated plates (10 &#x000b5;g/ml) for 30 minutes. Non-adherent cells were washed twice with cold PBS. Adherent cells were collected in 300 &#x000b5;l FACS buffer with 5 mM EDTA and counted by FACS. Data is presented as mean&#x000b1;SD from triplicates (&#x0002a;&#x0002a; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). In addition, PC3 cells (E) that demonstrated increased adhesion to collagen I and fibronectin in response to stimulation with CCL20, were co-incubated with CCL20 and PTX (100 ng/ml) and were allowed to adhere to collagen I- and fibronectin-coated plates.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0005125.g002"/></fig><p>CCL20 expression and secretion in the parental PC3 and PC3-CXCR4.5 cells that overexpress CXCR4 are regulated by CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g001">Fig. 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). PC3 cells express low levels of CXCR4 and secrete low levels of CCL20, whereas PC3-CXCR4.5 cells express high levels of CXCR4 and ten-fold higher levels of CCL20. In both cell lines, treatment with PTX or anti CXCL12 blocked CCL20 secretion; however, the inhibitory effect of PTX or anti CXCL12 was much more evident in the parental cells. Similarly, the effect of PTX on CXCL12-induced secretion of CCL20 was partial, albeit significant only in the parental PC3 cells. The differences between these cells may be the result of a more robust activation of diverse signaling pathways activated by CXCR4 and the use of insensitive G&#x003b1; chain used by CXCR4. Various signal transduction pathways have been implicated through the association of CXCR4 receptors with the guanine nucleotide binding protein (G-proteins). For example, stimulation of CXCR4 transfectants by CXCL12 results in increased phosphorylation of focal adhesion components, including the related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK/Pyk2), Crk, and paxillin. CXCL12 induced activation of the p44/42 MAP kinases (Erk 1 and 2), PI3 kinase, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0005125.e001.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005125-Ganju1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005125-Barbero1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005125-Peng1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, a short time following CXCL12 activation, the CXCR4 receptor becomes tyrosine phosphorylated through the activation and association with the receptor of JAK2 and JAK3 kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005125-Zhang1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005125-Soriano1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Several STAT transcriptional factors, including STAT1, -2, -3, and -5, but not STAT4 or -6, are associated with CXCR4 activation, concurring with the role assigned to the JAK tyrosine kinases in transducing signals from hematopoietic growth factor receptors. Tyrosine phosphorylation of two other members of the chemokine receptor family, CCR2 and CCR5, in response to their respective ligands (MCP-1 and RANTES) and the critical role of the JAK/STAT pathway activation in later chemokine signaling events were also documented. The activation in T cells of different STATs by the chemokines RANTES and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0005125.e002.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> has also been reported. Tyrosine phosphorylation is not a unique feature of chemokine receptors, since other GPCRs also activate STAT transcription factors. Interestingly, JAK/STAT pathway activation by chemokines and their receptors is not always blocked by PTX pretreatment, indicating a G-protein-independent pathway. To address the importance of JAK/STAT and MEK activation on the secretion of CCL20, we treated the PC3 and PC3-CXCR4.5 cells with JAK-2 inhibitor AG-490 (Cat. 658401; Calbiochem) at 1 &#x000b5;m/ml. and the MEK inhibitor- PD98059 (20 &#x000b5;M) (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) PD. In both cell lines, the JAK-2 inhibitor AG-490 totally abrogated CCL20 secretion, whereas the MEK inhibitor- PD98059 slightly increased the levels of CCL20. DMSO used for dissolving PD or AG-490 had an inhibitory effect on CCL20 secretion, and more significantly on the parental PC3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>). These results may suggest a role for the JAK/STAT pathway in the CXCL12-induced secretion of CCL20.</p><p>The increased levels of CCL20 associated with increased levels of CXCR4 do not correlate with the CXCL12 low levels secreted by PC3 or PC3-CXCR4.5 cells and cannot be blocked by anti CXCL12 when added to PC3-CXCR4.5 cell cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>). One possibility to explain such a phenomenon is the presence of a CXCR4 ligand other than CXCL12. Although chemokines typically display a high degree of receptor promiscuity, CXCR4 was (until recently) thought to bind only to CXCL12. However, recently, it was demonstrated that the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) can compete with the recognized ligand for CXCL12 for binding to CXCR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005125-Bernhagen1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. CXCR4 was shown to be homo-oligomerized by several experimental systems. It is possible that CXCR4 oligomerization may lead to autonomous signaling which is mediated through JAK/ STAT signaling.</p><p>To better understand the role of CCL20 in prostate cancer development, we characterized the expression of CCL20 and its receptor CCR6 in human prostate cell lines PC3, LNCaP, 22RV1 and DU145. We first examined CCR6 receptor surface and mRNA expression levels in these four cell lines. RT-PCR analysis and FACS analysis demonstrated that only PC3 cell line expressed CCR6 receptor at mRNA level and on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Next, we performed ELISA experiments to determine the secretion levels of CCL20 chemokine. Among the four prostate cancer cell lines studied, only PC3 cells secreted detectable levels of CCL20 into the culture supernatant during the 48 hours incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). However, in addition to PC3 cells, the mRNA expression of CCL20 was demonstrable in DU145 cells and at a very low level also in LANCaP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Since PC3 cells co-expressed the CCR6 receptor and its ligand CCL20, we focused our in vitro and in vivo experimental work on PC3 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>CCL20 promotes the growth and adhesion of CCR6-expressing tumor cells in vitro</title><p>We hypothesized that the CCR6-CCL20 axis may be involved in tumor progression via paracrine and/or autocrine mechanisms. To assess biological behavior resulting from CCL20-mediated activation in PC3 cells, we studied the effect of CCL20 on the growth and survival of PC3 cells in culture. PC3 cells were treated with various concentrations of CCL20. The number of viable cells following six days of incubation was detected using propidium iodide (PI) and FACS analysis. Treatment of cells with CCL20 increased the number of viable PC3 cells in the culture at a concentration of 5 ng/ml (1.35-fold increase, p&#x0003c;0.04) and at a concentration of 50 ng/ml (1.75-fold increase, p&#x0003c;0.0004); whereas at the highest concentration of CCL20, 250 ng/ml, we found no change in the number of viable cells compared to control non-stimulated PC3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). To further verify these results, CCL20-treated cells were loaded with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU). Cell proliferation was tested by staining for BrdU incorporation using specific anti-BrdU antibody and FACS analysis. Consistent with previous results, CCL20 induced the incorporation of BrdU in the cells at a concentration of 5 and 50 ng/ml (1.76-fold increase, p&#x0003c;0.0002), whereas treating the cells with higher concentration of CCL20 did not change the level of BrdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). In accordance with the previous results, we found that PC3-CXCR4.5 cells, which constitutively express high levels of CCL20, where inhibited in their growth when treated with increasing concentrations of CCL20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Concentration of 250 ng/ml even decreased the number of PC3-CXCR4.5 viable cells (p&#x0003c;0.006).</p><p>Adhesion of cancer cells to extracellular matrix (ECM) components is a step that is associated with tumor seeding, invasion and spreading. In order to investigate the effect of CCL20 on PC3 cell adhesion to the ECM proteins, we tested the adhesion of PC3 cells to the fibronectin and collagen I in response to increasing concentrations of CCL20. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>, elevated doses of CCL20 slightly increased the adhesion of cells to fibronectin (500 ng/ml of CCL20 promoted 1.45-fold increase, p&#x0003c;0.01), and significantly increased the adhesion of cells to collagen type I in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). Upon activation by CCL20 at concentration of 50 ng/ml PC3, adhesion to collagen I was 2.2-fold elevated (p&#x0003c;0.001); concentration of 500 ng/ml caused a 2.09-fold increase in adhesion (p&#x0003c;0.003). Treatment with pertussis toxin (PTX) prevented the CCL20-induced increase in PC3 cell adhesion to fibronectin (p&#x0003c;0.0009) and collagen I (p&#x0003c;0.002) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). In contrast to PC3 cells , adhesion of CCL20-producing PC3-CXCR4.5 cells to collagen I and fibronectin was slightly decreased following stimulation with increased doses of CCL20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p><p>The exposure of chemokine receptors to high concentrations of chemokines often results in the rapid attenuation of receptor responsiveness and a reduced biological response. This process termed &#x02018;desensitization&#x02019; is the consequence of a combination of different mechanisms.

The levels of CCL20 were quantified using PCR and ELISA assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>).

Treatment with anti-CCL20 antibodies significantly inhibited the growth and invasion of HT-29 tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g004">Fig. 4H</xref>). Moreover, antibodies to CCL20 inhibited the invasion of tumor cells into surrounding tissues similarly to the skin and muscle (data not shown).

The immunohistochemical staining revealed that the majority of tumor samples (50 out of 52, 96&#x00025;) expressed the CCR6 receptor at heterogeneous levels. Whereas the ligand for CCR6, CCL20, was expressed in 34 out of 52 tumor samples (65.4&#x00025;).

All tissue sections were obtained from the Pathology Department of the Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center. The average Gleason score in these patients was significantly lower than in the commercial array, 5.77 versus 8.04 respectively. Similar to the commercial array CCL20 was expressed in 70.5&#x00025; of the tumors and CCR6 was expressed in 95.5&#x00025; of the tumors sections. However, in contrast to the commercial array no significant correlation between CCL20 expression and Gleason score (e.g., tumor grade) and staging was found. These results suggest that CCL20 and CCR6 are commonly expressed in prostate cancer tumors; however, more studies are needed to demonstrate their diagnostic significance.</p><p>In order further test the possible interaction between CXCR4 receptor and CCL20 chemokine in prostate cancer, we evaluated the coexpression of CCL20 and CXCR4 in human prostate cancer tissues with the use of commercially available additional array of 48 paraffin-embedded prostate sections from patients with advanced prostate cancer.

Four additional samples demonstrated close expression pattern, and only six samples out of 48 (12.5&#x00025;) demonstrated different expression levels of CXCR4 and CCL20.

Here we show that CXCR4 up-regulates the expression of the chemokine CCL20 in various cancer cells, and that CCL20 in turn promotes in an autocrine manner the survival, proliferation and adhesion of cancer cells in vitro and enhances xenograft tumor growth, vascularization and invasion in vivo. CCL20 (also known as macrophage inflammatory protein-3&#x003b1; (MIP3&#x003b1;); liver and activation-regulated chemokine (LARC) or exodus-1) is a 9 kDa CC-type chemokine, which is expressed constitutively at low levels by keratinocytes in epidermal layers of skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005125-Charbonnier1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> intestinal mucosa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005125-Tanaka1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005125-Hieshima1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, epithelial crypts of tonsils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005125-Dieu1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as in the epithelium of Peyer's patches in the intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005125-Iwasaki1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. While there is redundancy in the human chemokine network, CCL20 is the unique chemokine ligand of its receptor CCR6. Expression of CCL20 is strongly enhanced by pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and LPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005125-Sugita1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005125-Harder1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. CCL20 selectively attracts CCR6-expressing natural killer cells, memory T cells, TH17 cells, and immature dendritic cells (DC) to the sites of inflammation to encounter the invading pathogens.</p><p>Recent studies suggested that CCL20 is an important player in the tumor chemokine network and similarly to other chemokines, CCL20 may promote cancer progression by two mechanisms: acting directly as a growth factor on cancer cells or establishing a microenvironment that suppresses specific anticancer responses. CCL20 expression has been described in a variety of human neoplasms, including colorectal, lung, pancreatic and breast human adenocarcinomas, malignant glioma, leukemia, lymphoma and melanoma However, the role of CCL20 in cancer development remains controversial. Since CCL20 is a potent chemoattractant for immature DCs, the most powerful antigen-presenting cells, it seems logical to attract iDCs to the tumor site to induce antitumor immune response. According to this approach, Fushimi et al., demonstrated in a mouse model that intratumor injection of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of CCL20 could suppress tumor growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005125-Fushimi1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, there is a growing body of evidence supporting the hypothesis that CCL20 production by cancer cells promotes tumor growth and invasiveness. Contrary to the results of Fushimi et al., other groups of investigators have shown that transfection of rodent tumor cell line with CCL20 enhances tumor growth and decreases immunogenicity, despite the attraction of iDCs to the tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005125-Bonnotte1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. In their model, as in human breast carcinomas which secrete high levels of CCL20 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005125-Bell1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, attracted DCs to the tumor site did not mature. These may serve as one of the tumor escape mechanisms by which attracted immature DCs poorly stimulate T-cell antitumor response, and moreover can activate regulatory T cells which suppress specific anti-tumor immune responses.</p><p>In our experimental models, we chose to evaluate the involvement of CCL20 in prostate and colon tumor growth, vascularization and invasiveness. Our results match the observations of Kleef et al., who demonstrated that CCL20 is overexpressed in human pancreatic carcinoma cells and in infiltrating macrophages adjacent to tumors, and stimulates the growth and invasion of neoplastic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005125-Kleeff1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Up- regulation of CCL20 was demonstrated in human hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, and CCL20 expression was found to correlate with tumor grade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005125-Rubie2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, we found that CXCR4, CCL20 and CCR6 are over- and coexpressed in human prostate cancer specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005125-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). In support of our findings it was recently published that the expression levels of CCR6 in prostate cancer are associated with clinical and pathologic features of more advanced and aggressive prostate cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005125-Ghadjar1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we show that, CCL20 promotes the growth and adhesion of CCR6-expressing cancer cell lines. Moreover, overexpression of CCL20 or CXCR4 in prostate and colon cancer cells promotes tumor growth that was neutralized with anti-CCL20 antibodies. These findings strongly emphasize the potential co-involvement of CCL20 and CXCR4 in cancer development.</p><p>Altogether, our findings provide evidence for the existence of a putative CXCR4/CCL20 interaction that could be involved in cancer development processes.
