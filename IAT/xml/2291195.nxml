Loss of DDB2 function may be related to tumor susceptibility. However, hypothesis of this study was that DDB2 could play a role in breast cancer cell growth, resulting in its well known interaction with the proliferative marker E2F1 in breast neoplasia. DDB2 gene was overexpressed in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (MCF-7 and T47D), but not in ER-negative breast cancer (MDA-MB231 and SKBR3) or normal mammary epithelial cell lines. In addition, DDB2 expression was significantly (3.0-fold) higher in ER-positive than in ER-negative tumor samples (<italic>P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;</italic>0.0208) from 16 patients with breast carcinoma. Knockdown of DDB2 by small interfering RNA in MCF-7 cells caused a decrease in cancer cell growth and colony formation. Inversely, introduction of the DDB2 gene into MDA-MB231 cells stimulated growth and colony formation. Cell cycle distribution and 5 Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation by flow cytometry analysis showed that the growth-inhibiting effect of DDB2 knockdown was the consequence of a delayed G1/S transition and a slowed progression through the S phase of MCF-7 cells. These results were supported by a strong decrease in the expression of S phase markers (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen, cyclin E and dihydrofolate reductase). These findings demonstrate for the first time that DDB2 can play a role as oncogene and may become a promising candidate as a predictive marker in breast cancer.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Damaged DNA Binding protein 2 (DDB2) is a 48-kDa protein originally identified as a component of the damage-specific DNA-binding heterodimeric complex DDB, which is involved in nucleotide excision repair of UV-induced DNA damage through interaction with DDB1 (127- kDA protein) or CSA proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002002-Chu1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Two stably DDB2 siRNA-transfected MCF-7 cell clones (cl.2 and cl.3) were isolated, where the DDB2 expression was strongly suppressed in contrast to that in the parent cells (Wt) and in the stably transfected cells with a scrambled siRNA duplex sequence (control siRNA) which were used as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002002-g003">Figure 3A and B</xref>).

With the time release from serum addition (12 and 18 h), we observed that both DDB2-deficient MCF-7 cell lines re-entered the cell cycle, with a loss of G1 cells and the appearance of a high S-phase fraction, but no G2 cell presence. The high peak corresponding to the S-phase fraction shifted slightly between 12 and 18 h after serum addition. However, the control MCF-7 cells were distributed in all phases of the cell cycle, with a lower S-phase fraction and a significant peak corresponding to about 19&#x00025; and 14&#x00025; G2 cells after 12 and 18 h addition of serum, respectively, compared to the DDB2-deficient MCF-7 cell lines. These results suggest that the DDB2 deficient MCF-7 cells advanced in the cell cycle more slowly than the control cells. These results were confirmed by 5 BrdU incorporation into cells growing synchronously after serum starvation. The cell fractions in G1/S and S-phases were estimated by flow cytometry analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002002-g006">Figure 6</xref>). A lack of labeling index (LI) corresponding to a lack of 5 BrdU incorporation was observed, indicating no cells were in the S-phase after 48 h of serum starvation. An alteration of cell cycle progression was observed in the DDB2 deficient MCF-7 cells 3 h after the addition of serum. Similar to the finding by cell cycle analysis after PI staining, no 5 BrdU incorporation was quantified for both DDB2-deficient MCF-7 cell lines, whereas the LI for the Wt and siRNA control MCF-7 cells (6.6&#x00025; and 9.3&#x00025;, respectively) revealed important S-phase fractions in these lines. Then, &#x00025; 5 BrdU-positive cells corresponding to the LI for DDB2 deficient cells was strongly increased and was similar to the control MCF-7 cells at 12 and 18 h after release from serum depletion. Compared to that of the control cells, this LI indicated an important pool of DDB2-deficient cells which started to re-enter the cell cycle and which corresponded to an essentially G1/S subpopulation. The DDB2-deficient MCF-7 cell clones 2 and 3 showed S-phase fractions respectively 6.8- and 4.2-fold less than that of the control MCF-7 cells, at 12 and 18 h after release from serum depletion. In addition, no G2 fraction was detected for both DDB2-deficient MCF-7 cell clones. These results demonstrate that DDB2 knockdown led to a delayed G1/S transition phase entry and a slowed MCF-7 cell progression through the S phase. These results were confirmed by an investigation of the PCNA protein level. Regardless of the time from release of serum depletion, the PCNA protein level was greatly reduced in both DDB2-deficient MCF-7 cell lines, compared to that of tubulin, used as a loading control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002002-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0002002-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002002.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>DDB2 knockdown affects cell cycle distribution of MCF-7 cells.</title><p>Parent cells (Wt), control siRNA-transfected MCF-7 cells and the two DDB2 siRNA-transfected cell clones (DDB2 siRNA cl.2 and cl.3) were synchronized by serum starvation for 48h, and induced to re-enter the cell cycle by the addition of serum for 0, 3, 12 or 18h.

The basal DDB2 level was very low or undetectable in ER-negative breast cancer cells and in the nontumorigenic epithelial mammary HMEC cell line. In addition, a correlation between DDB2 expression and ER status was observed also in breast tumor samples from patients.

In the present study, we observed that the DDB2 gene was upregulated in ER-positive breast cancer cells, compared to the very low expression of DDB2 in the nontumorigenic epithelial mammary HMEC cell line. The mechanism by which DDB2 expression is dysregulated in ER-breast cancer cells is not known. Moreover, the molecular mechanism involved in the loss of DDB2 gene expression in ER-negative breast cancer cells will need to be defined in the future. One hypothesis would suggest the involvement of BRCA1. The ER-positive breast cancer cells, such as MCF-7 and T47D cells, express BRCA1, whereas the ER-negative tumor cells, such as SKBR3 and MDA-MB231 cells are BRCA1 negative <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002002-Elstner1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Involvement of ER and other transcription factors or other molecular mechanisms are not excluded and future investigations will need to elucidate the regulation of DDB2 expression during breast tumor progression.</p><p>The surprising evidence that the high DDB2 content correlated with the high proliferation rate of MCF-7 and T47D cells compared to MDA-MB231 and SKBR3 cells, along with a number of studies reporting a role of DDB2 in the cell cycle regulation of normal cells, led us to investigate the role of this protein in tumor growth. The result of the inhibition of DDB2 expression, through the strategy of small interfering RNA (siRNA), gave a significant reduction of the growth rate and clonogenicity of the MCF-7 cells and an increased cell doubling time. Inversely, introduction of the DDB2 gene into MDA-MB231 cells increased their growth rate and clonogenicity and decreased their cell doubling time. We demonstrated that the increase in the doubling time of DDB2-deficient MCF-7 cells resulted in a slowing of their entry into G1/S transition and of their progression through the S phase of cell cycle. Moreover, no G2 fraction was detected 18h after release from serum depletion for both DDB2-deficient MCF-7 cell clones compared to control cells. These data suggest that DDB2 may play a role as an activator of breast tumor cell proliferation at the G1/S transition and during the S-phase progression of the cell cycle. The involvement of DDB2 at this checkpoint of the cell cycle correlates with the fact that it is well expressed in dividing and undamaged normal cells in the mid-G1 phase and peaks at the G1/S boundary, before dropping significantly in the S phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002002-Nag1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A strong decrease in the expression of DHFR, cyclin E and PCNA genes, which are required for DNA synthesis and more generally for proliferation, was observed in DDB2-deficient MCF-7 cells. These results suggest that DDB2 deficiency, by promoting a down-regulation of the replication genes during tumor cell growth, leads to the slowed entry into the G1/S transition and the S phase of the cell cycle. Expression of these genes is controlled by E2F1, a transcription factor which stimulates cell cycle progression at G1 to S phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002002-Stevens1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. This role is well documented in tumor cells, and particularly in breast cancer cells where E2F1 and its E2F1-target genes, including DHFR, PCNA and cyclin E, are overexpressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002002-Zhang1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002002-Nielsen1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, one mechanism by which DDB2 plays a role in tumor cell proliferation could be related to its interaction with E2F1. Indeed, in association with DDB1, DDB2 has a functional interaction with E2F1, leading to the stimulation of the E2F1-target gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002002-Hayes1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. However, no significant correlation between E2F1-target genes and DDB2 was observed in our breast tumor samples (see Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002002.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This preliminary clinical study was probably limited by the small number of samples. Also, further investigation with larger breast tumor samples will be necessary.</p><p>The present study provides new insights showing that DDB2 plays a novel biological function. DDB2 functions as a tumor suppressor in normal cells, at least in part by regulating cell proliferation and controlling p53-mediated apoptosis. Deletion of DDB2 in normal cells promotes spontaneous tumor growth in the absense of UV- or carcinogen-induced DNA lesions, probably due to an accumulation of unrepaired DNA lesions, leading to cell transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002002-Yoon1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, DDB2 exhibited in vitro oncogenic properties in ER-positive breast cancer cells, through the stimulation of cell proliferation. These results suggest that the overexpression of DDB2 imparts a growth advantage for ER-positive breast cancer cells. We can consider that DDB2 exhibits ying and yang activity, as does E2F1. Under normal circumstances, E2F1 plays a role in stimulating growth through its regulation of the expression of genes required for cell cycle progression in breast cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002002-Zhang1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002002-Johnson1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, E2F1 can also play a role in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, in response to DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002002-DeGregori1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our results describe an association between DDB2 and ER status in breast cancer as well as in preclinical models and in clinical specimens. It is known that the absence of ER in breast tumor cells is associated with a poor prognosis and an aggressive phenotype. The ER-negative breast cancer cell models used in this study, such as MDA-MB231 and SKBR3 cells are aggressive and highly metastatic estrogen-independent breast cancer cells because of high invasive ability, despite a slow growth rate. The increase in MDA-MB231 cell proliferation, which was observed after introduction of the DDB2 gene, suggests that DDB2 protein is a candidate oncogene when it is overexpressed, whatever the breast cancer cell phenotype. Also, the down-regulation of the DDB2 gene observed in these cells may reflect tumor progression to a metastatic phenotype. It is not excluded that the decrease in DDB2 expression is associated with a decrease in the NER system and an accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage, leading to an invasive cancer phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002002-Hartman2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to causing impairment in the DNA repair function, the loss of DDB2 gene expression, leading to a slowed growth of aggressive breast cancer cells, may be proposed as an important step in mammary carcinogenesis in ER-negative cells. Also, DDB2 may represent an important clinical interest as a prognostic/predictive marker of breast cancer progression towards an aggressive phenotype. A larger clinical investigation is needed to support this hypothesis.</p><p>The present study provides for the first time strong evidence that DDB2 is a candidate for oncogene action in breast cancer. It may contribute to a better understanding of breast tumor progression and to provide a valuable tool in the clinical investigation of breast cancer. This conclusion is based on several lines of evidence that DDB2 is highly expressed in the human ER-positive breast tumor samples and in the cell lines we examined, compared to ER-negative status, and plays a significant role as an activator of growth, favouring G1/S transition entry of ER-positive breast cancer cells during their cell cycle. These findings support the assessment of DDB2 status as a prognostic factor for tumor progression and chemosensitivity in breast cancer and, possibly, other cancers. Elevated levels of DDB2, through its ability to activate cancer cell growth, may influence the effectiveness of anticancer drugs. Also, the molecular mechanism by which the factors and the signaling pathway influencing DDB2 expression in ER-positive breast cancer cells will need to be defined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Lines</title><p>Human ER-expressing (MCF-7 and T47D), ER-negative (MDA-MB231 and SKBR3) breast cancer cell lines and normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) from Clonetics (Cambrex) were cultured as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002002-Kattan1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Tumor material</title><p>Sixteen anonymous (eight estrogen receptor positive, eight negative), 20-30 mg breast tumor samples were from surgical pieces of infiltrating breast carcinomas from patients in intend to make diagnosis before an appropriate treatment.

After blocking with 0.1&#x00025; fish gelatin/0.8&#x00025; bovine serum albumin/0.002&#x00025; Tween-80, the cells were then exposed to the primary polyclonal antibodies anti-DDB1, anti-DDB2 and anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), diluted at 1&#x02236;100, for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C. After two washes in PBS, the cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated bovine anti-rabbit immunoglobulins, diluted at 1&#x02236;100 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), in PBS for 20 min at 37&#x000b0;C. A negative control was performed without the primary antibody. The cells were then mounted in anti-fading medium (Citifluor, Link Analytical). Images of cellular immunofluorescence were acquired using an epifluorescence microscope Eclipse 80i with 40X objective (488 nm excitation and 518 emission) and captured with a coupled digital camera (Nikon) (See Supplemental data).</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>DDB2 Expression Vector and Transfection</title><p>The full-length human DDB2 cDNA containing the entire open reading frame (1300 bp) was isolated from MCF-7 cells by RT-PCR using the Hi-fidelity Extensor PCR kit (AB Gene), and the forward (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GGACTGGGTACCACACGGAGGACGCGATGGCTC-3&#x02032;</named-content>) and the reverse primers (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-CTGAGCTCTAGATCACTTCCGTGTCCTGGCTTCC-3&#x02032;</named-content>), with <italic>Kpn I</italic> and <italic>Xba I</italic> ends, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting DDB2 cDNA was inserted between the <italic>KpnI</italic> and <italic>XbaI</italic> sites into a pcDNA3.1(&#x0002b;) mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen), driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. The complete sequence of the cDNA was verified by DNA sequence analysis. The DDB2 cDNA was also subcloned into a pEF1/Myc-HisB vector (Invitrogen) between the <italic>KpnI</italic> and <italic>XbaI</italic> sites, to produce a Myc-polyhistidine-tagged DDB2 protein (See Supplemental data). The expression vectors included a Neo resistance gene driven by the SV40 promoter for clone selection. The size of the recombinant protein was verified by using the wheat germ lysate transcription-translation TNT kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Four &#x000b5;g of pcDNA3(&#x0002b;) or pEF1/Myc-HisB plasmid containing either DDB2 cDNA or no insert were used for stable transfection of MDA-MB231 or COS-7 cells, with TransPEI reagent (Eurogentec), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The clones were selected with 800 &#x000b5;g/ml of G418 for 4 weeks. Single colonies were isolated and then screened for levels of the expression of DDB2 protein by Western blot analysis. Five days before these experiments, the cells were placed into complete medium without G418 supplement.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>DDB2-siRNA Vector and Transfection</title><p>SiRNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Eurogentec in a purified and annealed duplex form.

SiRNA transfection experiments were carried out using jetSi-ENDO transfection reagent with 100 nM siRNA, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Eurogentec). Twenty-four hours following siRNA transfection, the cells were used to analyze the expression of DDB2 protein (see Supplemental data). Double strand DNA oligonucleotide encoding the effective siRNA in the knockdown of DDB2 was synthesized with a loop sequence TTCAAGAGA and a RNA pol III terminator sequence consisting of a 6 poly T. This double strand DNA oligonucleotide was cloned into the RNAi-ready pSIREN vector (BD Biosciences Clontech) between the <italic>BamHI</italic> and <italic>EcoRI</italic> restriction sites with the U6 promoter. This vector contains a puromycin resistance gene for the selection of stable transfectants. A unique <italic>Xba I</italic> restriction site was placed downstream of the terminator sequence for restriction digest analysis to confirm the presence of the cloned insert. Four &#x000b5;g of pSIREN/U6/DDB2-siRNA vector or pSIREN/U6 empty vector were used for stable transfection of MCF-7 cells with TransPEI transfection reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Eurogentec). The MCF-7 clones were selected with 0.5 &#x000b5;g/ml of puromycin for 3 weeks. Single colonies were isolated and then screened for levels of the expression of DDB2 protein by RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Five days before the experiments, the cells were placed into complete medium without puromycin supplement.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Cell Growth</title><p>Cells (1&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup>) were plated in 24-well dishes. The cell growth rate was determined by counting the number of cells with a hemocytometer as a function of time.

After a 3-day culture, the cells were washed three times with PBS and then synchronized by serum starvation for 48h. The cells were then induced to re-enter the cell cycle by the addition of serum for 0, 3, 12 or 18h and were harvested by trypsinization. The pellet of cells was resuspended in 0.1&#x00025; sodium citrate, 0.1&#x00025; Triton X100 and 50 &#x000b5;g/ml propidium iodide (PI), and then stored for 24h at 4&#x000b0;C. After centrifugation at 300 g for 5 min, the cells were resuspended in PBS containing 50 &#x000b5;g/ml of RNAse, and the DNA content was determined by Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis using an Orthocyte flow cytometer (Ortho Diagnostic Systems). To aid in the determination of the ability of the serum-starved cells to re-enter the S phase of the cell cycle, 100 &#x000b5;M of 5 Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were added to the culture medium for 20 min at the end of each incubation with serum (0, 3, 12 or 18h). Cells suspensions were prepared as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002002-Mirjolet1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, using the FITC-coupled anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody provided by Dako and were then analyzed by FACS. The data were analyzed using Cell Quest sofware (BD Biosciences Clontech). The Labeling Index (LI) corresponded to the percentage of BrdU-positive cells. The G1/S subpopulation, corresponding to BrdU-positive cells containing G1 DNA and S fractions, was calculated from the LI and expressed as the percentage of 5 BrdU-positive cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4l"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Evaluation of statistical significance for data from RT-PCR, Western blots, cell growth and colony formation was assessed using analyses of variance (ANOVA) and the Fisher protected least significant difference test.
