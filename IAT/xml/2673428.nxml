In this study, we show that RAD18 is also recruited to ionizing radiation (IR)-induced sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) forming foci which are co-localized with 53BP1, NBS1, phosphorylated ATM, BRCA1 and &#x003b3;-H2AX. RAD18 associates with 53BP1 and is recruited to DSB sites in a 53BP1-dependent manner specifically during G1-phase, RAD18 monoubiquitinates KBD domain of 53BP1 at lysine 1268 <italic>in vitro</italic>. A monoubiquitination-resistant 53BP1 mutant harboring a substitution at lysine 1268 is not retained efficiently at the chromatin in the vicinity of DSBs. In <italic>Rad18</italic>-null cells, retention of 53BP1 foci, efficiency of DSB repair and post-irradiation viability are impaired compared with wild-type cells. Taken together, these results suggest that RAD18 promotes 53BP1-directed DSB repair by enhancing retention of 53BP1, possibly through an interaction between RAD18 and 53BP1 and the modification of 53BP1.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Genetic screening of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> mutants has shown that <italic>RAD18</italic>, a RING-type (E3) ubiquitin ligase, is involved in the post-replication repair pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Yeast <italic>RAD18</italic> mutants are hypersensitive to various DNA-damaging agents, including UV light, &#x003b3; rays and certain chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Mammalian RAD18 also plays a crucial role in post-replication repair. In human cells, only one homolog of <italic>RAD18</italic> has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). <italic>Rad18</italic>-knockout mouse embryonic stem cells and chicken DT40 cells are sensitive to various DNA-damaging agents and display enhanced genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Similar to its yeast homolog, human RAD18 forms a complex with RAD6 (an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme) and monoubiquitinates proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) at replication forks that are stalled by UV-induced (and other) DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>We previously demonstrated that RAD18 rapidly translocates to the nuclei of UV-irradiated mammalian cells, accumulating at sites of stalled replication as discrete observable foci. Fluorescence microscopy has shown that these foci colocalize with DNA polymerase &#x003b7; (Pol&#x003b7;) and PCNA. We found that human RAD18 also translocates to the nucleus in response to replication stress induced by dNTP depletion or the acquisition of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). When stalled replication forks cannot be resolved and collapse to generate DSBs, vertebrate RAD18 facilitates homologous recombination at the sites of breakage, reducing the cytotoxic effect of DSB-inducing agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>Recently, it was demonstrated that <italic>RAD18</italic>-null HCT116 cells are sensitive to both X-ray irradiation and camptothecin, due to the defective repair of single-strand DNA breaks that arise during S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). These observations indicate that mammalian RAD18 responds to a numerous forms of DNA damage in addition to that induced by UV irradiation. In X-irradiated cells, Pol&#x003b7; focus formation and PCNA monoubiquitination have not been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In contrast with Pol&#x003b7; and ubiquitinated PCNA, which are unresponsive to DSBs, RAD18 is rapidly dispersed throughout the nucleus following X-ray irradiation, and it exhibits dynamic behavior similar to that observed in UV-irradiated cells. These findings suggest that RAD18 is involved in the cellular response to DSBs via PCNA- and Pol&#x003b7;-independent mechanisms. However, the sensitivity of <italic>Rad18</italic>-null mouse embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts to IR is not significantly higher than that of wild-type (wt) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>); thus, the putative role of RAD18 in the response to DSBs is unclear.</p><p>Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the regulation and function of RAD18 in response to DSBs. In cells exposed to DSB-inducing agents, many proteins involved in the DNA damage-response pathway, including BRCA1, MRE11/NBS1/RAD50 and 53BP1, accumulate in nuclear foci. These foci have been designated IR-induced nuclear foci (IRIFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). &#x003b3;-H2AX, which is immediately phosphorylated at its C-terminus in response to DSBs, plays a crucial role in regulating IRIF formation. Many components of IRIFs colocalize with &#x003b3;-H2AX foci, and &#x003b3;-H2AX is required for the retention of NBS1 and 53BP1 at DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). IRIF formation is thought to be vital for cellular DNA repair and the activation of DNA-damage checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The function of RAD18 in IR-irradiated cells and the potential targets of its E3 ligase activity are unknown. Therefore, in the present study we sought to identify the role of RAD18 in the DSB response, and to determine the relationship between IRIFs and RAD18 foci. The results presented here identify 53BP1 as a novel substrate of RAD18-directed E3 ligase activity and demonstrate the key role of mammalian RAD18 in maintaining 53BP1 IRIFs. Importantly, we show that <italic>Rad18</italic>-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit defects in DSB repair. Taken together, these results suggest that RAD18 plays a critical role in the DSB damage-response pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Antibodies (Abs)</title><p>Abs specific for Ser139-phosphorylated histone H2A.X and Ser10-phosphorylated Histone H3 were purchased from Upstate.

In brief, after thymidine was added at a concentration of 1 mM, cells were cultured for 24 h, and then cultured for 8 h in normal medium. After a second addition of thymidine at 1 mM, cells were cultured for 14 h. These cells were then cultured again in normal medium, thereby releasing them from cell cycle arrest at G<sub>1</sub>/S. FACS analysis was used to verify the cell synchronization. HeLa cells enriched in G1, S and G2/M phase populations were X-irradiated with 5 Gy and incubated for 1 h prior to analysis by immunofluorescence microscopy. To enrich for quiescent (G0) populations, mouse fibroblasts were cultured in medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 6&#x02013;7 days. The resulting G0 cells were reseeded in culture medium with or without 10 &#x003bc;M NU7026 containing 10% FBS 1.5 h prior to X-irradiation. Sixteen hours following X-ray irradiation, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium and 5 days later, surviving colonies of cells were counted.

We therefore compared the subcellular distribution of RAD18 in cells after UV- and IR- treatments. In response to UV-irradiation, RAD18 formed numerous nuclear foci (&#x0003e;80 per cell) that colocalized with PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). In contrast, fewer foci (&#x0223c;50 per cell) were induced by X-ray irradiation. The X-ray-induced foci were larger than those induced by UV light and did not colocalize with PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). This observation is consistent with our finding that PCNA is not monoubiquitinated in response to X-ray irradiation. Moreover, colocalization with PCNA was observed only in S-phase cells harboring stalled DNA replication forks, suggesting that the X-ray-induced RAD18 foci differ from those induced by UV light. Distinctive RAD18 nuclear foci were formed in mammalian cells exposed to X-rays, even in the presence of cycloheximide, indicating that focus formation does not require <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis (data not shown). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>RAD18 foci colocalize with ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIFs).

After X-ray exposure, however, RAD18 formed nuclear foci that largely colocalized with &#x003b3;-H2AX foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, center panel). Exposure to bleomycin, another DSB-inducing agent, also caused RAD18 to form nuclear foci that colocalized with &#x003b3;-H2AX foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, lower panel). Taken together, these results indicate that RAD18 forms nuclear foci at DSBs.</p><p>In response to DSB formation, various proteins are recruited to the regions flanking the breaks to form IRIFs containing NBS1, phospho-ATM, BRCA1 and 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). To determine if RAD18 is recruited to IRIFs, we examined whether nuclear RAD18 foci colocalized with IRIF component proteins. In X-irradiated cells, RAD18 foci largely colocalized with IRIF component proteins including NBS1, pATM, BRCA1 and 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, RAD18 foci appeared within 15 min after X-ray exposure and reached a plateau at 30 min (&#x0223c;90% the cells contained RAD18 foci). Thirty minutes after irradiation, the number of cells containing RAD18 foci began to gradually decrease; after 24 h, the number of cells with nuclear RAD18 foci had returned to the background level (&#x0223c;10%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). The kinetics with which RAD18 was recruited to nuclear foci following irradiation was similar to those for 53BP1 and &#x003b3;-H2AX, known components of IRIF. These results indicate that RAD18 is a component of IRIFs.</p></sec><sec><title>X-ray-induced RAD18 focus formation is dependent on 53BP1 during G1 -phase</title><p>We next examined IR-induced RAD18 focus formation in various human cell lines defective for IRIF component proteins.

To examine the role of 53BP1 in RAD18 focus formation, 53BP1 was depleted from MCF7 cells using a 53BP1-specific siRNA. More than 90% of the 53BP1 was depleted within 24 h of siRNA treatment, and the level of depletion was sustained for at least 72 h. The level of RAD18 was unaffected by 53BP1 depletion (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp082/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>). In the non-depleted cells, 53BP1 and RAD18 were homogeneously distributed throughout the nucleus prior to irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Following IR-treatment, RAD18 and 53BP1 formed discrete nuclear foci, however, in the 53BP1-depleted cells, the numbers of cells containing IR-induced RAD18 foci was reduced by &#x0223c;35% relative to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). These results suggest that the formation of RAD18 nuclear foci at DSB sites is dependent on 53BP1. &#x003b3;-H2AX and 53BP1 IRIF formation was observed in the wt and Rad18-null cells, indicating that RAD18 is not required for &#x003b3;-H2AX or 53BP1 focus formation (data not shown). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>IR-induced RAD18 focus formation requires 53BP1.

Therefore, RAD18C207F retains ubiquitin ligase activity towards PCNA but not the 53BP1 KBD fragment. Most likely, the failure of RAD18C207F to ubiquitinate the KBD fragment is due to the inability of RAD18C207F and 53BP1 to interact. Therefore, we conclude that wt RAD18 functions as an E3 enzyme for the monoubiquitination of 53BP1 <italic>in vitro</italic>.

These results raise the possibility that the interaction of 53BP1 with RAD18 and its subsequent RAD18&#x02013;RAD6-mediated monoubiquitination promote the retention of 53BP1 at DSBs. To confirm that RAD18 stabilizes 53BP1 at chromatin regions near DSBs in living cells, we measured the dynamics of 53BP1 in bleomycin-induced foci using fluorescence-recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP) technique. Mouse wt or <italic>Rad18</italic>-null cells were transiently transfected with GFP-mouse53BP1 (m53BP1) and then cultured in the presence of bleomycin.

Thus, the immobile fraction of GFP-m53BP1 at the DSBs was reduced in the <italic>Rad18</italic>-null cells (&#x0003c;60%), compared to the <italic>Rad18</italic> wt cells (&#x0003e;70%). Furthermore, we calculated the rate of the recovery by measuring the inclination of the curve obtained by the FRAP assay. <italic>Rad18</italic>-null cells showed about 1.9-fold higher inclination of the recovery curve of the GFP-m53BP1 than that of wt cells, suggesting the increase of dynamics of 53BP1 in the <italic>Rad18</italic>-null cells. These results support the idea that the association between GFP-m53BP1 and the DSB region is more stable in wt cells than in <italic>Rad18</italic>-null cells. In an attempt to test whether RAD18 affects the chromatin retention of 53BP1, we monitored bleomycin-induced GFP-m53BP1 foci in <italic>Rad18</italic>-null and wt cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D). In wt cells, the number of nuclei with bleomycin-induced foci of GFP-tagged mouse 53BP1 harboring the K1253R mutation, corresponding to human 53BP1 K1268R mutation, was reduced by 50% relative to that of wt GFP-m53BP1 24 h after treatment with bleomycin. In contrast, <italic>Rad18</italic>-null mouse cells showed almost no difference in the number of nuclei with bleomycin-induced foci between wt and mutant GFP-m53BP1. These results suggest that RAD18-directed modification at Lysine 1268 of 53BP1 promotes the retention of 53BP1 at DSBs. To further investigate whether RAD18-directed modification of 53BP1 affects retention of 53BP1 at DSBs, we used FRAP to compare the dynamics of GFP-fused wt C-terminal half of human 53BP1 fragment (amino-acid residues 1052&#x02013;1972) with that mutated at K1268R. The mutated 53BP1 fragment at K1268R showed about 1.6-fold higher inclination of the recovery curve than that of wt 53BP1 fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E). Therefore, the mutated 53BP1 fragment at K1268R protein exhibited more dynamic behavior in bleomycin-induced foci when compared with the wt GFP-53BP1.

The elevated X-ray sensitivity of the G1-synchronized Rad18-deficient cells was not evident when the cultures were irradiated during S phase or late S/G2 (2 h and 4 h after the release from mimosine, respectively). These data suggest that the repair of IR-induced DNA damage is impaired during G1 in Rad18-deficient cells. In parallel, we examined the UV sensitivity of DT40 cells deficient for 53BP1 or Rad18 at various stages of the cell cycle. 53BP1-deficient cells showed a slight increase in UV sensitivity during early S phase compared to wt DT40 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, right panel). In sharp contrast to the increased X-ray sensitivity observed during G1, the Rad18-deficient cells exhibited elevated UV sensitivity in early S phase, suggesting that there is distinct cell-cycle dependency on Rad18 in the response to DNA damage elicited by IR or UV. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Divergent responses of 53BP1- and Rad18-deficient DT40 cells to X or UV irradiation.

Rad18- and 53BP1-deficient cells were more sensitive to X-rays than were wt cells, and the 53BP1-deficient cells were more sensitive than the Rad18-deficient cells. The X-ray sensitivity of cells deficient for both Rad18 and 53BP1 was similar to that of the 53BP1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, left panel). In contrast, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), cells deficient for both 53BP1 and Artemis were more sensitive than either of the single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, right panel). Thus, Rad18 and 53BP1 are epistatic for cell survival, which suggests that Rad18 and 53BP1 function in the same pathway for the repair of IR-induced DNA damage. To confirm that the elevated X-ray sensitivity of the G1-synchronized Rad18-deficient cells is attributable to lack of Rad18-mediated modification of 53BP1, we reconstituted Rad18-deficient cells with wt or Rad18C214F, a chicken mutant Rad18 that corresponds to human Rad18C207F. The protein expression level of wt Rad18 and Rad18C214F was comparable (data not shown). Stable expression of wt Rad18, but not Rad18C214F, corrected the X-ray sensitivity of Rad18-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C), suggesting that modification of 53BP1 by RAD18 is important for Rad18-mediated repair of IR-induced DNA damage.</p></sec><sec><title>RAD18 and 53BP1 are involved in DSB repair during G1</title><p>To more closely examine the role of RAD18 in the DSB response pathway, we assessed DSB repair efficiency using the number of &#x003b3;-H2AX foci as an index of the number of DSBs. The rate of loss of &#x003b3;-H2AX foci is a direct marker of DSB repair in low-dose X-irradiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The 53BP1-mediated DSB repair mechanism is distinct from the repair pathway mediated by DNA-PKcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). To assess whether Rad18 is also involved in the pathway responsible for rejoining of DSB, we examined kinetics of formation of &#x003b3;-H2AX foci formation in G1-synchronized mouse cells in the presence of the DNA-PKcs inhibitor NU7026. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp082/DC1">Supplementary Figure 5</ext-link>, both DNA-PKcs inhibition and G1-synchronization did not affect the kinetics of Rad18 IRIF.</p><p>Confluent wt, <italic>53BP1</italic>- and <italic>Rad18</italic>-null MEFs, were synchronized at G1 then exposed to X-rays, and the numbers of &#x003b3;-H2AX foci were quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp082/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2A</ext-link>). The numbers of &#x003b3;-H2AX foci were similar in 53BP1- and Rad18-null MEFs at 1 h post-IR, suggesting that almost similar numbers of DSBs were formed in these cells. Moreover, &#x003b3;-H2AX foci disappeared with similar kinetics in <italic>Rad18</italic>-null and <italic>53BP1</italic>-null MEFs. At 12 h or 24 h post-IR, <italic>Rad18</italic>-null or the <italic>53BP1</italic>-null MEFs contained approximately twice as many &#x003b3;-H2AX nuclear foci as wt MEFs. These results indicate that DSB repair is less efficient in <italic>Rad18</italic>-null MEFs than in wt MEFs when DNA-PKcs kinase activity is inhibited. We conclude that both Rad18 and 53BP1 contribute to DNA DSB repair during G1 independently of DNA-PK-mediated repair pathway. <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>RAD18 is involved in the DSB repair during G1 phase.

In response to UV irradiation, RAD18 forms nuclear foci, almost all of which colocalize with PCNA, suggesting that RAD18 is recruited to stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In the present study, cells exposed to X-rays formed distinct nuclear foci containing RAD18, which colocalized with &#x003b3;-H2AX foci but not with PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). These results suggest that in X-ray-irradiated cells, the recruitment of RAD18 to DSBs and its localization into foci occur in a replication-independent manner.</p><p>RAD18 is also involved in S-phase-specific single-strand break repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). It is recruited to single-strand break sites induced by UV-A laser irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Although X-ray irradiation causes various types of DNA breaks, the IR-induced RAD18 foci that we observed likely represent DSBs based on their colocalization with &#x003b3;-H2AX and other early markers of the response to DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and C). In our study, the formation of RAD18 IRIFs in G1 cells was dependent on 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B). Given that RAD18 IRIFs were observed in S- and G2/M-phase cells irrespective of the presence of 53BP1, the mechanism responsible for the recruitment of RAD18 to DSBs in G1 cells differ from that in S- or G2/M-phase cells. Consistent with the G1-specific, and RAD18/53BP1-dependent mechanism for DSB repair, the physical interaction between these two proteins could be detected efficiently at G1-phase but not at S or G2/M-phase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp082/DC1">Supplementary Figure 3</ext-link>). NHEJ is thought to work mainly during G1-phase and various proteins including 53BP1 are recruited to DSBs to perform DSBs repair. The G1-specific binding of RAD18 with 53BP1 and putative G1-specific chromatin structure might contribute to the G1-specific dependency on 53BP1 for RAD18 IRIF. The binding of full-length 53BP1 and RAD18 was observed only when cells were irradiated with IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A), whereas bacterially-expressed 53BP1 KBD domain specifically bound to purified RAD18 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B and C). We speculate that the apparent discrepancy between <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments arises because <italic>in vivo</italic> binding of full length of 53BP1 to RAD18 is usually strictly suppressed by other domains of 53BP1 or by 53BP1-binding proteins unless the suppression is released by IR-induced post-transcriptional modifications or changes in associations with binding partners.</p><p>To assess the role of RAD18 at different cell-cycle stages, we investigated the formation of nuclear foci by a Rad18 cysteine 207 (C207F) mutant. The C207F RAD18 mutant failed to form foci during G1-phase, S-phase or G2/M (data not shown). Because 53BP1 was dispensable for IRIF of RAD18 during S- or G2/M phase, molecules other than 53BP1 will likely interact with RAD18 following completion of G1. Previous studies have shown that the zinc finger is required for accumulation of hRAD18 at sites of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Additionally, DNA-damage-induced poly-ubiquitin chains are produced on histone H2A and H2AX on damaged chromosomes after irradiation of X-ray. These poly-ubiquitin chains assemble additional DSB regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). It was also reported that Rad18 binds poly-ubiquitin chains through its zinc finger domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Moreover, Surface plasmon resonance analysis (using GST-fusions of wt or GST-C207F zinc fingers derived from hRAD18) revealed that the zinc finger is indeed important for binding to ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that the zinc finger domain of RAD18 interacts with multiple target(s), possibly including the poly-ubiquitin chains on histone H2A and H2AX, during different stages of the cell cycle.</p><p>In the early response to IR, local changes in chromatin structure are required for the initial recruitment of 53BP1 to DSBs. The initial recruitment of 53BP1 to DSBs was proposed to involve the indirect sensing of DSBs by 53BP1 through its interaction with the methylated Lys 79 residue of histone H3 and Lys 20 of histone H4 in the higher-order chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). After 53BP1 is recruited, its retention at the chromatin surrounding the break requires MDC1. Histone H2AX phosphorylation mediated by ATM and MDC1, which is also required for the retention of 53BP1, is thought to be extended from the site of breakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Therefore, the initial recruitment of 53BP1 to DSBs and the subsequent accumulation of 53BP1 at these sites are mechanically dissimilar processes. This study demonstrates that RAD18 monoubiquitinates fragments of 53BP1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and that RAD18&#x02013;RAD6 complex plays a role in retaining 53BP1 near DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B). The extent of 53BP1 retention correlates well with its monoubiquitylation in cells expressing wt, C207F or DR6 mutant RAD18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). Moreover, the introduction of K1268R mutation into human 53BP1 dramatically decreased the efficiency of monoubiquitylation of 53BP1 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>C). Additionally, the introduction of K1253R mutation into mouse 53BP1 decreased the efficiency of its foci formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>D). These results suggest very strongly that 53BP1 monoubiquitylation and nuclear retention at DSBs are closely related.</p><p>A fragment of 53BP1 was efficiently monoubiquitinated by RAD18&#x02013;RAD6 complex <italic>in vitro</italic>, however, monoubiquitination of endogenous 53BP1 could not be detected <italic>in vivo</italic>. After IR-irradiation, most of 53BP1 appear to be poly-ubiquitinated and degradated by the ubiquitin&#x02013;proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Moreover, this ubiquitin&#x02013;proteasome system is required for IR-induced 53BP1 foci formation at DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>).</p><p>So the whole mechanism of 53BP1 foci formation remains to be elusive. We speculate that both mono- and poly-ubiquitinaiton of 53BP1 function cooperatively in the initial recuruitment and retention of 53BP1 IRIF at DSBs. Thus, we could not identify the monoubiquitination form of 53BP1 <italic>in vivo</italic>, distinguishing from poly-ubiquitinated form of 53BP1. Actually the poly-ubiquitination and degradation of 53BP1 were observed in Rad18-null cells as well as in wt cells (data not shown). Salt-resistant 53BP1 nuclear foci persisted for longer periods post-irradiation in wt cells than in <italic>Rad18</italic>-null cells. Consistent with this finding, our FRAP results showed that the association of 53BP1 with chromatin at DSBs was less stable in <italic>Rad18</italic>-null cells than in control cells. Moreover, the number of cells with IR-induced foci of GFP-53BP1 harboring K1268R (or K1253R in mouse 53BP1) mutation in wt cells decreased to the level in <italic>Rad18</italic>-null cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D and E). Since IR-induced 53BP1 focus formation was observed even in <italic>Rad18</italic>-null cells, we infer that the initial recruitment of 53BP1 to chromatin is RAD18- independent whereas RAD18&#x02013;RAD6-dependent modification of 53BP1 is important for the retention of 53BP1 at DSBs. However, we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that RAD18 ubiquitinates unidentified substrate(s), which indirectly influence the dynamics of 53BP1 at DSBs.</p><p>We attribute the decreased retention of the 53BP1 foci in <italic>Rad18</italic>-null mouse cells to the loss of an interaction between 53BP1 and RAD18 and to decreased modification of 53BP1. Even in wt mouse cells, the 53BP1 IRIFs gradually disappeared. The dissociation of 53BP1 from the foci has two possible causes. First, since &#x003b3;-H2AX is required for the retention of 53BP1 at DSBs, &#x003b3;-H2AX dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) may result in the dissociation of 53BP1 from DSBs. Second, since RAD18 foci appeared after IR exposure and disappeared with a time course almost identical to that of the 53BP1 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D), the dissociation of RAD18 from 53BP1 may decrease the retention of both proteins at DSBs. The dissociation of RAD18 from 53BP1 may increase the accessibility of an unidentified protein to 53BP1, resulting in the dislocation of 53BP1 from DSBs. The modification of 53BP1 at lysine 1268 may promote interactions with the chromatin surrounding DSBs. Alternatively, since 53BP1 is a mediator of DSB signaling, the modification of 53BP1 at DSB sites may recruit putative adaptor protein(s) containing ubiquitin-binding domains to the DSBs. Appropriate localization of DNA repair proteins is crucial for their function. 53BP1 plays a role in a subset of DSB repair events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). In this study, we demonstrated that 53BP1 IRIFs are stabilized at DSBs through the interaction of RAD18 with 53BP1 and through modification of 53BP1. In addition, putative modifications of RAD18, including monoubiqitination, phosphorylation or dephosphorylation may facilitate the interaction between RAD18 and 53BP1 in response to IR. We also found that a <italic>Rad18</italic>-null mutation caused inefficient DSB repair in MEFs even after 24 h of X-ray irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). In addition, the <italic>Rad18</italic>-null cells were significantly more sensitive to X-rays than the wt cells under the DNA-PKcs-inactive condition. Therefore, we conclude that RAD18 is involved in a subset of DSB repair pathways by promoting stable retention of 53BP1 foci at DSBs. Since the defective DSB repair of <italic>RAD18</italic>-null cells was most evident in G1-synchronized cells (especially in the presence of a DNA-PKcs inhibitor) we speculate that RAD18 plays a role in DSB repair via the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. This idea is supported by the fact that the recombinant KBD protein stimulates double-stranded DNA end-joining activity of DNA ligase IV/Xrcc4 complex <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), that 53BP1 mutants unable to accumulate at IRIFs cannot correct the DSB repair defect of 53BP1-null cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), and that 53BP1 is functionally involved in XRCC4-dependent NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Additionally, the most recent reports show that 53BP1 promotes NHEJ at telomere-breakage sites through tethering and/or increasing mobility of the DNA ends, and 53BP1 also promotes NHEJ for V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Taken together, we assume that the 53BP1-directed NHEJ pathway is promoted by RAD18-directed modification of 53BP1 and/or interaction between RAD18 and 53BP1.</p><p>We performed additional assays to detect differences in levels of DSBs in Rad18-wt and -null cells by using pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). PFGE did not reveal differences between Rad18-wt and -null cells. It should be noted however that PFGE, Comet and related assays are inherently insensitive techniques which only detect large global changes in the integrity of genomic DNA. For example, 53BP1 is a bona-fide mediator of DSB signaling, yet other workers have shown that there is no difference between the PFGE pattern of genomic DNA derived from 53BP1-wt and -null following X-ray irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Therefore, it is most likely that differences in levels of DSBs between Rad18-wt and -null cells are below the sensitivity levels of conventional assays. Alternatively, it is possible that RAD18 and 53BP1-mediated mechanisms represent partially redundant or minor back-up pathways of DSB repair.</p><p>In summary, we identified 53BP1 as a substrate for RAD18 E3 monoubiquitination activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, and we demonstrated that modification of 53BP1 at lysine 1268 has a functional role in promoting the retention of 53BP1 at DSB sites and that RAD18 is involved in DSB repair. These results increase our understanding of the role of RAD18 in the cellular response to DSBs.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp082/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (18710047, 180139 and 18058017) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.
