Although its expression has been correlated to HER&#x0002b; high-grade tumors and to a high risk of progression, the molecular mechanisms of these S100A7-mediated tumorigenic effects are not well known. Here, we showed for the first time that epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces S100A7 expression in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines. We also observed a decrease in EGF-directed migration in shRNA-downregulated MDA-MB-468 cell lines. Furthermore, our signaling studies revealed that EGF induced simultaneous EGF receptor phosphorylation at Tyr1173 and HER2 phosphorylation at Tyr1248 in S100A7-downregulated cell lines as compared to the vector-transfected controls. In addition, reduced phosphorylation of Src at tyrosine 416 and p-SHP2 at tyrosine 542 was observed in these downregulated cell lines. Further studies revealed that S100A7-downregulated cells had reduced angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> based on matrigel plug assays. Our results also showed decreased tumor-induced osteoclastic resorption in an intra-tibial bone injection model involving SCID mice.

We have seen increased expression of S100A7 in two breast cancer cell lines following EGF stimulation. We observed a significant inhibition of EGF-induced migration on fibronectin-coated plates in S100A7-downregulated cell lines. There was also decreased EGF-directed invasion on matrigel-coated transwells. The results are in agreement with previous studies which reported a 1.4-fold increase in invasiveness in S100A7-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 clones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001741-Emberley3">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

We have observed that S100A7 regulates EGF-induced signaling. We noted a decrease in EGFR/HER2 phosphorylation at Tyr1068, Tyr1173, and Tyr1248 (HER2) sites in S100A7-downregulated MDA-MB-468 cells as compared to empty vector-transfected control cells upon EGF stimulation. Tyr1173 corresponds to the main site of EGFR autophosphorylation and has been shown to be critical for the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR as well as its ability to mediate actions in response to EGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001741-Bertics1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

Tyr542 is the major Grb2 binding site in tyrosyl-phosphorylated SHP2.

It has also been shown that SHP2 is necessary for ErbB2 to activate c-Src. Elevated Src expression is frequently observed in human breast cancer tissues compared with benign breast tumors or adjacent normal breast tissues and this elevated Src activity has been correlated with high grade, high proliferation and HER2 positivity in DCIS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001741-Wilson1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> as well as with poor metastasis-free survival in invasive breast cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001741-OttenhoffKalff1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001741-Hennipman1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

We have seen decreased phosphorylation of c-Src at Tyr416 in S100A7-downregulated cell lines as compared to vector-transfected controls. Tyr416 of Src is located in the kinase domain and phosphorylation of Src at this site enhances its catalytic activity. Thus, these data support a role for S100A7 as a modulator of the growth effects of EGF, which may have clinical implications in a subset of breast carcinomas where EGFR is overexpressed.</p><p>Suppression of EGFR signaling by EGFR inhibitors is known to reduce the incidence of prostate cancer metastasis to the bone in nude mice models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001741-Angelucci1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. The bone is a common site of metastases from breast, prostate, renal and thyroid cancers. Tumor growth in the bone depends on osteoclastic activity, which increases bone resorption and releases growth factors sequestrated in the bone matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001741-Pederson1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

Tumor cells induce these lesions directly by secreting factors that increase mature osteoclasts in the bone or indirectly through stromal cells, which secrete growth factors and cytokines causing the differentiation of precursors to active osteoclasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001741-Yoneda1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001741-Kakonen1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Since the MDA-MB-468 cell line is not highly metastatic, it did not produce bone metastasis or gross visible lung metastasis on intravenous injections in our study. Therefore, we injected vector control cells and S100A7-downregulated cells into the tibia of mice to determine if S100A7 is involved in the osteoclast resorption of bone. We observed significant lytic lesions in the tibia with destruction of the cortex on CT imaging in control mice and few lytic lesions in mice injected with the S100A7-downregulated cells. The marrow and trabecular bones were destroyed in the proximal tibia of the control mice as compared to the tibia from mice with S100A7-downregulation, where the marrow cavity and trabecular bones remained intact. This suggests that S100A7 may play an important role in the formation of osteolytic lesions and hence in the metastasis of breast cancer cells to bone.</p><p>The development and progression of osteolytic lesions in the bone is a complex phenomenon involving tumor cell interaction with different cell types of the bone microenvironment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001741-Roodman1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

We have found that epidermal growth factor regulates S100A7 expression. S100A7 mediates events that regulate EGF-induced migration. Loss of S100A7 expression alters the phosphorylation state of receptors and inhibits growth factor-induced cell motility and invasion on fibronectin-coated plates and matrigel-coated chambers. In addition, downregulation of S100A7 decreases angiogenesis in matrigel assays.

Growth factor-reduced matrigel was obtained from BD Biosciences (Bedford, MA), and thawed overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The required amount was appropriately calculated and the remaining aliquots were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. The gel was mixed at a ratio of 5&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells for 500 &#x000b5;l of matrigel. The mixture was implanted subcutaneously into two sites at the midline and the needle was retained for 1&#x02013;2 minutes to allow the plug to solidify. The needle was subsequently removed by slow rotation to ensure that the matrigel did not flow out. After 3 weeks, the mice were anesthetized using Avertin (2.5&#x00025;), 0.02 mg/kg of bodyweight and the matrigel plug was removed. Mice were euthanized with CO<sub>2</sub>, and then 0.5 ml to 2 ml of blood was collected from the heart and placed into heparin-coated tubes for estimation of systemic hemoglobin. One plug was removed, dipped in embedding medium (Tissue Tek) and snap-frozen on dry ice. Immunohistochemistry for CD31 was done on the embedded specimens at the microscopy histology core facility at our Institute. The other plug was weighed and dissolved in physiological saline (0.9&#x00025; NaCl). The tissue was grounded using a Wheaton tissue grinder and the supernatant was analyzed for hemoglobin content using a Hemoglobin Assay Kit (containing Drabkin's reagent) from Sigma Diagnostics. The results were interpreted as blood volume per unit weight of matrigel.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Cytokine analysis</title><p>The conditioned medium was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm/min at 4&#x000b0;C to allow the cells and debris to settle down.
