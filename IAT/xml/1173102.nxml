One important mechanism that ensures a high fidelity of DNA replication is a "cleansing" of the DNA precursor pool from deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates containing a modified base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Such modified bases may have ambiguous base-pairing properties that will result in a high mutagenic activity after their incorporation into DNA during replication. A classic example of the detoxification mechanism is the elimination of dUTP and 8-oxo-dGTP from the dNTP pool by the <italic>E. coli </italic>dUTPase and MutT proteins, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Purine analogs 6-hydroxyaminopurine (HAP) and 2-amino-HAP (AHA) are powerful mutagens in bacteria, yeast, and higher eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It has been suggested that HAP-deoxyriboside-triphosphate (dHAPTP) is a possible endogenous contaminant of nucleotide pools under peroxyl radical stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. HAP and AHA closely resemble the natural purines, hypoxanthine and xanthine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), and therefore, could be exploited to investigate the mechanism preventing mutations that are caused by non-canonical purine nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Chemical structures of HAP and AHA and natural purine bases.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2156-6-31-1"/></fig><p>It was proposed that purine salvage enzymes convert base analogs to the corresponding deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, which are misincorporated or misreplicated during DNA synthesis, resulting in induction of mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. HAP-induced mutagenesis in yeast is elevated in strains with defects in proofreading activity of replicative DNA polymerases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and does not depend on excision, mutagenic recombination, and mismatch repair systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We have described several systems protecting cells from the mutagenic and inhibitory effects of HAP (see review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]). One is the novel molybdenum cofactor-dependent system in <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It has yet to be determined if a similar system exists in higher eukaryotes. Another, versatile HAP-detoxification pathway relies upon the action of triphosphatase, Ham1p, which hydrolyze HAP-containing ribo- and deoxyribo-nucleotides to nucleoside monophosphates, and which prevent incorporation of base analog into DNA and RNA. We initially described the elevated sensitivity to HAP in yeast due to mutations in the <italic>HAM1 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. When we cloned and sequenced the <italic>HAM1 </italic>gene, we found that it has homologs in many organisms, from bacteria to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and proposed that the gene might code for new triphosphatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Then, the crystal structure of the Ham1p homologue from a thermostable bacterium (protein Mj0226) was determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It was found that the Ham1p ternary structure has common features with MutT. Homologs of the yeast Ham1p from other organisms possessed triphosphatase activity on dITP, ITP, XTP, and dHAPTP substrates (Kozmin and Pavlov, unpublished; Burgis and Cunnigham, personal communication; and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]).</p><p>There are additional, less thoroughly studied, factors modulating purine base analogues mutagenesis in yeast (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] for review). For example, <italic>aah1 </italic>mutants are sensitive to HAP, suggesting that adenine deaminase Aah1p may deaminate HAP base to hypoxanthine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we carried out a genome-wide search for HAP and AHA sensitive mutants. The release of several complete sets of deletion mutants by the Yeast Deletion Project provides a powerful approach for different types of genome screens in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Haploid and diploid strains have already been used to detect new genes controlling sensitivity to different agents such as UV, ionising radiation, iron, and methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], as well as spontaneous mutability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This approach, when combined with other genomics approaches, helps to establish the biological functions of uncharacterized ORFs in yeast, many of which have human orthologs. This approach also allows us to decipher the network responses to endogenous and environmental stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The present study is the first systematic, genome-wide search for the mutations conferring sensitivity to mutagenic purine base analogs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Development of the screening method</title><p>To develop a useful method for searching the yeast mutants sensitive to base analogs, we calibrated the experimental conditions using the wild-type strain, BY4742, and two previously described HAP-sensitive mutants, <italic>ham1 </italic>and <italic>aah1 </italic>(see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]), created on BY4742 background. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and described in Materials and Methods, yeast were grown in a 96-well microtiter plate and then transferred, using a multiprong replicator device, to YPD plates containing base analogs. An induction of the Can<sup>r </sup>mutants was monitored by replica-plating to the minimal-medium plates containing L-canavanine.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Scheme of the protocol for screening the yeast deletions library for base analog sensitivity and induced mutagenesis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2156-6-31-2"/></fig><p>The results are presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. The left panel of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> shows the induction of canavanine-resistant mutants by HAP and AHA; and the right panel represents the survival of the tested strains on YPD plates in the presence of base analogs. In the wild-type strain, as in the <italic>ham1 </italic>and <italic>aah1 </italic>mutants, 1&#x02013;3 spontaneous canavanine-resistant colonies per spot arise in the absence of mutagen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, left panel). In our experimental conditions, 1 &#x003bc;g/ml of HAP did not induce Can<sup>r </sup>mutants in the wild-type strain. A moderate induction of Can<sup>r </sup>clones (fewer than ten per spot) was observed at 10 &#x003bc;g/ml of HAP and a very strong HAP-induced mutagenesis was observed in the wild-type strain at 100 &#x003bc;g/ml of HAP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, left panel). For comparison, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml of AHA were only moderately mutagenic (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>, left panel). Furthermore, both HAP and AHA did not affect the viability of the wild-type strain, even at the maximal concentration of 100 &#x003bc;g/ml (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>, right panel).</p><p>In the <italic>ham1 </italic>strain, 1 &#x003bc;g/ml of HAP induced Can<sup>r </sup>mutants with the similar frequency that was observed in the wild-type strain at 2 orders in magnitude higher concentration of analog, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, left panel, phenotype of hypermutability, HM). The hypersensitivity of the <italic>ham1 </italic>mutant to the toxic action of HAP was clearly detectable at 100 &#x003bc;g/ml of HAP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, right panel). We will refer later to this phenotype as hypersensitivity, HS. Note that a reduction of the number of canavanine-resistant clones at 10 and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml of HAP, in comparison with 1 &#x003bc;g/ml of HAP observed in the <italic>ham1 </italic>mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, left panel, another manifestation of hypersensitivity phenotype, HS), is also due to a dramatic decrease of survival. When the <italic>aah1 </italic>mutant was tested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, second row, for HAP and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>, first row, for AHA), the drop of viability was less severe than that for the <italic>ham1 </italic>mutant (phenotype of elevated sensitivity, S). HAP-induced mutagenesis was detectable at a low dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/ml, but was much less compared to the <italic>ham1 </italic>mutant (phenotype of elevated mutability, M). Mutagenesis was somewhat stronger at the dose 10 &#x003bc;g/ml and was not seen at 100 &#x003bc;g/ml (another manifestation of elevated sensitivity, S). For the <italic>aah1 </italic>mutant, AHA-induced mutagenesis was moderate at the dose of 10 &#x003bc;g/ml and very strong at a concentration of 100 &#x003bc;g/ml. The <italic>aah1 </italic>mutant exemplified what we expect to observe for mutants moderately sensitive to both HAP and AHA. These data suggested that the procedure we devised for micro-titre plate format is effective for the detection of mutants with altered parameters of HAP and AHA sensitivity and mutability.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Results of the screening of the yeast deletion library for elevated mutagenesis and sensitivity in micro-titer plates</bold>.

After an initial screening of 4,823 deletion strains, 43 mutants strains appeared to affect base analog-induced killing or mutagenesis. However, in subsequent testing of candidate strains in same type of plate tests, we have confirmed HAP-sensitivity of 16 mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, column 4, where we refer to phenotypes of mutants according to abbreviations described in previous section). Next, we examined the mutability and survival of these 16 mutants in quantitative tests with HAP (see Materials and Methods). Based on the results of these two types of tests, we categorize HAP-sensitive strains in three groups, as shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Group I comprises, in addition to <italic>ham1 </italic>and <italic>aah1 </italic>strains, mutants <italic>ade12 </italic>and <italic>ade2</italic>. These strains were hypersensitive to the mutagenic and lethal action of HAP in both types of tests (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, columns 4&#x02013;6). Strains of this group were sensitive to the low doses (1 and/or 10 &#x003bc;g/ml) of HAP, in contrast to the wild-type strain. The <italic>ade12 </italic>mutant was almost as mutable as the <italic>ham1 </italic>strain, but the hypermutability could only be demonstrated in a quantitative test, due to poor plating efficiency (compare Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, row 3 and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, column 5, row 3). The <italic>ade2 </italic>mutant was as mutable as the <italic>aah1 </italic>mutant (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Deletion mutants of the first group showed variable degree of sensitivity to HAP-induced killing Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, column 6).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>HAP-sensitivity of the mutants selected in our screening.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center">Class of mutants</td><td align="center">Gene or ORF name deleted</td><td align="center">Functional group</td><td align="center">Response HAP in spot tests<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center">Induced mutant frequency (&#x000d7;10<sup>-7</sup>) by HAP<sup>#</sup></td><td align="center">Survival in presence of HAP<sup>#</sup></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Wild type</td><td></td><td></td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">400</td><td align="center">100%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="center">Class I: mutants hypersensitive to HAP</td><td align="center"><italic>HAM1</italic></td><td align="center">DNA<sup>1</sup></td><td align="center">HM, HS</td><td align="center">13000</td><td align="center">17%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center"><italic>ADE12*</italic></td><td align="center">DNA</td><td align="center">HM, HS</td><td align="center">10000</td><td align="center">30%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center"><italic>AAH1*</italic></td><td align="center">DNA</td><td align="center">M, S</td><td align="center">5500</td><td align="center">30%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center"><italic>ADE2</italic></td><td align="center">DNA</td><td align="center">M, S</td><td align="center">4400</td><td align="center">70%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="center">II class: Mutants sensitive to mutagenic effect of HAP</td><td align="center"><italic>VIP1</italic></td><td align="center">Cell<sup>2</sup></td><td align="center">M, S</td><td align="center">840</td><td align="center">76%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center"><italic>VID27</italic></td><td align="center">Metabolic<sup>3</sup></td><td align="center">M, S</td><td align="center">600<sup>&#x000b0;</sup></td><td align="center">82%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center"><italic>IPK1</italic></td><td align="center">Metabolic</td><td align="center">M, S</td><td align="center">1400</td><td align="center">100%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center"><italic>ADE5,7</italic></td><td align="center">DNA</td><td align="center">M</td><td align="center">1900</td><td align="center">100%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center"><italic>ADE8</italic></td><td align="center">DNA</td><td align="center">M</td><td align="center">1500</td><td align="center">100%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center"><italic>ADE6</italic></td><td align="center">DNA</td><td align="center">M</td><td align="center">1100</td><td align="center">100%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center"><italic>RIM101</italic></td><td align="center">meiosis</td><td align="center">M</td><td align="center">1100</td><td align="center">100%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center"><italic>ADE3</italic></td><td align="center">DNA</td><td align="center">M</td><td align="center">940</td><td align="center">100%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center"><italic>ADE1</italic></td><td align="center">DNA</td><td align="center">M</td><td align="center">860</td><td align="center">100%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center"><italic>YGR035c</italic></td><td align="center">unknown</td><td align="center">M</td><td align="center">500<sup>&#x000b0;</sup></td><td align="center">100%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center"><italic>Yjl055w*</italic></td><td align="center">Metabolic</td><td align="center">M</td><td align="center">500<sup>&#x000b0;</sup></td><td align="center">100%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="center">Class III: Mutants sensitive to killing</td><td align="center"><italic>YMl013c-a</italic></td><td align="center">Unknown</td><td align="center">S</td><td align="center">230<sup>&#x000b0;</sup></td><td align="center">60%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center"><italic>SHE4</italic></td><td align="center">Cell</td><td align="center">S</td><td align="center">600<sup>&#x000b0;</sup></td><td align="center">30%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center"><italic>TRP2</italic></td><td align="center">Metabolic</td><td align="center">HS</td><td align="center">250<sup>&#x000b0;</sup></td><td align="center">60%</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>&#x02020;- </sup>HM &#x02013;

Mutants of this class were sensitive to the mutagenic effect of HAP, but their growth was not severely inhibited on HAP-containing medium. As a result, there is a smaller difference, in comparison to mutants of the group I, or no difference in the number of Can<sup>r </sup>mutants induced by 10 and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml of HAP in spot-tests (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, column 4). These strains produced some HAP-induced Can<sup>r </sup>mutants at 10 &#x003bc;g/ml of HAP, whereas the parental strain was non-mutable at this HAP concentration. We also did not detect any substantial drops of viability after growth in liquid media containing 25 &#x003bc;g/ml of HAP (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, column 6). Group II was not homogeneous in respect to HAP mutability and sensitivity. The six most sensitive mutants in the group are <italic>vip1, vid27, ade1, ade5,7, ade6, ade8, ipk1 </italic>and <italic>rim101 </italic>(see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). These mutants showed a decrease in the number of Can<sup>r </sup>mutants in a qualitative test when concentration of HAP increased ten-fold (up to 100 &#x003bc;g/ml), which is an indication of some cell death at very high doses of HAP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Mutants <italic>yjl055w</italic>, <italic>ygr035c</italic>, and <italic>ade3 </italic>were more resistant to HAP, since the number of Can<sup>r </sup>colonies was similar at 10 and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml of HAP. As could be seen from the results of quantitative assay, mutant classification is quite conditional and there is substantial variation in responses between mutants of the Group II, but all of them were more mutable that the wild-type strain.</p><p>Finally, Group III includes mutants <italic>she4, trp2</italic>, and <italic>yml013c-a; </italic>which were sensitive to HAP-induced killing, but not to HAP-induced mutagenesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, column 6). In quantitative tests the <italic>yml013c-a </italic>and <italic>trp2 </italic>mutants were even less sensitive to the mutagenic action of HAP than the wild-type strain (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The <italic>she2 </italic>mutant was slightly more mutable that the wild-type strain only in quantitative test. The existence of such a type of mutants suggests that the toxic effect of HAP in yeast may be not only due to the induction of lethal mutations, but also due to inhibition of certain metabolic pathways.</p><p>In the present study, we have also characterized three AHA-sensitive mutants, <italic>aah1</italic>, <italic>ade12</italic>, and <italic>yjl055w </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). Remarkably, all of these mutants were also sensitive to HAP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Two of those mutants, <italic>aah1 </italic>and <italic>yjl055w</italic>, were AHA-hypermutable; whereas a<italic>de12 </italic>strain did not mutate in the presence of AHA, but was sensitive to AHA-induced killing. In a quantitative test, 50 &#x003bc;g/ml of AHA did not inhibit survival of the wild-type strain, <italic>aah1 </italic>and <italic>yjl055w </italic>strains; whereas survival of the <italic>ade12 </italic>mutant was reduced to 50%. In the <italic>aah1 </italic>and <italic>yjl055w </italic>strains, 50 &#x003bc;g/ml of AHA induced canavanine-resistant mutants with the frequencies 120 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-7 </sup>and 270 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-7</sup>, respectively, that was 4&#x02013;9-folds higher than observed in the wild-type and <italic>ade12 </italic>strains (30 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-7</sup>, in both strains).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we elaborated the technology for testing base analog-induced mutability and killing of thousands of yeast strains in microtiter format (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). We found that the method is quite sensitive and reliable. Next, we screened the library of haploid yeast strains carrying deletions in all nonessential ORFs for the sensitivity to mutagenic base analogs HAP and AHA. We have found 16 novel HAP-sensitive mutants that fall into several groups, based on the sensitivity profiles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). One group comprises the mutants that are HAP-hypermutable and grow poorly in the presence of HAP. Another class comprises strains with elevated HAP-mutability that grow normally on medium containing HAP. Finally, the third group includes the mutants sensitive to HAP-induced killing, but not to HAP-induced mutagenesis. We have also isolated three AHA-sensitive mutants. All of them were HAP sensitive as well. We summarized the properties of the genes found in our screening in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>.</p><p>One interesting result from our study is that none of the genes involved in the control of base analogs sensitivity except two genes, <italic>YML013c-</italic>a and <italic>ade12</italic>, were found in screenings for genes controlling sensitivity to the other types of mutagens, MMS, UV, and ionizing radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] or for elevated spontaneous mutagenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It was previously reported that deletion of the <italic>YML013c-a </italic>and <italic>ADE12 </italic>open reading frame specifically enhanced sensitivity to killing (as in case of HAP) induced by &#x003b3;-radiation and bleomycin, but did not affect sensitivity to MMS, UV, and hydroxyurea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. It is known that there are overlaps of the sets of genes detected in genome screenings for the MMS-, UV- or ionizing radiation-sensitive strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Usually, those spectra include genes controlling DNA replication, recombination, and DNA repair. In our study, we did not find any of those genes. This is consistent with our earlier observation that the mutagenic action of HAP in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>does not depend on nucleotide excision repair, mutagenic repair, and mismatch repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. A system to repair non-canonical purines and, probably HAP and AHA, in DNA has been recently characterized in <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It is possible that yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>lacks such a repair system.</p><p>Based on our data, we propose that, in yeast, the major base analogs protective mechanism is a control of the quality of DNA precursor pool that prevents incorporation of base analogs into DNA. This mechanism may work at several levels: transport of analogs into cells, detoxification of analogs by metabolic enzymes, maintenance of nucleotide pools, and fidelity control of DNA replication (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). HAP and AHA are likely transported into the yeast cell by the same permeases, which are involved in transport of natural purines. One candidate is purine-cytosine permease, Fcy2p, a major purine (adenine, guanine, and hypoxanthine) and cytosine transporter in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. According to our unpublished data, <italic>fcy2 </italic>mutants are resistant to HAP. Thus, the active transport of HAP is the first critical step in the HAP mutagenic pathway. The next step is a conversion of the base analog to the corresponding ribonucleoside monophosphate by enzymes of the purine salvage pathway. Previously we observed that the inactivation of the <italic>APT1 </italic>gene, encoding adenine phosphoribosyl transferase, led to a severe decrease of the mutagenic effect of HAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], suggesting that this enzyme plays a key role in the biosynthesis of HAP-riboside-5'-monophosphate (HAPMP). HAPMP then may be converted to the corresponding nucleoside triphosphate, which could be ambiguously incorporated into DNA by DNA polymerases and provoke replication errors in the subsequent replication cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The mechanism preventing HAP- and AHA-induced toxicity most likely involves the conversion of base analogs to non-mutagenic metabolites by purine salvage enzymes. The main argument for this hypothesis is that HAP could be utilized by yeast cells as a sole purine source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The first enzyme in this HAP and AHA detoxification pathway is adenine aminohydrolase, encoded by the <italic>AAH1 </italic>gene. Aah1p from several microorganisms has been biochemically characterized (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]). Is has a broad substrate specificity and is capable of converting both adenine and its six-substituted analogs into hypoxanthine <italic>in vitro</italic>. According to our data, yeast Aah1p may convert HAP to hypoxanthine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and AHA to guanine <italic>in vivo</italic>, since the inactivation of the <italic>AAH1 </italic>leads to a defect in this conversion that is readily detected by UV spectroscopy of yeast medium (unpublished observation). In the <italic>aah1 </italic>mutant, the base analog intracellular concentration increases. We propose that this causes the elevation of base analog-induced mutagenesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, in our screening we did not detect the <italic>amd1 </italic>mutant, deficient in AMP aminohydrolase, that catalyze deamination of AMP to IMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We disrupted this gene by the <italic>kanMX </italic>cassette in several yeast strains and did not see any effect on HAP-induced mutagenesis anywhere. Thus, deamination of HAP at the mononucleotide level does not play an important role in HAP detoxification. This can be due to several reasons: the inability of the Amd1p to hydrolyse HAPMP, the minor role of the <italic>AMD1 </italic>gene in yeast, or the short life-time of the HAPMP in yeast cells.</p><p>We have found that inactivation of adenilosuccinate synthase (ASS or Ade12p) encoded by the <italic>ADE12 </italic>gene strongly enhanced HAP-induced mutagenesis and AHA-induced killing (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>, and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The primary function of this enzyme is the conversion of IMP to SAMP in the pathway of AMP biosynthesis <italic>de novo </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). We propose that the reason for this hypersensitivity is the dysregulation of purine biosynthesis, as follows. First, the blocking of this step of purine biosynthesis causes accumulation of IMP in the cell. The excess of IMP is probably toxic for the cell, since <italic>ade12 </italic>mutants have a slow-growth phenotype that can be rescued by blocks of the earlier steps of the <italic>de novo </italic>purine biosynthesis pathway (Dr. A. M. Zekhnov {St-Petersburg State University}, personal communication). Accumulated IMP can be phosphorylated to ITP by nucleotide phosporylases. Thus, we propose that, in the <italic>ade12 </italic>mutant, an excess of ITP may saturate Ham1p triphosphatase, an essential enzyme for the destruction of HAPTP and dHAPTP, which leads to increased HAP-sensitivity (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The data obtained recently in bacteria are consistent with this hypothesis. It was shown that, <italic>in vitro</italic>, <italic>E. coli </italic>Ham1p homologues protein, RdgB, is a triphosphatase that acts to hydrolize non-canonical DNA precursors, dIPT and dXTP. The Ham1p protein was shown to possess a similar activity on dITP, dXTP, and dHAPTP substrates (Kozmin and Pavlov, unpublished; Burgis and Cunnigham, personal communication; and see refs. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the <italic>rdgB </italic>mutation is synthetically lethal with <italic>recA</italic>. As proposed, absence of RdgB leads to a dramatic increase of hypoxanthine and xanthine in DNA. Accordingly, base excision repair of such modified bases occurring in opposite strands may generate double strand breaks that require the RecA function to be repaired. However, over-expression of adenilosuccinate synthase PurA (homolog of yeast Ade12p) suppresses this lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This suggests a critical role of ASS in the regulation of intracellular concentration of genotoxic hypoxanthine-containing nucleotides.</p><p>We found that certain mutations affecting IMP biosynthesis <italic>de novo </italic>enhance HAP-induced mutagenesis (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Seven of sixteen newly identified genes controlling HAP and AHA sensitivity are involved in AMP biosynthesis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). It is known that the regulation of the AMP biosynthesis pathway by adenine is mediated by SAICAR, one of the precursors in adenine biosynthesis <italic>de novo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The accumulation of certain purine biosynthesis by-products may play a role in the regulation of the nucleotide pool. A defect in endogenous purine biosynthesis probably alters nucleotide pools to favour dHAPTP mis-incorporation into DNA or leads to HAP toxicity. In respect to this hypothesis, it is important that there is a difference in the level of HAP-induced mutagenesis among the strains carrying mutations in the genes of AMP biosynthesis. The less sensitive mutant is <italic>ade3 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The <italic>ADE3 </italic>does not directly control any steps of purine biosynthesis. It encodes the C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase that provides C1-tetrahydrofolate, an indispensable precursor for AMP, histidine, thymidylate, and methionine biosynthesis (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In this respect it is of interest that <italic>ade4, ade16 </italic>and <italic>ade17 </italic>mutants, also defective in IMP biosynthesis, were not found in our screen and were not sensitive to HAP or AHA when constructed <italic>de novo </italic>and tested directly (data not shown). The <italic>ADE4 </italic>stands apart because PRPP, a substrate of the product of the <italic>ADE4 </italic>gene, serves as a precursor for additional biosynthetic pathways. This prevents by-product accumulation and might be one of the explanations of lack of HAP sensitivity of the <italic>ade4 </italic>mutants. The single <italic>ade16 </italic>and <italic>ade17 </italic>mutants also do not lead to byproduct accumulation because <italic>ADE16 </italic>and <italic>ADE17 </italic>are isozymes and the inactivation of one gene does not block the pathway.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Purine salvage and purine biosynthesis <italic>de novo </italic>in yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic></bold>.

This observation provides new perspectives on the mechanisms of base analogs-induced mutagenesis.
