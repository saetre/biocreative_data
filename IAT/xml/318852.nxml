Five positive colonies were identified, and plasmid DNA was isolated. Cleavage with restriction endonucleases showed that these plasmids (designated pBX1 -5) contained inserts of 1530bp , 770bp , 700bp , 1100bp and 930bp . DNA sequence analysis of the plasmid with the largest insert ( pBX1 ) confirmed that bovine factor X cDNAs had been cloned. The cDNA sequence predicts that factor X is synthesized as a single chain precursor in which the light and heavy chains of plasma factor X are linked by the dipeptide Arg-Arg. The cDNA sequence also predicts that factor X is synthesized with a prepro leader peptide. We propose that at least five specific proteolytic events occur during the conversion of prepro -factor X to plasma factor Xa.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0065-a" xlink:role="4484"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0062.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4481"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0063.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4482"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0064.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4483"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0065.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4484"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0066.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4485"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0067.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4486"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0068.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4487"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0069.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4488"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0070.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4489"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0071.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4490"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0072.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4491"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0073.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4492"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
