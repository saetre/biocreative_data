However, some of the most interesting phenotypes are fixed in particular breeds and are therefore less tractable to genetic analysis using classical segregation-based mapping approaches. We implemented an across breed mapping approach using a moderately dense SNP array, a low number of animals and breeds carefully selected for the phenotypes of interest to identify genetic variants responsible for breed-defining characteristics. Using a modest number of affected (10&#x02013;30) and control (20&#x02013;60) samples from multiple breeds, the correct chromosomal assignment was identified in a proof of concept experiment using three previously defined loci; hyperuricosuria, white spotting and chondrodysplasia. Genome-wide association was performed in a similar manner for one of the most striking morphological traits in dogs: brachycephalic head type. Although candidate gene approaches based on comparable phenotypes in mice and humans have been utilized for this trait, the causative gene has remained elusive using this method. Samples from nine affected breeds and thirteen control breeds identified strong genome-wide associations for brachycephalic head type on Cfa 1. Two independent datasets identified the same genomic region. Levels of relative heterozygosity in the associated region indicate that it has been subjected to a selective sweep, consistent with it being a breed defining morphological characteristic. Genotyping additional dogs in the region confirmed the association. To date, the genetic structure of dog breeds has primarily been exploited for genome wide association for segregating traits. These results demonstrate that non-segregating traits under strong selection are equally tractable to genetic analysis using small sample numbers.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Each dog breed is defined by a specific combination of morphological, behavioral and coat color traits.

Brachycephalic breeds such as the Boxer, Boston Terrier, Pekingese, and Bulldog exhibit prognathism and have wide-set, round eyes. Based on the history of many brachycephalic breeds, this phenotype was originally selected in dogs that were used for fighting, based on the idea that this head shape is more powerful for biting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Ellis1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Brachycephaly is associated with a number of medical conditions in the dog including breathing abnormalities, cleft palate and lip and, in some breeds, increased risk of gliomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Hayes1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Luginbuhl1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Nelson1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-FoleyCW1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite these serious medical issues, dogs that exhibit brachycephalic head type have been favored for hundreds of years due to the similarity of their skull shape to that of human infants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Nller1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. With the use of artificial insemination and Caesarean sections that allow some brachycephalic breeds to reproduce, selection for more extreme versions of this phenotype has occurred and it is likely that genetic modifiers exist for this trait <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Hunemeier1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Smith1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. There is little variation within these breeds for brachycephaly, indicating that individuals are largely fixed for the causative allele. Based on crosses performed between breeds, brachycephaly is a semi-dominant trait <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Stockard1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Archeological evidence suggests that brachycephaly existed before the formation of modern breeds so it is likely that the major locus that confers this phenotype is common among affected breeds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Zedda1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The gene responsible for brachycephaly is unknown. An association between a variant of the canine TCOF1 gene and brachycephaly has been suggested in the past <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Haworth1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> but recent experiments do not support those findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Hunemeier1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Phenotypic traits that are common across many breeds, such as brachycephaly, are likely to be identical by descent, just as many other specific genetic traits have been shown to be shared between different dog breeds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Awano1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Bannasch1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Karlsson1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Neff1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Zangerl1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Hedan1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Kerns1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Kerns2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Philipp1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Schmutz1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Most of this phenotypic sharing ceased around 100 years ago when breed standards were fixed and stud books closed. Before this time, certain phenotypic traits would appear in individual dogs and desirable traits would be incorporated into a proto-breed of the time. Strong selection for desirable phenotypic traits that bred true led to homozygosity within breeds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Parker1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>This unique structure of dog breeds has been useful in determining the genetic basis for many desirable and deleterious traits, an effort facilitated by new genetic technologies emanating from the sequencing of the canine genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-LindbladToh1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Whole genome association analysis studies that utilize single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers have been used to identify the molecular causes of various traits and conditions including genetic mutations within breeds that cause coat color variations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Karlsson1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, hairlessness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Drogemuller1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> and defects in spinal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-SalmonHillbertz1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Trait identification involves single breeds that segregate the trait of interest followed by fine structure mapping using additional breeds that segregate the trait <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Bannasch1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. This two stage mapping approach has been very successful and requires modest numbers of individuals. Precise mapping of major loci responsible for trait variation has been accomplished with relatively small numbers of dogs as compared to the large numbers of individuals required for trait identification in genetically diverse human populations. This same unique genetic structure of modern dog breeds can also be advantageous for genetic studies across various breeds. Across breed association for breed stereotypes has been performed for a number of polygenic morphological and behavioral traits using relatively few SNPs across 148 breeds. Multiple significant associations were obtained for many of the traits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Jones1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, a large scale multibreed association analysis using 797 dogs from 72 breeds was used to define the likely mutation causing chondrodysplasia in dogs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Parker2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this study, an across breed mapping approach using SNP arrays and fine mapping techniques was used to identify chromosomal locations that are associated with brachycephaly using comparable sample numbers to studies that have investigated traits within single breeds. This approach takes advantage of the allelic nature of traits between breeds and the extended regions of linkage disequilibrium within breeds as well as the power of strong artificial selection for breed-defining traits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-LindbladToh1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. We propose that using SNP technologies to discern the molecular basis for traits and diseases can be successfully accomplished across multiple breeds as well as within single breeds and that this approach is especially useful for traits that are homozygous within breeds and have undergone strong selection as breed-defining characteristics. Using a modest number of samples, correct chromosomal locations were identified by genome-wide association for three positive control non-segregating traits. Brachycephalic head type was associated with multiple SNPs on Cfa1 using 20 cases and 31 controls. These results were confirmed in an independent dataset in which decreased relative heterozygosity along the chromosome also verified the position. Additional SNP genotyping in affected and unaffected dogs identified a region of overlap in homozygosity between affected breeds of 31 Kb.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>To demonstrate the power of across breed mapping, three positive control traits, hyperuricosuria, white spotting and chondrodysplasia, were selected for genome wide association analysis.

Dog breeds are known to have regions of linkage disequilibrium (LD) that are much longer than those seen in humans, thereby allowing trait and disease mapping in dogs with very few individuals and many fewer SNPs than are needed in human studies. However, the length of LD in dogs varies by breed and is in fact highly breed-specific and dependent upon factors such as the age of the breed, population-limiting events such as bottlenecks and popular sire effects, and the breed population size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Karlsson2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Across dog breeds, LD is shorter than in human populations, allowing a two stage mapping approach for segregating Mendelian traits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Schmutz1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Jones1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Strong selection for breed defining characteristics along with high inbreeding within dog breeds should cause LD near these loci to be longer. The breeds that were used in this study are predicted to have an average LD of &#x0223c;500 Kb based on their population size as compared to breeds in which LD has been measured <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-LindbladToh1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Sutter1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Some overlap of this LD allowed for the identification of strongly associated SNPs using an array with &#x0223c;50,000 SNPs with an average SNP spacing of 50 Kb. This approach relies upon a high density SNP array in order to identify overlap of regions homozygous for the trait of interest within each breed. A strong signal of selection, as indicated by the decreased relative heterozygosity, allowed for the identification of these regions even though the density of this array was not particularly high. Traits not under strong selection may require even higher density SNP arrays. This is illustrated by canine chondrodysplasia and hyperuricosuria where only single SNPs on this array had significant association with the phenotype.</p><p>In all four across breed mapping examples, a <italic>p</italic> value of &#x0003c;0.05 would identify false positive chromosomal locations. In the three cases where the causative mutation had already been identified, the most significant association was properly assigned and was &#x0223c;100 times more likely than the next highest association using permutation testing. The falsely decreased p values were more extreme in the second dataset where fewer breeds and more individuals per breed were used. As new arrays are developed that can assay more SNPs, it may be possible to use across breed mapping for more complex traits. This approach is most effective if many breeds are used or if mixed breed animals are used in addition to purebreds to reduce the false positives due to breed differences in allele frequencies.</p><p>Across breed mapping, followed by permutation testing and selection of the best locus (&#x0003e;100 more significant than the next highest), successfully identified genomic regions of association for brachycephaly. Fine mapping confirmed and narrowed the interval and two genes, THBS2 and SMOC-2, were implicated. Brachycephaly has been under strong selection as a breed-defining characteristic and was probably fixed either before or soon after the breeds were artificially created. The signatures of selective sweeps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-Nielsen1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> within natural populations should be amplified within dog breeds where artificial selection, rather than natural selection, is at work. Using the measure of relative heterozygosity by chromosome helped to define the location of a selective sweep around the brachycephaly locus.</p><p>Of the two genes associated with brachycephaly, the most promising candidate gene was THBS2. Thrombospondins (1 and 2) are expressed in bone and cartilage during development and in the adult skeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-AlfordAI1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Although null mutations induced in the mouse do not confer a severe skeletal phenotype, they do result in mild brachygnathism in the double mutant; thbs1&#x02212;/&#x02212;, thbs2&#x02212;/&#x02212; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-NishiwakiT1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. THBS2 has also been shown to have implications in craniofacial dysmorphism. Mice which overexpress an AP-1 transcription factor, Fra1, have reduced expression of THBS1 and THBS2. During differentiation of osteoblasts, the cells responsible for bone formation, RNA expression of THBS2 dropped over 70&#x00025; in Fra1 transgenic mice. It was also reduced by over 75&#x00025; in the long bones of 3-week-old Fra1 mice. The craniofacial dysmorphism presented by the Fra1 transgenic mice was a skull that was shortened along the anterior-posterior axis and larger along the mediolateral axis as compared to wildtype skulls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-NishiwakiT2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The second candidate gene for brachycephaly, SMOC2, was located just outside of the critical interval for brachycephalic head type. Nonetheless, disruption of its expression could still be causative of the phenotype. It is a member of the SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) family, a group of modular, matricellular proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-RocnikEF1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. They are secreted factors that facilitate interactions between the extracellular matrix of the cell and the surrounding tissue. SMOC2 has a very broad distribution throughout the body and is found in nearly all tissue types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-VannahmeC1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. The protein family's namesake, SPARC, also known as osteonectin or BM-40, is expressed primarily during embryogenesis and in adult bone tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-PorterPL1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been shown to have roles in angiogenesis, tumorigenesis and wound repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-RocnikEF1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Due to considerable sequence similarity with SPARC, SMOC2 may have analogous biological functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009632-LiuP1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Regulatory mutations in either SMOC2 and/or THBS2 could lead to the brachycephalic phenotype. Embryonic expression analysis of these two genes in the developing head of brachycephalic and non-brachycephalic embryos would be necessary to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>As demonstrated by these examples, purebred dogs offer a unique opportunity to identify the genetic etiology of extraordinary phenotypic diversity. Morphological traits such as brachycephaly are characteristic of certain breeds and had a functional purpose at the time that those breeds were created. The fact that such traits were fixed within breeds by strong selection by breeders allows the use of genetic approaches that are not feasible in other species. The small number of samples used for this analysis highlights the power of the canine model system for genetic analysis of traits and implies its potential application to identify other important disease loci in dogs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Blood samples were acquired from patients of the University of California at Davis William R.

The relative heterozygosity was normalized in a way that gives negative values when cases are less heterozygous than controls and otherwise positive values. The normalization was performed by the following formula: ratio&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 -1/ratio if ratio &#x0003c; 1 and ratio &#x02260; 0.
