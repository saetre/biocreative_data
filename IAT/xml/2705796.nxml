By sliding nucleosomes, NURF can alter chromatin structure and regulate transcription. NURF301/BPTF is the only NURF&#x02013;specific subunit of NURF and is instrumental in recruiting the complex to target genes. Here we demonstrate that three NURF301 isoforms are expressed and that these encode functionally distinct NURF chromatin remodeling complexes. Full-length NURF301 contains a C-terminal bromodomain and juxtaposed PHD finger that bind histone H3 trimethylated at Lys4 (H3K4me3) and histone H4 acetylated at Lys16 (H4K16Ac) respectively. However, a NURF301 isoform that lacks these C-terminal domains is also detected. This truncated NURF301 isoform assembles a complex containing ISWI, NURF55, and NURF38, indicating that a second class of NURF remodeling complex, deficient in H3K4me3 and H4K16Ac recognition, exists. By comparing microarray expression profiles and phenotypes of null <italic>Nurf301</italic> mutants with mutants that remove the C-terminal PHD fingers and bromodomain, we show that full-length NURF301 is not essential for correct expression of the majority of NURF gene targets in larvae. However, full-length NURF301 is required for spermatogenesis. Mutants that lack full-length NURF exhibit a spermatocyte arrest phenotype and fail to express a subset of spermatid differentiation genes. Our data reveal that variants of the NURF ATP&#x02013;dependent chromatin remodeling complex that recognize post-translational histone modifications are important regulators of primary spermatocyte differentiation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Changes in nucleosome dynamics have a profound effect on DNA transactions such as transcription, replication, and repair.

By altering nucleosome dynamics, genes can be rendered inaccessible or made available to the transcription machinery. There are a number of mechanisms by which altered chromatin states can be induced. Post-translational modification of the histone tails can change associations between histones and DNA and between neighboring nucleosomes, altering chromatin flexibility and conformation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Kouzarides1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Wang1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>). A second approach is through the deployment of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Saha1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Choudhary1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>). These multi-subunit protein complexes utilize the energy of ATP hydrolysis to alter the dynamic properties of nucleosomes. Traditionally they are divided into broad families depending on the catalytic subunit utilized, and their mechanism of altering nucleosomes - either nucleosome eviction, sliding or variant histone replacement.</p><p>The principal activity of the ISWI family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors is energy-dependent nucleosome sliding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Hamiche1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Xiao1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The <underline>nu</underline>cleosome <underline>r</underline>emodeling <underline>f</underline>actor (NURF) is one of the founding members of this family. By sliding nucleosomes, NURF can alternatively expose or occlude transcription factor binding sites, activating or repressing transcription. Consistent with this, studies of mutants that lack either the NURF-specific large subunit NURF301, or the catalytic ISWI ATPase subunit have shown that NURF is required for both transcription activation and repression <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Deuring1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Bonaldi1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

In contrast, NURF has been shown to regulate <italic>Drosophila</italic> innate immunity by repressing targets of the JAK/STAT pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Kwon1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although NURF is composed of four subunits, only the largest subunit (in <italic>Drosophila</italic> NURF301; in humans bromodomain and PHD finger transcription factor (BPTF)) is specific to NURF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Xiao1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Barak1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. All other subunits are present in a number of other chromatin remodeling complexes. This suggests that targeting of NURF to promoters is likely to be a function of NURF301/BPTF. Consistent with this, NURF301/BPTF contains PHD (plant homeo domain) fingers and a bromodomain, motifs that have the potential to recognize specific histone modifications. The C-terminal PHD finger of BPTF/NURF binds the amino terminal tail of histone H3 trimethylated at lysine position 4 (H3K4me3) and has been shown to recruit NURF to sites of H3K4me3 enrichment in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Wysocka1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

This suggests that NURF may bind to sites of H4K16Ac, although <italic>in vitro</italic> studies indicate that H4K16Ac may also inhibit catalytic activity of the ISWI subunit of NURF and hence NURF-mediated chromatin remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-ShogrenKnaak1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Ferreira1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Alternative splicing presents another mechanism by which the activity of chromatin modifying and remodeling factors may be regulated. Sequence analysis of 160 chromatin-associated proteins has revealed that 28&#x00025; of these encode alternative splice forms in which domains critical for function are substituted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Lois1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with this, Shiekhattar and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Barak2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> have previously reported that function of human NURF can be regulated by the incorporation of a catalytically inactive isoform of the SNF2L subunit.

This raises the possibility that multiple distinct NURF complexes exist with altered functions conferred by the incorporation of splice variants of the major subunits. In this report we examine whether <italic>Drosophila</italic> NURF is subject to alternative splicing. We show that three NURF301 isoforms occur, one of which lacks the PHD fingers and bromodomains that recognize the H3K4me3 and H4K16Ac marks. Using whole genome expression profiling we identify NURF target genes that require these domains and hence recognition of histone tail modifications. Our results indicate that NURF complexes that recognize H3K4me3 and H4K16Ac are not required for correct expression of the majority of NURF gene targets in larvae, but are obligatory for NURF function in spermatogenesis. Our data reveals that alternative splicing of the large specificity subunit NURF301 allows the elaboration of functionally distinct variants of the NURF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Naturally occurring isoforms of NURF301</title><p>Inspection of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome sequence (Release 5.2 annotation, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu/">http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu/</ext-link>) revealed that the locus encoding the NURF specificity subunit (<italic>Nurf301</italic>) potentially generates three isoforms by alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000574-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>Nurf301-A</italic> corresponds to the previously described full-length isoform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Xiao1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Nurf301-B</italic> contains an additional intron that deletes 60 bp from exon 6.

Strong binding between GST-PHD and H3K4me3, and GST-Bromo and H4K16Ac was observed.

Additional evidence for the existence of the <italic>Nurf301-C</italic> isoform was provided by the presence of an EST (LD30146) within the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project collection that corresponds to the 3&#x02032; region of <italic>Nurf301-C</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000574-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

Neither band was observed in extracts of null <italic>Nurf301</italic> mutants that disrupt all isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000574-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 2).</p><p>We next verified which histone modifications were bound by the C-terminal PHD finger and bromodomain of full-length NURF301. Single domains were expressed and purified as GST-fusion proteins and tested for the ability to bind either unmodified histone H3 and H4 tail peptides, H3K4me3 tail peptide or H4K16Ac tail peptide. Pull-downs were performed using either the peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000574-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) or GST-fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000574-g001">Figure 1E</xref>) as baits. As observed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Wysocka1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, the C-terminal PHD finger of NURF301 was able to bind H3K4me3 tail peptide but did not bind unmodified H3 tail peptide (GST-PHD in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000574-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>). Likewise the bromodomain was able to bind H4K16Ac tail peptide but did not bind unmodified H4 tail peptide (GST-Bromo in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000574-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>).</p><p>Our data indicate that NURF complexes built around full-length NURF301-A or around NURF301-B should have the ability to bind both H3K4me3 and H4K16Ac histone modifications. However, NURF complexes composed of the NURF301-C isoform will lack this binding ability. To confirm whether truncated NURF301 isoforms would be able to assemble a NURF complex, we determined association with the three other subunits of the NURF complex: ISWI, NURF55 and NURF38. Insect cells were co-infected with baculoviruses that express ISWI, NURF55, NURF38 and a FLAG-tagged C-terminally truncated version of NURF301 (FLAG-NURF301&#x00394;C). FLAG-NURF301&#x00394;C was then purified using anti-FLAG beads and association of other NURF subunits assayed by Western blotting. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000574-g001">Figure 1F</xref>, ISWI, NURF55 and NURF38 co-purified with the truncated NUR301&#x00394;C isoform. This defines a minimal ISWI-, NURF55- and NURF38-interacting region that is present within all NURF301 isoforms. It has previously been shown that the ISWI subunit alone displays remodeling activity, and that this does not require the presence of the other NURF subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Corona2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, by associating with ISWI, all NURF301 isoforms should nucleate the formation of functional chromatin remodeling complexes. To distinguish these alternative NURF complexes, we have designated them NURF-A, NURF-B and NURF-C, corresponding to the NURF301 isoform utilized. For example, NURF-C indicates the NURF complex constituted from the short PHD finger- and bromodomain-deficient isoform NURF301-C.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Whole genome expression profiling</title><p>To address the function of these complexes, in particular to distinguish functions of the full-length NURF-A and NURF-B complexes from the NURF-C complex, we have made use of a cluster of EMS-induced mutations that truncate <italic>Nurf301</italic> at exon 5. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000574-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, these mutations, which we term <italic>Nurf301&#x00394;C</italic> mutations, generate shortened NURF301 isoforms that contain all of the conserved motifs present in NURF301 except the C-terminal PHD fingers and bromodomain. These mutations will ablate function of NURF301-A and NURF301-B while still expressing a protein variant (NURF301&#x00394;C) that is a reasonable model for NURF301-C.

In early stage primary spermatocytes, NURF301 staining could be detected throughout the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000574-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). However, during maturation of the primary spermatocytes NURF301 began to accumulate preferentially on the bivalents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000574-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, mid) until finally NURF301 was exclusively detected on the bivalents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000574-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, late). Interestingly, NURF301 was only enriched on two of the three bivalents (closed arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000574-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). The three bivalents correspond to the second, third, and X and Y chromosomes respectively.

As such, NURF301 staining can be localized to the second and third chromosome bivalents.

Instead, NURF301 staining is distributed throughout the nuclei of primary spermatocytes suggesting that the C-terminal PHD fingers and bromodomain is required for NURF recruitment to chromatin in spermatocytes. In support of this, antibody staining using anti-H3K4me3 antibodies reveals that H3K4me3 is also selectively enriched on two of the three bivalents, like NURF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000574-g007">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen-1000574-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000574.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>NURF localization in primary spermatocytes.</title><p>(A) Antibody staining using anti-NURF301 antibodies reveals that NURF is enriched at two of the three bivalents in late primary spermatocytes.

Twine (Twe) is a germline-specific CDC25 that is required for entry of spermatocytes into meiosis. In <italic>twe</italic> mutants that fail to enter meiosis, NURF301 staining was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000574-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). This suggests that NURF localization requires function of tMAC and tTAFs and that disrupted NURF staining is not an indirect consequence of a meiotic block.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Alternatively splicing represents a convenient mechanism for generating diversity within proteins and protein complexes. In this report we provide evidence that alternative splicing of the large NURF301 subunit of NURF generates functionally distinct chromatin remodeling complexes. We identify two classes of NURF complexes. The first comprises NURF variants composed of full-length NURF301 that have the ability to target the H3K4me3 and H4K16Ac histone modifications. The second consists of NURF complexes composed of a truncated isoform of NURF301 (NURF301-C) that lack this ability. Functional characterization of these variant complexes has allowed the identification of distinct subsets of target genes. We show that NURF complexes that recognize the H3K4me3 and H4K16Ac histone tail modifications are not required for correct expression of the majority of NURF targets in larvae but are obligatory for NURF function in spermatogenesis.</p><p>The regulation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> NURF function by alternative splicing of the NURF301 specificity subunit may reflect a general phenomenon that will influence subunits and function of most chromatin remodeling enzymes. This is consistent with analyses of sequence databases that show that 28&#x00025; of chromatin modifying proteins potentially encode alternative splice forms in which domains critical for function are substituted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Lois1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. A good example of this is SNF2L, the catalytic subunit of human NURF, which generates an inactive isoform by alternative splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Barak2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Lazzaro1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, similar truncated NURF301 isoforms are also predicted to occur in other species. For example Andersen and Horwitz (2006) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Andersen1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> have shown that the homologous <italic>C. elegans nurf-1</italic> locus encodes a variant NURF-1A that lacks the PHD fingers and bromodomain. In addition gene predictions for human BPTF (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics) and mouse BPTF (UCSC gene predictions) indicate the existence of similar shortened isoforms. We propose that these isoforms do not generate dominant-negative, variant NURF complexes like those produced by alternative splicing of SNF2L <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Barak2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Rather functional NURF remodeling complexes are formed but these possess altered targeting specificity for histone post-translational modifications.</p><p>Our data indicate that short NURF301 isoforms are co-expressed with full-length NURF301 in all tissues assayed, and can form a complex with all other NURF subunits. To date we have not uncovered evidence of tissue-specific or exclusive expression of any of the NURF301 isoforms suggesting that these variant NURF complexes co-exist in cells. Thus, functional distinction between these complexes does not seem to be achieved by altering tissue distribution, but rather by regulating their ability to be recruited to target promoters by changing their modified histone-binding properties. Our microarray analysis of null and truncating <italic>Nurf301&#x00394;C</italic> mutants indicates that, for the majority of target promoters in larvae, full-length NURF isoforms are not obligatory for expression. However we do identify a subset of genes that require full-length NURF301 and a number of cases in which the variant NURF complexes appear to have antagonistic functions. For example, we have shown that expression levels of <italic>CG11893</italic> and <italic>CG6296</italic> are reduced by a greater margin in <italic>Nurf301&#x00394;C</italic> than null <italic>Nurf301</italic> mutants, raising the possibility that NURF-C isoforms antagonize function of full-length NURF complexes.</p><p>The fact that <italic>Nurf301&#x00394;C</italic> mutants affect expression of only a subset of NURF target genes in larvae is consistent with our previous analyses in which we showed that <italic>Nurf301&#x00394;C</italic> mutants show proper expression of ecdysone target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Badenhorst2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, although null <italic>Nurf301</italic> mutants do not express homeotic genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Deuring1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Badenhorst1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref><italic>Nurf301&#x00394;C</italic> mutants do not show major developmental abnormalities indicating that Hox gene expression is for the most part unaffected. This contrasts with experiments in <italic>Xenopus</italic> that have shown dramatic axial patterning defects as a consequence of loss of H3K4me3 recognition by NURF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Wysocka1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. One explanation for these differences may be that redundant stabilizing interactions exist on <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hox promoters that reduce the dependency on H3K4me3 for NURF binding to these promoters. This would be consistent with previous data showing that NURF can be recruited to target promoters through interaction with a number of transcription factors, for example the GAGA factor, the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Bcl6 homologue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Xiao1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Badenhorst2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Kwon1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. It seems feasible that, on the majority of NURF targets, interactions with transcription factors may be sufficient for NURF recruitment and activity.</p><p>Of the subset of NURF targets that do show altered expression in <italic>Nurf301&#x00394;C</italic> microarrays, approximately equal numbers are up-regulated (227) and down-regulated (183). While some of these may be indirect targets of NURF these data suggest that the C-terminal PHD fingers and Bromodomain may also be required for repression by NURF at some genes. This is confirmed in testes where expression of <italic>aret</italic> and <italic>bru-2</italic> are both up-regulated in <italic>Nurf301&#x00394;C</italic> mutants. There is some evidence that H3K4me3 and H4K16Ac are required for gene repression as binding of H3K4me3 by the PHD finger of ING2 has been shown to be required for transcriptional repression of cyclin D1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Shi1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, and H4K16Ac is required for rDNA silencing by NoRC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Zhou1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it is worth noting that the C-terminal region of NURF301 contains a second PHD finger in addition to the distal PHD finger that binds H3K4me3. This PHD finger has all the conserved hydrophobic residues in particular W32 that constitute the aromatic cage shown to be critical for methyl lysine recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Li2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that it may also bind methylated lysine residues. Experiments are underway to determine the binding specificity of this PHD finger, but it is tempting to speculate that it binds methylated histone lysine residues involved in gene repression. We are currently examining the genome-wide distribution of NURF complexes by ChIP-Sequencing methodologies. Results of these experiments will allow us to determine whether genes derepressed in <italic>Nurf301&#x00394;C</italic> mutants are direct targets of NURF and allow the overlap of NURF-binding with histone marks associated with gene repression to be determined.</p><p>Finally, our data indicates that NURF has a key role in <italic>Drosophila</italic> spermatogenesis. We have shown that testis development in <italic>Nurf301&#x00394;C</italic> mutants arrests at the primary spermatocyte stage. We demonstrate that expression of the spermatid differentiation gene <italic>fzo</italic> is lost in <italic>Nurf301&#x00394;C</italic> mutants and that NURF-binding at <italic>fzo</italic> overlaps accumulation of H3K4me3 and H4K16Ac marks. Taken together these data suggests that interpretation of these histone modifications is required for NURF function at the <italic>fzo</italic> promoter. It is important to stress though that these results are correlative. Direct causal requirement for NURF recruitment on H3K4me3 and H4K16Ac would need to be confirmed by loss of NURF under conditions in which these marks are ablated. However, this is hampered by availability of suitable genetic backgrounds in which these modifications are completely removed. Unfortunately, Mof the principal H4K16 acetylase is male lethal as it is required for X-chromosome dosage compensation in males <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000574-Hilfiker1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.
