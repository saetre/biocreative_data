We report that in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains lacking Trf4, cryptic transcripts are detected from regions of repressed chromatin at telomeres and the rDNA intergenic spacer region (IGS1-R), and at <italic>CEN3</italic>. Degradation of the IGS1-R transcript was reduced in strains lacking TRAMP components, the core exosome protein Mtr3 or the nuclear-specific exosome component Rrp6. IGS1-R has potential binding sites for the RNA-binding proteins Nrd1/Nab3, and was stabilized by mutation of Nrd1. IGS1-R passes through the replication fork barrier, a region required for rDNA copy number control. Strains lacking Trf4 showed sporadic changes in rDNA copy number, whereas loss of both Trf4 and either the histone deacetylase Sir2 or the topoisomerase Top1 caused dramatic loss of rDNA repeats. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that Trf4 is co-transcriptionally recruited to IGS1-R, consistent with a direct role in rDNA stability. Co-transcriptional RNA binding by Trf4 may link RNA and DNA metabolism and direct immediate IGS1-R degradation by the exosome following transcription termination.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>exosome</kwd><kwd>ncRNA</kwd><kwd>nucleolus</kwd><kwd>recombination</kwd><kwd>TRAMP</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The eukaryotic exosome is a complex of 10 core subunits, including a 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease and RNA-binding proteins, that is involved in many aspects of RNA processing and surveillance. The purified exosome alone does not display strong RNA degradation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Mitchell <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>) and is targeted to specific substrates by different cofactors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Houseley <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Two related complexes, TRAMP4 and TRAMP5, target aberrant tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Kadaba <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">LaCava <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Vanacova <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) and aberrant ribosomal RNA for exosome degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dez <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Houseley and Tollervey, 2006</xref>). These complexes also target a class of cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), resulting in their immediate degradation following transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Wyers <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Arigo <italic>et al</italic>, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Thiebaut <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Vasiljeva and Buratowski, 2006</xref>). An apparently similar class of RNA has been identified in mouse and human cells; like the CUTs, these superficially resemble mRNAs in being RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcripts that carry 5&#x02032; caps and 3&#x02032; poly(A) tails, but lack evident protein coding capacity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Willingham and Gingeras, 2006</xref>). Despite their apparent conservation, little is known about the function of these transcripts.</p><p>In many Eukaryotes, transcripts influence chromatin structure via the siRNA/RNAi system. In fission yeast, establishment of centromeric heterochromatin involves the poly(A) polymerases Cid12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Motamedi <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) and Cid14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Buhler <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), which are in the same family as budding yeast Trf4 and Trf5, and Cid14 resides in a TRAMP-like complex. <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> lacks homologs of key components of the machinery that processes siRNAs, but it seemed possible that other mechanisms might transfer information from the transcriptome back to the chromatin structure of the genome.</p><p>The TRAMP complexes are composed of a poly(A) polymerase, Trf4 or Trf5, a putative RNA-binding protein, Air1 or Air2, and the putative DEVH-box helicase Mtr4. Trf4 and Trf5 were originally isolated in a synthetic lethal screen with <italic>top1</italic> mutations. Conditional double mutants of <italic>trf4</italic> with <italic>top1-7</italic> showed ribosomal DNA (rDNA) condensation phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Sadoff <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Castano <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>), and were reported to display defects in mitotic segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Edwards <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). In addition, strains lacking both Trf4 and Trf5 (which are synthetic lethal) fail to complete DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). These reports suggested that Trf4 and Trf5 play some role in DNA metabolism, particularly in the rDNA, although the nature of this role remained unclear.</p><p>Wild-type yeast contain a tandem array of approximately 200 rDNA repeats on chromosome XII, the number of which is maintained by regulated recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Szostak and Wu, 1980</xref>). Each repeat contains the 35S and 5S ribosomal RNA genes separated by intergenic spacer regions IGS1 and IGS2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). The IGS1 region of the rDNA repeat contains a replication fork barrier (RFB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Voelkel-Meiman <italic>et al</italic>, 1987</xref>), where a protein complex including Fob1 imposes a unidirectional block to the progress of DNA replication forks. This region also contains a recombination hotspot that is necessary for double-strand break formation and subsequent recombination between sister chromatids to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kobayashi and Horiuchi, 1996</xref>).</p><p>The repeat tracts in two sister chromatids are normally held together by the cohesin complex, which is concentrated over the cohesin-associated region (CAR) in IGS2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Laloraya <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). This ensures that even if recombination is initiated, it occurs only with the aligned repeat in the sister chromatid, and does not result in a change of repeat number. Two divergent Pol II transcripts generated from the E-pro promoter within IGS1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Santangelo <italic>et al</italic>, 1988</xref>) have been suggested to regulate recombination, as replacement of E-pro with a regulated, divergent <italic>GAL1-10</italic> promoter resulted in cohesin displacement and extensive unequal recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Kobayashi and Ganley, 2005</xref>). Unequal recombination leads to a net change in repeat number for the chromatid that initiated recombination. However, these analyses did not address potentially distinct roles for the two Pol II transcripts, which we designate here as IGS1-F and IGS1-R. IGS1-F is transcribed through the CAR, consistent with its reported role in cohesin displacement, whereas IGS1-R is transcribed through the RFB.</p><p>The rDNA IGS regions, along with the telomeres and inactive mating loci, are silenced for Pol II transcription by the histone deactylase Sir2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Smith and Boeke, 1997</xref>). Loss of Sir2 leads to elevated expression of the IGS1 and IGS2 transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) and hyper-recombination within the rDNA array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Gottlieb and Esposito, 1989</xref>). This was proposed to be a consequence of cohesin displacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Kobayashi <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Here we demonstrate that one of the non-coding RNA (ncRNA) transcripts generated from the intergenic spacer regions, IGS1-R, is targeted for degradation mediated by Trf4 and the exosome. Trf4 is recruited to the rDNA spacer region that includes the RFB, via the IGS1-R transcript, and is required for stability of the rDNA repeat copy number. These data provide evidence for novel links between RNA and DNA metabolism in budding yeast.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cryptic transcripts from regions of repressed chromatin accumulate in strains with defects in the TRAMP complex or exosome</title><p>We speculated that transcripts may be generated from regions of repressed chromatin in the yeast genome but degraded by the TRAMP and exosome complexes. We therefore tested a telomeric region (<italic>TEL05L</italic>), the intergenic spacer (IGS) region of the rDNA repeat, a centromeric region (<italic>CEN3</italic>) and the silenced mating-type cassettes (<italic>MATa</italic>/&#x003b1;). In each case, we saw increased levels of a transcript in strains lacking Trf4, but not in single mutant strains lacking Trf5, Air1 or Air2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>, compare lane 2 with lanes 3&#x02013;5).</p><p>At many yeast telomeres, the terminal repeats are flanked by the &#x02018;Y&#x02032; region', which is conserved in whole or in part at 16 yeast telomeres. At some telomeres, this region encodes a putative DNA helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Yamada <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>), designated Yel077c in the case of <italic>TEL05L</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). Strand-specific probes demonstrated that the transcript elevated in the <italic>trf4</italic>&#x00394; strain is an ncRNA expressed antisense to <italic>YEL077C</italic>. The <italic>TEL05L</italic> ncRNA is &#x0223c;6.5 kb in length and was detected by a probe located within <italic>YEL074W</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figures, 2A and B</xref>) and by a second probe located 2.8 kb further toward the chromosome end (data not shown), showing it to extend across the Y&#x02032; region. 5&#x02032; RACE generated a product that was enriched in <italic>trf4</italic>&#x00394; (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>), which was cloned and sequenced. Three 5&#x02032; ends were identified, located 106&#x02013;128 bp beyond the 3&#x02032; end of the open reading frame (ORF) of <italic>YEL077C</italic>. The ncRNA therefore starts close to the chromosome end and runs antisense through the entire putative helicase ORF. Polymorphisms in sequenced products demonstrate that the ncRNA is transcribed from at least two telomeres (data not shown).</p><p>The <italic>TEL05L</italic> ncRNA was also elevated in a strain lacking Rrp6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>, lane 6), indicating that it is a target for exosome degradation. Depletion of Trf5 by growth of a <italic>trf4</italic>&#x00394; <italic>GAL-trf5</italic> strain on glucose medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>, lane 5) increased accumulation of the <italic>TEL05L</italic> transcript relative to the <italic>trf4</italic>&#x00394; single mutant. Overexpression of Trf5, in <italic>GAL-trf5</italic> strains grown in galactose medium, can suppress the phenotype of <italic>trf4</italic>&#x00394; strains on some TRAMP substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Houseley and Tollervey, 2006</xref>), and this was the case for the <italic>TEL05L</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>, lane 4). We conclude that TRAMP4 and TRAMP5 both participate in degradation, with TRAMP4 probably playing the major role, and function with the exosome to degrade large ncRNAs generated from telomeric regions.</p><p>We have not further characterized the &#x0223c;1.2 kb <italic>CEN3</italic> transcript, and the structure of the <italic>MAT</italic> loci prevents unambiguous assignment of the observed &#x0223c;1.2 kb transcript to a silent cassette. However, connections between Trf4 and Top1 mutations and rDNA structure (see Introduction) suggested a functional link to IGS transcription, which was therefore further investigated. The ncRNA products of transcription from E-pro, IGS1-F and IGS1-R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) are normally present at very low levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Santangelo <italic>et al</italic>, 1988</xref>) and we speculated that this might reflect rapid degradation involving the TRAMP and exosome complexes. To visualize these ncRNAs, northern blots of RNA from TRAMP and exosome mutants were probed with strand-specific probes to both rDNA intergenic spacer regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). An <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; strain, which overexpresses IGS transcripts, was used as a positive control. A <italic>top1</italic>&#x00394; strain was also analyzed, as <italic>top1 trf4</italic> double mutants were reported to show synthetic lethality and rDNA condensation phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Sadoff <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Castano <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>). Strains carrying <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>top1</italic>&#x00394; showed elevated levels of three ncRNAs IGS1-R, IGS1-F and IGS2-R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes 6 and 7).</p><p>The levels of IGS1-F and IGS2-R were unaltered in TRAMP or exosome mutants, whereas the level of IGS1-R was substantially increased in <italic>trf4</italic>&#x00394; and to a lesser extent in <italic>air1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>air2</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rrp6</italic>&#x00394; strains. No stabilization of IGS1-R was seen in <italic>trf5</italic>&#x00394; strains, and overexpression of Trf5 under GAL regulation did not suppress the <italic>trf4</italic>&#x00394; phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). This suggests that Trf5 does not efficiently target IGS1-R, even in the absence of Trf4. IGS1-R stabilization in the <italic>rrp6</italic>&#x00394; exosome mutant strain was weaker than that in <italic>trf4</italic>&#x00394; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figures 3B</xref> (lane 5) and D (lane 3)) and we therefore also examined the core exosome mutant <italic>mtr3-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>). Even at permissive temperature (25&#x000b0;C), accumulation of IGS1-R was visible in the <italic>mtr3-1</italic> strain. We conclude that TRAMP4 functions with both Rrp6 and the core exosome to degrade IGS1-R, whereas degradation of IGS1-F and IGS2-R presumably involves other activities.</p><p>Two major forms of IGS2-R of approximately 1.6 kb and 850 nt in length were detected (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The longer IGS2-R species also hybridized to a downstream probe to IGS1, whereas the short species was not detected with this probe, indicating that it is 3&#x02032; truncated (data not shown). This would be consistent with termination of some IGS2-R transcripts around the location of the CAR, even in <italic>top1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; strains. A shorter probe directed against the 3&#x02032; region of IGS1-R (NTS1 short; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>) was also used. This region is extremely AT rich and the probe hybridized poorly; however, only the longer transcripts were detected by NTS1 short probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>, compare lanes 1&#x02013;4 with 5&#x02013;8). This indicates that the IGS1-R transcripts show 3&#x02032; heterogeneity.</p><p>To assess whether increased IGS1-R RNA reflects increased transcription or post-transcriptional stabilization, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed to determine RNA Pol II occupancy in wild-type, <italic>trf4</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>top1</italic>&#x00394; cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3E</xref>) and <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; (data not shown). This revealed a clear peak of Pol II within the IGS1-R region in the wild-type strain. This peak was elevated in the <italic>top1</italic>&#x00394; strain, consistent with constitutive derepression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bryk <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>). In contrast, the Pol II signal in the <italic>trf4</italic>&#x00394; strain was lower than that in the wild-type strain, despite elevated levels of the transcript.</p><p>We next wanted to determine how the TRAMP complex is recruited to the IGS1-R transcripts. The Nrd1&#x02013;Nab3 heterodimer of RNA-binding proteins was reported to recruit the exosome to substrate RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Arigo <italic>et al</italic>, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Thiebaut <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The longest observed IGS1-R transcript contains 10 potential binding sites for Nab3 (UCUU) including two prominent clusters, and seven binding sites for Nrd1 (GUAA/G). The level of IGS1-R was therefore assessed in ts-lethal <italic>nab3-11</italic> and <italic>nrd1-102</italic> mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3F</xref>). IGS1-R was strongly stabilized in the <italic>nrd1-102</italic> mutant, demonstrating that it is targeted by the Nrd1&#x02013;Nab3 pathway. In contrast, the <italic>nab3-11</italic> mutant conferred little or no stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3F</xref>). Allele specificity has, however, previously been reported for mutations in these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Conrad <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>) and the data do not demonstrate that Nrd1 is primarily responsible for targeting IGS1-R for degradation. On other transcripts, Nrd1&#x02013;Nab3 are responsible for transcription termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Steinmetz <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Arigo <italic>et al</italic>, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kim <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Thiebaut <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). However, we saw no clear differences in the migration of the IGS1-R transcripts in the <italic>nrd1</italic> or <italic>nab3</italic> mutants relative to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3F</xref>), suggesting that termination is not strongly impaired.</p><p>From the ChIP and northern data, we conclude that transcription of IGS2-R and IGS1-F is strongly repressed by a chromatin structure that requires Sir2 and Top1 for its maintenance. IGS1-R is more actively transcribed than IGS2-R or IGS1-F, but the resulting transcripts are rapidly degraded by a mechanism that requires the Nrd1/Nab3 complex, TRAMP4 and both the core exosome and Rrp6.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>IGS1-R is polyadenylated and shows extensive 3&#x02032; heterogeneity</title><p>Primer extension was used to define the 5&#x02032; end of the IGS1-R transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). The 5&#x02032; end was mapped by running the primer extension products alongside a sequencing ladder on a 40 cm denaturing polyacrylamide gel (data not shown). The major 5&#x02032; end lies at &#x0002b;599 nt from the end of the 25S rRNA, with some secondary 5&#x02032; ends spanning about 20 bp. This position is 26 bp 3&#x02032; to that originally described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Santangelo <italic>et al</italic>, 1988</xref>) and around &#x0002b;175 nt from the RFB.</p><p>Conventional analyses of polyadenylation using RNase H and oligo(dT) were complicated by the presence of two genome-encoded poly(A) tracts within IGS1-R (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures 1A and B</xref>). However, the results were consistent with 3&#x02032; heterogeneity, as were the northern analyses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>.

These results indicate that IGS1-R is polyadenylated by Pap1 and suggest that efficient polyadenylation promotes IGS1-R degradation.</p><p>We tested whether the polyadenylation activity of Trf4 is required for degradation of IGS1-R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4E</xref>). Plasmids expressing either Trf4 or the catalytically inactive Trf4-DADA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Vanacova <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) fully suppressed the IGS1-R stabilization phenotype in the <italic>trf4</italic>&#x00394; strain.

The <italic>top1</italic>&#x00394; strains expressing wild-type Trf4 showed a hyper-recombination phenotype (lanes 5 and 6). Hyper-recombination was suppressed in the absence of Trf4 (lanes 2 and 3), but was clearly present when only Trf4-DADA was expressed (lanes 8 and 9). Western blotting confirmed that the mutant and wild-type Trf4 were expressed at similar levels (data not shown). In this experiment, strains were grown on minimal media to select for plasmid maintenance and recombination was less active than on complete YPD media used in the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>. Thus, the poly(A) polymerase activity of Trf4 is not required for IGS1-R degradation and is also not required for hyper-recombination.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>rDNA recombination frequency is unaffected by loss of TRF4</title><p>These analyses do not resolve differences in recombination frequency and stability of the rDNA repeat tract. Recombination rates within the rDNA tract can be assessed by integrating a single-copy marker gene and scoring for its loss.

In this case, the role of IGS1-R transcription might be to recruit Trf4 to the rDNA in the vicinity of the RFB region. Were this model correct, we would detect an association of Trf4 with the rDNA IGS1-R region that is dependent on RNA Pol II transcription.</p><p>ChIP analysis of Trf4-Myc over the rDNA IGS regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7B</xref>) showed clear enrichment over IGS1-R.

The ChIP signal for Trf4 was substantially reduced across the IGS1-R region at the restrictive temperature, consistent with its recruitment by IGS1-R nascent transcripts, although the ChIP signal for Pol II showed greater reduction than the Trf4 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7B</xref>). To ensure that the protein context of the rDNA is not generally altered in this strain, lysates from this experiment were checked by ChIP for the presence of Sir2, which was only mildly reduced at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>These data indicate that Trf4 is recruited co-transcriptionally to the nascent IGS1-R transcripts, probably via Nrd1/Nab3.

In contrast, the Smc1 ChIP signal was strongly reduced by loss of Top1, either in the presence or absence of Trf4. This makes it unlikely that the effects of Trf4 on rDNA copy number regulation are related to removal of cohesin from the IGS region.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cryptic transcripts are generated from repressed chromatin regions in S. cerevisiae</title><p>Genome-wide analyses of RNA Pol II density in yeast using ChIP and tiling microarrays showed that almost the entire genome is transcribed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">David <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Steinmetz <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). A striking feature of these analyses was that regions of repressed chromatin, notably in the rDNA IGS1 region and telomeres, showed Pol II occupancy that was significantly below the background of &#x02018;non-transcribed' regions. Paradoxically, these repressed regions can be actively transcribed under some conditions, leading to the suggestion that initial rounds of transcription might be needed to establish subsequent silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Steinmetz <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). In strains lacking the poly(A) polymerase Trf4, we detected cryptic transcripts derived from <italic>CEN3</italic> and from regions of repressed chromatin: a telomeric region (<italic>TEL05L</italic>) and the rDNA intergenic spacer region IGS1-R.</p><p>The <italic>TEL05L</italic> ncRNA transcript stabilized in TRAMP and exosome mutants is &#x0223c;6.5 kb in length and is derived from the Y&#x02032; region, which is fully or partially conserved at most yeast telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Louis and Haber, 1992</xref>). The RNA initiates close to the terminal telomeric repeats and runs antisense to an ORF (<italic>YEL077C</italic>), which potentially encodes a 143 kDa protein proposed to function as a DNA helicase involved in telomere maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Yamada <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). Sequence analyses showed that ncRNAs are generated from at least two telomeres, and we speculate that they may be transcribed from many or all telomeres. The identification of these ncRNAs might be consistent with the model that cryptic transcripts play a role in establishing silenced chromatin regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Steinmetz <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, centromeric regions are very small, lack clear heterochromatic regions and were not previously reported to be transcribed. In contrast, centromeric regions in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> are transcribed, but the RNAs are rapidly degraded by the TRAMP and exosome complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Buhler <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). We detected an RNA of &#x0223c;1.2 kb apparently derived from <italic>CEN3</italic>, which was elevated in the <italic>trf4</italic>&#x00394; strain, suggesting that cryptic centromeric transcripts may also be present in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p>Previous reports functionally linked Trf4 with Top1 and cohesion and condensation in the rDNA repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Castano <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>), and we therefore analyzed the IGS1 transcripts in more detail. Two transcripts, IGS1-R and IGS1-F, are generated by divergent transcription from the E-pro promoter. We showed that IGS1-R, but not IGS1-F, is recognized and degraded by TRAMP4 and the exosome. Expression of a catalytically inactive form of Trf4 showed that its poly(A) polymerase activity is not required for degradation of IGS1-R. The catalytic activity of Trf4 was also dispensable for degradation of <italic>HSP104</italic> mRNA in THO complex mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Rougemaille <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), but was required for degradation of hypomethylated tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Vanacova <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). This suggests that polyadenylation aids degradation of structured substrates, but is dispensable on less structured RNAs. The 3&#x02032; ends of the IGS1-R transcripts are polyadenylated by the canonical poly(A) polymerase Pap1, and are very heterogeneous. We speculate that this heterogeneity may result in part from termination by collision with oncoming RNA polymerase I molecules.</p><p>ChIP analyses showed that Trf4 could be crosslinked to the rDNA over the IGS1-R region, but not over IGS1-F. This association is largely dependent on functional RNA Pol II, since it was substantially reduced in an <italic>rpb1-1</italic> mutant strain at non-permissive temperature. We therefore propose that Trf4 is recruited co-transcriptionally to the nascent IGS1-R transcripts. The IGS1-R region contains multiple predicted binding sites for the RNA-binding proteins Nab3 and Nrd1, which were previously reported to act as cofactors for the exosome in RNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Vasiljeva and Buratowski, 2006</xref>). Consistent with this, degradation of IGS1-R was strongly inhibited by a mutation in Nrd1, indicating the involvement of the Nrd1/Nab3 heterodimer in recruiting the TRAMP and/or exosome complexes. Since Nrd1/Nab3 also function in transcription termination by RNA Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Arigo <italic>et al</italic>, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Thiebaut <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), they clearly have the potential to bind co-transcriptionally to nascent transcripts. We saw no evidence for effects of mutations in Nrd1 or Nab3 on termination of the IGS1-R transcript, but we predict that they act to recruit the TRAMP complex to nascent IGS1-R transcripts.</p><p>Co-transcriptional binding of Nrd1&#x02013;Nab3 and Trf4 may be an important factor in the very rapid degradation that makes many transcripts from yeast and other eukaryotes &#x02018;cryptic'. The exosome cannot degrade co-transcriptionally, since it requires a free 3&#x02032; end, but it appears that the IGS1-R transcripts are already targeted during transcription, potentially allowing their immediate degradation when the transcript is released from the polymerase.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Links between Trf4 and rDNA copy number regulation</title><p>Strains carrying <italic>trf4</italic>&#x00394; displayed sporadic alterations in copy number.

Deletion of exosome component Rrp6 in <italic>top1</italic>&#x00394; reduced the hyper-recombination phenotype, indicating that Rrp6 is also required for normal rDNA stability.</p><p>The cohesin complex is believed to hold sister chromatids together in the rDNA, so that recombination does not lead to alterations in copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Huang <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). However, loss of Trf4 did not detectably affect cohesin binding over IGS1 and IGS2. Changes in rDNA recombination rate without alteration of cohesin association were previously observed in mutants of Lrs4/Csm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Huang <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Together the data are consistent with the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref>. Transcription of IGS1-F through the CAR located in IGS2, or the balance between transcription of IGS1-F and IGS2-R may play important roles in cohesin displacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Kobayashi and Ganley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). However, we predict that IGS1-R has a distinct function, which is important for rDNA stability, although its exact nature remains unclear. Trf4 and other factors binding to the nascent IGS1-R transcript may enhance rDNA stability at the site of transcription, possibly by promoting the repair of DNA damage. Alternatively, IGS1-R transcripts that escape degradation might exert a dominant negative effect on rDNA repair or recombination at other sites, and these models are not mutually exclusive. The ChIP data showing co-transcriptional recruitment of Trf4 would be consistent with association of the TRAMP complex with the rDNA at the site of transcription via IGS1-R. Rrp6 retains mRNAs with aberrant 3&#x02032; ends close to the site of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hilleren <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>), and it is conceivable that IGS1-R, which shows high 3&#x02032; heterogeneity, could also be linked to the transcription site by Rrp6.</p><p>The IGS1-R transcript passes through the RFB, a key region for rDNA copy number regulation. Replication forks emanate from replication origins (termed ARS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) in each rDNA repeat, but forks moving against the direction of pre-rRNA transcription are stalled at the RFB, presumably to reduce collision with RNA Pol I. Top1 binding sites flank the RFB and are required to relieve DNA supercoiling generated by the high Pol I transcriptional rate. We speculate that the lack of Top1 activity leads to DNA damage over RFB regions carrying stalled DNA replication forks. Strains lacking Sir2 should not have excessive supercoiling at the RFB, but will have more stalled replication forks in this region due to increased activation of rDNA replication origins when Sir2 is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Pasero <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><p>There are a number of potential links between the exosome and its cofactors and the repair of DNA damage in yeast. Strains lacking Trf4 are hypersensitive to DNA cleavage induced by the Top I inhibitor camptothecin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Walowsky <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). This was also the case for <italic>air1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>air2</italic>&#x00394; double-mutant strains (our unpublished observations), showing this phenotype to be TRAMP-related. Strains lacking Trf4 were also reported to be hypersensitive to DNA damage caused by treatment with the alkylating agent MMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Walowsky <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). In addition, the nuclear exosome components Rrp6 and cofactor Rrp47/Lrp1/C1D are implicated in the repair of UV-induced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Hieronymus <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), and <italic>rrp47</italic>&#x00394; strains are defective in both non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Erdemir <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). We speculate that the TRAMP and exosome complexes also play a role in the repair of DNA damage at the RFB. Increased histone mRNA levels leading to defects in DNA metabolism have recently been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Reis and Campbell, 2006</xref>); however, this was not found to be the case for a <italic>trf4</italic>&#x00394; single mutant, and we have also not observed this in our strains (data not shown).</p><p>Recombination events are frequent in <italic>top1</italic>&#x00394; mutants but rare in <italic>trf4</italic>&#x00394;. We predict that recombination-based repair is infrequent in <italic>trf4</italic>&#x00394; strains due to the action of Top1 in removing supercoils and preventing DNA damage. This may explain the low penetrance of the repeat number change phenotype in <italic>trf4</italic>&#x00394;, with events altering repeat number occurring only once in many generations. Notably, however, some <italic>trf4</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>air1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>air2</italic>&#x00394; samples contained two populations with discrete rDNA lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref> and data not shown), suggesting that a recombination event had occurred during early growth of the culture. The <italic>top1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>trf4</italic>&#x00394; strains are predicted to undergo frequent rDNA damage repair by recombination. However, the repeat tract collapses as these events are biased toward contraction, being based on strand invasion rather than homologous recombination.</p><p>Degradation of the IGS1-R transcript resembles that of the CUTs, which account for a significant proportion of the genome of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.

A DNA replication fork is shown blocked at the RFB. Transcription of IGS1-F and IGS2-R may concentrate cohesin at the CAR. This would potentially resemble the role of RNA Pol II in concentrating cohesin to other sites of convergent transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Lengronne <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Alterations in the level or balance of IGS1-F and IGS2-R may also be responsible for regulated cohesin displacement, allowing misalignment of sister chromatids and alterations in repeat number. The high rate of pre-rRNA transcription and attendant DNA supercoiling may lead to DNA damage, particularly at the DNA replication fork stalled at the RFB, when Top1 is absent. The IGS1-R transcript is proposed to recruit Nrd1 and Nab3, which generally function together with the Sen1 RNA helicase. These factors may stimulate co-transcriptional association of the TRAMP complex and the exosome with the IGS1-R transcript. Interactions between TRAMP, the exosome and the RFB region of the rDNA, via the IGS1-R transcript, are envisaged to alter the chromatin structure and/or promote DNA repair (see Discussion).</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="7601921f8"/></fig></floats-wrap></article>
