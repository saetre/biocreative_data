The DNA replication- or DNA repair-coupled nucleosome assembly pathways are important for maintenance of transcriptional gene silencing and genome stability. However, how these pathways are regulated is not well understood. Here we report an interaction between the Elongator histone acetyltransferase and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Cells lacking Elp3 (K-acetyltransferase Kat9), the catalytic subunit of the six-subunit Elongator complex, partially lose silencing of reporter genes at the chromosome VIIL telomere and at the <italic>HMR</italic> locus, and are sensitive to the DNA replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) and the damaging agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Like deletion of the <italic>ELP3</italic>, mutation of each of the four other subunits of the Elongator complex as well as mutations in Elp3 that compromise the formation of the Elongator complex also result in loss of silencing and increased HU sensitivity. Moreover, Elp3 is required for S-phase progression in the presence of HU. Epistasis analysis indicates that the <italic>elp3</italic>&#x00394; mutant, which itself is sensitive to MMS, exacerbates the MMS sensitivity of cells lacking histone chaperones Asf1, CAF-1 and the H3 lysine 56 acetyltransferase Rtt109. The <italic>elp3</italic>&#x00394; mutant has allele specific genetic interactions with mutations in <italic>POL30</italic> that encodes PCNA and PCNA binds to the Elongator complex both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Together, these results uncover a novel role for the intact Elongator complex in transcriptional silencing and maintenance of genome stability, and it does so in a pathway linked to the DNA replication and DNA repair protein PCNA.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>During S phase of the cell cycle, not only must DNA sequences be faithfully duplicated, chromatin structures must also be inherited into daughter cells to maintain gene expression states and cell identity. While significant progress has been made in understanding the regulation of DNA replication, how chromatin structures are maintained from one cell division cycle to the next (so-called epigenetic inheritance) is only partially understood. It is believed that the DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly process plays an important role in such inheritance as well as maintenance of genome stability. In this process, histone chaperones such as chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) deposit newly synthesized histones H3&#x02013;H4, which are acetylated at specific lysine residues, onto replicating DNA in a PCNA dependent reaction. PCNA is a clamp for DNA polymerases and other proteins that are involved in DNA replication and DNA repair. Genetic interactions between lysine acetyltransferase Elp3 and factors involved in DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly are described. Elp3 is required for transcriptional silencing and for maintenance of genome stability and binds directly to PCNA. A role for the Elongator complex in response to DNA damage and in maintenance of gene silencing is discussed.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromatin, an organized complex of proteins and DNA in eukaryotic cells, is regulated by diverse means to govern cellular processes including gene transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair. For instance, histones that form the core components of nucleosomes, the basic building block of chromatin, are modified post-translationally by acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Distinct modifications of histones can either alter chromatin structure and/or recruit proteins to chromatin to impact a specific cellular process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Zhang1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Kouzarides1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, histone chaperones facilitate DNA replication and gene transcription processes by binding to histones for nucleosome assembly and/or disassembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Groth1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, chromatin can be remodeled by ATP dependent chromatin remodeling machines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Li1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Emerging evidence suggests that histone modifications, nucleosome assembly and chromatin remodeling coordinate to regulate chromatin structures during gene transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair and other cellular processes.</p><p>Elp3 is the catalytic subunit of the Elongator histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that was originally purified as a component preferentially associating with hyperphosphorylated forms of RNA polymerase II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Wittschieben1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The <italic>ELP</italic> genes were also identified as the target of zymocin, a three-subunit toxin complex secreted by <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis</italic> that inhibits cell cycle progression of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Frohloff1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Elp3 forms a stable complex with five other polypetides called Elp1, Elp2, Elp4, Elp5 and Elp6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Krogan1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, and contains two domains. The C-terminal domain of Elp3 is similar to the catalytic domain of the Gcn5 HAT and the purified Elp3 complexes have acetyltransferase activities for free and nucleosomal histones H3 and H4, with lysine 14 of H3 and lysine 8 of H4 as the prime targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Winkler1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Elp3 has been named Kat9 K-acetyltransferase to conform with recent acetyltransferase nomenclature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Allis1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Elp3 also contains a region that bears sequence similarity to the catalytic domain of Radical SAM enzymes. Indeed, the corresponding domain of <italic>M. jannaschii</italic> Elp3 binds S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) <italic>in vitro</italic> and contains an iron-sulphur cluster, two characteristics of Radical SAM enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Paraskevopoulou1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The function of this motif, however, is not known.</p><p>Elp3 is localized predominantly in the cytosol suggesting that the Elongator complex has functions other than transcription elongation. Budding yeast cells lacking Elp3 exhibit severe growth defects in the absence of Gcn5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Kristjuhan1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, the catalytic subunit of the SAGA and ADA histone acetyltransferases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Li1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Grant1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Silent information regulator proteins (Sir) that are structural components of heterochromatin in budding yeast are found within euchromatin in cells lacking both Elp3 and Gcn5, suggesting that hypoacetylation of histones affects the integrity of telomeric chromatin in the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Kristjuhan1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it is not clear whether Elp3 is also important for silencing at other silent chromatin loci such as the two silent mating type loci, <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic>. In addition, the Elongator complex has been shown to be required for wobble uridine tRNA modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Huang1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, the mammalian Elongator complex was shown to acetylate &#x003b1;-tubulin and stabilize microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Creppe1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, the Elongator has been implicated in regulation of polarized exocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Rahl1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. These results indicate that the conserved Elongator complex functions in multiple cellular processes.</p><p>Histone chaperones are a group of proteins that bind histones and promote nucleosome assembly during DNA replication, DNA repair and gene transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Groth1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The classical histone chaperone involved in DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly is Chromatin Assembly Factor 1 (CAF-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Stillman1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Smith1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. CAF-1 deposits newly synthesized histone H3&#x02013;H4 onto replicating DNA to promote nucleosome formation. The ability of CAF-1 to deposit histones preferentially onto replicating DNA is mediated through the physical interactions between CAF-1 and the Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Moggs1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Shibahara1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. PCNA is a protein clamp that is loaded onto DNA at the replication fork or at sites of DNA repair by an ATPase called RFC (Replication Factor C) and interacts with many proteins involved in DNA replication and DNA repair, including the replicative DNA polymerases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Waga1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to CAF-1 and PCNA, Asf1, first identified as a factor disrupting heterochromatin silencing when over-expressed in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Le1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, is also involved in DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Tyler1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Krawitz1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent studies indicate that the ability of Asf1 to promote replication-coupled nucleosome assembly is mediated through its ability to regulate acetylation of lysine 56 of H3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Chen1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Li2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Lysine 56 on H3 is localized at DNA entry and exit points of a nucleosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Ozdemir1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Acetylation of this lysine residue is catalyzed by histone acetyltransferase Rtt109 (Kat11) and is dependent on the presence of Asf1 in yeast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Han1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Driscoll1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, this modification increases the binding of H3 with CAF-1 and subsequent assembly of new H3&#x02013;H4 onto replicating DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Li2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, Asf1 and CAF-1 cooperate to assemble specifically modified histones during DNA synthesis.</p><p>In yeast cells, factors such as CAF-1, Asf1 and PCNA that are known to be involved in DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly are required for both transcriptional gene silencing as well as maintenance of genome integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Le1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Tyler1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Kaufman1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Tyler2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. For instance, mutations in CAF-1, Asf1 or PCNA result in partial loss of transcriptional silencing and increased sensitivity towards DNA damaging agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Tyler1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Linger1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Zhang2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicate that the roles of Asf1 in transcriptional silencing and maintenance of genome stability are separable. For instance, the function of Asf1 in transcriptional silencing is linked to its interaction with Hir1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Sharp1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, a histone chaperone that is involved in DNA replication-independent nucleosome assembly. On the other hand, recent studies have shown that the ability of Asf1 to maintain genome stability is mediated mainly through Asf1's role in regulating acetylation of lysine 56 of H3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Han1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Tsubota1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Recht1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Driscoll1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Celic1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover different PCNA mutant alleles exhibit distinct effects on transcriptional silencing and sensitivity to DNA damaging agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Zhang2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is possible that the functions of CAF-1 and PCNA in transcriptional silencing and maintenance of genome stability are also mediated through their interactions with different partners or pathways.</p><p>In both yeast and human cells CAF-1 binds histones H3/H4 in which histone H4 is acetylated on lysine residues 5, 8 and 12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Verreault1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Zhou1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Acetylation of lysine residues 5 (H4K5) and 12 (H4K12) of H4 is catalyzed by the Hat1 histone acetyltransferase; the HAT responsible for acetylation of lysine 8 (H4K8) is not known although Elongator can acetylate H4K8 and histone H3 lysine 14 <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Winkler1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, Asf1 has been shown to co-purify with Hat1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Fillingham1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to Hat1, CAF-1 and Asf1 interact with Sas2 physically and genetically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Meijsing1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Osada1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Sas2, the catalytic subunit of SAS histone acetyltransferase, acetylates lysine 16 of H4 and is involved in silencing at telomere and the <italic>HM</italic> loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-EhrenhoferMurray1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Sutton1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the functions of these interactions are not clear. Thus, factors involved in DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly pathway also interact with multiple HATs. In this report, we describe genetic and biochemical interactions between Elp3 and factors involved in nucleosome assembly pathways and DNA replication and repair. Cells lacking Elp3 are defective in transcriptional silencing and are sensitive to DNA damaging agents including hydroxyurea and MMS, two phenotypes shared by cells containing mutations in genes known to be involved in DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly. Moreover, we have shown that mutations at the SAM binding module of Elp3 abolish its interactions with Elp2 and subsequent formation of an intact Elongator complex. Biochemical analysis suggests that Elp3 is one of the HATs responsible for acetylating H4K8 <italic>in vivo</italic> and genetic analysis shows interactions between Elp3 and proteins involved in replication-coupled nucleosome assembly. Lastly, the Elongator complex physically interacts with PCNA. These results reveal a novel role of the Elongator in maintenance of genome stability.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cells lacking Elp3 are partially defective in transcriptional silencing at both telomeres and the <italic>HMR</italic> locus and are sensitive to DNA damaging agents</title><p>Cells lacking Elp3 and Gcn5 are synthetic lethal.

Cells lacking each of the five subunits exhibited similar defects in telomeric silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000684-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).

A similar degree of silencing defects and sensitivity towards DNA damaging agents were observed when other Elongator subunit genes were deleted. The results suggest that an intact Elongator complex is required for efficient transcriptional silencing and an optimal DNA damage response. Supporting this idea, we have shown that mutations within the radical SAM domain of Elp3 compromise formation of the Elongator complex and exhibit the same phenotypes as found for the <italic>elp3</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells. Moreover, the <italic>elp3</italic>&#x00394; mutant enhances the HU and MMS DNA damage sensitivity of <italic>asf1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rtt109</italic>&#x00394; deletions and the <italic>H3K56R</italic> mutation and enhances the sensitivity of <italic>cac1</italic>&#x00394; mutant in the presence of MMS. We suggest, therefore, that Elongator functions in a pathway in parallel to the <italic>CAF-1</italic> and <italic>ASF1</italic> chromatin assembly processes.</p><p>The Elongator complex interacted directly with PCNA, a protein that also interacts with CAF-1 and facilitates the link between nucleosome assembly and DNA synthesis, either in S phase or during DNA repair. However, we could not detect a single complex containing CAF-1, PCNA and Elongator, suggesting that Elongator and PCNA form a separate complex that functions independently from the CAF-1-PCNA complex. This conclusion is supported by genetic data that shows that the <italic>pol30-8</italic> mutation, which is defective in binding CAF-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Zhang2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, displays synthetic defects when combined with <italic>elp3</italic>&#x00394; in the presence of MMS. Together, these results reveal a new function for Elp3 in maintaining genome stability and suggest that Elp3 functions in this process through a pathway genetically and physically linked to PCNA.</p><p>We reported here that the <italic>elp3</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells are highly sensitive to HU, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) that reduces dNTP pools and thereby prevents the firing of late replication origins and slows down DNA synthesis from early origins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Tercero1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Alvino1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. HU also activates the checkpoint kinase Rad53, which in turn leads to induction of RNR gene expression. Because the Elongator complex is best known for its function in transcription elongation, it is possible that HU sensitivity of the <italic>elp3</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells is due to altered expression of <italic>RNR</italic> genes or other genes involved in the checkpoint response, however, microarray analysis of mRNA levels indicate that the expression of <italic>RNR</italic> genes is not affected in the <italic>elp3</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Krogan1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, the expression of <italic>RNR1</italic> and <italic>RNR3</italic> genes was induced by HU in the <italic>elp3</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells to a similar level as that of wild type cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the HU sensitivity of the <italic>elp3</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells is likely not due to defects in a transcriptional response to checkpoint activation. Instead, we suggest that sensitivity towards HU and other DNA damaging agents including MMS displayed by the <italic>elp3</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells arise from a defect in a process that involves PCNA and cooperates with ASF1 and CAF-1 dependent DNA replication- or DNA repair-coupled nucleosome assembly. Supporting this idea, we have shown that the <italic>elp3</italic>&#x00394; mutation genetically interacts with mutations at lysine 56 of H3 as well as lysine residues 5 and 12 of histone H4 in the response to HU. Moreover, low concentrations of HU slow down S phase progression of the <italic>elp3</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells significantly more than wild type cells. Lastly, genome wide studies reveal that the <italic>elp3</italic> mutant exhibits a synthetically lethal/slow growth phenotype with a mutation in <italic>RFC4</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Collins1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>.

First, it is possible that the defects displayed by the <italic>elp3</italic>&#x00394; mutant are due to altered expression of genes such as PCNA, CAF-1 and Asf1 involved in nucleosome assembly. This is not likely since microarray analysis indicates the expression of the genes known to be involved in DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly pathway are not affected in cells without Elongator complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Krogan1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, the Elongator complex may acetylate newly synthesized histones before deposition onto replicating DNA. Supporting this idea, the Elongator complex is mostly localized in the cytosol and one of the preferential lysine residues acetylated by the Elongator complex is lysine 8 of histone H4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Winkler1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Epistasis analysis indicates that the <italic>elp3</italic>&#x00394; mutation when combined with mutations at lysine 8 of H4 exhibited a phenotype similar to the phenotype observed for the <italic>elp3</italic>&#x00394; mutation and the level of H4K8Ac was partially reduced in the <italic>elp3</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells. Curiously, acetylation of lysine residues 5, 8 and 12 of H4 is present on H4 co-purified with CAF-1 from both yeast and mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Verreault1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Zhou1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is possible that the Elp3 containing complex may be one of the enzymes that acetylates lysine 8 of H4 and that this modified histone ends up complexed with CAF-1 for deposition during DNA synthesis. However, we noticed that cells lacking Elp3 were sensitive to HU and mutations at lysine 8 of H4 did not show increased HU sensitivity compared to wild type cells, suggesting that the HU sensitivity of the Elp3 mutant cells is not likely due to a loss of acetylation of lysine 8 of H4.</p><p>A third possible model derives from our observation that PCNA interacts with the Elongator complex, implying a nuclear function for Elongator complex that is coupled to DNA synthesis and nucleosome assembly. It is possible that the Elongator complex travels with PCNA during DNA replication to modulate chromatin structure and/or proteins involved in DNA replication to ensure that DNA synthesis is coupled to nucleosome assembly during S phase of the cell cycle. The finding that deletion of both <italic>GCN5</italic> and <italic>ELP3</italic> is synthetically lethal and that the lethality can be suppressed by deletion of either <italic>SIR1</italic>, <italic>SIR3</italic> or <italic>SIR4</italic> suggests that in the absence of the two acetyltransferases, cellular chromatin becomes hypo-acetylated and Sir proteins spread to euchromatin and inhibit genes that are normally not silenced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Kristjuhan1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. We suggest that the lethality in <italic>elp3&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> strains is due to inappropriate assembly of normal chromatin during DNA replication that leads to secondary effects that cause lethality, such as gene expression defects. In the absence of the Elongator complex alone, some hypo-acetylation of histones likely occurs, thereby compromising chromatin assembly, but this is not sufficient to kill the cells. The defect in <italic>elp3&#x00394;</italic> cells is only revealed when DNA damage is induced, suggesting that DNA damage creates a condition where the Elongator mediated function related to chromatin assembly is more important, possibly as a result of its interaction with PCNA. This model is consistent with our observation that in the absence of Elongator and Asf1 or Rtt109, the chromatin assembly defect is enhanced, even in cells where DNA damage is not externally induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000684-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, simultaneous depletion of Elongator and CAF-1 does not compromise the growth of cells, but in the presence of 0.01&#x00025; MMS, <italic>elp3</italic>&#x00394; <italic>cac1</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells display synthetic defects. Thus, redundancy of chromatin assembly mechanisms and acetyltransferases ensures that robust chromatin assembly occurs during S phase and during DNA repair.</p><p>In addition to the Elongator complex, three other histone acetyltransferases are known to interact with factors involved in DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly.

However, the functional significance of this interaction remains unclear as it appears that acetylation of lysine 16 of H4 at telomeric heterochromatin is normal in cells lacking CAF-1 and Asf1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Huang3">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, it has been shown recently that Hat1 binds to Asf1 in yeast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Fillingham1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Hat1 forms a complex with Hat2 and Hif1 and acetylates lysine 5 and 12 of H4 in yeast and mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Kleff1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Verreault2">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>. Third, Asf1 regulates acetylation of H3 lysine 56 by presenting H3&#x02013;H4 to Rtt109-Vps75 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Han1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Han2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Collins1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref> thereby directly regulating the binding of H3 with two other histone chaperones CAF-1 and Rtt106 and subsequent nucleosome assembly during S phase of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Li2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, there are multiple histone acetyltransferases that function directly or indirectly during the DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly process in budding yeast. Why then are several histone acetyltransferases involved in this process? It is known that acetylation of H3 lysine 56 by Rtt109 and H4 lysine 5 and 12 are present on newly-synthesized histones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Masumoto1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Sobel1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, acetylation of these lysine residues is likely to facilitate deposition of new H3&#x02013;H4 onto replicating DNA for <italic>de novo</italic> nucleosome assembly. In addition to new H3&#x02013;H4, parental histones must be transferred to replicating DNA during S phase, a process that is poorly understood. It has been suggested recently that Asf1 can disrupt parental nucleosomes following DNA replication in human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Groth3">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>. It is possible some of these HATs are also involved in acetylation of parental histones to facilitate nucleosome remodeling and subsequent transfer of parental histones onto replicating DNA. Supporting this idea, it has been shown that PCNA interacts with lysine acetyltransferase p300 in human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Hasan1">&#x0005b;71&#x0005d;</xref>. It is proposed that the PCNA-p300 interaction facilitates chromatin remodeling at the DNA damage sites by p300 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Hasan1">&#x0005b;71&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is possible that PCNA may also recruit the Elongator complex to modulate chromatin structure during DNA replication or in response to DNA damage.</p><p>The acetylation patterns of new-synthesized H4 is conserved from yeast to human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Sobel1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, it has been shown that H3K56Ac is also present in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Das1">&#x0005b;72&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Tjeertes1">&#x0005b;75&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, H3K56Ac likely has a function in replication-coupled nucleosome assembly and maintenance of genome stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Das1">&#x0005b;72&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000684-Yuan1">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, replication-coupled nucleosome assembly in higher eukaryotic cells is also likely regulated by multiple acetylation events catalyzed by different HATs. The future challenge will be to determine whether other histone acetyltransferases and/or other histone modifying enzymes also play a role in the regulation of the DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly process and study how these histone modifications are coupled to chromatin assembly at the DNA replication fork and how they influence the inheritance of states of gene expression and maintenance of genome stability in yeast and mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Yeast strains</title><p>All yeast strains used in this study were derived from the parental W303 background (<italic>leu2-3,112, ura3-1, his3-11, trp1-1, ade2-1, can 1-100</italic>) and were listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000684.s006">Table S2</xref>.
