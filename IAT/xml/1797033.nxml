The zinc-finger GATA3 transcription factor has been reported to be involved in the growth control and differentiation of breast epithelial cells. In SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) studies we observed an intriguing significant correlation between <italic>GATA3 </italic>and <italic>MUC1 </italic>mRNA expression in breast carcinomas.

In addition, we detected a statistically significant correlation in expression between <italic>GATA3 </italic>and <italic>MUC1 </italic>genes at the mRNA and protein levels both in normal breast epithelium and in breast carcinomas (<italic>p </italic>= 0.01).

GATA factors are classified into two subfamilies on the basis of structural features and expression patterns. The expression of <italic>GATA1</italic>, <italic>GATA2</italic>, and <italic>GATA3 </italic>has been detected predominantly in hematopoietic cells, whereas <italic>GATA4</italic>, <italic>GATA5</italic>, and <italic>GATA6 </italic>are expressed mainly in the cardiovascular system and in endodermal-derived tissues including liver, lung, pancreas, and intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The function of GATA factors is modulated by their interaction with other transcription factors, transcriptional coactivators and co-repressors.</p><p>In genome-wide expression profile studies from our laboratory we observed that the expression of <italic>GATA3 </italic>is highly correlated with estrogen receptor-&#x003b1; (ER&#x003b1;) status in breast carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] similar results were reported by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Parikh and colleagues (2005) suggested that GATA3 expression might be associated with responsiveness to hormone therapy in breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, the expression of <italic>GATA3 </italic>has been shown to correlate with specific breast cancer phenotypes, defined as luminal type A, carrying an improved disease-free survival and overall survival when compared with tumors that do not express <italic>GATA3 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It has been reported that GATA3 may be involved in growth control and differentiation in breast epithelial cells mediating the transcriptional activation of several genes such as those encoding cytokeratins 5, 6 and 17, and trefoil factors 1 and 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Recent evidence indicates that the proteins GATA4, GATA5, and GATA6 may be important in the upregulation of mucin expression (<italic>MUC2</italic>, <italic>MUC3</italic>, and <italic>MUC4</italic>) and trefoil factor genes (<italic>TFF1 </italic>and <italic>TFF2</italic>), events that are in turn associated with gastrointestinal epithelial cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The MUC1 glycoprotein is a member of the mucin family of proteins, expressed mostly on the apical membrane of various glandular epithelia such as in luminal breast epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The association of <italic>MUC1 </italic>overexpression with loss of cell polarity has been observed in breast carcinomas. Abnormal <italic>MUC1 </italic>expression leads to a loss of cell&#x02013;cell and cell&#x02013;extracellular-matrix adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It was further determined that this increase in <italic>MUC1 </italic>expression is due mainly to transcriptional regulatory events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The 5'-regulatory region of the human <italic>MUC1 </italic>gene was analyzed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Several consensus binding sites for transcription factors were observed in this promoter region, such as those for the SP1, STAT1, STAT3, NF-&#x003ba;B, MZF1 and DbpA proteins, all of which may be involved in the transcriptional regulation of <italic>MUC1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, the factors determining <italic>MUC1 </italic>tissue-specific expression remain largely unknown, as do the mechanisms causing <italic>MUC1 </italic>overexpression in tumors.</p><p>Global gene expression studies pointed to a significant correlation in the overexpression of <italic>GATA3 </italic>and <italic>MUC1 </italic>genes commonly observed in breast cancer. Interestingly, we also observed the presence of multiple putative GATA-binding sites throughout the <italic>MUC1 </italic>promoter. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of GATA3 as a putative transcriptional regulator of <italic>MUC1 </italic>in breast cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Serial analysis of gene expression database mining</title><p>To perform a comparative analysis of the GATA family members expressed in breast tissue, we analyzed 47 breast SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) libraries: 4 normal breast epithelium, 8 ductal carcinoma <italic>in situ </italic>(DCIS), 33 invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs), and the MCF7 and ZR75 breast cancer cell lines. To this end, we combined 29 breast cancer SAGE libraries generated by us at a resolution of 100,000 tags per library (Aldaz Laboratory) with 18 SAGE libraries (generated at the Polyak Laboratory, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA) downloaded from the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project &#x02013; SAGE Genie database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

To enable the visualization and illustration of our analyses, we used the TIGR MultiExperiment Viewer (MeV 2.2) software (The Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, MD, USA). This tool was employed for normalization and average clustering of the SAGE data. Spearman's test was employed for a correlation analysis of transcripts. The CGAP-dbEST and Oncomine databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] were employed for collection and visualization of gene expression profiles of the previously mentioned transcripts from publicly available breast cancer ESTs and microarray data sets (Additional file 1).</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time RT-PCR expression analysis in breast carcinomas</title><p>For validation studies, total RNA was isolated from an independent set of 36 snap-frozen breast carcinomas (stages I and II: 13 ER&#x003b1;-negative tumors and 23 ER&#x003b1;-positive tumors) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, San Francisco, CA, USA).

We analyzed a total of 263 cases (38 normal tissues (19 DCIS and 206 IDCs). Information on ER and progesterone receptor (PR) status was available for all IDC cases. Before immunostaining, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in water for 10 minutes. Heat-induced epitope retrieve was performed with 1.0 mM EDTA buffer pH 8.0 for 10 minutes in a microwave oven followed by cooling for 20 minutes. To block non-specific antibody binding, the slides were incubated with 10% goat serum in PBS for 30 minutes. Primary monoclonal anti-GATA3 (HG3-31: SC-268; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and anti-MUC1 (VU4H5: SC-7313; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies were used at 1:50 and 1:100 dilutions respectively. Antibody detection was performed using diaminobenzidine (DAB). Staining intensity was determined by means of a Chromavision Automated Cellular Imaging System (ACIS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) with the generic DAB software application, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].

The MCF7 breast cancer cell line displayed the highest <italic>GATA3 </italic>expression level observed.

It is interesting to note that GATA3 and MUC1 protein expression are positively correlated among normal breast samples as well as in breast carcinomas (&#x003c4;<sub>b </sub>= 0.44; <italic>p </italic>= 0.01). Additionally, <italic>MUC1 </italic>expression was correlated with lymph node-positive status in breast carcinomas (&#x003c4;<sub>b </sub>= 0.46; <italic>p </italic>= 0.006).

These sites encode the conserved consensus sequence required for the binding of GATA factors. To determine whether GATA3 is capable of binding the -2398/-2393 sequence <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay with nuclear extracts obtained from the MCF7 breast cancer cell line. In brief, protein&#x02013;DNA complexes were crosslinked <italic>in vivo</italic>, sonicated and then immunoprecipitated with anti-GATA3 monoclonal antibodies. DNA samples were obtained from three fractions: input, non-specific eluted, and immunoprecipitated. These DNA samples were subjected to PCR with two sets of primers that flanked the predicted GATA3-binding site (-2398/-2393) and the putative GATA1-binding site (-446/-451) in the <italic>MUC1 </italic>promoter region.</p><p>In addition, we employed a set of primers spanning the second exon of the <italic>HLA-DQA1 </italic>gene (242 bp), used as negative control because there are no GATA-binding motifs in its sequence. The amplified product corresponding to the GATA1-binding site (186 bp) was detected from input DNA and non-specific GATA3-eluted DNA fractions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). However, this GATA1-related amplified product was not detected from the anti-GATA3-immunoprecipitated DNA fraction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>), indicating that the GATA3 protein does not recognize the -446/-451 site from the <italic>MUC1 </italic>promoter region.</p><p>Identical results were obtained for the <italic>HLA-DQA1</italic>-amplified products (negative control), demonstrating the specificity of the ChIP assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). In contrast, the amplified product spanning the GATA3-binding site (292 bp in size) was detected in the input and anti-GATA3-immunoprecipitated DNA fractions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>). These amplified products were detected only in the second immunoprecipitated DNA fraction (reChIP assay; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5e</xref>). Furthermore, we employed an EMSA approach to validate the ChIP findings. Nuclear extract retarded the mobility of the <italic>GATA3 </italic>sequence-specific probe (positive control) and the probe encoding the putative GATA3-binding site (5'-ggcggatctttgatagactggagtgtc-3') found in the wild-type <italic>MUC1 </italic>promoter region (-2398/-2393) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In contrast, electromobility was not affected when a point mutant of the aforementioned <italic>MUC1 </italic>probe (T/CTTA/G instead of the wild-type T/GATA/G) was employed, indicating that no protein binding occurred (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The presence of GATA3 in the retarded probe-protein complex was confirmed by supershift analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>). The addition of anti-GATA3 antibody to the binding reaction showed a further decrease in the mobility of the probe-protein complex. Addition of the control antibody (anti-ER&#x003b2;) had no effect.</p><p>Overall, these data indicate that endogenous GATA3 protein molecules from the MCF7 breast cancer cell line were able to associate with the putative GATA3-binding site of <italic>MUC1 </italic>promoter sequence, as demonstrated with <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>assays.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>GATA3 </italic>anti-sense assay</title><p>To investigate the effect of GATA3 on <italic>MUC1 </italic>gene expression, a <italic>GATA3 </italic>knock-down assay was performed with specific anti-sense oligonucleotides in MCF7 and T47D breast cancer cell lines. Cells were treated with optimal concentrations of <italic>GATA3 </italic>anti-sense oligonucleotides (3 &#x003bc;g/ml) and examined 48 and 72 hours after transfection. Immunoblotting analyses of the cells treated with MCF7 and T47D showed that <italic>GATA3 </italic>translation was blocked by the anti-sense oligonucleotide at both time points analyzed (namely at 48 and 72 hours after transfection; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a</xref>). Treated cells showed a significant decrease in <italic>MUC1 </italic>expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Total protein staining showed that these results were not due to differences in protein loading. The same result was obtained in a separate experiment with a MCF7-cell ELISA assay with a different monoclonal antibody (HMFG1) against MUC1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7b</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Transcriptome profile analyses demonstrated that <italic>GATA3 </italic>expression is strongly correlated with ER&#x003b1; status in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Recently we performed a cross-platform comparison between SAGE and DNA microarray profiles showing that the <italic>ESR1</italic>, <italic>GATA3</italic>, and <italic>MUC1 </italic>genes are very tightly co-expressed in breast carcinomas (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. To validate the relationship of GATA3 and MUC1 in breast tissues further, we performed mRNA expression analyses of 36 invasive breast carcinomas by real-time RT-PCR, and protein expression analysis in 263 breast tissue samples by means of immunohistochemistry on TMAs. Both analyses showed a statistical positive correlation between <italic>GATA3 </italic>and <italic>MUC1 </italic>expression at the mRNA and protein levels (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01; Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). Interestingly, we also detected a positive correlation between GATA3 and MUC1 protein expression when both markers were evaluated in normal breast tissue as well (<italic>p </italic>= 0.001).</p><p>Two recent studies from gastrointestinal epithelial cells indicated that GATA family members (GATA4 and GATA5) may have pivotal roles in the transcriptional upregulation of three mucin genes: <italic>MUC2</italic>, <italic>MUC3</italic>, and <italic>MUC4 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These data led us to infer that GATA3 might have a role in the transcriptional upregulation of <italic>MUC1 </italic>in breast epithelium.</p><p>To determine whether GATA3 protein was actively bound to the predicted consensus <italic>MUC1 </italic>promoter sequence (at -2398/-2393 from the transcriptional start site (TSS)) <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro</italic>, we performed ChIP and gel shift analyses in breast cancer cells. The ChIP assay in MCF7 demonstrated the existence of a functional GATA3 binding site within the <italic>MUC1 </italic>promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The EMSA studies further validated ChIP data (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Having found that GATA3 transcription factor efficiently recognizes a sequence motif in the distal portion of the <italic>MUC1 </italic>promoter, we proceeded to analyze the effects of GATA3 suppression on MUC1 protein expression in transiently transfected MCF7 cells. <italic>GATA3 </italic>knockdown assays led to a significant decrease in MUC1 protein expression in MCF7 breast cancer cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), strongly suggesting an involvement of GATA3 in the modulation of <italic>MUC1 </italic>expression.</p><p>The <italic>MUC1 </italic>promoter sequence has been analyzed previously for its ability to direct the expression of a reporter gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The construct (including 2.9 kb of MUC1 5'-flanking region) showed high expression levels in ZR75 cells but surprisingly low levels in MCF7 and T47D cell lines. This study showed that tissue-specific expression of a reporter gene could be obtained with only 743 bp of 5' sequences of the <italic>MUC1 </italic>gene, using the ZR75 cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, the binding of GATA3 to the promoter regions of target genes generate an open chromatin configuration that increases the accessibility to other main transcriptional regulators (perhaps STAT) in the vicinity of the TSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These data, together with the fact that <italic>GATA3 </italic>knock-down expression did not immediately abolish <italic>MUC1 </italic>expression, suggest that GATA3 is partly required to drive <italic>MUC1 </italic>expression. The finding that <italic>GATA3 </italic>and <italic>MUC1 </italic>expression were correlated in SAGE, real-time RT-PCR and TMA immunohistochemistry analyses shows statistical significance. It is also apparently a set of breast carcinomas in which there was no direct correlation between levels of <italic>GATA3 </italic>and <italic>MUC1 </italic>expression. This suggests that GATA3 may contribute to <italic>MUC1 </italic>upregulation in a subset of breast cancer cells (namely ER&#x003b1;-positive breast carcinoma).</p><p>The role of GATA3 as a transcriptional upregulator of <italic>MUC1 </italic>could be directly via a <italic>cis</italic>-acting interaction and/or indirectly via cross-talk between GATA3 and <italic>MUC1 </italic>co-activators such as ER&#x003b1;/SP1, STAT or FOG (friend-of-GATA cofactors). The transcriptional regulatory event, operating after the binding of GATA3 to the <italic>MUC1 </italic>promoter, remains to be determined. The <italic>MUC1 </italic>promoter contains several <italic>cis</italic>-elements specific for transcription in lymphoid cells such as STAT, MZF1, XBP1, MYB and GATA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The involvement of GATA and STAT proteins in cytokine signaling is well documented in the hematopoietic and lymphoid systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Interestingly, a GATA-STAT synergy has been recently suggested as a general event that could account for cell-specific effects of transcriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The presence of these elements, which can upmodulate gene expression in lymphoid cells, are in accord with the observation that the <italic>MUC1 </italic>gene is expressed in activated T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Alternatively, several putative estrogen and progesterone response elements (ERE/PRE) have been identified in the human <italic>MUC1 </italic>promoter by sequence analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Zhou and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] demonstrated that ER does not directly regulate the Muc1 promoter sequence in mice. It is possible that the <italic>MUC1 </italic>gene is transcriptionally regulated by non-ERE-mediated mechanisms, for example those involving ER&#x003b1; binding to a co-activator such as AP1 or SP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. It is interesting to note that two SP1-binding sites have been characterized as important <italic>MUC1 </italic>transcriptional activators in epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Moreover, there are studies demonstrating protein-protein interaction between ER&#x003b1; and GATA1 in erythroid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. ER&#x003b1; binds to the GATA1 protein at two sites, one of which is a zinc-finger domain that is highly conserved among GATA family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, a possible way of explaining <italic>ESR1</italic>, <italic>GATA3</italic>, and <italic>MUC1 </italic>co-expression could very probably involve the formation of a complex between the ER&#x003b1; and GATA3 proteins that results in the upmodulation of <italic>MUC1 </italic>gene expression.</p><p>It has been shown that high expression of <italic>GATA3 </italic>correlates with low tumor grade by <italic>in silico </italic>analysis of cDNA microarray data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. As is known, tumor grade is a good measure of breast cancer progression and differentiation status. In this study we have demonstrated a strong correlation between loss of GATA3 protein expression and more advanced stages of breast cancer progression; that is, high-grade less differentiated breast carcinomas expressed lower levels of GATA3 protein on the basis of immunohistochemical studies (<italic>p </italic>= 0.004). Similarly, Mehra and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] showed that loss of <italic>GATA3 </italic>expression is associated with higher histological grade.</p><p>Our data agree with previously reported studies showing the role of GATA family members in the development and maintenance of a more differentiated state. Interestingly, there is emerging evidence that membrane-associated mucins (MUC1 and MUC4) contribute to the regulation of differentiation, morphogenesis, and proliferation of breast epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Recent data show that a fragment of the MUC1 cytoplasmic tail can be translocated to the nucleus, driving the transcriptional co-activator status of &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. This finding sustains the possibility that GATA3 might influence cell differentiation possibly through processes involving the upregulation of <italic>MUC1 </italic>gene expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings suggest that GATA3 could contribute to the transcriptional upregulation of <italic>MUC1 </italic>gene expression in some breast carcinomas.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>bp = base pairs; ChIP = chromatin immunoprecipitation; DAB = diaminobenzidine; DTT = dithiothreitol; ELISA = enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; EMSA = electrophoretic mobility-shift assay; ER = estrogen receptor; <italic>ESR1 </italic>= gene encoding estrogen receptor &#x003b1;; GATA3 = GATA-binding protein 3; HRP = horseradish peroxidase; IDC = invasive ductal carcinoma; MUC1 = mucin 1; PR = progesterone receptor; RT-PCR = reverse-transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction; SAGE = serial analysis of gene expression; TMA = tissue microarray.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MCA conceived the study idea and carried out the experimental analyses and the biostatistical/bioinformatics analysis and took part in writing the manuscript.
