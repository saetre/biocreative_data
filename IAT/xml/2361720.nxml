As a result, Us9 null mutants are defective in anterograde transmission of infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, it is unclear how Us9 promotes axonal sorting of so many viral proteins. It is known that the glycoproteins gB, gC, gD and gE are associated with lipid raft microdomains on the surface of infected swine kidney cells and monocytes, and are directed into the axon in a Us9-dependent manner. In this report, we determined that Us9 is associated with lipid rafts, and that this association is critical to Us9-mediated sorting of viral structural proteins. We used infected non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line that acquires many of the characteristics of sympathetic neurons in the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF). In these cells, Us9 is highly enriched in detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). Moreover, reducing the affinity of Us9 for lipid rafts inhibited anterograde transmission of infection from sympathetic neurons to epithelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. We conclude that association of Us9 with lipid rafts is key for efficient targeting of structural proteins to axons and, as a consequence, for directional spread of PRV from pre-synaptic to post-synaptic neurons and cells of the mammalian nervous system.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Alpha herpesviruses are common mammalian pathogens (e.g. herpes simplex and chickenpox virus infect humans). These viruses enter and spread in and out of the mammalian nervous system, a defining hallmark of their lifecycle and potential pathogenesis. Neurons are polarized cells, and the movement of certain cellular proteins is highly restricted to the cell body, to dendrites, or to axons. Indeed, the axon harbors only a small subset of neuronal proteins. Thus, it is remarkable that these viruses efficiently gather and move their structural components from the cell body to the axon after infection of neurons. Previously, we identified a small viral membrane protein (known as Us9) that mediates the efficient targeting of virus particles to axons of infected neurons. We now report that Us9 must localize to &#x0201c;lipid raft&#x0201d; domains, specialized regions within cellular membranes to promote axonal targeting. Reducing the affinity of Us9 for lipid rafts dramatically reduces sorting of structural proteins to axons. This is the first report, to our knowledge, to implicate lipid rafts in targeting alpha herpesvirus structural proteins to axons, an essential step for spread of infection in the mammalian nervous system.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons are highly polarized cells with distinct biochemical and functional properties particular to the cell body (soma), dendrites, and the axon. Soluble, cytosolic proteins likely move into axons and dendrites by bulk flow, while membrane proteins are highly restricted to the somatodendritic membrane, the axonal membrane, or within vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Brown1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Sorting of membrane proteins to the somatodendritic or axonal compartments of neurons is similar to the sorting mechanism of membrane proteins either to the basolateral or to the apical membranes of epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Dotti1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Both cell types share a common component for compartmentalization of their membrane milieu: lipid raft microdomains. Rafts often are defined biochemically as detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) or detergent-insoluble glycolipid complexes (DIGs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Edidin1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Rajendran1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. These protein-lipid complexes are highly enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, and float freely within the liquid-disordered state of the lipid bilayer. Furthermore, they are small and dynamic, often ordering themselves into larger, more stable rafts through protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Mayor1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Shaw1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Lipid rafts/DRMs play a key role in the axonal sorting of membrane proteins during neuronal maturation, including axonal growth and guidance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Zheng1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Ledesma et al. showed that two axonally-targeted membrane proteins, Thy-1 and influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), interact with sphingolipid-cholesterol rafts in rat hippocampal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Ledesma2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. These microdomains normally were resistant to detergent treatment at 4&#x000b0;C. However, reducing the levels of cholesterol and sphingolipids resulted in the detergent-solubility of both proteins, as well as aberrant sorting into axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Ledesma2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The increased synthesis of sphingomyelin during neuronal maturation was critical for the formation of protein-lipid complexes, an essential step for the targeting of randomly distributed GM1 ganglioside in immature neurons to the axon of fully mature neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Ledesma1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Alpha herpesviruses (e.g. herpes simplex virus (HSV) and pseudorabies virus (PRV)) replicate and traffic within polarized neurons, a strategy conducive to their lifestyle in the host peripheral nervous system (PNS). Infection begins with virion entry at mucosal surfaces and spread of infection between cells of the mucosal epithelium. The PNS is infected through axon termini innervating this region, and subsequent trafficking of capsids to the cell body. It is here that a reactivatable, latent infection is established that persists for the life of the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Roizman1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. A well known, but poorly understood observation, is that upon reactivation from the latent infection, &#x003b1;-herpesviruses rarely enter the central nervous system despite having what seems to be two rather similar choices: cross one synapse and infect the central nervous system (rare) or traffic back down the axon to the initial peripheral site of infection (very common). Inherent in this choice is the fact that viral proteins must be targeted to axons, a highly specialized neuronal compartment restricted to only a subset of neuronal proteins. The primary problem is to identify the mechanisms that gather and sort the many viral structural proteins to this compartment.</p><p>The Us9 gene product, a small, tail-anchored type II membrane protein, has been of interest in understanding the mechanisms of anterograde transport of alpha herpesviruses in the mammalian nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Brideau1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Tomishima1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

Trypsin inhibitor (1 mg/ml; Sigma Aldrich) was added to neutralize the trypsin for 5 min and then removed and replaced with neuron culture medium (described below). Prior to plating, the ganglia were triturated using a fire-polished Pasteur pipette and then plated in the S compartments of the Teflon ring.

We used a silicone grease-loaded syringe attached to an 18-gauge truncated hypodermic needle to apply a thin, continuous strip of silicone grease over the entire bottom surface of the Teflon ring. Next, a 50-&#x000b5;l drop of neuron medium containing 1&#x00025; methocellulose (serum free) was placed in the center of each tissue culture dish covering the etched grooves. This step prevents the seal from being entirely devoid of moisture, which is needed for axon penetration and growth between the grooves. Finally, the silicone grease-coated ring was gently seated on the tissue culture dish or the surface of the 35-mm dish such that the etched grooves spanned all three compartments, forming a watertight seal between compartments. Neuron medium was then placed in all three compartments immediately after the chamber was assembled. Once the SCG neurons were dissected and dissociated, approximately one half of a single ganglion was plated into the S chamber.

Cell bodies in the S chamber are infected, virus particles sort into axons in a Us9-dependent manner, and subsequently infect the PK15 cells that amplify the infection. The initial infection is confined to the S chamber via silicone vacuum grease and a methocellulose barrier. Therefore, infection spreads to the N chamber solely through axons that emanate from neuronal cell bodies and extend to PK15 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Chng1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Though all of the infections produced a comparable number of infectious virus in the S chamber, spread to second order PK15 cells in the N chamber was dramatically different. PRV Becker spread efficiently from neurons to PK15 cells, producing a median titer of 1.2&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> PFU in the N chamber after 24 hours post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000065-g007">Figure 7C</xref>).

However, in one dish, we detected a low number of infectious particles (1.5&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup>). We interpret a low yield of amplified virus as a single neuron-to-cell spread event (the burst size of an infected PK15 cell is roughly 1000 PFU). Nevertheless, the neuron-to-cell spread capability of PRV 160 is extremely low compared to wild-type PRV Becker. PRV 322 (Us9-TfR) was completely defective in anterograde spread and was indistinguishable from the Us9-null mutant (no infectious virus detected in the N-compartment).

A small number of assembly complexes would bind a sorting adaptor protein(s) and go to axons; the majority of assembly complexes would egress the cell body locally, perhaps at sites where axons contact the infected cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000065-g009">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>What determines whether a vesicle laden with viral structural proteins is directed to the axon as opposed to being released from the cell body? We propose that phosphorylation of Us9, subsequent to its recruitment into lipid rafts, may be the pivotal step. The PRV Us9 acidic domain region is heavily phosphorylated during infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Brideau3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, and is essential for anterograde, transneuronal spread <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Brideau3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Phosphorylation occurs predominantly on two serine residues within the 10-amino-acid acidic domain, and mutating these serines to alanines dramatically decreases anterograde spread in the rat visual system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Brideau3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. This phosphorylation event would occur after Us9 enters the raft, as the acidic cluster domain is not required for raft association of Us9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000065-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). We are currently investigating whether 1) the association of Us9 with lipid rafts coincides with its phosphorylation inside infected cells and 2) the phosphorylation state of the Us9-TfR chimera is reduced since it is no longer enriched in lipid rafts.</p><p>Perhaps not surprisingly, the Us9 acidic domain region is highly conserved among Us9 homologs of other neurotropic herpesviruses, including the human pathogens herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV), as well as the animal pathogens equine herpesvirus (EHV) and bovine herpesvirus (BHV), suggesting an important role for this domain in the anterograde spread of virus in the mammalian nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Brideau3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Chowdhury1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Flowers1">&#x0005b;72&#x0005d;</xref>. We predict that phosphorylation of the Us9 acidic domain (within the context of a lipid raft) is necessary for binding an axonal sorting adaptor, which would then mediate anterograde transport inside the axon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Tomishima2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Favoreel2">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our model addresses how viral glycoproteins/vesicles are sorted into the axon of infected neurons, but does not suggest a mechanism for their function in cell-to-cell spread of infection in cultured epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Dingwell1">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Nixdorf1">&#x0005b;76&#x0005d;</xref>.

The virus fusion machinery is composed of gB trimers, as well as gH/gL heterodimeric complexes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Mettenleiter3">&#x0005b;79&#x0005d;</xref>). PRV gH is essential for entry into uninfected cells, cell-to-cell spread of infection in tissue culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Peeters1">&#x0005b;80&#x0005d;</xref>, and transneuronal spread of infection in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Babic1">&#x0005b;81&#x0005d;</xref>. Does gH enter the axon in a Us9 or gE-dependent manner despite its apparent exclusion from DRMs? We are currently investigating this question. Cross-linking experiments performed on purified HSV virions found that hetero-oligomers of gB, gC, and gD were closely associated with one another in the virion envelope (within 11.4&#x000c5;). The gH and gL proteins could also be cross-linked within the envelope as one might predict. Interestingly, gL was never cross-linked to gB, leading the authors to suggest that organization of these proteins in the membrane &#x0201c;precludes associations of gH/gL with gB&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Handler1">&#x0005b;82&#x0005d;</xref>. One explanation for this finding is that gB is present in a lipid raft microdomain, whereas gH is not (a small proportion of HSV gH has been shown to be in the DRM fraction of infected COS cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Lee1">&#x0005b;83&#x0005d;</xref>). It is also feasible that PRV gH may indeed be raft-associated, but solubilization with cold detergent is too stringent. Triton X-100 and CHAPS are reported to be the most reliable detergents for analyzing raft association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Schuck1">&#x0005b;84&#x0005d;</xref>. However, some membrane proteins solubilized by Triton X-100 do associate with lipid rafts by antibody copatching <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Favoreel1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Harder1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Janes1">&#x0005b;85&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Lang1">&#x0005b;86&#x0005d;</xref>. At this time it is unclear if gH has a weak affinity for rafts, or is indeed a &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; non-raft protein as is transferrin receptor.</p><p>Our findings also highlight the importance of the Us9 TMD domain in raft targeting. Several studies have addressed the importance of the transmembrane segment in partitioning viral and cellular membrane proteins into lipid rafts: influenza virus hemagglutinin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Scheiffele1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Lin1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref> and neuraminidase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Barman1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Kundu1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>, the LMP-1 oncoprotein of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Coffin1">&#x0005b;87&#x0005d;</xref>, and the human immunoreceptor Fc&#x003b3;RIIA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-GarciaGarcia1">&#x0005b;88&#x0005d;</xref>. It is clear from these studies that amino acids within the TMD (even single amino acids) have dramatic effects on raft partitioning, sorting, or signaling events. A comprehensive analysis of the Us9 TMD may reveal residues important for protein-lipid/protein-protein interactions that are key in promoting axonal sorting of mature virus particles.</p><p>Several alpha herpesvirus proteins have been shown to associate with DRMs during virus replication. In addition to PRV membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Favoreel1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>; this study) the virion host shutoff (vhs) protein of HSV-1 was shown to be enriched in organellar membrane fractions which contain virus assembly intermediates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Lee1">&#x0005b;83&#x0005d;</xref>. HSV gB is proposed to mobilize lipid rafts during entry, perhaps to mediate cell signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Babic1">&#x0005b;81&#x0005d;</xref>.

These findings demonstrate that lipid rafts play an important role in the replication cycle of alpha herpesviruses, and underscore the importance of lipid rafts in virus biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Bavari1">&#x0005b;91&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Wilflingseder1">&#x0005b;94&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Two competing models have been presented for anterograde, axonal transport of alpha herpesviruses in neurons (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Diefenbach1">&#x0005b;95&#x0005d;</xref>). Viral capsids are either transported down the axon independently from viral membrane proteins (and assemble prior to egress), or they are sorted and transported together as a mature virus particle within a vesicle. Recent studies have shown that efficient capsid transport is dependent on at least two viral membrane proteins, Us9 and gE. Deleting either of these genes from HSV or PRV results in a marked decrease of viral capsids from entering axons of infected neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Lavail1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Lyman1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Chng4">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000065-Wang1">&#x0005b;96&#x0005d;</xref>. It is difficult to conceive how viral membrane proteins could impact capsid sorting unless the two were tightly coupled during axonal entry and transport (i.e. if capsids entered axons separate from viral membrane proteins, deletion of gE and Us9 would have no effect on capsid sorting). These recent findings are consistent with a model where viral capsids and membrane proteins traffic together in axons as mature virus particles (within a vesicle) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000065-g009">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that PRV Us9 is highly enriched in DRMs of non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells, and this enrichment is critical to axonal targeting and subsequently in neuron-to-cell spread. This is the first report to implicate lipid rafts in the axonal sorting of alpha herpesvirus structural proteins in mammalian neurons. Our future plans include isolating lipid rafts from polarized PC12 cells infected with wild-type PRV, and identifying the cellular and viral proteins present within these lipid microdomains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1000065.s001"><label>Video S1</label><caption><p>A differentiated PC12 cell body (with multiple neurites) infected with PRV GS443 for 12 hours.
