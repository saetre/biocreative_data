Here, we show that Lin28 also specifically associates with ribonucleoprotein particles containing the replication-dependent histone H2a mRNA in mouse embryonic stem cells. We further show that the coding region of H2a mRNA harbors high affinity binding sequences for Lin28 and that these sequences stimulate the expression of reporter genes in a Lin28-dependent manner. We suggest that a key function of Lin28 in the maintenance of pluripotency is to promote the expression of the H2a gene (and perhaps also other replication-dependent histone genes) at the posttranscriptional level in order to coordinate histone production with the unique proliferative properties of embryonic stem cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Abundantly expressed in human and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, Lin28 is among four factors (including Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog) that together reprogram human fibroblasts to pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). Despite its apparent critical role in ES cells, the molecular function and mode of action of Lin28 are just beginning to be elucidated. Multiple studies have demonstrated that Lin28 functions to block the production of mature let-7 microRNAs implicated in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, although the mechanism by which it does so remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7 B8">4&#x02013;8</xref>). In addition, let-7 microRNA represses the expression of Lin28, creating a feedback loop [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and references therein]. However, other evidence exists that Lin28 may regulate gene expression through multiple mechanisms. Indeed, Polesskaya <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) reported that Lin28 associates with ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) containing IGF-2 mRNA and stimulates its translation in muscle cells. Similarly, our recent studies suggest that Lin28 acts to modulate mouse ES cell growth likely in part by effecting the expression of cell cycle genes (including cyclins A and B and cdk4) at the translational level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Thus, a major role Lin28 may play in ES cells is to regulate the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression. This is conceivable given that pluripotency is thought to be mechanistically linked to the unique proliferative properties of ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>The class of genes that provide the massive amounts of histones required for chromosome packaging during the S-phase of cell cycle are the replication-dependent histone genes. Those encoding the four core histones (H2a, H2b, H3 and H4) and the linker histone H1, are unique in that they do not contain introns and that their mRNAs end in a highly conserved stem-loop structure instead of a poly(A) tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15">13&#x02013;15</xref>). As histone synthesis outside the S-phase is highly toxic to the cell, multiple levels of regulation are involved to restrict histone production exclusively to the S-phase. Owing to the structure of the nucleosome, it is critical that the replication-dependent histones are stoichiometrically expressed in cells. However, the sequences and mechanisms that regulate the transcription of the individual histone genes are well known to be diverse, reflecting different regulatory factors and modes of regulation present in different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the four histone subtypes (H2a, H2b, H3 and H4) are differentially regulated at the posttranscriptional level depending on cell types. In this report, we suggest that Lin28 plays a role in regulating the production of histones, in particular the H2a subtype, in mouse ES cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Lin28 stimulates ES cell proliferation</title><p>We have recently reported that Lin28 plays a role in mouse ES cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> recapitulates this observation. Mouse ES cells were transfected with a siRNA specific for Lin28. In parallel, the cells were mock-transfected or transfected with a control siRNA. mRNA and protein levels were measured 24 and 48 h after transfection, respectively. The level of Lin28 mRNA in cells transfected with the Lin28-specific siRNA (Lin28 siRNA) was reduced to &#x0223c;10% of those in cells that were mock transfected or transfected with a control siRNA (Control siRNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a). Importantly, the level of untargeted beta-actin mRNA was not affected, indicating that the siRNA-mediated gene silencing effect was specific. The Lin28 protein level decreased by &#x0223c;75% after Lin28 siRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>b, top panel, compare lanes 2 to 1). The cells transfected with Lin28 siRNA exhibited a retarded growth phenotype, as indicated by the lower cell numbers compared to those transfected with control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>c). Treatment of ES cells with siRNAs targeted to different regions of Lin28 showed similar effects (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp372/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). On the other hand, elevated expression of Lin28 by transfection of a Flag-tagged Lin28 expression vector (Flag-Lin28) resulted in stimulation of cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>d). The level of Flag-Lin28 expression was estimated to be &#x0223c;5-fold higher than that of endogenous Lin28, given a plasmid DNA transfection efficiency of &#x0223c;50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>b, top panel, compare lane 4 to 3, and data not shown). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Lin28 promotes cell proliferation.

In addition, trypan-blue exclusion assays also revealed &#x0003c;10% non-viable cells in all cases (data not shown). However, we show that these were likely resulted from cell cycle structure changes indicated by the flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp372/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). Taken together, the above results are consistent with the notion that Lin28 in its natural context may function to promote progression from S to G2/M phase, which is in line with our previous observation using BrdU incorporation flow cytometric analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Lin28 binds histone H2a mRNA <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To explore the possibility that Lin28 may regulate specific genes involved in cell cycle progression, we searched for mRNA targets of Lin28. Using immunoprecipitation (IP) and reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), we identified cyclins A and B, and cdk4 mRNAs as the putative targets of Lin28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Here, we report the replication-dependent histone H2a mRNA as a new target of Lin28 regulation. An interaction between Lin28 and histone mRNAs was originally missed by us, because these mRNAs are not polyadenylated and thus could not be detected by our IP and RT-qPCR assays where oligo(dT) was used to generate cDNAs from precipitated RNAs in reverse transcription reactions. Ironically, we were using histone H2a mRNA sequences as negative controls for Lin28 binding. To our surprise, these sequences consistently showed the highest affinity for Lin28 in our <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA&#x02013;protein interaction assays. These observations prompted us to explore the possible link between Lin28 and histone mRNAs.</p><p>Thus, we performed IP using a monoclonal anti-Flag antibody to isolate RNPs from ES cells transfected with Flag-Lin28. RNA samples extracted from IP complexes were used to generate cDNAs, followed by qPCR to identify associated mRNAs. In the RT reactions, primers specific for the four core histone (H2a, H2b, H3 and H4) mRNAs as well as oligo(dT) were used. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> presents representative results of multiple independent experiments. The amounts of mRNAs present in the anti-Flag IP complexes relative to those in pre-immune IgG IP complexes (which were arbitrarily set as 1) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>a. Tubulin mRNA was used as a control for non-specific RNA binding. H2a mRNA exhibited the most dramatic enrichment (&#x0223c;5-fold) among the four histone mRNAs in the anti-Flag versus pre-immune complexes. The rest (H2b, H3 and H4), however, showed only marginal enrichment (&#x0223c;1.5&#x02013;2-fold). Confirming our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), mRNAs for cyclins A and B and cdk4 were also significantly enriched. Notably, the enrichment of Oct4 was also reproducibly observed, albeit to a lesser extent (&#x0223c;2-fold). The possibility that Oct4 mRNA may be a target for Lin28 regulation is currently under investigation. Importantly, these results were mimicked by IP using a polyclonal anti-Lin28 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>b). Furthermore, the relative fold enrichment did not reflect levels of the mRNAs in the cell extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>c), suggesting that the relative enrichments observed were not due to high amounts of the particular mRNAs present in the extracts. The apparently higher levels of H2b and H4 mRNAs compared to those of H2a and H3 in the cell extract were likely resulted from higher primer efficiencies in the RT and PCR reactions. The primers were designed such that at least 12 mRNAs in each subtype of histone genes could be detected in our RT and PCR reactions (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section). Taken together, the preferential enrichment of H2a mRNA in Lin28-containing RNPs indicates that it may be an <italic>in vivo</italic> target for Lin28 regulation. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Lin28 associates with a specific subset of mRNAs in mouse ES cells.

XL allows the detection of direct contact between RNA and protein based on the natural photo-reactivity of nucleic acids and amino acids upon UV irradiation. Our pilot experiments revealed that, like many other RNA-binding proteins [i.e. the fragile X mental retardation protein FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>)], Lin28 can be crosslinked non-specifically to almost any RNA tested even under very stringent conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>c and data not shown). This was not surprising since the specific affinity of Lin28 for let-7 microRNA precursors has been reported to be relatively low, in the micromolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Nonetheless, we have been able to show a specific and direct interaction between Lin28 and the coding region of H2a mRNA using a crosslinking and competition strategy similar to that described by Schaeffer <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). These sorts of assays are quite sensitive and largely alleviate the contribution of non-specific binding. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>XL and competition assays. Flag-Lin28 was transfected into HEK293 cells and cell extract prepared.

The unlabeled competitor RNAs used were from the coding regions of histones H4, H3, H2b and H2a, and fragment B1U1. B1U1 was derived from a part of the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR) of cyclin B mRNA that does not contain high affinity binding sequences for Lin28 [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>], and thus served as a control for non-specific Lin28 binding. The reactions were UV-irradiated, followed by RNase A digestion. Crosslinked (thus radioactively labeled) Lin28 was captured by IP using an anti-Flag antibody and visualized by autoradiography. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>a, Lin28 binding to the radioactively labeled H2a RNA was competed far more efficiently by the unlabeled H2a RNA than by any of the others (compare lanes 15&#x02013;17 with lanes 3&#x02013;14). Under the conditions used, the affinity of H2a RNA for Lin28 is &#x0223c;8-fold higher than that of H4 RNA, and &#x0223c;5-fold higher than those of B1U1, H2b and H3 RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>b). The apparent better competition at the 7&#x02013;molar excess concentration using unlabeled B1U1 versus unlabeled H2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>a, compare lanes 12&#x02013;13 with lanes 15&#x02013;16) simply reflects intrinsic experimental variation, which is reflected in the error bar shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>b at the 7-molar excess concentration. When labeled B1U1 was used, more efficient competition of H2a compared to B1U1 RNA itself was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>c). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the H2a coding region contains high affinity binding sites for Lin28.</p></sec><sec><title>H2a coding region contains sequences that stimulate gene expression in a Lin28-dependent manner</title><p>As a predominantly cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein, Lin28 may affect its target mRNAs at the translational and/or stability level. This question can be addressed by overexpression or downregulation of Lin28, followed by assessing the effects on levels of proteins and RNAs encoded by the target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). However, this type of approach is not feasible for histone genes due to the intimate coupling between histone expression and the cell cycle. Histone mRNA and protein levels rise in early S-phase and decline dramatically at the end of S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Therefore, differences in histone mRNA and protein levels cannot be discerned using asynchronous cell populations. On the other hand, due to the fast ES cell cycle (mouse ES cells divide every &#x0223c;8&#x02013;10 h) and the requirement for at least 24 h to synchronize ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), experiments using synchronized ES cells are not feasible either. To circumvent these problems, we employed a luciferase reporter system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Thus, sequences derived from H2a, H2b, H3 or H4 coding regions were inserted into the 3&#x02032;UTR of a firefly luciferase reporter construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and the abilities of the sequences to stimulate the reporter gene expression measured. The parental (FFL) and a construct containing the B1U1 sequence were included as negative controls. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>a, while the H2a sequence exhibited a strong stimulatory effect on firefly luciferase activity in a Lin28-dependent manner, those from H2b, H3 and H4 had a modest stimulatory effect, and B1U1 showed no effect. RT-qPCR analysis confirmed that the Lin28-dependent luciferase activity changes observed were not due to changes in luciferase mRNA levels when Lin28 was introduced into cells at 10 and 20 ng levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>b). This is consistent with a role of Lin28 in regulating the translation of the reporter mRNA. However, when the Lin28 expression vector was added at higher amounts, leading to higher expression levels of Lin28 protein (data not shown), the level of H2a-containing mRNA was reproducibly slightly increased over that of the other mRNAs (40 ng, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>b). A simple interpretation for these observations is that the H2a sequence has the ability to enhance both translation and mRNA stability in a Lin28-dependent manner. Experiments are currently underway to understand the molecular basis of the different effects exerted by Lin28 in this system. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Luciferase activity assays. The indicated reporter constructs were transfected into NIH/3T3 cells that do not express endogenous Lin28, together with increasing amounts of Flag-Lin28. In addition, a Renilla reporter was included in all transfections for normalization purposes. Luciferase activities and mRNA levels were measured 24 h after transfection. Firefly luciferase activities [after normalization against Renilla luciferase (<bold>a</bold> and <bold>c</bold>)] and firefly mRNA levels (<bold>b</bold>) from cells without Flag-Lin28 transfection were arbitrarily set as 1.

While a single copy insertion had no effect, the insertion of two tandem copies of the elements recapitulated the translational stimulatory phenomenon observed with the full-length H2a insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>c). That one copy of the element did not produce an intermediate stimulatory effect indicates that H2a may contain more than one Lin28 high affinity binding element and that binding to multiple elements may produce synergistic and not just additive effects. This phenomenon is commonly seen in RNA-based studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22 B23">20&#x02013;23</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that binding of Lin28 to specific sites within the H2a coding region may enhance translation and/or mRNA stability.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have shown here that Lin28 positively influences the mouse ES cell cycle, likely by facilitating the progression from S to G2/M phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp372/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). In addition to the key cell cycle regulatory genes cyclins A and B and cdk4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), we have identified histone H2a as a new putative target of Lin28. This is based on its preferential association with Lin28 in the context of RNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) and its ability to directly bind Lin28 in our <italic>in vitro</italic> assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, we show that sequences derived from the coding region of H2a are able to stimulate reporter gene expression at the posttranscriptional level in a Lin28-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). We thus postulate that Lin28 may play a role in regulating the translation and/or stability of H2a mRNA, in addition to a subset of key cell-cycle regulator genes, as part of ES cell-specific mechanisms. As can be seen from the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, Lin28 appears to be able to influence not only translation, but also mRNA stability. Interestingly, other studies on Lin28 have implicated this protein in a variety of steps of gene regulation. For example, there have been multiple reports that Lin28 can block the production of mature let-7 microRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7 B8">4&#x02013;8</xref>). However, the mechanism by which it does so remains highly controversial. Two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) found that Lin28 specifically binds to the terminal loop regions of let-7 precursors <italic>in vitro</italic> and blocks microRNA processing at the Microprocessor step in the nucleus. Rybak <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), on the other hand, concluded that inhibition occurs in the cytoplasm at the Dicer step and that both the loop and stem regions of let-7 precursors bind Lin28. They also found that Lin28 was able to bind mature let-7 that does not contain the terminal loop sequences. Furthermore, Heo <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) reported that Lin28 induces terminal uridylation of pre-let-7 in the cytoplasm, leading to inhibition of Dicer processing and pre-let-7 degradation. Taken together, these studies suggest that binding of Lin28 to its target RNAs may lead to multiple outcomes, perhaps influenced by protein&#x02013;protein interactions, by other <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements lying near to Lin28-binding sites, or by the intracellular location.</p><p>ES cells proliferate rapidly and indefinitely while maintaining their capacity of differentiating into any cell type found in the body.

As such, the cells devote more than half of the entire cycle length to their S-phase and apparently lack a G1/S checkpoint. Given that histone expression is mechanistically coupled to the S-phase, ES cells may have evolved unique mechanisms controlling histone production in order to coordinate with their unique proliferative properties. Our finding that the replication-dependent histone H2a gene is a likely target for Lin28-mediated regulation highlights this possibility.</p><p>As the transcriptional regulation of the individual histone genes are well known to be diverse, (reviewed in 13), it is not surprising that the four histone subtypes (H2a, H2b, H3 and H4) appear to be differentially regulated at the posttranscriptional level with respect to Lin28 in an ES cell-specific manner. Although H2a mRNA is likely the major target for Lin28 regulation relative to H2b, H3 and H4, based on our assays, the possibility exists that the other three may also be regulated by Lin28, albeit to a lesser extent.</p><p>The regulation of expression of replication-dependent histone genes in non-ES cells has been extensively studied. SLBP/HBP is among the many well-studied factors involved in histone mRNA metabolism. It binds the 3&#x02032;-end stem-loop of histone mRNAs with high specificity and regulates the 3&#x02032;-processing, nucleocytoplasmic transport, stability and translation of these mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In addition, specific elements that reside in the coding regions of histone genes and that participate in the various steps of histone mRNA metabolism including transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), nucleocytoplasmic transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and histone 3&#x02032;-end processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) have been described. Our finding that the H2a coding region may contain translational/stability stimulatory sequence elements suggests for the first time that there may exist translational/stability &#x02018;modulators&#x02019; within the coding regions of histone mRNAs that might be recognized by cell-type-specific factors. It is intriguing to note that the expression of cyclin A and histones are intimately coupled to each other, and that both are coupled to DNA synthesis and cell-cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Our finding that both cyclin A and H2a mRNA are targets of Lin28 regulation underscores the importance of coordinated regulation of gene expression by Lin28.</p><p>Finally, based on our findings [this report and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>)] as well as those of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), growing evidence suggests that Lin28 has important biological functions distinct from the inhibition of let-7 processing. While the reported effects of Lin28 on let-7 microRNA expression are negative, those on mRNA targets are positive. However, the ultimate effect of Lin28 on all known targets is to promote cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>A feedback model for the regulation of cell proliferation by Lin28 and let-7.
