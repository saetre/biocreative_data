Behavioral and cell culture experiments suggest an increase in glucose level as a factor in such feeding-induced entrainment. For application of feeding-induced entrainment in humans, nutrient content and dietary variations should be considered.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Finding</title><p>To elucidate the food composition necessary for dietary entrainment, we examined whether complete or partial substitution of dietary nutrients affected phase shifts in liver clocks of mice. Compared with fasting mice or <italic>ad libitum</italic> fed mice, the liver bioluminescence rhythm advanced by 3&#x02013;4 h on the middle day in <italic>Per2</italic>::luciferase knock-in mice that were administered a standard mouse diet, i.e. AIN-93M formula &#x0005b;0.6&#x02013;0.85 g/10 g mouse BW&#x0005d; (composition: 14&#x00025; casein, 47&#x00025; cornstarch, 15&#x00025; gelatinized cornstarch, 10&#x00025; sugar, 4&#x00025; soybean oil, and 10&#x00025; other &#x0005b;fiber, vitamins, minerals, etc.&#x0005d;), for 2 days. When each nutrient was tested alone (100&#x00025; nutrient), an insignificant weak phase advance was found to be induced by cornstarch and soybean oil, but almost no phase advance was induced by gelatinized cornstarch, high-amylose cornstarch, glucose, sucrose, or casein. A combination of glucose and casein without oil, vitamin, or fiber caused a significant phase advance. When cornstarch in AIN-93M was substituted with glucose, sucrose, fructose, polydextrose, high-amylose cornstarch, or gelatinized cornstarch, the amplitude of phase advance paralleled the increase in blood glucose concentration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results strongly suggest the following: (1) balanced diets containing carbohydrates/sugars and proteins are good for restricted feeding-induced entrainment of the peripheral circadian clock and (2) a balanced diet that increases blood glucose, but not by sugar alone, is suitable for entrainment. These findings may assist in the development of dietary recommendations for on-board meals served to air travelers and shift workers to reduce jet lag-like symptoms.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Various physiological phenomena such as body temperature, food intake, and the sleep-wake cycle are under the control of an endogenous circadian clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-King1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Under restricted feeding schedules, numerous physiological and metabolic functions, including locomotor activity, body temperatures, and insulin and corticosterone release, become entrained to the availability of food. Strong support for the existence of a food-entrainable timing system is provided by the circadian pattern of food anticipatory activity (FAA) rhythms that have been shown to develop in intact and SCN-ablated animals maintained on restricted feeding schedules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Mistlberger1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Stephan1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Krieger1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Boulos1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Clock gene rhythms in the liver and cerebral cortex can also be entrained to restricted feeding stimuli within 2 days, i.e before FAA can develop, despite the locking of SCN activity to LD cues or SCN ablation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Damiola1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Stokkan1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Wakamatsu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Taken together, the data suggest that glucose may be at least one factor for peripheral tissue clock gene entrainment as well as FAA during restricted feeding schedules. Therefore, in the present experiment, we directly examined the effect of carbohydrates, including sugar and starch, on the entrainment of the circadian liver clock using <italic>Per2</italic>::luciferase knock-in mice.</p><p>Humans generally consume an appropriate balanced diet containing starch, protein, and oil, but not simple nutrients such as glucose. Therefore, to enable the application of our study results to humans, appropriate dietary guidelines were developed. In order to elucidate the role of nutrition in inducing phase shifts, the components of the AIN-93M diet were partially or completely substituted. Since glucose is a good candidate for inducing entrainment signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Stephan3">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, we focused particularly on cornstarch and sugar.

Under explant conditions, the term &#x0201c;projected ZT (pZT)&#x0201d; was used instead of ZT.

Surprisingly, with regard to starch/sugar, mouse diets with 100&#x00025; glucose, 100&#x00025; sucrose,100&#x00025; cornstarch, 100&#x00025; GCS, or 100&#x00025; HACS do not cause significant phase advancement of the liver clock when compared with a 2-day fasting group. In addition to starch/sugar, 100&#x00025; casein and 100&#x00025; soybean oil also did not cause a significant effect on phase advance. Thus, the present study suggests that a balanced diet containing carbohydrate, protein, lipids, and vitamins/minerals may be effective for inducing phase shifts in the peripheral circadian clock. These data indicate that, simple diets such as 100&#x00025; sugar, 100&#x00025; protein, and 100&#x00025; oil are inadequate for inducing entrainment signals. Therefore, we suggest that a balanced diet such as the control AIN-93M diet is good not only for maintaining the health and metabolism of mice but also for inducing entrainment signals in the peripheral circadian clock.</p><p>Although 100&#x00025; glucose, 100&#x00025; casein, 100&#x00025; starch, and 100&#x00025; soybean oil failed to cause a significant phase advance in the present study, 86&#x00025; glucose with 14&#x00025; casein caused a significant phase advance when compared to 100&#x00025; sucrose alone. It has been observed that consumption of meals rich in protein and fat leads to secretion of gut hormones such as cholecystokinin (CCK), secretin, and peptide YY from the upper small intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Dockray1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Green1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. At present, we do not know the role of such gut hormones on phase shift of the liver clock; however, some studies have suggested a role of CCK in circadian systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Lundberg1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Shimazoe1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. In one such behavioral experiment, it was shown that consumption of vegetable oil did not produce phase shifts in the activity rhythm of rats on a restricted feeding schedule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Stephan3">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, our present results suggest the inability of oil to cause a phase shift in the liver clock. The observation that 95&#x00025; glucose with 5&#x00025; soybean oil did not cause a phase advance of the liver clock could be attributed to potency differences of fat and oil or the level of protein and fat required for CCK release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Dockray1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Green1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Two interesting findings strongly suggest that the digestive tract, particularly the jejunum, is an important site where the sensation of food is received as an entrainment signal for corticosterone rhythm. In one finding, the circadian corticosterone rhythm was entrained by restricted feeding in rats and maintained under enteral injection of artificial nutrition. However, it disappeared on middle cardiac vein injection of the same nutrition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Saito1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In a second finding, restricted feeding-entrained corticosterone rhythm was maintained under ileal resection in rats but disappeared under jejunal resection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Kato1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Our present results in the liver circadian clock support these studies since the AIN-93M diet, the partial substitution diet, and the glucose with casein diet caused significant and large phase advances of the liver clock rhythm. These results suggest that at minimum a combination of starch/sugar with protein may be necessary to produce adequate phase shift of the liver clock. Conversely, vitamins/minerals or cellulose contained in AIN-93M may not contribute to an AIN-93M-induced phase advance since the combination of glucose with vitamins/minerals or glucose with cellulose did not cause a phase advance.</p><p>In the current study we have found that starch/sugar in the AIN-93M diet are important mediators of liver phase advancement. An AIN-93M diet containing a substitution of polydextrose for starch/sugar resulted in a failure of liver phase advancement. The inability of the polydextrose diet to produce a phase shift could have been due to its relatively low caloric load. Partial substitution of glucose, sucrose, fructose, and polydextrose resulted in a positive effect on phase advancement with respect to the order of relative blood glucose values. In addition, two types of cornstarch were used to further support these findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Liu1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Substitution of cornstarch by HACS caused a significantly weaker phase advance when compared to that in the control cornstarch and GCS-substituted groups. In fact, the blood glucose value was significantly higher in the GCS group as compared to the HACS group. These results suggest that a diet containing starch/sugar that produces high blood glucose values may be beneficial for phase shift of the liver clock if fed to animals in the context of a balanced diet. The data also underscore the important effect that an increase in blood glucose concentration has on the phase advance of the liver clock.</p><p>Rat-1 fibroblasts treated with glucose have been shown to exhibit clock resetting by the down-regulation of <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Hirota1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, our data show that 100&#x00025; glucose does not cause phase advance. The difference between our present results and that observed by Hirota et al. may be attributable to the experimental design, which was <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, respectively. Recently, it has been reported that fasting up-regulated <italic>Per1</italic> and down-regulated <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Dec1</italic>, and <italic>Bmal1</italic> in the mouse liver and that re-feeding prevented the fasting-induced change of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Kawamoto1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Kobayashi1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, up and down changes of gene expression by a balanced diet (normal mouse chow) may not be reproduced by a simple diet of 100&#x00025; glucose. Future experiments will compare the clock gene-expression pattern in the liver between a balanced diet and a 100&#x00025; sucrose diet. In one behavioral study, glucose shifted the phase of FAA when the rats were subjected to a restricted feeding schedule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Stephan3">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. We have found that in addition to the AIN-93M diet, 100&#x00025; glucose and 86&#x00025; glucose with 14&#x00025; casein caused FAA under a 2-day restricted feeding schedule, suggesting that 100&#x00025; glucose has the ability to produce FAA without affecting the liver clock. Dissociation of behavioral FAA rhythms and peripheral clock gene expression has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Davidson1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Feillet1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the mechanism of such dissociation by glucose is not elucidated in the present study, this is the first successful report of dissociation by diet.</p><p>Given the present results, it is not clear whether the effects we observed on the liver clock were specific effects on a food-entrainable circadian pacemaker or were a more global effect on the circadian system. If restricted feeding with different diets had global effects, then we may see shifts in the SCN. However, if the effects were specific to the food-entrainable oscillator, then we would not expect to see shifts in the SCN. Although previous papers have suggested that restricted feeding does not cause a phase shift of the SCN clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Damiola1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Stokkan1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Hara1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, our future studies will examine whether balanced food, substituted food, or simple nutrients can cause a shift of the SCN clock.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the volume of food can produce large phase shifts in the FAA rhythm in rats in a food volume-dependent manner, while substitution of the diet with non-nutritive bulk failed to produce phase shifts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Stephan4">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. When rats were entrained to 20 g food/day, approximately 6 g was necessary to produce phase shifts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Stephan4">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. In our present study, we found that phase advance of the liver clock was dependent on the volume of food (0.7, 1.4, or 2.0 g/day). Mice consume 4&#x02013;6 g food/day under free-feeding conditions and 1.4 g food/day is required to cause phase shifts. Thus, we estimate that at least 30&#x00025; of the food intake under free-feeding is required to cause phase shifts in the liver clock in both mice and rats. After feeding the mice 1.4 g food/day, our data show a significant phase advance of the bioluminescence rhythm on the second day but not the first. A previous study has also reported clear phase shifts induced by restricted feeding schedules on the second day of daytime feeding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-LeMinh1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, entrainable stimulation for at least 2 days may be necessary to produce a phase advance and entrainable stimulation for 4 days is needed to produce a maximum phase advance of the liver clock.</p><p>In summary, the present results strongly suggest that a balanced diet is important for restricted feeding-induced entrainment of the peripheral clock rhythm and that balanced foods that lead to high blood glucose levels are suitable for peripheral clock entrainment.

In order to allow for the mice to adapt to the control diet, their diet was changed from normal to the control AIN-93M diet 3&#x02013;4 days prior to the experiment. After 24-h food deprivation from the control diet, each mouse was provided a food tablet at ZT6 using an automatic food vending machine. Four hours after providing a food tablet, food consumption was checked. Some mice ate the entire tablet within 4 h, but some mice did not, depending on palatability. If the remaining food pellet comprised more than 0.09 g/10 g BW (2 SEM of the average food intake of normal food; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> section) on day 2, the mice were not used for the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments.</p><p>Pre-gelatinized cornstarch (GCS; Nisshoku Alstar E) and high-amylose cornstarch (HACS; Nisshoku High-Amylose Starch) were purchased from Nihon Shokuhin Kako (Tokyo, Japan).

A block of the liver was rapidly removed from each of the mice and placed in ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution (pH 7.2; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The liver tissues were cut into pieces with small scissors and explanted in a 35-mm Petri dish, sealed with parafilm (Sigma-Aldrich), and cultured with 1.3 ml DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (2.7 mM), HEPES (10 mM), kanamycin (20 mg/L; Sigma-Aldrich), insulin (5 &#x000b5;g/mL; Sigma-Aldrich), putrescine (100 &#x000b5;M; Sigma-Aldrich), human transferrin (100 &#x000b5;g/mL; Sigma-Aldrich), progesterone (20 nM; Sigma-Aldrich), sodium selenite (30 nM; Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.1 mM <sc>d</sc>-luciferin Na salt (Invitrogen) The concentration of glucose (4.5 g/L) is much higher than serum glucose (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> section), therefore it is important to note that all <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments were conducted under such conditions.

The program was developed by Mr. Tuyoshi Yaita and Dr. Shigenobu Shibata (Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan). The peaks were defined as points at which the bioluminescence was higher than that on both sides of the points and were confirmed from the waveform (supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006909.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Typically, the second peak is considered for the determination of the peak phase time because the first peak is sometimes affected by the movements of the culture dish. The period of <italic>Per2</italic>::luciferase activity (recorded from 24 to 72 h <italic>in vitro</italic>) was assessed for each liver culture sample and calculated by averaging the time periods between the first and second peaks and between the second and third peaks.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Time-course measurement of blood glucose concentration and relative blood glucose values</title><p>Each tablet was dissolved in water at a concentration of 0.1 g/mL except for the soybean oil liquid. For this experiment, we administered 0.33 mL/10 g BW through an oral syringe since the onset of food intake needed to be adjusted for a time-course measurement of blood glucose levels. In consideration of the suspension ability or aqueous solubility of the diet, the concentration was set as 0.1 g/mL solution. Each of the diet solutions was injected at a dose of 0.033 g/10 g BW and this value was approximately 1/10 of the tablet diet (refer to <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>). In human experiments, the glucose relative value (&#x00025;) is calculated using the following formula: 100&#x000d7; (blood glucose up to 2 h after food intake/total blood glucose up to 2 h after intake of the same amount of glucose) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006909-Frost1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, in the present mouse experiment, blood glucose was measured at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after oral intake. The AUC (area under the blood glucose concentration-time curve) was calculated for each diet including 100&#x00025; glucose, and then relative glucose values (&#x00025;) for each diet were calculated by 100&#x000d7; (mean AUC for each diet/mean AUC for 100&#x00025; glucose). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006909-g002">Fig. 2B</xref> shows the time course of glucose content in the tail blood after bolus injection of 100&#x00025; glucose or water to fasting mice.

For the blood glucose measurement, the tail vein of each mouse was cut and the glucose content was measured by using a Glucose PILOT kit (Aventir Biotech, LLC, Carlsbad, CA, USA) under light ether anesthesia.
