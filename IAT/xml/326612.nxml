The 1190 base pairs of DNA examined include the likely coding sequence for the first 258 amino acids of the uvrD protein. The transcription promoter for the uvrD gene was identified upstream of the protein coding region. Synthesis of messenger RNA in vitro from this promoter was inhibited by purified lexA protein. The lexA protein was found to bind downstream from the promoter at a sequence, CTGTATATATACCCAG, which is homologous to other known lexA protein binding sites. In the absence of the lexA protein, approximately half of the messages initiated in vitro at the uvrD promoter terminate after about 60 nucleotides at a sequence which resembles a rho-independent terminator. These results indicate that the uvrD gene is induced during the SOS response, and that the expression of the gene may also be regulated by transcription attenuation.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00369-0108-a" xlink:role="8632"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00369-0110-a" xlink:role="8634"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00369-0101.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8625"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00369-0102.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8626"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00369-0103.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8627"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00369-0104.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8628"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00369-0105.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8629"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00369-0106.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8630"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00369-0107.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8631"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00369-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8632"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00369-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8633"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00369-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8634"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00369-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8635"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00369-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8636"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00369-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8637"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00369-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8638"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00369-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8639"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00369-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8640"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
