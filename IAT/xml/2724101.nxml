PINK1 is a mitochondrial kinase of unknown function. We investigated calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function in PINK1-deficient mammalian neurons. We demonstrate physiologically that PINK1 regulates calcium efflux from the mitochondria via the mitochondrial Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> exchanger. PINK1 deficiency causes mitochondrial accumulation of calcium, resulting in mitochondrial calcium overload. We show that calcium overload stimulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production via NADPH oxidase. ROS production inhibits the glucose transporter, reducing substrate delivery and causing impaired respiration. We demonstrate that impaired respiration may be restored by provision of mitochondrial complex I and II substrates. Taken together, reduced mitochondrial calcium capacity and increased ROS lower the threshold of opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) such that physiological calcium stimuli become sufficient to induce mPTP opening in PINK1-deficient cells. Our findings propose a mechanism by which PINK1 dysfunction renders neurons vulnerable to cell death.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CELLBIO</kwd><kwd>CELLCYCLE</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in a range of neurodegenerative diseases, in particular, Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized initially by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), and later, by more widespread nondopaminergic neuronal loss (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Braak et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). The molecular pathogenesis of sporadic PD, and the basis for selective dopaminergic neuronal loss, remains unclear. Several genes have now been identified in which mutations cause forms of familial PD that are clinically and pathologically indistinguishable from sporadic PD. A number of these genes, namely <italic>PINK1</italic>, <italic>DJ-I</italic>, and <italic>Omi/HtrA2</italic>, encode mitochondrially located proteins, further implicating mitochondrial dysfunction as the primary event sufficient to cause PD.</p><p>Mutations in the PINK1 gene cause autosomal recessive PD (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Valente et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). PINK1 is a 581 amino acid protein consisting of a mitochondrial targeting motif and a serine/threonine kinase domain homologous to the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>/calmodulin family. Studies both in&#x000a0;vitro (<xref rid="bib38 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Silvestri et&#x000a0;al., 2005; Muqit et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>) and in&#x000a0;vivo (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Gandhi et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>) show PINK1 localized to mitochondria. The targets for PINK1 remain unknown, although mitochondrial proteins such as Omi/HtrA2 (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Plun-Favreau et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>) and TRAP1 (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Pridgeon et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>) have been identified as downstream effectors of PINK1 function. It is well established that PINK1 protects neurons from oxidative stress, and furthermore plays a role in mitochondrial morphology in mammalian cells and <italic>Drosophila</italic> models (<xref rid="bib24 bib20 bib42" ref-type="bibr">Haque et&#x000a0;al., 2008; Exner et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Yang et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We previously demonstrated that PINK1 deficiency results in an age-related loss of neuronal viability, and increased sensitivity to stress-induced mitochondrial apoptosis. In keeping with other reports, mitochondrial dysfunction was implicated due to the presence of lowered mitochondrial membrane potential, increased oxidative stress, and morphological changes of mitochondria associated with PINK1 deficiency (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Wood-Kaczmar et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying the mitochondrial membrane potential, the sources of oxidative stress, and basis of the sensitivity to apoptosis remained unknown. In this study we used dynamic imaging techniques to explore the&#x000a0;mitochondrial pathophysiology of PINK1-induced PD. We report that loss of PINK1 function causes dysregulation of mitochondrial calcium handling, resulting in mitochondrial calcium overload which sensitizes the mitochondria to opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP). Furthermore, we explain the basis for the impaired respiration and oxidative stress in PINK1 models of PD. These findings define a mechanism whereby PINK1 dysfunction may cause nigral neuronal death, and highlight pathophysiological processes that may also occur in sporadic PD.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><p>Using stable expression of shRNA constructs, we were able to&#x000a0;reduce PINK1 gene expression by &#x0003e;90% in (1) a human dopaminergic neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y), and (2) human neurons derived from fetal mesencephalic stem cells that represent the closest in&#x000a0;vitro model of primary human neurons. Finally, we corroborated our findings with another mammalian model: (3) primary cortical and midbrain neurons from a PINK1 knockout (KO) transgenic mouse (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>Ai and 1Aii). The characterization of these models has been extensively described (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Wood-Kaczmar et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Stable re-expression of wild-type (WT)-PINK1 or the kinase-dead mutant K219M-PINK1 was achieved in PINK1 knockdown (KD) neuroblastoma cells and confirmed by RT-PCR.</p><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Mitochondrial Membrane Potential</title><p>Mitochondrial membrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003c8;<sub>m</sub>) is an indicator of mitochondrial state. To control for the effect of multidrug resistance pumps on loading of dyes and experimental results, cells were initially loaded in the presence of the MDR inhibitor cyclosporine H. No difference in loading or in results was detected, and therefore all further experiments were conducted without cyclosporine H.</p><p>PINK1 KD in neuroblastoma cells is associated with a significant reduction in the TMRM signal by 43% compared to controls (n &#x0003e; 120 cells in &#x0003e;2 clones, p &#x0003c; 0.0001). Re-expression of WT PINK1, but not K219M-PINK1, rescued the TMRM signal in neuroblastoma cells (data not shown). PINK1 KD in human neurons is also associated with a significant lowering of the mean TMRM fluorescence signal by 16% (n &#x0003d; 60 in two clones, p &#x0003c; 0.005) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>Bi and 1Bii). These data suggest that PINK1 KD is associated with lowering of the basal &#x00394;&#x003c8;<sub>m.</sub> As basal accumulation of TMRM may be dependent on several factors including plasma membrane potential, we investigated the mechanism maintaining the &#x00394;&#x003c8;<sub>m</sub> by studying the sensitivity of &#x00394;&#x003c8;m to a range of mitochondrial inhibitors.</p><p>Control cells demonstrated either no response or slight hyperpolarization in response to complex V inhibition by oligomycin (0.2 &#x003bc;g/ml), while subsequent inhibition of complex 1 by rotenone (5 &#x003bc;M) caused a rapid loss of potential (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>Ci). Therefore, in control neurons, the &#x00394;&#x003c8;<sub>m</sub> is maintained by the activity of the respiratory chain, with contributions from both complex I and complex II (100% &#x0003d; basal &#x00394;&#x003c8;m, 0 &#x0003d; FCCP &#x00394;&#x003c8;m at end). In contrast, oligomycin caused marked mitochondrial depolarization in PINK1 KD/KO neurons (78.6% &#x000b1; 4.8% decrease in TMRM signal in mouse KO cortical neurons, n &#x0003d; 72 cells; 84.6% &#x000b1; 3.2% for human KD neurons, n &#x0003d; 112 cells; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>Cii). Therefore, in PINK1 KD/KO cells, &#x00394;&#x003c8;<sub>m</sub> is largely maintained by the hydrolysis of ATP by complex V, rather than by respiration.</p><p>Provision of additional substrate for complex 1 (5 mM pyruvate and 5 mM malate) to PINK1 KD neurons caused an increase in &#x00394;&#x003c8;<sub>m</sub> (TMRM signal increased by 23.4% &#x000b1; 1.9%, n &#x0003d; 68 for human neurons and by 18.6% &#x000b1; 0.7%, n &#x0003d; 87 for mouse KO neurons).

In addition, FAD<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> level was more oxidized in PINK1 KD neuroblastoma cells (PINK1 KD, 49.7% &#x000b1; 4.3%, compared to control, 37.5% &#x000b1; 2.9%, p &#x0003c; 0.05; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A, 2B, and 2D).

Preincubation (for 20 min) of PINK1 KO neurons with 5 mM pyruvate restored the redox state to control values (a rise from 23.4% &#x000b1; 1.8% to 54.8% &#x000b1; 4.9%; n &#x0003d; 71; p &#x0003c; 0.001) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>E).

Similarly control human neurons showed a rise in [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>c</sub> with no mitochondrial depolarization (n&#x000a0;&#x0003d; 35; data not shown), whereas PINK1 KD neurons exhibited a rise in [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>c</sub>, followed by a stepwise mitochondrial depolarization, where each step coincided with each UV induced [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>c</sub> rise (n &#x0003d; 38; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>C). Interestingly, following recovery of the [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>c</sub> signal, fluo-4 showed a very bright signal colocalizing completely with the TMRM signal, reflecting high levels of [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>m</sub> in PINK1 KD neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>C). Further activation of a calcium signal in these cells caused a profound mitochondrial depolarization and disappearance of the mitochondrially located TMRM signal. Application of FCCP to control neurons caused complete depolarization of the mitochondria. Application of FCCP in PINK1 KD neurons did not produce any further depolarization.

Such models recapitulated selective dopaminergic neuronal loss, &#x003b1;-synuclein-positive aggregates, and the clinical features of parkinsonism. However, the use of complex 1 toxins precludes the study of the natural pathophysiological events within mitochondria prior to neuronal death. Genetic models of the autosomal recessive PD have been less successful at reproducing the clinicopathological features of PD in&#x000a0;vivo mammalian models (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kitada et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). However, in&#x000a0;vitro models of PINK1 deficiency have produced phenotypes consistent with PD, namely age-related dopaminergic neuronal loss with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Wood-Kaczmar et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, the in&#x000a0;vitro models enable the physiologic events occurring within neurons, directly due to a mutation causing PD, to be characterized.</p><p>A reduction of complex 1 activity by 30% has been described in brain, muscle, and platelets of patients with sporadic PD (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Schapira et&#x000a0;al., 1990</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that the absence of PINK1 is associated with inhibition of respiration, with concomitant reduced oxygen consumption and an altered redox state. The lowered activity of the respiratory complexes is insufficient to maintain the &#x00394;&#x003c8;m, and hence results in a decrease in &#x00394;&#x003c8;m. As a result, the mitochondria switch from the production of ATP to the consumption of ATP by the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub>-ATPase in order to maintain their &#x00394;&#x003c8;m (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Campanella et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, this phenomenon could be reversed by the provision of additional respiratory chain substrates: the increase in respiration in the presence of additional pyruvate resulted in a concomitant switch in the mechanism of &#x00394;&#x003c8;m maintenance from hydrolysis of ATP to production of ATP. The ability to reverse the respiratory chain inhibition and repolarize the &#x00394;&#x003c8;m has not been previously demonstrated in PD. These data strongly suggest that the respiratory complexes in PINK1 deficiency are intact and that their functional inhibition is in fact secondary to reduced substrate supply. In keeping with other reports in the literature (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Scheele et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>), we found that PINK1 loss of function was associated with reduction in glucose uptake at the plasmalemmal membrane in human and mouse neurons. Thus, we conclude that reduced substrate delivery causes the impairment of respiration and reduced &#x00394;&#x003c8;m in cells that lack PINK1.</p><p>One of the major functions of the mitochondria is the maintenance of calcium homeostasis within the cell. Abnormal calcium homeostasis has been implicated in a range of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (<xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr">Abramov et&#x000a0;al., 2003, 2004</xref>), Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and stroke (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Mattson, 2007</xref>). In PD, one important observation is that adult dopaminergic neurons are uniquely dependent on calcium channels (rather than sodium channels) to maintain autonomous pacing activity. As a result these neurons are exposed to frequent large influxes of cytosolic calcium, which must be buffered by the mitochondria (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Chan et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Mitochondrial dysfunction and in particular an inability to handle these calcium loads may render dopaminergic neurons particularly vulnerable to injury. Furthermore, it has been reported that SN and VTA neurons that express higher levels of calcium-binding proteins such as calbindin are spared in both sporadic PD and MPTP toxicity (<xref rid="bib17 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Damier et&#x000a0;al., 1999; Liang et&#x000a0;al., 1996</xref>). However, the nature of calcium dysregulation and its contribution to neuronal death is largely uncharacterized in PD. We report that human and mouse neurons lacking PINK1 have a higher basal [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>m</sub> than control neurons. Furthermore, stimuli that induce a rise in cytosolic calcium cause mitochondrial calcium overload with greatly impaired recovery. As a consequence of this, the mitochondrial calcium uptake capacity is dramatically reduced in the absence of PINK1. Thus, repetitive rises in cytosolic calcium result in mitochondrial calcium overload, leading to premature opening of the PTP, profound mitochondrial depolarization, and ultimately cell death (<xref rid="bib14 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Crompton, 1999; Nicholls and Budd, 2000</xref>). In addition, the opening of the PTP by calcium is modulated by factors such as lowered basal &#x00394;&#x003c8;m and raised mROS production (described below), which also occur in PINK1 deficiency.</p><p>Accumulation of calcium within the mitochondria matrix depends on both calcium uptake into the mitochondria through an electrogenic uniporter, as well as extrusion of calcium from the mitochondria through Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> antiporters (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Szabadkai et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Our data suggest that the cause of mitochondrial calcium accumulation in PINK1 deficiency is a direct impairment of calcium efflux from the mitochondria secondary to dysfunction of the Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> exchanger. The reasons for this are (1) following an increase in [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>m</sub> there was no mitochondrial efflux of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and concomitant influx of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (which would normally enable recovery of [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>m</sub>), (2) application of external Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> was able to activate the Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> exchanger in control neurons but not in PINK1 KD neurons, and (3) there was no apparent abnormality of calcium influx in PINK1 KD/KO cells, To date, the existence of the calcium uniporter and antiporters has been established only functionally. The Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> antiporter was first recognized in heart and brain mitochondria (<xref rid="bib12 bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr">Carafoli et&#x000a0;al., 1974; Crompton et&#x000a0;al., 1977, 1978</xref>). Although one putative candidate was reported to be isolated from beef heart mitochondria (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 1992</xref>), the proteins that truly account for the activity of these transporters have not yet been identified and confirmed. We have shown physiologically that PINK1 regulates the Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>exchange mechanism in mitochondria, and that this is fundamental to the role of PINK1 in cell physiology. We are unable to prove biochemically that the Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>exchanger is a direct substrate or interactor of PINK1 because the molecular identity of this protein remains unclear. In order to fully clarify the relationship between PINK1 and Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> exchange, it is necessary to first identify this protein, which is the subject of ongoing research.</p><p>One interesting observation in these experiments was the significant difference in the mitochondrial calcium capacity of mouse compared to human neurons. Control mouse neuronal mitochondria depolarized at much lower calcium concentrations than control human neurons. Control mouse neurons did not accumulate mitochondrial calcium in the same way as normal human neurons due to immediate opening of the PTP.</p><p>Oxidative stress has long been implicated in sporadic PD: there is evidence of elevated levels of lipid peroxidation markers (4-hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde) and protein nitration in the substantia nigra and in Lewy bodies of patients with PD (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Andersen, 2004</xref>). However, it is less clear whether the oxidative stress is causal in PD or a consequence of dysfunctional neurons. At a cellular level, overproduction of ROS would theoretically be able to inhibit the mitochondrial Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> exchanger, causing mitochondrial calcium overload, as well as inhibiting the plasmalemmal glucose transporter and reducing respiration (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Jornot et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>). In our models, we demonstrate that in the absence of PINK1, there was a significant increase in ROS production from two separate sources. There was an increase in mROS that may be secondary to the increase in mitochondrial calcium, as well as the impairment of respiration. Alternatively, it is recognized that PTP opening per se results in an increase in ROS production through a conformational change in complex I (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Batandier et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). In addition, there was overproduction of cROS, in the form of superoxide by NOX. Increased activity of NOX has been reported to be responsible for the oxidative stress seen in other neurodegenerative diseases and is a major source of ROS production in MPTP-induced cell toxicity (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Anantharam et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). As calcium is known to increase the activation of NOX-2 (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Abramov et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>), we postulate that cytosolic calcium may result in an increase in cROS production. Manipulation of ROS production using inhibitors of NOX, NOX-2 (gp91<sup>phox</sup>) siRNA, and ROS scavengers enabled us to distinguish the primary abnormalities from the secondary consequences of ROS production in PINK1 KD/KO neurons. Reduction of ROS production was able to reverse the impaired glucose uptake in PINK1-deficient cells, and thus oxidative stress plays an important role in causing the impaired respiration seen in PINK1 KD/KO. Provision of substrates was also able to overcome the impaired respiration and mitochondrial depolarization. However neither reduction of ROS nor substrate provision was able to affect mitochondrial calcium overload or calcium-induced mitochondrial depolarization in PINK1 KD/KO cells.</p><p>In summary, we have characterized the mitochondrial pathophysiology that occurs due to PINK1 loss of function and have attempted to define mechanisms by which PINK1 deficiency renders neurons vulnerable. Within mitochondria there is considerable crosstalk between the bioenergetic function and calcium homeostasis. Our data suggest that as a result of PINK1 deficiency there is primarily an impairment of mitochondrial calcium efflux resulting in mitochondrial calcium overload. This induces a rise in ROS that may further impair calcium efflux and also inhibit glucose uptake, resulting in reduced substrate delivery and impaired respiration. Ultimately, the synergistic action of increased mROS and mitochondrial calcium overload induces opening of the PTP. Opening of the PTP, occurring either as an early event (calcium-induced) or as a late event, has several consequences that exacerbate the mitochondrial pathophysiology and promote cell death: (1) PTP opening will further increase ROS production in the mitochondria, (2) PTP opening will result in reduced rate of maximal respiration through pyridine nucleotide depletion (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Di Lisa et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>), and (3) PTP opening will cause cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release and neuronal apoptosis. Neurons of the substantia nigra, where there is increased oxidative stress and large calcium influxes, will be particularly susceptible to mitochondrial apoptosis via these mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods" id="sec4"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Cell Models</title><p>The generation, characterization, and maintenance of the neuroblastoma, human neuron, and mouse neuronal cultures are described briefly in the <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref> and have been published elsewhere (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Wood-Kaczmar et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>Loading of Cells</title><p>For measurements of [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>c</sub> and [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>m</sub>, cells were loaded for 30 min at room temperature with 5 &#x003bc;M of either fura-2 AM or fluo-4 AM in combination with 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M of either X-Rhod-1 AM or Rhod-5n, and 0.005% pluronic acid in a HEPES-buffered salt solution (HBSS) composed of 156 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.25 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM glucose, and 10&#x000a0;mM HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.35 with NaOH). For flash photolysis experiments, caged Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, 10 &#x003bc;M <italic>o</italic>-nitrophenyl EGTA, AM (NP-EGTA, AM) was loaded at the same time as the other indicators, and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-free medium containing 0.5 mM EGTA was used.

TMRM is used in the redistribution mode to assess &#x00394;&#x003c8;m, and therefore a reduction in TMRM fluorescence represents &#x00394;&#x003c8;m depolarization. Alternatively, Rh123 (26 &#x003bc;M, equivalent to 10 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; Molecular Probes) was added to cells during the last 15 min and washed prior to the experiment. Under these loading conditions, Rh123 is nontoxic and gives a reliable and reproducible measure of &#x00394;&#x003c8;<sub>m</sub> through the &#x0201c;dequench&#x0201d; of mitochondrial fluorescence, and thus an increase in the Rh123 signal reflects mitochondrial depolarization.</p><p>For measurement of mROS production, cells were preincubated with MitoSOX (5 &#x003bc;M, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 10 min at room temperature. For measurement of cROS production, dihydroethidium (2 &#x003bc;M) was present in the solution during the experiment. No preincubation (&#x0201c;loading&#x0201d;) was used for dihydroethidium to limit the intracellular accumulation of oxidized products.</p><p>For glucose uptake experiments, the uptake of the fluorescent glucose homolog 2-NBDG (Invitrogen) was measured by the addition of 40 nM 2-NBDG in the presence of 0.25 mM glucose during a period of continuous imaging.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><title>Fluorescence Measurements</title><p>Fluorescence measurements were obtained on an epifluorescence inverted microscope equipped with a &#x000d7;20 fluorite objective.

The 488&#x000a0;nm Argon laser line was used to excite fluo-4 fluorescence, which was measured using a band-pass filter from 505 to 550 nm. Illumination intensity was kept to a minimum (at 0.1%&#x02013;0.2% of laser output) to avoid phototoxicity, and the pinhole was set to give an optical slice of &#x0223c;2 &#x003bc;m.

For HEt, MitoSOX, X-Rhod, or Rhod-5n measurements the 543 nm laser line and 560 nm long-pass filter were used. NADH autofluorescence was excited at 351 and measured at 375&#x02013;470 nm. 2-NDBG was excited at 458 nm, and fluorescence was measured at 520 nm.

Application of CGP-37157 (10 &#x003bc;M) to control neurons (C) inhibited the Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> exchanger. Removal of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> from the medium in control neurons (D) also inhibited the Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> exchanger.</p><p>(E and F) Application of 50 mM NaCl in the presence of 7 &#x003bc;M ruthenium red stimulated an increase in Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and decrease in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> in control mitochondria (E).

Arrows indicate the final free calcium concentration to which mitochondria are exposed. Control human mitochondria (G) demonstrated a much higher Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> capacity compared to PINK1 KD mitochondria (H). Control neurons are able to partially maintain the &#x00394;&#x003c8;m, until the collapse of the fluo-4 fluorescence. WT mouse neurons (I) also exhibited a higher Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> capacity than PINK1 KO neurons (J).

PINK1 KO neurons (Aii) exhibited a higher basal level of ROS production than WT neurons. The basal ROS production and the response to KCl were blocked by inhibition of NOX in PINK1 KO neurons.
