During replication, 8-oxoG will frequently mispair with adenine, thus forming G:C &#x02192; T:A transversions, a common somatic mutation associated with human cancers. In the present study, we have constructed a stable transfectant cell line expressing hOGG1 fused at the C-terminal end to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and investigated the cellular distribution of the fusion protein by fluorescence analysis. It is shown that hOGG1 is preferentially associated with chromatin and the nuclear matrix during interphase and becomes associated with the condensed chromatin during mitosis. Chromatin-bound hOGG1 was found to be phosphorylated on a serine residue <italic>in vivo</italic> as revealed by staining with an anti-phosphoserine-specific antibody. Chromatin-associated hOGG1 was co-precipitated with an antibody against protein kinase C (PKC), suggesting that PKC is responsible for the phosphorylation event. Both purified and nuclear matrix-associated hOGG1 were shown to be substrates for PKC-mediated phosphorylation <italic>in vitro</italic>. This appears to be the first demonstration of a post-translational modification of hOGG1 <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Organisms are continuously exposed to reactive oxygen species generated as by-products of the respiratory chain, during inflammation and by exposure of cells to ionising radiation or oxidative stress conditions. The reaction of these molecules with DNA yields a wide variety of damage including strand breaks, abasic (AP) sites and oxidised bases. From a human health perspective, oxidative DNA damage has been implicated in mutagenesis, carcinogenesis and ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c2">2</xref>). Therefore, cells have developed specific repair mechanisms to counteract the biological effects of these lesions and the base excision repair pathway is the major pathway for correcting oxidative DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c3">3</xref>). Among the base lesions induced by oxidative stress, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) is probably the most critical residue due to its high abundance and ability to mispair with adenine, which can lead to a high frequency of spontaneous G:C &#x02192; T:A transversions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c5">5</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, three different enzymes cooperate to suppress spontaneous mutagenesis caused by 8-oxoG: (i) the DNA glycosylase&#x0002f;AP lyase Fpg (MutM) removes 8-oxoG from 8-oxoG:C base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c7">7</xref>); (ii) the DNA glycosylase MutY specifically removes A mispaired with 8-oxoG, introduced when 8-oxoG remains in the template during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c8">8</xref>); and (iii) MutT is an 8-oxo-dGTPase that prevents DNA polymerase-mediated incorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP opposite A in the template strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c9">9</xref>). Both MutY and MutT homologues have been identified in humans but are not apparent in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c11">11</xref>). Yeast and human cells contain OGG1, a sequence-unrelated functional homologue of the <italic>E.coli</italic> Fpg DNA glycosylase that exhibits a high specificity for 8-oxoG paired with C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c13">13</xref>). Both <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> OGG1 and <italic>E.coli</italic> Fpg deficiency give rise to a spontaneous mutator phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c15">15</xref>). Homozygous <italic>ogg</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> mice show a 10-fold elevated G:C &#x02192; T:A spontaneous transversion frequency in DNA from liver cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c17">17</xref>). G:C &#x02192; T:A transversions are characteristic of mutational spectra exhibited by human tumours with a defect in the tumour suppressor p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c18">18</xref>). Interestingly, mutations and polymorphisms in the human <italic>OGG1</italic> gene have been found to be associated with tumours from head, neck, lung and kidney cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c21">21</xref>).</p><p>hOGG1 has been purified to apparent homogeneity and the catalytic properties have been extensively investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c23">23</xref>). In addition, the X-ray structures of both the free hOGG1 enzyme as well as a catalytically inactive mutant bound to an 8-oxoG:C-containing DNA have recently been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c24">24</xref>,25). Structural analyses have shown that upon binding to DNA, the enzyme undergoes extensive local conformational changes associated with its strong preference for C in the opposite strand. Altogether, these studies have provided a detailed molecular understanding of the enzyme&#x02019;s biochemical properties. However, relatively little is known about the enzyme&#x02019;s <italic>in vivo</italic> functions, intracellular distribution and mode of expression.</p><p>In the present study, we demonstrate, using biochemical methods and immunofluorescence analysis, that during cell cycle interphase, hOGG1 becomes associated both with the chromatin and the nuclear matrix. The nuclear matrix is a dynamic RNA&#x02013;protein network that focally assembles many nuclear processes such as RNA transcription and splicing, DNA replication and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c26">26</xref>). During mitosis, hOGG1 follows the condensed chromatin. Furthermore, we show that hOGG1 is phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> on a serine residue and is subject to protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>. The chromatin-associated hOGG1 co-immunoprecipitates with PKC; this provides the first evidence for a post-translational modification of this repair enzyme.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and localisation studies</title><p>HeLa S3 cells were maintained in monolayer cultures in DMEM 4.5 g&#x0002f;l glucose medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal calf serum (Integro), 0.3 mg&#x0002f;ml glutamine, 100 U&#x0002f;ml penicillin and 100 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml streptomycin (BioWhittaker), at 37&#x000b0;C in 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere.

This and the corresponding &#x02018;empty&#x02019; EGFP vector were used to transfect HeLa S3 cells and cell line derivatives were isolated showing stable expression of the fusion protein (hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP) or EGFP. Examination of the stable hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP transfectant showed exclusive sorting of hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP to the nucleus with a stronger signal observed in the nucleoli of interphase cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f1">1</xref>F). During mitosis, from pro-metaphase to telophase, the hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP signal was localised to the condensed chromatin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f1">1</xref>G&#x02013;J). The sorting was dependent on the presence of the hOGG1 sequence as cells expressing EGFP protein alone showed fluorescence evenly distributed throughout the cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f1">1</xref>A&#x02013;E). Attempts to detect endogenous hOGG1 by immunofluorescence using anti-hOGG1 antibodies were unsuccessful. Similar localisation dynamics to condensed chromosomes have been reported with chromatin-associated proteins such as ATRX, BRG and hbrm (human SWI&#x0002f;SNF-like proteins), HA95 (homologue to the human PKA anchoring protein AKAP95) and DNA topoisomerase II&#x003b1;, which are all involved in various aspects of transcriptional regulation and DNA replication, DNA repair and mitotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c31">31</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>hOGG1 is bound to the nuclear matrix in interphase cells</title><p>As many proteins associated with the condensed chromatin during mitosis also bind to the core nuclear matrix, we asked if hOGG1 also would be associated with the matrix component. Asynchronously dividing HeLa hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP cells were sequentially extracted as described in the Materials and Methods to obtain cytoplasm, soluble chromatin and the nuclear matrix (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f2">2</xref>A). The protein extracts were analysed by western blotting. The fractionation procedure was controlled by immunoblotting with antibodies directed against lamin A&#x0002f;C, a nuclear matrix-associated protein, and histone H1, a chromatin-associated protein. Immunoblotting with anti-GFP and anti-hOGG1 antibodies, respectively, revealed hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP to be present in both the soluble chromatin and nuclear matrix fractions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f2">2</xref>A, lanes 2 and 4). No hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP was detected in the high salt wash employed prior to obtaining the matrix fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f2">2</xref>A, lane 3). The localisation of hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f2">2</xref>A, lane 1) probably reflects protein leakage from the nucleus during the cell lysis procedure as the cellular fluorescence studies showed hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP to be exclusively nuclear (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c13">13</xref>). In contrast, the EGFP protein was only detectable in the cytoplasmic fraction following the first Triton X-100 treatment (data not shown). To exclude any unspecific localisation due to the overexpression of the hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP fusion protein, similar experiments were also carried out scoring the endogenous hOGG1 protein in non-transfected HeLa S3 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f2">2</xref>B). Similar to the fusion protein, endogenous hOGG1 was also detected both in the chromatin and in the nuclear matrix fractions as judged by western blotting using an anti-hOGG1 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f2">2</xref>B, lanes 2 and 4). hOGG1 was absent in the 2 M NaCl wash (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f2">2</xref>B, lane 3) but leakage of the protein to the cytoplasmic fraction was observed also in this case (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f2">2</xref>B, lane 1). Thus, the results obtained with the fused and the free hOGG1 proteins were essentially identical, implying that the intracellular distribution of hOGG1 is not significantly affected by the C-terminal EGFP fusion extension. Similar results were also obtained when nuclear matrices were prepared using an alternative fractionation protocol according to Reyes <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c29">29</xref>) (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>hOGG1 is detected after <italic>in situ</italic> extraction of the core nuclear matrix</title><p>To further investigate the association of hOGG1 to the nuclear matrix, HeLa hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP cells were grown on coverslips and subjected to sequential extractions <italic>in situ</italic> using Triton X-100, DNase I, ammonium sulfate and high salt in order to obtain the nuclear matrix (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f3">3</xref>). The efficiency of chromatin digestion was indicated by the disappearance of the DAPI stain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f3">3</xref>a and d), while the integrity of the nuclear matrix was verified by immunostaining with lamin A&#x0002f;C antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f3">3</xref>c and f). DNase treatment of the cells partly removed the intranuclear localisation of hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP, thus confirming its association with the DNase-sensitive chromatin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f2">2</xref>A). However, a nuclear speckled pattern of hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP remained even after high salt treatment indicating that a significant proportion of the fusion protein was associated with the nuclear matrix (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f3">3</xref>b). No staining was detected for the HeLa EGFP cells subjected to identical treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f3">3</xref>e). EGFP staining was removed immediately after detergent treatment (data not shown).

This results in strand cleavage of a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing an 8-oxoG:C base pair (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f4">4</xref>A). hOGG1 activity was observed in the HeLa hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP-derived cytoplasmic and chromatin fractions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f4">4</xref>B, lanes 1 and 2) but no cleavage of the 8-oxoG:C substrate was detected in either the high salt wash (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f4">4</xref>B, lane 3) or the nuclear matrix fractions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f4">4</xref>B, lane 4), despite the presence of high amounts of hOGG1 in the latter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f2">2</xref>A, compare lanes 2 and 4). As the AP lyase activity associated with hOGG1 is quite weak, HAP1 endonuclease was added to the reaction mixture to force strand cleavage at AP sites in the DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f4">4</xref>B, lanes 5&#x02013;8). HAP1 cleaves DNA specifically at the 5&#x02032; side of abasic sites, generating fragments containing a 3&#x02032;-OH that migrate faster than the products of the AP lyase cleaving at the 3&#x02032; side (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f4">4</xref>B, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lanes 1 and 2). However, despite the increased cleavage efficiency observed in the cytoplasmic and chromatin fractions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f4">4</xref>B, lanes 5 and 6) no hOGG1 activity was detected in the high salt wash and the nuclear matrix fractions upon the addition of HAP1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f4">4</xref>B, lanes 7 and 8). Similar results were obtained for the non-transfected HeLa-derived extracts (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f4">4</xref>B and C). Addition of purified hOGG1 to the nuclear matrix fraction restores DNA glycosylase&#x0002f;AP lyase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f4">4</xref>B and C, compare lanes 9 and 10) thus excluding the possibility that the absence of hOGG1 activity is due to the presence of inhibitors, or the absence of specific partners or essential cofactors that may be necessary for efficient glycosylase activity. However, the lack of 8-oxoG:C DNA glycosylase activity in the nuclear matrix fraction was found to be caused by insolubility of hOGG1 in the matrix fraction effected by the extraction conditions. The hOGG1 could be solubilised by NP-40 extraction, but the enzyme was not recovered in an active form (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>The chromatin-associated <bold>hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP</bold> fusion protein is phosphorylated on a serine residue <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Cell cycle-dependent changes in subcellular localisation have often been correlated with changes in protein phosphorylation patterns as demonstrated for a number of proteins including ATRX, BRG and hbrm, and the Rb protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c33">33</xref>). The hOGG1 protein has several predicted phosphorylation sites for cAMP and cGMP-dependent kinases, casein kinase II and PKC and this prompted us to examine whether the localisation of hOGG1 could be related to the protein phosphorylation status. <italic>In vivo</italic> phosphorylation was examined by western blot analysis of each HeLa hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP fraction using an anti-phosphoserine antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f5">5</xref>A). Although the anti-GFP antibody did not reveal any obvious differences in the electrophoretic mobility of the hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP fusion protein in the various fractions, the anti-phosphoserine antibody detected a phosphorylated form of hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP, however, only in the chromatin fraction. Using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, no phosphorylation could be detected in any of the fractions (data not shown). Treatment of the purified hOGG1 protein or the different biochemical fractions with &#x003bb;-PPase did not have any significant effect on the hOGG1 enzymatic activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f5">5</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>The chromatin-associated <bold>hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP</bold> interacts with PKC</title><p>Previous studies have suggested a role for PKC phosphorylation in controlling protein interactions between the nuclear envelope and the chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c35">35</xref>). As hOGG1 contains potential PKC consensus sequences (S<sup>44</sup>FR, S<sup>211</sup>AR and T<sup>295</sup>NK), we investigated possible interactions between PKC and hOGG1 by attempts at co-immunoprecipitation using a monoclonal antibody against PKC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f6">6</xref>A). PKC was immunoprecipitated from the cytoplasmic and chromatin fractions using the monoclonal anti-PKC antibody, while hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP was immunoprecipitated by the polyclonal anti-GFP antibody from the cytoplasmic, chromatin and nuclear matrix fractions. However, hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with PKC from the chromatin fraction. Weak co-immunoprecipitation could also occasionally be observed from the cytoplasmic fraction. In contrast, no co-immunoprecipitation was observed with EGFP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f6">6</xref>B, cytoplasmic fraction that contains all the EGFP). These results demonstrate that PKC and hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP can be co-immunoprecipitated from a low salt, DNase-treated chromatin extract of HeLa hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Purified hOGG1 and nuclear matrix-associated <bold>hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP</bold> are phosphorylated by PKC <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>We also investigated if hOGG1 could be phosphorylated by PKC <italic>in vitro</italic> and, if so, whether such modification would affect its catalytic activity. Purified recombinant hOGG1 did not demonstrate any autophosphorylation activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f7">7</xref>, lane 3) but was a substrate for phosphorylation by a mixture of &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;&#x000a0;and &#x003b3; PKC isoforms <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f7">7</xref>, lane 1). The phosphorylation did not appear to have any significant effect on hOGG1 enzymatic activity as assayed by the cleavage of the 8-oxoG:C-containing double-stranded oligonucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f7">7</xref>A, lower panel, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lane 1).</p><p>We next investigated whether the hOGG1 protein obtained by the cellular fractionation was a substrate for PKC. HeLa cells expressing hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP were fractionated as described (i.e. see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f2">2</xref>) and each fraction was incubated with PKC isoforms mixture <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f7">7</xref>B). hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP was identified by the staining of the co-migrating band with Coomassie Blue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f7">7</xref>B, lane 5). No phosphorylation of hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP was observed in the chromatin fraction although the labelling pattern clearly suggested the presence of kinase activities (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f7">7</xref>B, compare lanes 1 and 3). In contrast, no endogenous kinase activity was detected in the nuclear matrix fraction (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f7">7</xref>B, lane 2). However, the resident hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP fusion protein was indeed a substrate for <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation by PKC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f7">7</xref>B, lane 4). We also tested if phosphorylation of the fractionated hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP protein would recover any enzymatic activity. Treatment of the chromatin-associated hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP with PKC did not have any significant effect on the enzymatic activity of the fusion protein (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f7">7</xref>B, lower panel, compare lanes 1 and 3). Furthermore, as expected, enzymatic activity of the insoluble nuclear matrix-associated hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f7">7</xref>B, lane 2) could not be restored by PKC phosphorylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf347f7">7</xref>B, lane 4).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In order to gain further insights into the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of the hOGG1 protein, we have examined its subcellular distribution in form of a fusion to EGFP (hOGG1&#x02013;EGFP). We report that hOGG1 is localised to condensed chromatin at the onset of mitosis from pro-metaphase to telophase. Co-localisation of hOGG1 with mitotic chromosomes resembles that of several other nuclear proteins including the SWI&#x0002f;SNF-like protein ATRX, the heterochomatin-binding protein HP1 and DNA topoisomerase II&#x003b1;. These proteins are all involved in transcriptional regulation through an effect on chromatin remodelling, and are also believed to be involved in DNA replication and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c37">37</xref>). Our findings suggest that hOGG1 may be important during mitosis as part of a mitotic mutation avoidance system similar to that described previously for the mismatch repair proteins in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c38">38</xref>) and the nucleotide excision repair proteins in <italic>Schizosaccharyomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c39">39</xref>).</p><p>The nuclear matrix is viewed as a dynamic RNA&#x02013;protein network, which not only hosts transcription and replication complexes but also proteins involved in DNA repair. Among the multitude of enzymes involved in repair processes, PARP, mutant p53 and DNA topoisomerase II&#x003b1; have been shown to preferentially localise to the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c43">43</xref>). Furthermore, several proteins including Ku70, Fanconi Anemia proteins and BLM in complex with hRAD51 have been shown to bind to the nuclear matrix in a DNA damage and cell cycle-regulated manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c46">46</xref>). In this report, we show that hOGG1 is associated with the DNase-sensitive chromatin as well as the nuclear matrix during interphase. The chromatin-associated hOGG1 displays 8-oxoG:C DNA glycosylase&#x0002f;AP lyase activity and therefore most probably works <italic>in vivo</italic> to repair the oxidation-associated lesions in genomic DNA. The functional significance of the association of hOGG1 with the nuclear matrix is more difficult to interpret. We were unable to measure any 8-oxoG:C DNA glycosylase activity associated with the nuclear matrix but this can be ascribed to precipitation and inactivation of the hOGG1 protein during the extraction procedure. It is still likely that hOGG1 remains active in the nuclear matrix <italic>in vivo</italic> and participates in base excision repair of oxidative damage that could arise for instance at scaffold&#x0002f;matrix (S&#x0002f;MAR) regions. Repair activity at these sequences was suggested previously for PARP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c40">40</xref>). More recent observations demonstrating that S&#x0002f;MARs are hypersensitive to DNA breakage also support the possibility of excision repair going on in these sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c47">47</xref>). It has also been proposed that the nuclear matrix is a site where damaged ends meet to be repaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c48">48</xref>).</p><p>The observed association of hOGG1 with the nuclear matrix also raises the question about other roles of the protein, for instance in mRNA synthesis and processing and&#x0002f;or replication. Several recent genetic and biochemical studies provide evidence for a dual role of DNA glycosylases in both transcriptional control and DNA repair. The human uracil DNA glycosylase UDG was shown to negatively regulate E2F-mediated transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c49">49</xref>). More recently, Missero <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c50">50</xref>) described an unexpected role for the human T:G mismatch specific thymine DNA glycosylase TDG as a transcriptional repressor. In addition, the three-dimensional structure of the <italic>E.coli</italic> DNA glycosylase AlkA revealed the presence of an N-terminal &#x003b2;-sheet&#x0002f;&#x003b1;-helix domain very similar to the structure of the conserved tandem repeat of the TFIID TATA-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c51">51</xref>). In comparative analysis, we observed that AlkA and hOGG1 show very similar three-dimensional structures despite limited sequence similarity. This observation, taken together with the present study showing the localisation of hOGG1 to putative transcription sites (i.e. condensed chromatin and nuclear matrix), are consistent with an as yet undescribed role of hOGG1 in transcriptional regulation.</p><p>The possibility that a post-translational modification could be correlated with the dynamic localisation of hOGG1 to either the chromatin or the nuclear matrix during interphase was investigated using anti-phosphoserine or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The results show that chromatin-associated hOGG1 is phosphorylated on a serine residue whereas the nuclear matrix-associated hOGG1 appears unphosphorylated. Phosphorylation experiments showed that the nuclear matrix-associated hOGG1 could be a substrate for PKC <italic>in vitro</italic> whereas the chromatin-associated hOGG1 was not. In addition, immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the expressed hOGG1 binds to PKC in the chromatin extract. These findings suggest that the phosphorylation of the chromatin-associated hOGG1 could be mediated by PKC. PKC has been reported to phosphorylate and modulate the enzymatic functions of a number of DNA repair proteins including DNA polymerase &#x003b2;, RPA, DNA topoisomerase II&#x003b1; and HAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf347c55">55</xref>). However, we could not detect any significant alteration of enzymatic function correlated with the phosphorylation event, suggesting that phosphorylation could be involved in protein re-localisation rather than in modulation of the enzymatic function. On the other hand, it is difficult to assess the extent of the phosphorylation reaction and more detailed kinetic studies are needed to conclude firmly on the effects on the enzymatic reactions. Nevertheless, the present study provides clear evidence for the existence of a phosphorylated subfraction of hOGG1 in the cell, which preferentially associates with interphasic chromatin.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that hOGG1 is dynamically regulated with respect to its nuclear localisation, such that the DNase-sensitive chromatin as well as the nuclear matrix appears to be the preferential sites of association during interphase, while the protein re-localises to condensed chromatin during mitosis. These results suggest that the 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase hOGG1 may be involved in more aspects of DNA metabolism and repair than previously assumed and possibly also have other functions than just removing 8-oxoG from DNA. In this context, it might be worth mentioning that hOGG1 has a strong affinity for C&#x0002f;C mismatches in DNA (I.Morland, M.Bj&#x000f8;r&#x000e5;s and E. Seeberg, unpublished data). We have also shown that hOGG1 becomes phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> and that PKC is likely to be responsible for this phosphorylation reaction. Phosphorylation may direct compartmentalisation of hOGG1 although further experiments are required to be more conclusive about the exact role of the phosphorylation event. Nevertheless, this appears to be the first demonstration of a post-translational modification of hOGG1, similarly as has been described for many other proteins being involved in DNA repair.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf347f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Subcellular distribution of hOGG1.
