RPA2 is hyperphosphorylated in response to various DNA-damaging agents and also phosphorylated in a cell-cycle-dependent manner during S- and M-phase, primarily at two CDK consensus sites, S23 and S29. Here we generated two monoclonal phospho-specific antibodies directed against these CDK sites. These phospho-specific RPA2-(P)-S23 and RPA2-(P)-S29 antibodies recognized mitotically phosphorylated RPA2 with high specificity. In addition, the RPA2-(P)-S23 antibody recognized the S-phase-specific phosphorylation of RPA2, suggesting that during S-phase only S23 is phosphorylated, whereas during M-phase both CDK sites, S23 and S29, are phosphorylated. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the mitotic phosphorylation of RPA2 starts at the onset of mitosis, and dephosphorylation occurs during late cytokinesis. In mitotic cells treated with ionizing radiation (IR), we observed a rapid hyperphosphorylation of RPA2 in addition to its mitotic phosphorylation at S23 and S29, associated with a significant change in the subcellular localization of RPA. Our data also indicate that the RPA2 hyperphosphorylation in response to IR is facilitated by the activity of both ATM and DNA-PK, and is associated with activation of the Chk2 pathway.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA in cells is challenged by various environmental and cellular stresses causing DNA lesions. Therefore, mechanisms to maintain genome stability are important for cell viability and survival. DNA damage induces numerous cellular responses and leads to cell-cycle arrest, DNA repair or the induction of programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In mammalian cells, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinases (PIKKs) including DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), Ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated protein (ATM) and Ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) play important roles in the DNA damage checkpoint regulation following DNA damage. They phosphorylate several key proteins involved in the DNA damage response such as the tumor suppressor protein p53, checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2, histone H2AX and replication protein A (RPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>).</p><p>RPA, the human single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein, is a stable heterotrimer consisting of three subunits with apparent molecular masses of 70, 32 and 14 kDa (RPA1, RPA2 and RPA3, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). RPA is one of the key players in various processes of DNA metabolism including the initiation and elongation of DNA replication, homologous recombination (HR), nucleotide excision repair (NER) and long-patch base excision repair (BER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8">6&#x02013;8</xref>). Studies in yeast and mammalian systems indicate that RPA is also involved in DNA damage recognition and checkpoint activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>). The RPA&#x02013;ssDNA complex generated in response to DNA lesions is implicated in localization of ATR&#x02013;ATRIP to sites of DNA damage and Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 together with TopBP1 to sites of DNA damage for the activation of ATR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14 B15">12&#x02013;15</xref>). Following this, the RPA2 subunit undergoes hyperphosphorylation in response to DNA-damaging agents, such as UV- and &#x003b3;-irradiation, DNA-alkylating agents and replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">16&#x02013;18</xref>). Various members of the PIKK family such as DNA-PK, ATM and ATR have been found to phosphorylate the N-terminal residues of RPA2 <italic>in vitro</italic> and putatively <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19 B20 B21">17&#x02013;21</xref>). A number of different possible phosphorylation sites in the N-terminus of RPA2 were identified using mass spectrometry analysis and 2D phosphopeptide mapping, which revealed four phosphorylation sites (S4, S8, T21 and S33) and a fifth site at either S11, S12 or S13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). It has been demonstrated <italic>in vivo</italic> that an RPA2 mutant that mimics the hyperphosphorylation at the N-terminus of RPA2 is unable to localize to the replication centers in cells, but is capable of association with DNA damage foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). This is consistent with the finding that RPA2 hyperphosphorylation after DNA damage disrupts RPA interaction with DNA polymerase &#x003b1; <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Previous reports suggested that in response to DNA damage, hyperphosphorylation of RPA2 disrupts its association with replication centres during S-phase and contributes to the inhibition of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>RPA2 is also phosphorylated in a cell-cycle-dependent manner during S- and M-phase primarily at two CDK consensus sites, S23 and S29, by Cdk1-cyclin B or Cdk2-cyclin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27 B28 B29">26&#x02013;29</xref>). Replacement of the CDK consensus sites S23 and S29 by alanine abolishes RPA2 phosphorylation during S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Although RPA is phosphorylated during initiation of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), N-terminal deletion (residues 2&#x02013;30), or alanine substitutions at S23 and S29 of RPA2 had no significant effect on the ability of RPA to bind ssDNA or to support SV40 DNA replication <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In contrast, recent findings suggested that phosphorylated RPA has a significantly decreased ability to bind and destabilize duplex DNA compared to the unphosphorylated form of RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Additional data showed further that interactions of the N termini of RPA1 and RPA2 are probably important to prevent interference of the phosphorylated RPA2 with the functions of the core DNA-binding domain of RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Moreover, RPA purified from mitotic cells showed a reduced binding to ATM, DNA polymerase &#x003b1;, and DNA-PK as compared to unphosphorylated recombinant RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>Although the response of RPA to various DNA damaging agents has been investigated for more than a decade, our knowledge relates to cells in interphase and far less is known about the DNA damage response of RPA in mitosis. To investigate the role of RPA2 phosphorylation in response to DNA damage in mitosis, we have established two novel monoclonal phospho-specific antibodies, RPA2-(P)-S23 and RPA2-(P)-S29, and examined the localization of RPA throughout mitosis. Here, we demonstrate that when DNA damage occurs in mitosis, mitotically phosphorylated RPA2 is additionally hyperphosphorylated and re-localizes to damaged chromosomal DNA. In addition, our results show that ATM and DNA-PK are required for RPA2 hyperphosphorylation in mitosis and that this is associated with an activation of the Chk2-pathway. On the basis of these observations, we propose that hyperphosphorylation of RPA2 may play a role in DNA repair during mitosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and cell lines</title><p>Cells were maintained at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Altogether, these findings let us suggest that during S-phase only S23 is phosphorylated whereas during M-phase both CDK sites, S23 and S29, are phosphorylated.</p><p>Since both newly generated phospho-specific RPA2 antibodies were successfully employed in immunoblot, they were also used to investigate the localization of mitotically phosphorylated RPA2 throughout different stages of M-phase by immunofluorescence microscopy. It has been previously reported that mitotic phosphorylation appears at the G2- to M-phase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), but how mitotically phosphorylated RPA is distributed in comparison to heterotrimeric RPA, and, moreover, when the dephosphorylation of RPA2 takes place are still under discussion. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, RPA2 was excluded from the mitotic chromosomes throughout mitosis (for comparison see &#x003b1;-tubulin staining in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp605/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). The two other subunits of RPA, RPA1 and RPA3, were also excluded from the chromosomes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp605/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3A</ext-link>). In addition, using both phospho-specific RPA2 antibodies, a sharp decrease of mitotically phosphorylated RPA2 was observed at the end of cytokinesis when chromosomal DNA de-condenses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Moreover, these data reveal that in early G1-phase RPA2 is dephosphorylated and re-enters the newly reformed nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). These findings indicate that all three events, dephosphorylation of mitotic RPA2, de-condensation of mitotic chromosomes and re-localization of RPA, occur simultaneously. However, the correlation between the RPA2 dephosphorylation and the de-condensation of mitotic chromosomes needs to be examined further.</p></sec><sec><title>Mitotic RPA is hyperphosphorylated and changes its localization in response to DNA damage</title><p>The role of RPA in DNA replication and DNA damage response during interphase has been investigated for more than a decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). However, far less is known about the response of RPA when the DNA damage occurs in mitosis. To investigate the response of RPA after DNA damage in mitosis, asynchronous or mitotically arrested HeLa S3 cells were either mock- or IR treated. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, treatment of asynchronous and mitotic cells with IR leads to RPA2 hyperphosphorylation, detected as a slower migrating RPA2 isoform (marked as form <italic>hp</italic>) and with an anti-RPA2-(P)-S4/8 antibody. Interestingly, both newly generated anti-RPA2-(P)-S23 and anti-RPA2-(P)-S29 antibodies recognized RPA2 hyperphosphorylation only in mitotic cells exposed to IR. These findings indicate that, in addition to its mitotic phosphorylation at S23 and S29, RPA2 becomes hyperphosphorylated when DNA damage is induced in mitosis. Since earlier reports showed alterations of RPA localization in response to DNA damage during interphase, we wanted to determine whether RPA re-localization takes place in mitosis. Therefore, we carried out immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of mitotic cells subjected to &#x003b3;-irradiation. In unirradiated mitotic cells, RPA2 was excluded from prometaphase chromosomes, as determined by staining with anti-RPA2-(P)-S23, anti-RPA2-(P)-S29 and anti-RPA2 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, mock-treated panels). In contrast, in cells exposed to IR, mitotically phosphorylated RPA2 changes its distribution and co-localizes with chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, IR treated panels), which was observed within 20 min post-irradiation (data not shown). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>RPA2 is hyperphosphorylated in response to IR in mitosis.

The Cdk1 activity of the mock-treated sample in absence of roscovitine was arbitrarily defined as 100% Cdk1 activity.

The purity of the soluble and chromatin-bound protein fractions was verified by immunoblot using anti-GAPDH and anti-H3-(P)-S10 antibodies, respectively. Chromatin-bound proteins were solubilized by sonication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B), or alternatively by DNase I treatment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp605/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3B</ext-link>). In the case of mock-treated cells, mitotically phosphorylated RPA2 was present mainly in the soluble fraction and with much lower intensity in the wash fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp605/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3B</ext-link>). In addition, trace amounts of &#x02018;basal&#x02019; RPA2 was detected in the chromosomal fraction. In contrast to unirradiated cells, the distribution of RPA2 between the different fractions was altered after IR treatment, with hyperphosphorylated RPA2 being detected predominantly in the chromatin-bound fraction. In the remaining insoluble fraction after DNAse I treatment, no RPA subunit was detected either in mock- or IR treated cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp605/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3B</ext-link>). These observations further support our findings that RPA binds to chromosomal DNA in mitotic cells in response to IR whereas in unirradiated mitotic cells RPA does not. In addition, we found that the RPA1 and RPA3 subunits were redistributed in a pattern similar to RPA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp605/DC1">Supplementary S3A and S3B</ext-link>), which suggests that RPA in mitosis is present as a heterotrimeric complex. The localization data on all three RPA subunits contradict previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>) but are consistent with the finding that RPA could be biochemically purified as a stable heterotrimeric complex from mitotic cells by others and by us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). The results obtained here indicate that DNA damage in mitotic cells leads to an association of RPA with chromatin. In addition to its mitotic phosphorylation, RPA2 is also hyperphosphorylated after exposure of cells in M-phase to ionizing radiation.</p></sec><sec><title>S23 and S29 are not phosphorylated in response to DNA damage caused by IR in asynchronous cells</title><p>Recently published results indicate that CDKs and PIKKs are involved in RPA2 phosphorylation in response to genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). To investigate whether IR treated asynchronous cells exhibit a similar response, we analyzed RPA2 phosphorylation status in mock- or IR treated cells in the presence or absence of the CDK inhibitor roscovitine. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, no RPA2 phosphorylation at S29 was detected in asynchronous cells. The low S23 phosphorylation signal of the <italic>sp</italic> migrating RPA2 form was due to the presence of S-phase cells and was not perturbed by IR or roscovitine treatment. RPA2 hyperphosphorylation and phosphorylation of ATM, Chk2 and H2AX (at S1981, T68 and S139, respectively) were seen only in IR treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). Strikingly, hyperphosphorylation of RPA2 and phosphorylation of H2AX, but not ATM and Chk2, exhibited elevated levels with increasing doses of roscovitine after IR treatment. In addition, inhibition of Cdk1 activity by roscovitine was monitored using immunoprecipitated Cdk1 as a kinase source and histone H1 as a substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, bottom). The Cdk1-associated incorporation of [<sup>32</sup>P] phosphate into histone H1 was strongly reduced when cells were treated with increasing doses of roscovitine. This result is in agreement with previous findings that roscovitine inhibits CDKs and forms a tight complex, which can be immunoprecipitated, and that the CDK inhibition can be measured in a kinase assay <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). In contrast, IR treatment itself did not display any noticeable effect on the Cdk1 activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). These findings suggest that CDKs are not involved in RPA2 hyperphosphorylations in response of interphase cells to IR, which is in agreement with the knowledge that CDKs are not activated after IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>DNA damage during mitosis leads to delay in mitotic progression and checkpoint activation</title><p>To further investigate the response of human RPA to DNA damage in mitosis, mitotically arrested HeLa S3 cells were either mock- or IR treated with 10 Gy (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp605/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link> for cell viability) and then released from nocodazole arrest to allow cells to progress throughout mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). In the case of mock-treated cells, dephosphorylation of mitotically phosphorylated RPA2 was detected 1-h post-release. By 3-h post-nocodazole release the majority of RPA2 was found in the dephosphorylated RPA2 form (form b) consistent with the cells having exited mitosis. Mitotic cells exposed to IR showed a delay in dephosphorylation of mitotically phosphorylated RPA2 in comparison to mock-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp605/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5</ext-link>, quantification of the mitotic RPA2 phosphorylated form). IR treatment of mitotic cells resulted in the appearance of RPA2 hyperphosphorylation 1-h post-release, which decreased over time and was not detected after 4-h post-release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Interestingly, a similar pattern of dephosphorylation was observed for the mitotically phosphorylated RPA2, suggesting that both phosphorylation signals are abolished when cells exit mitosis.

Seckel, A-T and LC cells were enriched in mitosis using two consecutive cell-cycle arrests (thymidine followed by nocodazole block), followed by mock or IR treatment (10 Gy). Cell extracts were prepared 1-h post-irradiation. RPA2 was analyzed by immunoblot using the indicated antibodies. The expression levels of ATM and ATR were detected with anti-ATM and anti-ATR antibodies. A phospho-specific anti-ATM-(P)-S1981 antibody was employed to monitor DNA damage-dependent phoshorylation of ATM. Seckel and A-T cell lines stably transfected with full length ATR (labeled as &#x02018;+ATR&#x02019;) or ATM (labeled &#x02018;+ATM&#x02019;) cDNA expression vectors were established, respectively.

Both drugs were applied to cells in a manner similar to wortmannin. The IC<sub>50</sub> values for inhibition of ATR kinase activity by NU7441 or KU-55933 are greater than 100 &#x003bc;M, and ATR activity should not be inhibited under the present conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, inhibition of ATM by KU-55933 and DNA-PK by NU7441 caused a strong reduction of RPA2 hyperphosphorylation but did not affect the mitotic phosphorylation. Similar results were obtained when cells were incubated with caffeine (data not shown). An amount of 20 &#x000b5;M of DNA-PK and ATM inhibitors did not completely inhibit hyperphosphorylation of RPA2 in IR treated cells whereas the same doses of wortmannin reduced the hyperphosphorylation of RPA2 to a level below detection.</p><p>To investigate the involvement of the ATR kinase, Seckel, A-T and control (LC) cells were compared for their ability to hyperphosphorylate RPA2 in response to IR in mitotic cells. The expression levels of both PIKKs were monitored using anti-ATM and anti-ATR antibodies. Examination of RPA2 in mitotic cells after exposure to IR revealed an impaired hyphosphorylation in A-T cells whereas Seckel and LC cells showed a robust RPA2 response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). Introduction of exogenic ATM into A-T cells fully restores their ability to hyperphosphorylate RPA2 after IR treatment to the levels similar to those seen in Seckel and LC cells. Seckel cells stably expressing transgenic ATR showed no significant increase in the RPA2 hyperphosphorylation in response to IR. Following IR treatment, phosphorylation of ATM at S1981 was observed in Seckel, LC and A-T cells stably transfected with ATM. Our results suggest that the mitotic hyperphosphorylation of RPA2 in response to IR is mediated by ATM and DNA-PK rather than ATR.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The role of the cell-cycle-dependent phosphorylation of RPA has been in the centre of interest in the fields of DNA replication, DNA repair and DNA damage signaling for more than a decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The establishment of phospho-specific antibodies has previously provided a better understanding of DNA damage-dependent RPA phosphorylation. To enhance the knowledge of the cell-cycle regulation of RPA, two novel monoclonal RPA2 antibodies were produced against two characterized CDK sites, S23 and S29, RBP-8H3 and RBP-8C7, respectively. Both phospho-specific antibodies recognized mitotically phosphorylated RPA2, confirming that mitotic phosphorylation of RPA2 includes phosphorylation on S23 and S29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The RPA2-(P)-S23 antibody also detected a characteristic RPA2 isoform present during S-phase, however with lower intensity. This would be consistent with a smaller fraction of RPA2 being phosphorylated in S-phase cells compared to mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> phosphorylation using Cdk1 and various purified RPA2 phosphorylation site mutants indicated that S23 or S29 are phosphorylated by this kinase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp605/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>), which supports the findings of other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and that both monoclonal antibodies presented here effectively discriminate between the two sites. Our results suggest that S23 is phosphorylated in S- and M-phase, whereas S29 phosphorylation takes place only during M-phase. These findings are in agreement with results of Fang and Newport showing that RPA2 shares phosphorylation sites in S-phase and mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). They also identified an additional site specifically phosphorylated in mitosis by Cdk1, but did not determine the exact site <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis revealed that both antibodies are very suitable for microscopic analyses. The mitotic phosphorylation of RPA2 lasts throughout mitosis until late stages of M-phase suggesting a specific dephosphorylation mechanism of RPA2 late in mitosis as supported by the analyses of mitotic spindles in parallel (for &#x003b1;-tubulin staining see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp605/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). Mitotically phosphorylated RPA is excluded from chromosomes and the nuclear scaffold and is maintained within the soluble cellular fraction. This might be necessary to avoid possible interference of RPA with mitotic processes such as condensation of chromosomes. It has been shown that mitotically phosphorylated RPA binds to dsDNA with lower affinity than non-phosphorylated RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Late in cytokinesis dephosphorylation of RPA2 takes place, probably during chromosome de-condensation, and RPA2 dephosphorylated at S23 and S29 re-enters the newly formed nucleus. Our findings and studies of other researchers have shown that the RPA expression levels do not fluctuate during the cell cycle, especially during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>). These data lead us to hypothesize that, most likely at the end of cytokinesis, a rapid dephosphorylation of RPA2 takes place, rather than proteolysis and new synthesis of RPA2 and its subunits. Since RPA2 is phosphorylated during the entire M-phase (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp605/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link> for details), we propose that the phospho-specific antibodies RPA2-(P)-S23 and RPA2-(P)-S29 described here should be excellent M-phase markers.</p><p>The response of RPA to various DNA-damaging events is well established in interphase cells, but very little is known about its response to DNA damage that occurs during M-phase. Using phospho-specific RPA2 antibodies, we observed, in addition to phosphorylation at S23 and S29, a rapid RPA2 hyperphosphorylation response following IR treatment during mitosis. Moreover, RPA changes its subcellular localization in response to IR, from chromatin-excluded to chromatin-associated. In the case of UV treatment (dose of 5&#x02013;15 J/m<sup>2</sup>), no RPA2 hyperphosphorylation and DNA damage-induced changes in localization were observed in mitotic cells (data not shown). These findings indicate that RPA might be involved in the cellular DNA damage response and DNA repair processes during mitosis, supporting its role in DSBs repair pathways found in interphase cells. Anantha <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) showed that genotoxic stress generated in or before S-phase by camptothecin and bleomycin caused RPA2 hyperphosphorylation and phosphorylation at S29. They suggested that cell-cycle-dependent phosphorylation is a requirement for the hyperphosphorylation in response to DNA damage. In contrast, our results did not find an involvement of CDKs in the RPA2 hyperphosphorylation after IR treatment in asynchronous cells. First, the RPA2 hyperphosphorylation mobility shift observed in asynchronous cells exposed to IR did not comprise phosphorylation at S23 and S29. Secondly, the level of RPA2 hyperphosphorylation was elevated in IR and roscovotine-treated cells further supporting our findings. This is consistent with the knowledge that the cellular response to DNA damage after IR includes the degradation of Cdc25A and a lack of activation of CDKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). The apparent contradiction may reflect different requirements for DNA damage signaling after the different DNA damaging agents used: IR [this study and those reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>)], and camptothecin and bleomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Contrary to interphase cells, after IR treatment of cells in mitosis, the hyperphosphorylated, shifted form of RPA2 contained phosphorylated S29 most likely since mitotic RPA2 is already modified by CDKs. In agreement with our result, S29 phosphorylation of RPA2 was also observed in bleomycin-treated mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>).</p><p>DNA damage occurring during mitosis leads to checkpoint activation and a delay in mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68 B69 B70">68&#x02013;70</xref>). We observed an IR-induced delay in dephosphorylation of mitotic RPA when cells pass through M-phase. This was due to a prolonged mitotic progression. However, hyperphosphorylation and CDK-dependent phosphorylation of RPA2 was only observed in mitotic cells exposed to IR. When cells entered the new cell cycle, RPA2 hyperphosphorylation, the mitotic shift of RPA2 and phosphorylation of H3 at position S10 were diminished suggesting that only cells with repaired DSBs might enter G1. Liu and Weaver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) showed that the earliest RPA2 hyperphosphorylation was detected in interphase cells 45 min post-IR treatment with a dose of 50 Gy. In contrast, using lower doses such as 10 Gy, RPA2 hyperphosphorylation was not detected until 2 h and peaked at 3&#x02013;4 h after IR treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>). Strikingly, we observed IR-induced hyperphosphorylation of RPA2 already at 15 min post-treatment (starting at 5&#x02013;10 min, data not shown) in both mitotically arrested cells and cells released from mitotic block. These results indicate that mitotic cells are able to induce RPA2 hyperphosphorylation in response to IR treatment more rapidly than interphase cells. Mitosis is a very short and vulnerable cell-cycle stage, which may require a very fast DNA damage response by DNA repair proteins including RPA. Interestingly, only IR treated cells released from the mitotic block showed Chk1 and Chk2 activation, whereas nocodazole-arrested cells exhibited only Chk2 activation. These results suggest that in order to activate an IR-induced DNA damage response and subsequently Chk1, cells might have to progress through mitosis and pass the spindle checkpoint. We could show the activation of the spindle checkpoint in progressing mitotic cells treated with IR by monitoring BubR1 phosphorylation status. In contrast, in response to IR, Chk2 activation might be triggered independently from the Chk1 pathway during mitosis. It has been shown that both downstream checkpoint kinases are differently regulated in response to DNA damage during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>). Our data suggest that the DNA damage response of RPA2 is associated with Chk2 activation in mitotic cells. This is in line with a previous report, which proposed that mitotic entry after IR is linked with inactivation and dephosphorylation of Chk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>). The results presented here are further supported by findings of Zachos <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>), who examined the mitotic function of Chk1 using the chicken DT40 system. They proposed a role for Chk1 in the spindle checkpoint, specifically in delaying anaphase onset by regulation of Aurora-B and BubR1. This would suggest that cells which pass the spindle checkpoint are able to activate Chk1. Using a Chk1 inhibitor in interphase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>), the inability of Chk1 activity to modulate IR-induced RPA2 hyperphosphorylation in different cell lines was observed, which is also in line with our findings.</p><p>The results presented here reveal that in mitotic cells, hyperphosphorylation of RPA2 in response to IR is mediated through ATM and DNA-PK. In both cases, the inhibition of either ATM or DNA-PK, but not ATR, leads to reduction of RPA2 hyperphosphorylation in M-phase cells after IR treatment. Both members of the PIKK family are also involved in the cellular response to DSBs, and have been shown in interphase cells to phosphorylate RPA2 <italic>in vitro</italic> and/or <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>). We propose that IR-induced RPA2 hyperphosphorylation in mitosis can be mediated by both ATM and DNA-PK activities.</p><p>Taken together, our results indicate the involvement of RPA in a DNA repair process in response to DNA damage occurring in mitosis. It will be interesting in future experiments to assess the precise roles of RPA in response to ionizing radiation in mitotic cells, including a putative function in promoting DSB repair during mitosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp605/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp605_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkp605_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="gkp605_SUPPLEMENTARY_MATERIAL_description2009.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Irish Research Council for Science Engineering and Technology (IRCSET); INTAS (Brussels, Belgium), Health Research Board (HRB), Ireland; Science Foundation Ireland (SFI).
