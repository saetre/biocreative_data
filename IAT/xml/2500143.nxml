Cholesterol-enriched membrane domains, such as caveolae, regulate association of SFK with the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), which is needed for kinase activation and mitogenic signaling. PAG, a ubiquitously expressed member of the transmembrane adaptor protein family, is known to negatively regulate SFK signaling though binding to Csk. We report that PAG modulates PDGFR levels in caveolae and SFK mitogenic signaling through a Csk-independent mechanism. Regulation of SFK mitogenic activity by PAG requires the first N-terminal 97 aa (PAG-N), which include the extracellular and transmembrane domains, palmitoylation sites, and a short cytoplasmic sequence. We also show that PAG-N increases ganglioside GM1 levels at the cell surface and, thus, displaces PDGFR from caveolae, a process that requires the ganglioside-specific sialidase Neu-3. In conclusion, PAG regulates PDGFR membrane partitioning and SFK mitogenic signaling by modulating GM1 levels within caveolae independently from Csk.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: CEF, caveolae-enriched fractions; CTxB, cholera toxin subunit B; DANA, 2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; PDGFR, PDGF receptor; SFK, Src family protein tyrosine kinases; TEM, transmission electron microscopy.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases of the Src family (Src family protein tyrosine kinases [SFK]) play important roles in signal transduction induced by a large number of extracellular stimuli including growth factors, integrins, and cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin, 2001</xref>). For example, they control cellular responses induced by PDGF such as mitogenesis, survival, and cytoskeleton rearrangement. In contrast to several mitogens, PDGF-induced SFK activation does not have an impact on the Ras&#x02013;MAPK pathway but, rather, controls <italic>c-myc</italic> expression that is needed for cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bromann et al., 2004</xref>). Several Src substrates promoting mitogenic signaling have been characterized, including Shc, Stat3, Vav2, and Abl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bromann et al., 2004</xref>). Rac has been further identified as an important element of Abl signaling, and we have shown that Src-induced <italic>c-myc</italic> expression and cell cycle progression need Rac/Jun N-terminal kinase and Rac&#x02013;NADPH oxidase signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boureux et al., 2005</xref>). Intriguingly, requirement of SFK is also dependent on functional p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broome and Courtneidge, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Furstoss et al., 2002</xref>). Although not completely understood, data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Niu et al. (2005)</xref> suggest that Stat3 mediates p53 down-regulation, an event which is required for late G1 progression. Nevertheless, additional regulatory mechanisms might be envisaged.</p><p>How Src induces signaling specificity is not clearly established. Although phosphorylation of appropriate substrates may be part of the mechanism, spatial regulation could also be implicated. Indeed, SFK localization at focal adhesions is crucial for cell adhesion and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frame, 2004</xref>), and accumulation in plasma membrane lipid rafts is apparently important for T and B cell receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Janes et al., 1999</xref>). Lipid rafts are somewhat controversial structures, defined as microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids which concentrate and regulate signaling proteins at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horejsi, 2005</xref>). In nonlymphoid cells, this function may be partially ensured by caveolae. These membrane invaginations are composed of cholesterol, sphingolipids, structural proteins of the caveolin family, and signaling molecules. They play crucial roles in signal transduction induced by growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pike, 2005</xref>). In fibroblasts, they are highly abundant, regulate the localization of PDGF receptors (PDGFR), and contain probably &#x0003e;25% of the SFK present in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Veracini et al., 2006</xref>). We have recently reported that these domains regulate SFK mitogenic signaling through SFK&#x02013;PDGFR complex formation. In contrast, caveolae do not control PDGF-induced SFK signaling leading to F-actin assembly for dorsal ruffles formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Veracini et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, proteins that regulate tyrosine kinases in such membrane domains may play important roles in signaling specificity.</p><p>Src activity is subjected to a strict control based on intramolecular interactions of its SH2 domain with pTyr527 (phosphorylated Tyr527; referred to the avian Src) and of the SH3 domain with a linker domain between the SH2 and the catalytic core that keep the kinase in a closed and inactive conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boggon and Eck, 2004</xref>). Phosphorylation of Tyr527 at the C terminus by the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Csk is crucial for SFK inactivation. Indeed, <italic>Csk</italic> inactivation in mice causes aberrant SFK activity and lethality during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Imamoto and Soriano, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nada et al., 1993</xref>). However, how Csk phosphorylates SFK in vivo is only partially understood. Although Src is a very good substrate in vitro, it does not interact efficiently with Csk in vivo because of the fact that Src is at the plasma membrane, whereas Csk is strictly cytosolic. Thus, in vivo activity requires membrane-associated Csk binders that allow its recruitment to subcellular compartments where SFK reside. For example, paxillin recruits Csk to the focal adhesions that may regulate SFK adhesive and migratory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baumeister et al., 2005</xref>), whereas Dok-1 induces Csk translocation to the plasma membrane for mitogenic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>). This regulation is governed by a Csk-SH2 pTyr-dependent mechanism, and phosphorylation of Csk-binding proteins is triggered by SFK, which defines a negative-feedback regulatory loop.</p><p>Recently, a novel group of signaling proteins has emerged that may also be involved in SFK signaling and its regulation during immunoreceptor stimulation. This family, called TRAPs (transmembrane adaptor proteins), currently comprises seven members, the founder being LAT (the linker of activation of T cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Horejsi et al., 2004</xref>). They all contain a short extracellular single transmembrane and a long intracellular domain with tyrosine motifs that potentially interact with SH2 domains of other signaling proteins. For example, LAT comprises four Tyr that, when phosphorylated by ZAP70 (a downstream effector of the SFK Lck and Fyn), create binding sites for PLC&#x003b3; and Grb2, which are both required for efficient T cell activation. Another member of this family, PAG (phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brdicka et al., 2000</xref>), also called Cbp (Csk-binding protein; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawabuchi et al., 2000</xref>), is ubiquitously expressed, unlike other members of the family whose expression is mostly restricted to hematopoietic tissues. PAG contains 10 Tyr residues in the cytoplasmic domain, 9 of which are SFK phosphorylation sites, 2 poly-Pro motifs for interaction with SH3-containing proteins, and 2 potential palmitoylation sites implicated in lipid rafts localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Horejsi et al., 2004</xref>). It may allow Csk recruitment in these structures through interaction of Csk-SH2 with pTyr317. Thus, PAG may define an additional negative regulatory loop toward SFK in membrane domains such as caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shima et al., 2003</xref>). In this paper, we have addressed the role of PAG in the regulation of SFK mitogenic signaling. We show that this adaptor, independently of binding to Csk, regulates PDGFR partitioning at the plasma membrane through the ganglioside GM1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>PAG negatively regulates Src mitogenic signaling</title><p>We first addressed the role of Csk in the PDGF-induced Src mitogenic signal transduction pathway. To this end, we transfected NIH 3T3 cells with a Csk-expressing construct. After serum starvation, we stimulated the transfected cells with PDGF for cell cycle reentry and monitored de novo DNA synthesis by BrdU incorporation into the nuclei. PDGF stimulation induced a 50% BrdU incorporation in control cells, which was inhibited by Csk overexpression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). DNA synthesis was restored by coexpression of the transcription factor Myc or the active RacV12 mutant of the Rho family of small GTPases, two elements of the Src pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bromann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boureux et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, the active RasL61 mutant could not overcome the G1 block induced by Csk, confirming the Ras-independent nature of the Src pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bromann et al., 2004</xref>). We concluded that Csk can regulate the PDGF-induced Src mitogenic function.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>PAG inhibits PDGF-induced Src mitogenic signaling.</bold> (A) Csk overexpression inhibits PDGF-induced Src mitogenic signaling.

To confirm this data, we analyzed mitogenesis in cells with reduced level of caveolin. Although caveolin-1 knockdown promoted DNA synthesis by itself in 25% of NIH 3T3 cells, it significantly reduced PDGF mitogenic response in comparison to control cells, confirming the role of caveolin in this signaling pathway (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200705102/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200705102/DC1</ext-link>). The residual mitogenic response could be attributed to the moderate efficacy of our siRNA to reduce plasma membrane caveolin-1 levels in cells cultured at high density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galbiati et al., 1998</xref>) as required for efficient induction of quiescence. Nevertheless, we do not exclude the involvement of additional membrane domains in this cellular response. We were next interested in the adaptors that target Csk to these domains, particularly PAG. PAG overexpression strongly inhibited DNA synthesis induced by PDGF (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). As for Csk, active RacV12 and Myc rescued the PDGFR signaling that was blocked by PAG. Myc effect was specific as it was not observed by expressing Fos. Moreover, although PAG inhibited the mitogenic response induced by PDGF in p53<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), this inhibitory effect was not observed in p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEF (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). A comparable result was described in NIH 3T3 cells that coexpressed the adenovirus E1B (early 1B) 55K protein, which inhibits p53 transactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yew and Berk, 1992</xref>). These findings are consistent with the notion that PAG might inhibit the Src mitogenic pathway. Interestingly, PAG did not affect the capacity of oncogenic SrcY527F per se to induce DNA synthesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>), indicating that it may regulate signaling upstream of SFK, probably via a PDGF-induced SFK activation.</p></sec><sec><title>PAG mitogenic inhibition is independent of its interaction with Csk</title><p>We next asked whether PAG function was mediated by its association with Csk. Surprisingly, we found that the PAG Y317F, a mutant which did not interact with Csk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brdicka et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawabuchi et al., 2000</xref>), could still inhibit mitogenesis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, left). To confirm this observation, we coexpressed PAG with an inactive form of Csk, Csk-K<sup>&#x02212;</sup>. By associating with PAG, Csk-K<sup>&#x02212;</sup> was expected to prevent recruitment of endogenous Csk to membrane domains and, therefore, to overcome PAG inhibitory effect. As this was not the case, we concluded that the PAG antimitogenic effect is independent of its interaction with Csk. PAG contains nine additional Tyr residues that, when phosphorylated, create binding sites for other SH2-containing signaling proteins, including RasGAP and the adaptor Sam68 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smida et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, we investigated whether one of these Tyr residues played a role in PAG antimitogenic effect. However, we found that all mutants in which a single Tyr residue was replaced by Phe were still inhibitory (unpublished data). We also tested the activity of the PAG-N mutant fused to the GFP, which comprises only the first 97 aa encompassing the extracellular/transmembrane domains, and a short cytoplasmic sequence without any obvious binding motifs for signaling proteins. Remarkably, PAG-N was sufficient to mimic the antimitogenic effect of full length PAG. Moreover, coexpression of PAG-N with Myc or RacV12 restored the mitogenic response of these cells upon PDGF stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, right). Conversely, expression of PAG-C [98&#x02013;433] fused to GFP, which could still associate with Csk, did not affect mitogenesis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B [right] and C [middle and right]</xref>). We obtained similar data when PAG-N was transduced by retroviral infection, which induced moderate protein expression and, thus, excluded a nonspecific inhibitory effect caused by high protein expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). In conclusion, PAG-N is sufficient to inhibit Src mitogenic signaling.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>PAG mitogenic inhibition is independent of Csk but requires PAG palmitoylation sites.</bold> (A) Schematic of the PAG constructs used.

To this aim we used caveolae-enriched fractions (CEF) purified from HEK 293 cells expressing PAG-N. A Triton X-100 cell lysate was fractionated through a sucrose gradient and CEF were isolated in the light fractions (2&#x02013;4) as shown by the bulk of caveolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Veracini et al., 2006</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>, PAG-N was localized in CEF. Mutation of the lipid acylation sites Cys39 and Cys42 into Ala (PAG-N CC/AA) was sufficient to abrogate this localization. Interestingly, these mutations also impaired the capacity of PAG-N to inhibit mitogenesis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>), suggesting that targeting to caveolae and/or other membrane domains is required for PAG-N function. We then asked whether PAG-N could also regulate growth factor signaling outside membrane microdomains. First, we examined the effect of PAG-N on PDGF-induced dorsal ruffle formation, which is known to be independent of caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Veracini et al., 2006</xref>). We observed that 30% of control NIH 3T3 cells exhibited at least one dorsal ruffle 5 min after PDGF stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>) and that this response was not affected by overexpression of PAG-N. We then analyzed the mitogenic response induced by EGF in NIH 3T3 cells. Although the dominant-negative Cav-3DGV inhibited PDGF mitogenic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Veracini et al., 2006</xref>), it did not affect the one induced by EGF (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). This indicated that, in NIH 3T3 cells, EGF does not require caveolae and/or cholesterol-enriched membrane domains for mitogenesis. Interestingly, PAG-N also had no effect on EGF cellular response, whereas it still inhibited the one elicited by PDGF (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). We concluded that PAG-N function is tightly linked to the signaling processes dependent on membrane domains such as caveolae.</p></sec><sec><title>PAG-N displaces PDGFR from caveolae, leading to the prevention of Src mitogenic signaling</title><p>We next addressed the molecular mechanism by which PAG-N inhibits SFK mitogenic function in greater detail. Because PAG-N may affect signaling upstream of SFK, we hypothesized that it could inhibit SFK-PDGFR coupling in caveolae. This idea was first evaluated in CEF of HEK 293 cells expressing human PDGFR &#x003b2;, with or without PAG-N. Surprisingly, PAG-N reduced PDGFR level in CEF by 50%, whereas SFK concentration remained unchanged (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, left). Moreover, PAG-N did not affect the total level of the receptor (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, right), thus excluding any protein degradation mechanism. The specificity of this inhibition was also illustrated by the inability of PAG-N CC/AA to displace the receptor from CEF. We confirmed these observations by electron microscopy using immunogold labeling of PDGFR in caveolae of NIH 3T3 cells infected with mock or PAG-N retroviruses. Indeed, although 50% of caveolae were positive for PDGFR immunolabeling in control cells, &#x0003c;10% were positive in PAG-N&#x02013;expressing cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). In contrast, PAG-N did not affect the caveolar immunogold labeling of caveolin, thus confirming the specificity of this effect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). We concluded that PAG-N specifically excludes PDGFR from caveolae.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>PAG-N excludes PDGFR from caveolae.</bold> (A) PAG-N reduces the level of PDGFR in CEF of HEK 293 cells expressing PDGFR.

PAG-N also increased the association of SFK with caveolin, which is thought to participate in its catalytic inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 1996</xref>). Reduction of SFK&#x02013;PDGFR complex formation was also suggested by a decrease of PDGF-induced SFK activation as well as phosphorylation of the Src mitogenic substrates Stat3, Tyr705, Shc, Tyr239, and Tyr240 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bromann et al., 2004</xref>) in cells expressing PAG-N (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, B and C</xref>). Conversely, activation of ERK1 and 2 upon PDGF stimulation was not modified (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>), indicating that PAG-N does not inhibit all signaling pathways emanated from the activated receptor but only the caveolae-regulated signaling.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>PAG-N inhibits SFK mitogenic signaling.</bold> (A) PDGFR&#x02013;SFK complex formation is reduced in CEF of NIH 3T3 cells infected with PAG-N.

Because PAG-N does not interact physically with PDGFR (unpublished data), we reasoned that it may affect caveolae properties necessary for PDGFR localization. Indeed, we observed a drastic redistribution of caveolin at the periphery of PAG-N&#x02013;expressing cells. This was confirmed by electron microscopy, which showed that 70% of mature caveolae were connected to the surface of cells expressing PAG-N as compared with 25% in mock-infected cells (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200705102/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200705102/DC1</ext-link>). This finding suggested that PAG-N modulates caveolae properties and/or endocytosis. In addition to caveolin, lipid constituents, such as cholesterol and ganglioside GM1, also play important roles in caveolae functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sharma et al., 2004</xref>). Remarkably, we observed a large accumulation of GM1 at the surface of cells expressing PAG-N (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). This accumulation was dependent on the membrane domain localization of the adaptor, as the mutant PAG-N CC/AA did not modify GM1 membrane level. A moderate but significant accumulation of cholesterol was also observed at the surface of cells stably expressing PAG-N in comparison to mock-infected cells (unpublished data), confirming that PAG-N alters caveolae constituents. We then analyzed the effect of such modifications in membrane lipid constituents on PDGFR membrane partitioning. Previous reports suggested that PDGF localization could be regulated by GM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mitsuda et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that exclusion of PDGFR from caveolae by PAG-N was mediated by GM1. Indeed, exogenous GM1 reduced PDGFR accumulation in CEF from HEK 293 cells expressing the human receptor (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>). This finding was further confirmed by electron microscopy on NIH 3T3 cells, where immunogold labeling of PDGFR in caveolae was reduced by 80% upon addition of exogenous GM1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>). We then asked whether GM1 could also influence PDGF-induced mitogenesis. Exogenous GM1 reduced PDGF mitogenic response by 70% (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 D</xref>). This inhibition was reversed by expression of Myc or RacV12, two elements of the Src pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bromann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boureux et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, it was not modified by expression of the constitutively active RasL61 mutant or the transcription factor Fos, demonstrating that GM1 inhibitory effect was independent of Ras. We concluded that an excess of GM1 at the plasma membrane delocalizes PDGFR from caveolae and inhibits PDGF mitogenic response via inhibition of an Src-dependent signaling pathway.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>PAG-N displaces PDGFR from caveolae and inhibits Src mitogenic signaling via GM1.</bold> (A) PAG-N increases GM1 content at the cell surface.

The effect of PAG-N CC/AA suggested a role for membrane domain localization in this molecular process. Furthermore, we found that caveolin-1 knockdown also reduced the capacity of PAG-N to impact on GM1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>), suggesting that caveolin or caveolae integrity might be also required. The ganglioside-specific sialidase Neu-3 allows the conversion of di- and trisialidated gangliosides to monosialidated glycolipids such as GM1. Interestingly, this enzyme is localized at the external leaflet of the plasma membrane and interacts with caveolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Papini et al., 2004</xref>). We thus investigated whether Neu-3 was involved in PAG-N&#x02013;induced GM1 effects. Neu-3 knockdown strongly reduced GM1 cell surface accumulation elicited by PAG-N (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, A&#x02013;C</xref>).

Neu-3 inhibition, either with DANA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 E</xref>, left) or through Neu-3 siRNA transduction (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 E</xref>, right), largely reversed PAG-N mitogenic inhibition.

To this end, mouse NIH 3T3 cells were stably transfected with a vector expressing a small hairpin RNA that reduced PAG level in CEF by 80%, as compared with mock-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 A</xref>). We observed that GM1 accumulation at the cell surface was significantly reduced in PAG knocked-down cells (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 B</xref>). Remarkably, PDGFR caveolar distribution was significantly increased in cells with reduced PAG, as revealed by the appearance of multi-labeled PDGFR beads in caveolae, whereas caveolin was not (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 C</xref>). In accordance with our hypothesis, exogenous GM1 largely restored PDGFR monolabeling in caveolae. We then addressed the effect of endogenous PAG on mitogenesis. PAG down-regulation induced an increase in BrdU incorporation both in the presence and absence of growth factors (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 D</xref>), indicating that endogenous PAG negatively regulates mitogenesis. Interestingly, increase in BrdU incorporation was abrogated by exogenous GM1, which is in agreement with the hypothesis of a PAG&#x02013;GM1 signaling pathway regulating mitogenesis. We then analyzed the molecular determinants involved in endogenous PAG biological activity by introducing human PAG mutants that were not targeted by the mouse shRNA sequence (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 E</xref>). Human PAG restored DNA synthesis to the level observed in control cells, indicating that the biological effect was not caused by a side target of the shRNA. Similar results were obtained with PAG Y317F and PAG-N, which do not bind to Csk, unlike PAG-C. These data are consistent with the idea that the N-terminal sequence is responsible for the mitogenic inhibitory activity of endogenous PAG. We also found that increased DNA synthesis after PAG down-regulation was inhibited by AG-1296, a PDGFR inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kovalenko et al., 1997</xref>), but not by Iressa, a specific inhibitor of EGF receptors (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herbst et al., 2004</xref>). SFK and caveolae were also implicated in this cellular response, as revealed by the inhibitory effect of the Src inhibitor SU6656 and the Cav3-DGV mutant, respectively. Accordingly, basal PDGFR and ERK activities were enhanced in these cells (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 G</xref>). Hence, an increased PDGFR signaling mediated by its membrane redistribution may be responsible for the promotion of DNA synthesis in cells with reduced PAG. Finally, we also wished to confirm the Csk-independent nature of endogenous PAG activity. A 10-min PDGF stimulation induced Csk membrane recruitment in 50% of cells, as revealed by Csk immunostaining at the plasma membrane (Fig. S3, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200705102/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200705102/DC1</ext-link>). <italic>PAG</italic> silencing had no effect on Csk relocalization and mitogenic activity (Fig. S3 C), as expected.

So far, PAG functions were mostly related to Csk activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Horejsi et al., 2004</xref>). Recently, additional PAG-interacting proteins with signaling functions have been reported, including the E3 ligase SOCS1, which is important for SFK degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ingley et al., 2006</xref>), the negative Ras regulator RasGAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smida et al., 2007</xref>), and SFK as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oneyama et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Solheim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tauzin et al., 2008</xref>). In this paper, we have uncovered a novel property of this transmembrane protein, unrelated to its association with Csk or any other signaling protein yet implicating SFK regulation. By controlling GM1 levels at the plasma membrane, PAG regulates PDGFR partitioning in caveolae and its association with SFK for mitogenic signaling. Recent data have shown that PAG can sequester and affect signaling of oncogenic SFK in membrane domains and this implicates a phosphotyrosine-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oneyama et al., 2008</xref>). This may not occur in PDGF-stimulated fibroblasts, probably because of the inefficiency of endogenous SFK to phosphorylate PAG in these conditions.</p><p>How GM1 regulates PDGFR levels in caveolae is not clearly established, but the simplest model would implicate a competition mechanism. In addition, one might speculate that there is repulsion between the GM1 carbohydrate moiety and an epitope in the extracellular domain of PDGFR, as was recently found for the ganglioside GM3 and the insulin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kabayama et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the balance between the two constituents would regulate PDGFR concentration in these membrane domains. Additionally, GM1 may also regulate PDGFR catalytic activity, as suggested by Mistuda et al. (2002), and by the increased PDGFR activity observed in PAG-depleted cells with reduced GM1 level. Therefore, by regulating GM1 level at the plasma membrane, PAG may have an impact on PDGFR mitogenic signaling via both receptor membrane partitioning and catalytic activity (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig10"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p><bold>A model for how PAG regulates PDGFR-induced DNA synthesis.</bold> Under normal conditions, PDGF-induced receptor activation triggers its association with SFK in caveolae, leading to Src mitogenic signaling, which is required for induction of DNA synthesis. An increase in PAG level induces Neu-3 sialidase activity that leads to GM1 accumulation and PDGFR exclusion from caveolae. This, in turn, prevents Src mitogenic signaling and induction of DNA synthesis. Conversely, a reduction of PAG level lowers Neu-3 sialidase activity and GM1 cell surface accumulation, allowing an increase in PDGFR caveolar localization. This induces PDGFR activation and Src mitogenic signaling even in the absence of PDGF.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1820603f10"></graphic></fig><p>One important issue raised by these observations is to understand how PAG regulates GM1 accumulation. A first hypothesis implies that, by associating with GM1, it allows lipid delivery to the cell surface, as was recently described for syntaxin-6, a t-SNARE (target membrane&#x02013;soluble N-ethylmaleimide attachment protein receptor) involved in membrane fusion events along the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choudhury et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, syntaxin-6 controls the level of GM1 in caveolae and we observed that its overexpression also inhibits PDGF-induced Src mitogenic signaling (unpublished data). However, syntaxin-6 functions were not affected by PAG down-regulation (unpublished data), suggesting that these two proteins regulate mitogenesis and GM1 accumulation through separate mechanisms. A second hypothesis implies that PAG has an impact on GM1 biosynthesis. This notion is supported by the important role of the membrane domain&#x02013;localized sialidase Neu-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Papini et al., 2004</xref>) on PAG activity. Thus, PAG may have an impact on Neu-3 by modulating its expression, localization, enzymatic activity, and/or substrate availability. We also demonstrated that PAG functions require palmitoylation of the protein for its localization in membrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uittenbogaard and Smart, 2000</xref>). Surprisingly, these properties were not observed in any other member of the TRAP family we tested (i.e., LAT, SIT, TRIM, and NTAL; unpublished data), including the ones that also harbor palmitoylation sites (LAT and NTAL). Therefore, additional mechanisms must be required for full PAG activity. Accordingly, a detailed mutagenesis analysis identified Phe 25, 32, and 35 as important determinants of PAG-N functions, which define a consensus sequence for binding to caveolin-1 (X&#x003a6;XXXX&#x003a6;XX&#x003a6;, where &#x003a6; corresponds to Phe, Tyr, or Trp, and X to any other amino acid; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Couet et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2006</xref>). However, the endogenous proteins were found to interact weakly in cells (unpublished data), suggesting that this sequence might have additional roles.</p><p>Moreover, the present findings raise the issue of the nature of the membrane-anchored Csk binders involved in the regulation of Src mitogenic signaling. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhao et al. (2006)</xref> clearly implicated the adaptor protein Dok-1. Using Src phosphorylation on Tyr450, Dok-1 recruits Csk to the cell periphery for regulation of Src-induced <italic>c-myc</italic> expression and cell cycle progression. However, they did not investigate whether Dok-1 regulates signaling in caveolae. Additional Csk-binding proteins could be involved in the regulation of SFK mitogenic signaling. One obvious candidate may be caveolin-1 itself, when it is phosphorylated on Tyr14 by SFK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our study raises important questions about PAG signaling specificity and PAG regulation. Our data show that PAG action is restricted to specific membrane domains. Therefore, we could also expect that PAG impact on receptor signaling regulated by these membrane domains. For instance, NGF receptors have been reported to require GM1 for neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mutoh et al., 1995</xref>), and PAG, which is highly expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawabuchi et al., 2000</xref>), may also contribute to the ability of NGF to induce neurites. Additional work is certainly needed to define the regulation of this novel PAG function. Regulation of protein expression could be part of the mechanism, as suggested by our gene silencing experiments. Another level of regulation may implicate deacylation on Cys39 and Cys42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greaves and Chamberlain, 2007</xref>). By removing palmitoyl residues, PAG will be excluded from membrane domains and will not have an impact on GM1 at the cell surface. Although not predicted, phosphorylation at the N terminus could also influence PAG antimitogenic function. Clearly, further investigations are required to unravel the molecular mechanism by which this GM1-mediated PAG function is regulated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>DNA constructs, antibodies, and reagents</title><p>Constructs expressing PAG and PAGY317F have been described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brdicka et al., (2000)</xref>.
