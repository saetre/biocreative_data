Progression along the T cell lineage further requires cooperative signaling provided by the interleukin 7 receptor (IL-7R), but the molecular mechanisms responsible for the dynamic and lineage-specific regulation of IL-7R during thymopoiesis are unknown. We show that active Notch1 binds to a conserved CSL-binding site in the human <italic>IL7R</italic> gene promoter and critically regulates <italic>IL7R</italic> transcription and IL-7R &#x003b1; chain (IL-7R&#x003b1;) expression via the CSL&#x02013;MAML complex. Defective Notch1 signaling selectively impaired IL-7R&#x003b1; expression in T-lineage cells, but not B-lineage cells, and resulted in a compromised expansion of early human developing thymocytes, which was rescued upon ectopic IL-7R&#x003b1; expression. The pathological implications of these findings are demonstrated by the regulation of IL-7R&#x003b1; expression downstream of Notch1 in T cell leukemias. Thus, Notch1 controls early T cell development, in part by regulating the stage- and lineage-specific expression of IL-7R&#x003b1;.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The development of T cells is a tightly regulated process guided by inductive signals provided by the thymic microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). The interaction of Notch1 with Delta-like ligands expressed by the thymic epithelium is an initial obligatory event for lymphomyeloid progenitors seeding the thymus to undergo T cell specification and diversion away from alternative cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Thereafter, recurrent Notch&#x02013;ligand interactions are required for intrathymic early thymic progenitors (ETPs) to maintain T cell specification and to support further development along the T cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). During this maturation process, ETPs that are CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> double negative (DN) and either CD44<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD117<sup>+</sup> or CD34<sup>+</sup>CD1a<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD33<sup>+</sup> in mice or humans, respectively, differentiate into DN2 (CD44<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> or CD34<sup>+</sup>CD1a<sup>+</sup>) and DN3 (CD44<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> or CD4<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> immature single positive) thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Progression beyond the DN3 stage and irreversible T cell commitment is accomplished by signaling through a pre-TCR that promotes survival, proliferation, and further differentiation to the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double-positive (DP) stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). This developmental checkpoint, known as &#x003b2; selection, also depends on cooperative signaling provided by Notch1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Therefore, Notch activation is crucial early in thymopoiesis for the induction and maintenance of T cell specification within the DN intrathymic compartment and, later on, for the functional outcomes of &#x003b2; selection.</p><p>Besides the pre-TCR&#x02013;dependent phase of thymocyte expansion at the &#x003b2;-selection checkpoint, there is an early phase of extensive proliferation of the intrathymic pool of T cell precursors in response to IL-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Binding of IL-7 to its receptor (IL-7R), which is composed of an &#x003b1;-chain (IL-7R&#x003b1;) associated to the common cytokine receptor &#x003b3; (&#x003b3;c) chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), plays a conserved nonredundant role by promoting the survival and proliferation of DN progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). IL-7, however, is dispensable for differentiation beyond the DN3 stage, although it may be required later on during positive selection of CD8<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Thus, besides Notch1 signals, IL-7&#x02013;IL-7R&#x003b1; interactions provide additional thymic signals that are critical for the development of thymocytes before the DP stage.</p><p>The stage-specific function of IL-7 during intrathymic development is accomplished by a tight regulation of IL-7R&#x003b1; expression. IL-7R&#x003b1; is first induced during thymopoiesis in late ETPs in transit to DN2, it declines steadily after the DN2 stage and must be terminated before transition to the DP stage, but it is reexpressed after positive selection in single-positive thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Still, the molecular bases of the dynamic regulation of IL-7R&#x003b1; expression during thymopoiesis remain poorly understood. In early lymphoid precursors and B cell progenitors of mice, IL-7R&#x003b1; gene (<italic>Il7ra</italic>) transcription is regulated by the Ets family transcription factor PU.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). However, PU.1 down-regulation is specifically required for progression in the T cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), and another Ets factor, GA binding protein (GABP), was shown to regulate IL-7R&#x003b1; expression in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Nonetheless, neither expression nor function of GABP is T-lineage specific. Rather, GABP regulates IL-7R&#x003b1; expression in pre-B and committed B cells as well and has recently been proven to be a critical regulator of B cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Therefore, the molecular mechanism responsible for the dynamic and T-lineage&#x02013;specific regulation of IL-7R&#x003b1; expression remains to be identified. In this paper, we provide evidence that Notch1 accomplishes this function during T cell development. We show that active Notch1 directly regulates human IL-7R&#x003b1; gene (<italic>IL7R</italic>) transcription and critically controls the IL-7&#x02013;dependent expansion of the intrathymic pool of early DN T cell progenitors in human thymopoiesis as well as the IL-7&#x02013;induced proliferation of T cell leukemias.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Notch1 signaling up-regulates IL-7R&#x003b1; expression in hematopoietic precursors</title><p>In both mouse and human thymopoiesis, Notch1-induced T-lineage specification parallels the induction of IL-7R&#x003b1; expression and IL-7 dependency. We thus wanted to investigate whether IL-7R&#x003b1; expression in early thymopoiesis is a direct consequence of Notch1 activation rather than a byproduct of progression toward the T cell lineage. To this end, we first analyzed the impact of Notch1 signaling on surface levels of IL-7R&#x003b1; expressed on human ETPs developing in a hybrid human/mouse fetal thymic organ culture (FTOC). Thus, sorted ETPs were infected either with a bicistronic retroviral vector encoding the intracellular active form of Notch1 (intracellular Notch1 [ICN1]) and GFP as a reporter, or with a GFP-only control vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), and IL-7R&#x003b1; expression was then analyzed by flow cytometry on the ETP progeny arising in a FTOC assay. Supporting a direct role of Notch1 in IL-7R&#x003b1; expression, we found that ectopic expression of ICN1 consistently resulted in the generation of DP thymocytes with up-regulated IL-7R&#x003b1;, as compared with the GFP-transduced controls (fold increase of mean fluorescence intensity [MFI] &#x000b1; SEM: 2.26 &#x000b1; 0.28 from three independent experiments; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). More importantly, similar approaches showed that IL-7R&#x003b1; was induced de novo on the major cell progeny (&#x0003e;95%) arising in multicytokine cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>) from ICN1-transduced human CD34<sup>+</sup> cord blood (CB) multipotent precursors, which displayed a homogeneous lineage-negative (Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) phenotype (i.e., CD1a<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, CD2<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, CD5<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, CD7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, CD13<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, CD14<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, CD19<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, CD33<sup>lo</sup>, CD34<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, CD56<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, CD116<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, CD122<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, and TCR-&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>). In contrast, no IL-7R&#x003b1; was expressed on the equivalent Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> population derived from control CB precursors transduced with GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), which represented a minor proportion (5%) of the GFP<sup>+</sup> progeny (95% CD13<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells). Loss-of-function experiments were then performed to establish whether Notch-deficient progenitors had defects in IL-7R&#x003b1; expression. Thus, Notch signaling was inhibited in CD34<sup>+</sup> CB cells by ectopic expression of a dominant-negative mutant form of the Notch coactivator MAML1 (dominant-negative MAML1 [dnMAML1]) fused to GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>), and dnMAML1<sup>+</sup> cells were then analyzed for their capacity to acquire surface IL-7R&#x003b1; under optimal culture conditions, using the OP9-DL1 coculture system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>, control CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitors transduced with GFP-only vectors gave rise to a major Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> progeny (i.e., CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, CD13<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, CD19<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, and CD56<sup>&#x02212;</sup>; 90% by day 22), which expressed IL-7R&#x003b1; (&#x0003e;85% of cells). In contrast, the equivalent Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> progeny of dnMAML1<sup>+</sup> precursors (70%) were markedly impaired in their capacity to express IL-7R&#x003b1; (&#x0003c;25%). Overall, these results indicate that Notch1 signaling can up-regulate IL-7R&#x003b1; expression in primary human hematopoietic progenitors.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Notch1 signaling regulates IL-7R&#x003b1; expression in human hematopoietic precursors.</bold> (A) Flow cytometry of IL-7R&#x003b1; expression on electronically gated GFP<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> (DP) thymocytes derived from ETPs transduced with either ICN1-GFP or GFP-only vectors in an FTOC assay (day 13).

We found that <italic>IL7R</italic> messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was markedly increased in ICN1-transduced cells, as compared with GFP-only&#x02013;transduced controls (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081922/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>), indicating that Notch1 signaling is able to control <italic>IL7R</italic> gene expression. Because <italic>IL7R</italic> transcription is a hallmark of lymphoid progenitors developing along either the T or the B cell lineages, it was important to investigate whether regulation of <italic>IL7R</italic> mRNA expression by Notch1 is common to T and B cell lymphocyte precursors or restricted to T-lineage cells. Thus, we analyzed two human cell lines that constitutively express surface IL-7R&#x003b1;, namely SupT1 and REH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>), as prototypes of pre-T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>) and pre-B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), respectively, and asked whether <italic>IL7R</italic> mRNA expression was affected upon Notch signaling inhibition by dnMAML1. We found that disruption of Notch1 signaling, as assessed by decreased expression of <italic>HES1</italic>, resulted in a marked down-regulation of surface IL-7R&#x003b1; on SupT1 pre-T cells, which correlated with decreased <italic>IL7R</italic> mRNA levels; however, dnMAML1 did not affect IL-7R&#x003b1; and mRNA expression in REH pre-B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Quantitative PCR analyses showed that expression of <italic>IL2RG</italic> gene encoding the IL-7R &#x003b3;c chain remained essentially unchanged in either cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>), supporting a specific effect of Notch1 on <italic>IL7R</italic> expression in SupT1 cells. Consistently, SupT1 cells, but not REH cells, expressed detectable levels of endogenous active Notch1 (Fig. S1). As a whole, these data, together with similar results obtained from additional T-lineage (CUTLL1) and B-lineage (NALM-6) cell lines (Fig. S1), support the notion that regulation of <italic>IL7R</italic> expression by Notch1 is T-lineage specific.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Inactivation of Notch signaling by dnMAML1 results in T-lineage&#x02013;specific inhibition of IL-7R&#x003b1; protein and <italic>IL7R</italic> mRNA expression.</bold> SupT1 pre-T cells and REH pre-B cells were transduced either with a retroviral vector encoding dnMAML1 fused to GFP or with a GFP-only control vector.

As a control, we also observed a selective enrichment of the Notch target gene <italic>HES1</italic> in the former cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>, top). Therefore, endogenous ICN1 can bind constitutively to the CSL-binding site of <italic>IL7R</italic> and <italic>HES1</italic> promoters in T-lineage cells, although with different efficiencies that may depend on stage-specific differences in chromatin contexts. However, no binding of ICN1 could be detected in any pre-B cell line. Because <italic>IL7R</italic> expression is regulated by the Ets transcription factor PU.1 in developing B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), ChIP assays were performed using an anti-PU.1 antibody as well.

This pattern resembles that found in FTOC assays in which treatment with a &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor (GSI) impaired Notch signaling and hampered cytoplasmic TCR-&#x003b2; (TCR-&#x003b2;ic) expression (Fig. S2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). Thus, we can conclude that CSL/MAML-dependent Notch1 signaling is absolutely required for progression through the &#x003b2;-selection checkpoint in humans, as reported in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). In contrast, ETPs with impaired Notch signaling were capable of progressing along the initial differentiation stages upstream of &#x003b2; selection with relative efficiencies equivalent to those of controls. Indeed, proportions of DN2 and DN3 thymocytes arising during the initial 2 wk were similar in dnMAML1<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>+</sup> FTOCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F</xref>), although absolute numbers were markedly decreased in the former (53 &#x000b1; 13% [P = 0.0164] and 74 &#x000b1; 11% [P = 0.002] reduction of control DN3 cells by days 4 and 11, respectively), and essentially no dnMAML1<sup>+</sup> cells were recovered by day 25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref>). Down-regulated IL-7R levels may thus be sufficient for maintaining survival of thymocytes upstream of &#x003b2; selection but unable to sustain cellular expansion in response to mouse IL-7 produced locally in the thymic lobes. Supporting this possibility, neither numbers of apoptotic cells nor expression levels of antiapoptotic Bcl2 molecules changed significantly in Notch-deprived FTOCs before day 12. However, down-regulated IL-7R&#x003b1; levels expressed on Notch-deprived thymocytes showed a diminished function, as assessed by STAT5 phosphorylation, compared with controls (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081922/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>). Collectively, these data indicated that impaired Notch signaling had two independent stage-specific effects during T cell development: first, a down-regulation of IL-7R&#x003b1; expression that resulted in an impaired proliferation from DN1 to DN3 stages; and second, a developmental arrest at the &#x003b2;-selection checkpoint.

Because IL-7R&#x003b1; overexpression on DP thymocytes has been shown to disrupt thymopoiesis in mice as a result of an impaired supply of local IL-7 for DN cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), hIL-7 was exogenously provided to our FTOC assays. IL-7R&#x003b1; overexpression did not significantly affect IL-7&#x02013;mediated proliferation of thymocytes with intact Notch signaling, as proportions of GFP- and IL-7R&#x003b1;&#x02013;transduced thymocytes remained constant throughout culture in GSI-untreated FTOCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>).

Accordingly, ectopic IL-7R&#x003b1; expression significantly rescued the reduced cell recovery observed during the initial 2 wk of culture in GSI-treated lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref> and Fig. S3).

Still, levels of apoptosis or expression of Bcl2 remained unchanged regardless of IL-7R&#x003b1; ectopic expression in GSI-treated lobes (Fig. S3), thus confirming that proliferation, rather than survival, is compromised in the absence of Notch signaling before the &#x003b2;-selection checkpoint. Thereafter, however, enforced IL-7R&#x003b1; expression was unable to rescue Notch-deprived thymocytes from GSI-induced apoptosis, and absolute cell numbers dropped abruptly along the third week of FTOC (Fig. S3).

Supporting such a direct link, in this paper we identified IL-7R&#x003b1; as a new transcriptional Notch1 target and showed that IL-7R&#x003b1; expression is regulated by Notch1 in a T-lineage&#x02013; and developmental stage&#x02013;specific manner. We also provided evidence that developmental regulation of IL-7R&#x003b1; expression by Notch1 during human thymopoiesis is critical to controling expansion of the early T cell progenitor compartment in response to IL-7. Moreover, we found that active Notch1 also regulated IL-7R&#x003b1; expression and IL-7&#x02013;dependent proliferation of human T-ALLs, suggesting that cross talk of both pathways may be relevant for leukemogenesis.</p><p>Active Notch1 was shown to specifically transactivate the <italic>IL7R</italic> promoter in a CSL/MAML-dependent manner. This finding provides the molecular basis for understanding the differential transcriptional regulation of <italic>IL7R</italic> expression in T and B cell lineages and offers new insights into the dynamic regulation of IL-7R&#x003b1; expression during thymopoiesis. In mouse B cell development, IL-7R&#x003b1; expression is regulated by two Ets transcription factors, PU.1 and GABP, which appear to function sequentially in a developmental stage&#x02013;specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). PU.1 is required as well for survival of early thymic immigrants, but PU.1 down-regulation is obligatory for T cell specification and progression in the T cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). We show in this paper that PU.1 down-regulation concurs with up-regulation of Notch activity in human thymopoiesis, as shown in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), and restriction of PU.1 function by Notch1 appears to be a particular aspect of T-lineage specification in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). It is thus possible that IL-7R&#x003b1; expression is initially supported by PU.1 in early thymic immigrants but needs to be maintained after T-lineage specification by Notch1. Alternatively, <italic>IL7R</italic> transactivation in the thymus may be specifically induced only after T cell specification downstream of Notch1 because the earliest thymus precursors still lack IL-7R&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Supporting a direct role of Notch1 in <italic>IL7R</italic> transcription de novo, we showed that induction of IL-7R&#x003b1; expression in CB multipotent progenitors was critically regulated by Notch1 signaling. In any of these scenarios, factors other than Notch1 may contribute to sustain IL-7R expression in more mature T cell&#x02013;committed thymocytes, as Notch1 activity is drastically down-regulated in post&#x02013;&#x003b2;-selected thymocytes before transition to the DP stage. In this regard, Xue et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>) have shown that GABP regulates <italic>IL7R</italic> expression in mouse developing thymocytes and that it is required for a normal DN to DP transition after &#x003b2; selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Because <italic>GABPA</italic> mRNA expression is maintained at high levels throughout human thymopoiesis, and particularly in pre-TCR<sup>+</sup> and DP thymocytes with down-regulated Notch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>), it is possible that GABP is actually contributing to <italic>IL7R</italic> gene expression in &#x003b2;-selected thymocytes also in humans. Thus, GABP could act in concert with lineage-specific <italic>IL7R</italic> regulators to control stage-specific <italic>IL7R</italic> expression in human thymopoiesis, as occurs during B cell development in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>).</p><p>Defective proliferation of Notch-deprived thymocytes in our FTOC assays could be rescued by enforced expression of IL-7R&#x003b1;. This was a stage-specific effect restricted to thymocytes within the early DN progenitor compartment, but IL-7R&#x003b1; failed to replace Notch1 signals at the &#x003b2;-selection checkpoint, when cell survival requires a proper pre-TCR function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Therefore, crucial checkpoints controlling cellular expansion in human thymopoiesis are independently set by the signaling functions of the IL-7R and the pre-TCR, as proposed in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>), and both seem highly dependent on Notch1 activity. Indeed, we show in this paper that Notch1 controls IL-7R&#x02013;dependent proliferation of the DN progenitor pool, and Maillard et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>) recently demonstrated an absolute requirement of Notch for cell survival/proliferation during &#x003b2; selection in vivo that was independent of the pre-TCR, as was previously shown in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Thus, Notch and pre-TCR should act in parallel pathways that synergize during &#x003b2; selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Still, TCR-&#x003b2; rearrangement and/or expression could be Notch dependent because DN4-like thymocytes lacking TCR-&#x003b2;ic accumulated in Notch1-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>) as well as in our dnMAML1<sup>+</sup> and GSI-treated FTOCs. Collectively, we can propose that, besides the conventional roles reported for Notch1 as a commitment factor very early in thymopoiesis and as a trophic factor during &#x003b2; selection, Notch1 serves a more unconventional role as a regulator of IL-7 responsiveness and T cell progenitor expansion before acquisition of the pre-TCR. Thus, the two main phases of cellular growth characterized in postnatal thymic lymphopoiesis, involving either the IL-7R or the pre-TCR, are independently impacted by Notch1 signals.</p><p>Our gene expression analyses support the idea that the exquisite stage-specific dependence of IL-7 during thymopoiesis is the result of the coordinated regulation of Notch1 activity and IL-7R&#x003b1; expression, and a similar mechanism can be inferred from available data in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). We found that Notch target genes and <italic>IL7R</italic> simultaneously reached maximal expression at the DN2 and DN3 stages, and both became down-regulated before transition to the DP stage. Accordingly, maximal IL-7 responsiveness and massive expansion occurs in vivo at the DN2 to DN3 transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), whereas developing thymocytes become insensitive to IL-7 between the &#x003b2;-selection and positive selection checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Besides transcriptional regulation, active suppression of cytokine signal transduction ensures termination of IL-7R signals required for progression to the DP stage in mice, and then IL-7R&#x003b1; expression and signaling are restored by positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Such a strict control may be necessary to avoid IL-7&#x02013;mediated survival/proliferation signals in preselection DP thymocytes and to escape from overactivity of a cytokine receptor, which can contribute to thymocyte malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). Our observation that ectopic IL-7R&#x003b1; could rescue the growth arrest induced by Notch deprivation not only in normal thymocytes but also in T-ALLs is, thus, remarkable. Importantly, IL-7R signaling significantly contributes to T-ALL proliferation by activation of PI3K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>), and constitutive PI3K activation has recently been shown to induce resistance to Notch1 inhibition in T-ALL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Therefore, downstream effectors of IL-7R, such as PI3K, represent suitable molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. Overall, these results implicate IL-7R&#x003b1; as a major regulator for cell cycle progression induced by Notch1 in early human thymopoiesis and support a cooperative role between Notch1 and IL-7R&#x003b1; in leukemogenesis that deserves further studies.</p><p>It is currently believed that dynamic regulation of IL-7R&#x003b1; expression determines efficient responses to limited amounts of IL-7 locally supplied by the thymic microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). In mice made transgenic for Lunatic Fringe, a modulator of Notch activation, DN thymocytes must continuously compete for limiting Notch1 expansion signals in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). We can thus propose that by regulating lineage- and stage-specific expression of IL-7R&#x003b1;, Notch could serve a crucial role devoted to enhancing competitiveness for limiting IL-7 production in the thymus and also in the bone marrow niches, which would finally result in selective expansion of ETPs and leukemic blasts under physiological and pathological conditions, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Thymus and CB precursor isolation and flow cytometry.</title><p>Experiments were performed, and thymus and CB samples were obtained, in accordance with procedures approved by the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient&#x000ed;ficas (CSIC) Bioethics Committee.
