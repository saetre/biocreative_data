The resulting spectra were compared with data for primary colorectal (CRC) and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) from our former studies. Of 49 signals differentially expressed in primary HCC, primary CRC, and liver metastases, two were identified by immunodepletion as S100A6 and S100A11. Both proteins were precisely localized immunohistochemically in cells. S100A6 and S100A11 can discriminate significantly between the two primary tumor entities, CRC and HCC, whereas S100A6 allows the discrimination of metastases and HCC.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Both identified proteins can be used to discriminate different tumor entities. Specific markers or proteomic patterns for the metastases of different primary cancers will allow us to determine the biological characteristics of metastasis in general. It is unknown how the protein patterns of tumors change during metastasis or whether markers are present that allow metastases to be allocated to a specific tumor entity. The latter is of clinical interest if the primary tumor is not known.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Distant metastases are the principal causes of death in patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC).

The initiation of MTS affects the expression of multiple proteins.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003767-Mc1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003767-Ueda1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> The identification of proteins that are characteristic of metastasis might allow the discrimination of different tumor entities. To address this challenge, specific proteomic approaches have been used that focus on the complex analysis of protein levels in metastases using cell lines.&#x0005b;2527&#x0005d; Such altered expression patterns have been detected for cytokeratin 18, tissue transglutaminase, Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 1, fibroblast-type tropomyosin, interleukin-18, annexin I, disulfide isomerase, heat shock protein 60, peroxiredoxin 1, chlorine intracellular channel protein 1, and creatine kinase B chain, as well as for some ribosomal proteins. Since the early 1990s, a number of studies have investigated, with genomic approaches, tissues derived directly from both primary tumors and organs involved in metastasis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003767-Finkelstein1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003767-Conzelmann1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study to use a proteomic approach in a comparative investigation of tissues derived from different metastasising primary tumors and in the identification of proteins that can discriminate between these tumor types and between tumors and metastases. In contrast to the majority of SELDI&#x02013;MS-based studies, we identified significantly differentially expressed proteins. The Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding proteins identified here, S100A6 and S100A11, can distinguish very clearly between MTS, primary CRC, and primary HCC, as well as between CRC and HCC. A number of additional signals were detected that discriminate between MTS and CRC, but S100A6 and S100A11 do not. The identification of specific signals that can distinguish between metastases and the primary tumor is in progress. Until now, only two small studies have comparatively assessed the expression of S100A6 in human colorectal mucosa, primary colorectal adenocarcinomas, and liver metastases using a specific western blot analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003767-Komatsu1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003767-Komatsu2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, we analysed an extended number of samples using a hypothesis-free proteomic approach and thereby detected and identified S100A6 as a factor with the potential to discriminate between primary HCC and MTS. S100A6 and S100A11 belong to the group of S100 proteins involved in the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signalling network, and regulate intracellular activities such as cell growth and motility, cell-cycle progression, transcription, and cell differentiation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003767-Schafer1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003767-Donato1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> Both S100A6 and S100A11 have been observed in several epithelial tumors and are linked to metastasis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003767-Melle5">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003767-Komatsu1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003767-Maelandsmo1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003767-Yao1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref></p><p>In this study, we have demonstrated the potential of SELDI&#x02013;MS in characterizing metastasis in terms of protein profiles and in discriminating between different tumor entities. In future, it would be very interesting to assess and compare the protein profiles of metastases derived from different types of metastasising tumors. We might expect to find a panel of protein signals or a &#x0201c;metastatic protein profile&#x0201d; that is common to all metastatic tissues. This panel will presumably contain proteins involved in the coordination of metastatic processes. Although neither S100A6 nor S100A11 can discriminate between MTS and the corresponding primary CRC, they can discriminate between primary CRC and primary HCC. Perhaps more importantly, S100A6 is a potential candidate to discriminate between MTS and primary HCC. The discrimination of primary HCC and its metastases located in the liver is presently complicated and afflicted with difficulties.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003767-Helmberger1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> Therefore, S100A6 might provide some resolution of this problem.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003767.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Representative examples of SELDI-TOF MS spectra of liver metastases derived from colorectal carcinoma (MTS), colorectal carcinoma (CRC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
