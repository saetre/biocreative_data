Despite negative reports, functional impacts of individual genetic variants have been reported.

The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate if variations within <italic>ADRB2</italic> as haplotypes or as haplotype combinations confer an increased prevalence of obesity and hypertension among adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We genotyped five variants required to capture common variation in a region including the <italic>ADRB2</italic> locus in a population-based study of 6,514 unrelated, middle-aged Danes.

The present study did not find consistent evidence for an association of <italic>ADRB2</italic> variants with either obesity or hypertension when variations were analysed in a case-control study. The same lack of impact was also seen in the quantitative trait analyses, apart from nominal differences on waist-to-hip ratio and systolic blood pressure between specific haplotype combinations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>In a population-based sample of 6,514 Danes we found no consistent associations between five common variants which tag the <italic>ADRB2</italic> locus and prevalence of obesity or hypertension neither when analysed as individual haplotypes nor as haplotype pairs.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The beta-adrenergic receptor 2 (ADRB2) is part of the sympathetic nervous system influencing metabolic as well cardiovascular functions. Due to this biological function, ADRB2 has been a candidate for the development of obesity and hypertension; however, no consistent associations with these conditions have been observed. Previous studies have especially examined two functional variants, the Arg16Glu and the Gln27Glu, which in few studies were associated with both obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007206-Pereira1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007206-Bengtsson1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and hypertension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007206-Pereira1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007206-Bengtsson1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. However, overall there is ambiguity regarding the effect of these variants and in our previous study none of them were associated with either trait <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007206-Gjesing1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In addition to functional single variations, functional haplotypes have also been reported within this locus. One study identified that two common haplotypes, composed of 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within the <italic>ADRB2</italic> locus, displayed a significantly different expression of both mRNA and protein in HEK cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007206-Drysdale1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, the response to inhalation of the ADRB2 agonist albuterol was different depending on the combinations of these common haplotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007206-Drysdale1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Haplotypes based on 10 of these SNPs have also showed significantly lower sensitivity as well as a lipolytic effect in response to noradrenalin stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007206-Eriksson1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, a study identified that only four of the 13 SNPs included in the study by Drysdale and colleagues accounted for the majority of the haplotypic differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007206-Cerrone1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, haplotypes composed of these four SNPs were associated with obesity in a case-control study comprising 59 obese, 61 overweight and 79 lean individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007206-Cerrone1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, <italic>ADRB2</italic> haplotypes were reported to have a physiological effect on measures of blood pressure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007206-Binder1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, despite the previous lack of a consistent effect of individual SNPs in <italic>ADRB2</italic>, there are several indications that haplotypes and haplotype combinations may have a physiologically significant effect, yet the effect of haplotypic pairs is so far unexplored in a large-scale study sample.</p><p>Therefore, we examined the impact of the individual haplotypes and haplotypic combinations within <italic>ADRB2</italic>. Five SNPs were selected using pair wise tagging with an R<sup>2</sup> above 0.8 as they were required to represent variation within the <italic>ADRB2</italic> locus covering a 15 Kbp region which included <italic>ADRB2</italic> and two flanking linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocs according to HapMap (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hapmap.org">http://www.hapmap.org</ext-link>). This was followed by analyses of the effect of haplotypes and haplotype combinations in relation to the prevalence of obesity and hypertension.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study sample</title><p>We studied a Danish population-based study sample involving of 6,514 middle-aged Danes from the greater Copenhagen area sampled at Research Centre for Prevention and Health (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6,514; 3,169 men, 3,345 women) aged 46&#x000b1;8 years (mean&#x000b1;SD) and having a (body mass index) BMI of 26.3&#x000b1;4.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (ClinicalTrials.gov ID-no:NCT00289237 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007206-Jrgensen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>).

Genotyping was performed using Taqman allelic discrimination (KBioscience, Hoddesdon, UK) with a genotyping success rate above 97&#x00025; for all five variants and only one genotyping error was observed out of a total of 1,726 duplicate samples.

Fisher's exact test was applied to analyse differences in minor allele frequency as well as genotype distribution of the individual genotypes. Logistic regression assuming an additive model was performed to evaluate the difference in genotype distribution adjusted for sex and age in relation to obesity and hypertensive status. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to analyse the effect of individual genotypes on quantitative traits. Haplotype frequencies were estimated using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and association was evaluated by global and haplotype-specific score statistics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007206-Schaid1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The global <italic>p</italic>-value is an estimate of the overall effect of haplotypes in the statistical model and the specific <italic>p</italic>-value is an estimate of the effect of a specific haplotype compared to the effect of the remaining haplotypes. Haplotypes with a frequency below 0.5&#x00025; were excluded. The program PHASE version 2.1.1 was used to estimate the combinations of haplotypes. PHASE is a program using a Bayesian statistical method for reconstructing haplotypes from population genotype data developed by Stephens and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007206-Stephens1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007206-Stephens2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. General linear models with adjustment for sex and age was used to test a reference haplotype combination against the remaining haplotype combinations (in a pair-wise manner) for differences in the frequency of obesity and hypertension and traits related to these conditions and a specific <italic>p</italic>-value for each comparison was calculated. The reference was set as the haplotype combination (4,4). This was chosen as the reference based on the decreased expression previously seen for the haplotype corresponding to haplotype number 4 in the present study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007206-Drysdale1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. F-test (for continuous traits) and Chi-squared (for binary traits) were used to calculate the global <italic>p</italic>-value representing the fit to the model added by haplotype combinations compared to a model including only sex, age and BMI. Statistical analyses rely on traits being normally distributed which after evaluation of quantile-quantile plots were found. Patients with known diabetes (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;108) were excluded from all quantitative trait analyses and patients receiving anti-hypertensive treatment (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;403) were excluded from quantitative trait analyses of blood pressure. A statistical power calculation was performed assuming haplotype frequencies of 39&#x00025; versus 27&#x00025; as observed in a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007206-Cerrone1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, a significance level of 95&#x00025;, and a sample size of 1,000.
