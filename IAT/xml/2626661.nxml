These two recognition pathways lead to the activation of type I interferons and resistance to infection. In addition, TLR signals are required for the CD4 T cell and IgG2a, but not cytotoxic T lymphocyte, responses to influenza virus infection. In contrast, the role of NOD-like receptors (NLRs) in viral recognition and induction of adaptive immunity to influenza virus is unknown. We demonstrate that respiratory infection with influenza virus results in the activation of NLR inflammasomes in the lung. Although NLRP3 was required for inflammasome activation in certain cell types, CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, as well as mucosal IgA secretion and systemic IgG responses, required ASC and caspase-1 but not NLRP3. Consequently, ASC, caspase-1, and IL-1R, but not NLRP3, were required for protective immunity against flu challenge. Furthermore, we show that caspase-1 inflammasome activation in the hematopoietic, but not stromal, compartment was required to induce protective antiviral immunity. These results demonstrate that in addition to the TLR pathways, ASC inflammasomes play a central role in adaptive immunity to influenza virus.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Y.

Lethal pneumonia and encephalopathy caused by influenza virus have now become a serious problem, especially among the elderly and children, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Furthermore, the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses that are associated with a high fatality rate (&#x0003e;60%) have been reported in Southeast Asia, Europe, and Africa. Therefore, there is an urgent and important public health need to develop effective vaccines against not only annual seasonal influenza viruses but also against highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses. Influenza virus is recognized through at least two viral sensors. First, the cytosolic sensor retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) detects influenza after fusion and replication in infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Second, influenza genomic RNA, upon release in late endosomes, is recognized by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). The RIG-I pathway is used by most cells to respond to virus infection, whereas the latter is used by plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Signaling through both RIG-I and TLR7 results in the production of type I IFNs, which limit viral replication and increasing resistance to infection.</p><p>In addition to type I IFNs, proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 play a crucial role in protection against influenza. Influenza virus infection is accompanied by IL-1&#x003b2; production in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Influenza virus infection activates IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18 production in human macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). IL-1 is responsible for acute lung immunopathology and is required to promote survival of the mice after influenza virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Influenza virus&#x02013;specific CD4 T cell responses and IgM levels were reduced in IL-1R&#x02013;deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Not surprisingly, influenza virus has evolved strategies to inhibit the activation of inflammasomes. NS1 protein of influenza virus suppressed caspase-1 activation, maturation of pro&#x02013;IL-1&#x003b2; and pro&#x02013;IL-18, and caspase-1&#x02013;dependent apoptosis in infected primary human macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). However, the mechanism by which IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18 are activated during influenza infection in vivo is unknown.</p><p>Inflammasomes are molecular platforms that allow activation of caspase-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Caspase-1 is an essential regulator of inflammatory response through its capacity to process and activate proIL-1&#x003b2;, proIL-18, and proIL-33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). NOD-like receptors (NLRs) comprise a large family of intracellular PRRs that play an important role in innate immunity in response to recognition of various &#x0201c;damaged&#x0201d; self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) and nonself molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). NLR protein (NLRP) 3, also known as NALP3/Cryopyrin/CIAS1/PYPAF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), forms a caspase-1&#x02013;activating inflammasome. Mature IL-1&#x003b2; secretion requires at least two steps: first, transcriptional and translational up-regulation of pro&#x02013;IL-1&#x003b2; through TLR stimulation; and second, the activation of caspase-1 by inflammasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Recent reports indicate that infection by certain viruses also results in inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Kanneganti et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>) showed that Sendai and influenza viruses activated the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages pulsed transiently with ATP for 30 min in vitro. Muruve et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>) demonstrated that adenovirus infection activates IL-1&#x003b2; processing in NLRP3-, ASC-, and caspase-1&#x02013;dependent manners. However, inflammasomes were not activated by transfection of RNA, Poly I:C, or infection with reovirus (double-stranded RNA virus) or vesicular stomatitis virus (single-stranded RNA virus). In another seminal study, Johnston et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) reported that Myxoma virus carries a protein that inhibits ASC/caspase-1 activation and subsequent cell death after virus infection. Such an evasion mechanism supports the idea that inflammasomes might play a vital role in antiviral defense.</p><p>Although the proinflammatory role of inflammasomes is well known, less is understood with respect to the requirement for inflammasomes in the generation of adaptive immune responses. Uric acid, which triggers NLRP3 inflammasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), has been shown to stimulate DC maturation and, when coinjected with antigen in vivo, significantly enhances the generation of responses from CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). NLRP3, as well as its adaptor molecule ASC, are required for contact hypersensitivity responses in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). More recently, the Th2-inducing adjuvant activity of alum was shown to be mediated through NLRP3/ASC inflammasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Thus, inflammasomes appear to play an important role in certain types of autoimmune diseases, hyperresponsiveness, and immunization. However, the role of inflammasomes in the recognition of viral infection in vivo and generation of protective adaptive immunity is unknown.</p><p>In this paper, we examine the role of the NLRP3 inflammasomes in the initiation of adaptive immunity after physiological infection with influenza virus. We describe requirement for caspase-1 inflammasomes in the hematopoietic, but not stromal, cells in the establishment of Th1, CTL, and IgA responses to respiratory flu infection. Collectively, our data provide the first evidence of the in vivo requirement for the components of inflammasomes in adaptive immunity to a virus infection.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in the lung after respiratory influenza infection</title><p>Although NLRP3-deficient macrophages were reported to be unable to activate IL-1&#x003b2; in response to influenza virus in the presence of ATP in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), the role of inflammasomes in influenza infection in vivo is unknown. In the lung, the primary targets of flu infection are the respiratory epithelial cells, which produce large amounts of virus that can subsequently infect alveolar macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) and DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). To begin to dissect the importance of various components of the inflammasome complex in response to influenza virus infection, we first examined IL-1&#x003b2; secretion in candidate cell types including BM&#x02013;derived macrophages (BMM), BM DCs and lung fibroblasts. Although BMM and BM DC exhibited significant reduction in IL-1&#x003b2; secretion in the absence of NLRP3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>), lung fibroblast cells activated inflammasomes independently of NLRP3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). All cell types required caspase-1 for release of IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;C</xref>). Next, we examined the target of NLR recognition of influenza virus. Stimulation of cells with influenza virions showed that attachment (blocked by 65&#x000b0;C inactivation), fusion (blocked by 56&#x000b0;C inactivation), and replication (blocked by UV irradiation) of the virus were required to elicit inflammasome activation in BM DCs (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081667/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081667/DC1</ext-link>) and in lung fibroblasts (Fig. S1 C). Purified genomic RNA, upon delivery by DOTAP, induced very low levels of IL-1&#x003b2; secretion in BM DC, which was enhanced by the addition of ATP (Fig. S1 B), indicating that flu genomic RNA, although insufficient to trigger inflammasomes, could serve as signal 1 for NLR-mediated IL-1&#x003b2; secretion. In contrast, flu genomic RNA and ATP treatment failed to elicit inflammasome activation in lung fibroblasts (Fig. S1 D). Collectively, these data indicated that influenza virus infection stimulates NLRP3-dependent and NLRP-3 independent inflammasomes in a cell autonomous and cell type&#x02013;specific manner and that other factors, in addition to viral genomic RNA, are required to elicit inflammasome activation.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>The role of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 in inflammasome activation and cellular recruitment to the lung after influenza infection.</bold> (A&#x02013;G) BM macrophages (A), BMDCs (B), or primary lung fibroblast (C) prepared from WT, NLRP3-, and caspase-1&#x02013;deficient mice were infected with A/PR8 virus at MOI 2.5. Supernatant was collected 12&#x02013;24 h after stimulation and analyzed for IL-1&#x003b2; by ELISA. WT, NLRP3-, NLRC4-, ASC-, and caspase-1&#x02013;deficient mice were infected intranasally with 10<sup>3</sup> PFU A/PR8 virus. BAL was collected by washing the trachea and lungs twice by injecting a total of 1 ml PBS containing 0.1% BSA (D and F). Lung homogenate was prepared in 2 ml PBS containing 0.1% BSA (E and G). IL-1&#x003b2; levels detected from the BAL or lung homogenate at different time points (D) or at 2 d p.i. (E&#x02013;G) are shown. Horizontal lines show the mean. (H&#x02013;I) Lung tissue was collected from the indicated groups of mice at 0 and 5 d p.i. Total lung leukocytes were enumerated. The values represent the mean of three mice per group and are expressed as the mean &#x000b1; SD. Similar results were obtained from at least two separate experiments. &#x0002a;, P &#x0003c; 0.05; &#x0002a;&#x0002a;, P &#x0003c; 0.01 versus a group of noninfected mice.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2060079f01"></graphic></fig><p>Next, to determine the role of NLRP3 inflammasomes in the secretion of IL-1&#x003b2; during physiologically relevant influenza virus infection in vivo, mice were challenged intranasally with influenza strain A/PR8. Active IL-1&#x003b2; was secreted into the BAL in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081667/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081667/DC1</ext-link>). Starting at 2 d post infection (p.i.), IL-1&#x003b2; secretion was evident in the BAL in WT mice infected with 10<sup>3</sup> PFU of influenza virus. However, mice deficient in NLRP3, ASC, or caspase-1, but not NLRC4, failed to secrete IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>) or IL-18 (Fig. S2 B) into the alveolar space in response to influenza infection. Inflammasome-independent cytokines, such as IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, KC, and MIP-2, were secreted comparably from NLRP3, ASC, or caspase-1 KO mice (Fig. S2, C&#x02013;F), indicating that the reduction in IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18 secretion is not caused by a general immune deficiency in these mice. In contrast to the BAL fluid, IL-1&#x003b2; secretion in the lung tissue was found to be independent of NLRP3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). To determine the cellular compartment responsible for the secretion of IL-1&#x003b2; in the lung, we generated BM chimeric mice in which only the hematopoietic (WT&#x02192;caspase-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) or the stromal cells (caspase-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>&#x02192;WT) expressed caspase-1. Measurement of IL-1&#x003b2; in the BAL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>) and lung tissue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>) indicated that inflammasome activation in vivo occurs within the hematopoietic compartment and the stromal compartment. A previous study demonstrated the importance of type I IFNs in inflammasome activation after <italic>Francisella novicida</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). However, in response to influenza infection, although partly important in BM DC response, responsiveness through type I IFN receptor was dispensable for IL-1&#x003b2; secretion in the BAL (Fig. S3). Collectively, these data indicated that NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in the alveolar macrophages and DCs within the alveolar space after respiratory challenge in a type I IFN-independent manner, whereas the lung tissue resident hematopoietic cells activate caspase-1 through NLRP3-independent pathways (Fig. S4).</p></sec><sec><title>ASC, caspase-1, and IL-1R, but not NLRP3, is required for cellular recruitment to the lung after flu infection</title><p>Next, we wished to determine the consequence of inflammasome activation in cellular recruitment to the infected lungs. In WT mice infected with A/PR8, accumulation of leukocytes became apparent starting around day 3 p.i. and peaking around day 5 p.i. (Fig. S5 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081667/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081667/DC1</ext-link>). Various leukocytes were detected including macrophages, DCs, pDCs, NK cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes (Fig. S5 B). These cellular subsets were defined by flow cytometry as described in Fig. S6. In contrast, mice deficient in ASC and caspase-1, but not NLRP3, exhibited significant reduction in cellular recruitment of all subsets (Fig. S5 C). In addition, IL-1R&#x02013;deficient mice were also impaired in their ability to induce leukocyte recruitment to the lung (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>). Furthermore, mice selectively defective in caspase-1 in the hematopoietic compartment (caspase-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>&#x02192;WT) were impaired in their ability to recruit leukocytes to the lung (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 I</xref>). Thus, these data indicated that although NLRP3 is required for IL-1&#x003b2; secretion into the alveolar space (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>), NLRP3-independent ASC/caspase-1&#x02013;dependent pathways (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>) in the lung tissue hematopoietic cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 I</xref>) result in IL-1&#x003b2; secretion leading to cellular infiltration in the lung.</p><p>IL-1&#x003b2; is a well known stimulator of neutrophil recruitment, which is triggered by the synthesis and display of chemokines and leukocyte adhesion molecules. Our data demonstrated that differential requirements for NLRP3&#x02013;IL-1&#x003b2; secretion into the alveolar space depended on NLRP3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>), whereas IL-1&#x003b2; secretion in the lung interstitium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>) and recruitment of leukocytes to the lung were independent of NLRP3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>). Furthermore, lung leukocyte infiltration depended on ASC, caspase-1, and IL-1R, indicating that inflammasome-released IL-1&#x003b2; is required to mediate this process. In contrast, NLRC4-deficient mice had normal IL-1&#x003b2; secretion as measured by BAL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). These data demonstrated a differential role of NLRP3; the cell types that secrete IL-1&#x003b2; in the alveolar space (such as alveolar macrophages and DCs) require NLRP3 for inflammasome activation, whereas those that secrete IL-1&#x003b2; in the lung interstitium (interstitial macrophages, DCs, and others) can trigger NLRP3-independent inflammasomes. Only the latter source of IL-1&#x003b2; is required to activate vascular endothelial cell to enable leukocyte migration into the lung (Fig. S4). Evidence exists for the NLRP3-independent ASC dimer&#x02013;mediated pyroptosome that can activate caspase-1 directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). It is of interest that other studies have described NLRP3/NLRC4-independent ASC/caspase-1&#x02013;dependent inflammasome activation in response to LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>) and cytosolic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Influenza-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses depend largely on ASC and Caspase-1 but not NLRP3</title><p>Next, to decipher the importance of inflammasomes in adaptive immune responses to influenza infection, mice deficient in NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, or IL-1R were infected with a sublethal dose of A/PR8 (10 PFU or 0.4 LD<sub>50</sub>). 14 d later, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were isolated from the spleen of flu-primed mice and restimulated with varying concentrations of inactivated virion or H-2D<sup>b</sup>&#x02013;restricted nucleoprotein (NP) peptide, respectively. Although CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from infected NLRP3-deficient mice responded similarly to those from WT mice, ASC<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, caspase-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), and IL-1R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>) mice failed to mount comparable CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell responses. In addition, ASC<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice demonstrated a partially reduced CTL phenotype compared with caspase-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or IL-1R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, in which CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell responses were barely detectable after immunization with live flu infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Furthermore, comparable reduction in virus-specific CD8 T cell numbers in the spleen and lung was observed by intracellular IFN-&#x003b3; staining (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref>) and by tetramer staining (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 H</xref>). These data indicated that NLRP3-independent ASC/caspase-1 inflammasomes and responsiveness through the IL-1R are required to elicit T cell responses to influenza virus in vivo. In addition, the intermediate phenotype of the defect in T cell responses in ASC<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> compared with caspase-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice suggests the presence of an ASC-independent caspase-1 inflammasome in the generation of T cell responses after influenza infection.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Influenza-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses depend largely on ASC and Caspase-1 but not NLRP3.</bold> WT, NLRP3-, ASC-, and caspase-1&#x02013;deficient mice (A and B), IL-1R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (C and D), or WT&#x02192;caspase-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and caspase-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>&#x02192;WT BM chimeric mice (E and F) were infected intranasally with a sublethal dose (10 PFU) of A/PR8 virus. 14 d p.i., CD8 and CD4 T cells were isolated from spleen and stimulated with irradiated APCs with the indicated amount of heat-inactivated virion or NP peptide for 72 h, respectively.

In contrast, serum IgG1 levels were significantly elevated in MyD88-deficient mice compared with WT or other inflammasome KO groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). A slight reduction in the IgG2c response was detected in ASC<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and caspase-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, which was similar to that seen in IL-1R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Only caspase-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had a significant reduction in IgG3 responses but not IL-1R&#x02013; or MyD88-deficient mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>), indicating that caspase-1&#x02013;dependent IL-1&#x003b2;&#x02013;, IL-18&#x02013;, and IL-33 (all upstream of MyD88)&#x02013;independent factors play a major role in the induction of this isotype response. In contrast, no significant differences were found in serum IgM responses (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>). Antibody secretion in the BM chimeric mice indicated that the requirement for caspase-1 was all attributable to its expression in the hematopoietic compartment alone (Fig. S7, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081667/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081667/DC1</ext-link>). These data indicated that at least one NLRP3-independent ASC- and caspase-1&#x02013;dependent inflammasome is required for nasal IgA and, to some extent, serum IgG2c responses to influenza virus. In addition, IL-1R and MyD88, which is downstream of TLRs, IL-1R, IL-18R, and ST2, are required for the same process in vivo. In contrast, IgG3 responses appear to depend mainly on caspase-1 but not on IL-1R or MyD88, whereas MyD88 has a regulatory role for IgG1 responses.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Differential requirement for NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 for immunoglobulin isotype responses to influenza virus.</bold> WT, NLRP3-, ASC-, caspase-1&#x02013;, IL-1R&#x02013;, and MyD88-deficient mice were infected intranasally with a sublethal dose (10 PFU) of A/PR8 virus.

Previous studies have demonstrated the requirement for TLR7 and MyD88 in adaptive immunity to influenza virus infection with somewhat conflicting results. Lopez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>) found no requirement for MyD88 on T cells or immunoglobulin responses to aerosolized influenza virus challenge. In contrast, Koyama et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>) showed that TLR7 or MyD88 is required for the induction of B cell secretion of anti-HA IgG2a and IgG2c but not CTL responses. Heer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>) demonstrated that IgG2a and IgG2c responses to flu were impaired in MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> but not in TLR7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. All studies found IgG1 antibody levels to be elevated in MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>) as well as TLR7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Together, these studies indicated that activation of CD8 T cells during antiinfluenza immune response relies on mechanisms other than the TLR7 and MyD88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>), whereas IgG2a/c and CD4 T cell responses depend on MyD88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). In light of the data we present here, inflammasome recognition of influenza virus infection plays a more dominant role in the establishment of CD8 T cell responses compared with TLR7. In addition, we found that serum IgG2c responses were largely dependent on both ASC-dependent caspase-1 inflammasome signals. These data suggested that caspase-1 inflammasomes, as well as TLR7/MyD88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), play a key role in the formation of IgG2c-secreting B cells after flu infection. A pronounced defect in nasal IgA production in ASC and caspase-1&#x02013;deficient mice and complete impairment in MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice suggest that inflammasomes and IL-1R signals are required to elicit B cell secretion of IgA in the nasal mucosa.</p></sec><sec><title>ASC, caspase-1, and IL-1R, but not NLRP3, are required for survival after sublethal influenza challenge</title><p>Finally, we examined the importance of inflammasomes in immune-mediated protection. To this end, we followed viral titer and survival of mice after intranasal challenge with a sublethal dose (10 PFU) of A/PR8. The virus titers in the lung of infected mice revealed that all mice sustained similar viral load at day 5 p.i., indicating that, with the low dose viral challenge, inflammasomes were not required for innate immune protection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). In contrast, at later stages of infection, viral clearance was severely impaired in mice deficient for ASC, caspase-1, or IL-1R, but not NLRP3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Specifically, caspase-1 in the hematopoietic but not stromal compartment was required for control of virus replication at this stage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). This effect became pronounced on day 10 p.i., when WT and NLRP3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had completely cleared the virus and those deficient in ASC, caspase-1, or IL-1R sustained high virus burden in the lung (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Consequently, although WT and NLRP3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice recovered from sublethal infection with influenza virus, the majority of the flu-challenged ASC<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, caspase-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and IL-1R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice succumbed to death by 18 d p.i. (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). These data indicated that NLRP3-independent ASC-dependent caspase-1 inflammasomes are required to provide IL-1R&#x02013;dependent immune protection against respiratory influenza infection. It is unclear which NLRPs are responsible for the recognition of influenza virus in the initiation of ASC inflammasome-dependent immune responses. Future identification of NLRP responsible for influenza recognition will provide important insights into the molecular mechanism.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>ASC-1&#x02013;, caspase-1&#x02013;, and IL-1R&#x02013;deficient mice, but not NLRP3-deficient mice, are more susceptible to influenza infection and disease.</bold> WT, NLRP3-, ASC-, caspase-1&#x02013;, and IL-1R&#x02013;deficient mice (A) and WT&#x02192;caspase-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and caspase-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>&#x02192;WT BM chimeric mice (B) were infected intranasally with a sublethal dose (10 PFU) of A/PR8 virus.

It is well known that recovery from influenza infection requires CD8 T cells. The antiviral capacity of flu-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells is dependent on their ability to migrate to the lungs and come in contact with infected airway epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Effector CD8 T cells begin to appear in the lung &#x0223c;5&#x02013;7 d after infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Thus, the inability of ASC- and caspase-1&#x02013;deficient mice to clear virus in the lung at 8 and 10 d after influenza infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>) is likely the result of a combined effect of their failure to develop robust systemic CD8 T cell responses and to recruit effector CD8 T cells to the lung (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and Fig. S5 C). This recruitment and effector T cell induction are downstream of IL-1R signaling, as IL-1R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice failed to elicit lung cellular infiltration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) or T cell responses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). These data provide important evidence for the requirements for inflammasomes in multiple stages of antiviral immune defense.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated the requirement for ASC/caspase-1 inflammasomes in the development of adaptive immune responses to respiratory influenza virus infection. Our data support the notion that influenza virus is recognized through an ASC-dependent pathway in addition to TLR7 and RIG-I. Both caspase-1 (this paper) and TLR7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>) recognition pathways, but not RIG-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), appear to be required for adaptive immune responses to influenza virus. These data have significant implications in the design of prophylactic vaccines and management of influenza infection in general. Stimulants of inflammasomes may provide an ideal adjuvant candidate in flu vaccines that will confer protective immune responses. Finally, clinical management of severe pathogenic influenza strains, such as H5N1 avian strains, which often cause immunopathology, may require blockade of inflammasome to attenuate pathology in addition to antiviral therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Animals.</title><p>The generation of mice deficient in NLRP3, ASC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), NLRC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), caspase-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), and MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>) has been reported previously.
