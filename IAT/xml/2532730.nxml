Although the phenotype of BS cells is suggestive of a role for BLM in repair of stalled or damaged replication forks, thus far there has been no direct evidence that BLM associates with any of the three human replicative DNA polymerases. Here, we show that BLM interacts specifically <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> with p12, the smallest subunit of human POL &#x003b4; (hPOL &#x003b4;). The hPOL &#x003b4; enzyme, as well as the isolated p12 subunit, stimulates the DNA helicase activity of BLM. Conversely, BLM stimulates hPOL &#x003b4; strand displacement activity. Our results provide the first functional link between BLM and the replicative machinery in human cells, and suggest that BLM might be recruited to sites of disrupted replication through an interaction with hPOL &#x003b4;. Finally, our data also define a novel role for the poorly characterized p12 subunit of hPOL &#x003b4;.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The faithful completion of chromosomal DNA replication is of crucial importance in determining the fidelity with which genetic information is passed from mother to daughter cells. Incomplete replication or the erroneous copying of a damaged DNA template can give rise to genome instability, accumulation of mutations and, in multicellular organisms, to neoplastic transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Chromosomal DNA replication in eukaryotic cells requires three distinct DNA polymerases named DNA polymerase &#x003b1; (POL &#x003b1;), &#x003b5; (POL &#x003b5;) and &#x003b4; (POL &#x003b4;). POL &#x003b4; and POL &#x003b5; are required for replication of the leading strand and for completion of lagging strand DNA synthesis. Their respective roles in the replication of leading and lagging strands are still uncertain, though it has been proposed that POL &#x003b4; and POL &#x003b5; function specifically at the lagging and leading strands of the replication fork, respectively. POL &#x003b4; is also involved in different DNA repair pathways as a gap filling enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The mammalian POL &#x003b4; has been studied extensively as a core enzyme consisting of four subunits named p125, p66, p50 and p12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Two of the subunits form a tightly-associated catalytic heterodimer consisting of the catalytic p125 subunit, which has both 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; DNA polymerase and 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; exonuclease activities, and p50. The role of the p66 subunit is to bind PCNA, the homotrimeric sliding clamp that functions as a processivity factor for POL &#x003b4; during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). A specific role for the p12 subunit has not been identified thus far, although it has been shown to interact with the p125 and p50 subunits of POL &#x003b4; and Proliferating Cell Antigen (PCNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), and data from <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA replication assays indicate that addition of p12 enhances the DNA polymerizing activity of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The levels of p12 are regulated by the proteasome through the mechanism that is not dependent upon p12 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Apart from PCNA, no other interacting protein has been characterized that specifically associates with p12.</p><p>The RecQ family of DNA helicases represents a group of evolutionarily conserved enzymes that are involved in the maintenance of genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). There are five members of this family known in humans called RECQL1, BLM, WRN, RECQL4 and RECQL5. Defects in three of these give rise to defined clinical disorders associated with cancer predisposition and various aspects of premature aging: mutations in the <italic>WRN</italic> and <italic>RECQL4</italic> genes result in Werner's syndrome (WS) and Rothmund&#x02013;Thomson syndrome (RTS), respectively, both of which feature genome instability, predisposition to some types of cancer and the early onset of several aging features. Mutations in the <italic>BLM</italic> gene cause Bloom's syndrome (BS), which is also associated with excessive chromosomal instability and a high incidence of cancers of all types. In contrast to WS and RTS, no obvious premature aging has been observed in BS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Cells derived from BS patients show a 10-fold higher frequency of reciprocal exchanges between sister chromatids (SCEs), as well as excessive chromosome breakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The BLM protein is a DNA structure-specific helicase that unwinds DNA in 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), and shows an apparent preference for unwinding of synthetic Holliday junctions, G-quadruplex (G4) DNA and D-loop DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). These substrates represent different DNA structures that can be formed <italic>in vivo</italic> during DNA replication and homologous recombination (HR) processes. Cell biological studies have shown that BLM is localized in the nucleus of human cells within discrete foci termed promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). BLM also localizes to nucleoli in S-phase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), and to telomeres in cells lacking telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). On the basis of the aforementioned reports, it has been proposed that BLM functions at the interface of DNA replication and recombination, and facilitates the repair of damaged DNA replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>A large body of evidence implicates BLM in DNA replication. First, DNA replication defects, such as a retarded rate of nascent DNA chain elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) and accumulation of abnormal replication intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), have been described in BS cells. Second, BLM interacts physically and functionally with several proteins that play important roles during DNA replication, such as replication protein A (RPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), FEN-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) and chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Third, BLM is localized to replication foci, particularly during late S phase, and this co-localization increases in the presence of agents that inhibit DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Fourth, BLM expression is activated at the G1/S boundary and peaks in late S-phase/G2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Fifth, BS cells are hypersensitive to agents that perturb DNA replication, such as hydroxyurea (HU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we report the physical and functional interaction of BLM with p12, the smallest subunit of human POL &#x003b4; (hPOL &#x003b4;). Consistent with this interaction playing an important biological function, we show that the presence of the hPOL &#x003b4; enzyme, as well as the p12 subunit alone, can specifically stimulate the DNA helicase activity of BLM. We also find that BLM specifically promotes hPOL &#x003b4; strand displacement activity. Furthermore, we show that the co-localization of BLM and hPOL &#x003b4; in nuclear foci is activated during replicative stress. Our data are consistent with a role for hPOL &#x003b4; in the recruitment of BLM to sites of arrested or disrupted DNA replication forks, in order for it to effect its role in fork repair and/or stabilization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Purification of the hPOL &#x003b4; enzyme</title><p>Four-subunit hPOL &#x003b4; was expressed by infection of insect cells with four recombinant baculoviruses, each encoding a subunit of hPOL &#x003b4;. Recombinant baculoviruses encoding the hPOL &#x003b4; subunits were a kind gift from Dr Valdimir Podust. In order to produce an exonuclease deficient hPOL &#x003b4; mutant, a D402A substitution mutation was introduced into the p125/wt cDNA by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis of the transfer vector pVL1393/p125. Primer sequences are available upon request.

The coverslips were then rinsed with ice-cold PBS. Soluble proteins were removed by incubating the slides in pre-extraction buffer [10 mM PIPES, 300 mM sucrose, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 (pH 6.8)] for 5 min on ice. The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min on ice. The immunostaining was performed as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) using the IHIC34 rabbit polyclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and the AlexaFluor 488 conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) to detect BLM, at 1 : 200 and 1 : 800 dilutions, respectively. The A-9 mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, California, USA) against the catalytic subunit of hPOL &#x003b4; and the CY3 conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK) were used to detect hPOL &#x003b4;, at 1 : 400 and 1 : 1000 dilutions, respectively. BrdU incorporation was detected after repeated paraformaldehyde fixation and HCl denaturation with rat anti-BrdU primary antibody (Abcam) and AlexaFluor 350 conjugated goat anti-rat secondary antibody (Molecular Probes), each at 1 : 300 dilution. Epifluorescence microscopy, image acquisition and analysis were carried out on a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope with the Lucia G software (Laboratory Imaging s.r.o., Prague, Czech Republic). Grabbed images were scored manually using the Adobe Photoshop program. Foci obtained following staining with either antibody (green or red) were marked and counted. Foci were counted as co-localizing if more than 50% of the green and red signal was overlapping. Co-localization was expressed as percentage of the total number of BLM (green) or POL &#x003b4; (red) foci. The total number of cells scored in each treatment was 100.

A far-western assay was then used to test for a specific interaction between BLM and one or more of the hPOL &#x003b4; subunits. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, the BLM protein specifically interacted with a protein of apparent molecular mass of 14 kDa (lane 6), which corresponds to p12, the smallest subunit of hPOL &#x003b4;. In contrast, BLM did not interact with any of the other three hPOL &#x003b4; subunits, with an unrelated human DNA polymerase, hPOL &#x003bb; (lane 4), or with any protein from the extract of Sf9 insect cells from which the recombinant hPOL &#x003b4; enzyme was purified (lane 5). In order to confirm that BLM specifically binds to p12, the far-western analysis was repeated using full-length BLM and purified recombinant p12 immobilized on nitrocellulose. Clear evidence of binding was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, lane 9). Moreover, in a reverse far-western, purified p12 specifically bound to full-length BLM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, lane 6), but not to BSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, lane 4) or to another human RecQ helicase, WRN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, lane 5). No cross-reactivity of either the anti-BLM antibody with p12, or the anti-p12 antibody with BLM was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, lanes 1&#x02013;3 and 7 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, lanes 1&#x02013;3). Taken together, these data indicate that BLM and p12 interact specifically <italic>in vitro.</italic></p><p>To validate the results obtained from far-western assays, we next performed YTH analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, p12 interacted with full-length BLM, but not with full-length WRN or <italic>E. coli</italic> RecQ, indicating that the physical interaction between p12 and BLM is specific. Furthermore, no YTH interaction could be detected between the full-length BLM fused to Gal4-AD and any of the other three hPOL &#x003b4; subunits (p125, p66 and p50) fused to LexA-DBD (data not shown).</p><p>To gain insight into the possible association of BLM and p12 in human cells, we performed co-IP assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). Because the endogenous levels of p12 are very low and our newly generated anti-p12 antisera did not work in IP assays, we were forced to use ectopically expressed p12. For this, FLAG-p12 was transiently transfected into 293T cells and the cells were subsequently synchronized in S phase by treatment with 1 mM HU for 24 h. Synchronization of the 293T cells was confirmed by fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis (data not shown). Using an anti-FLAG antibody, we were able to specifically co-immunoprecipitate BLM from HU-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, lane 4), but not from unsynchronized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, lane 3). As expected, the anti-FLAG antibody efficiently precipitated p125, the largest subunit of hPOL &#x003b4;, from both HU-treated and unsynchronized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, lanes 3 and 4, lower panel). No BLM was present in the precipitate when a control antibody was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, lane 2). A reciprocal co-IP experiment was also carried out, in which an anti-BLM polyclonal antibody was used to immunoprecipitate FLAG-p12 from 293T nuclear extracts. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, p12 could be specifically co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous BLM from the S phase-synchronized cells (lane 8), but not from unsynchronized 293T cells (lane 7). Furthermore, in addition to p12, the anti-BLM antibody efficiently co-immunoprecipitated hp150, the largest subunit of CAF-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, lanes 7 and 8, lower panel), a protein shown previously to interact with BLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Similar co-IP results were obtained when 293T-derived nuclear cell extracts were incubated with ethidium bromide, indicating that the <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction of p12 and BLM is unlikely to be mediated by DNA (data not shown). Finally, the specificity of co-IPs with the anti-BLM antibody was demonstrated in a control experiment using nuclear extracts from BS (BLM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) cells: in this case, the anti-BLM antibody could not co-immunoprecipitate p12 from these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, lane 11, lower panel), whereas it could efficiently co-immunoprecipitate p12 from S phase-synchronized BS cells containing the <italic>BLM</italic> cDNA (BLM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> + pBLM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, lane 12, lower panel). Collectively, these data indicate that BLM directly associates with the p12 subunit of hPOL &#x003b4; <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that the BLM/p12 interaction in human cells is exclusively or predominantly seen in cells in which DNA replication is arrested.</p></sec><sec><title>Mapping of the interacting regions on BLM and p12</title><p>BLM contains several important domains; a conserved helicase domain (aa 649&#x02013;1006), an RecQ familiy C-terminal (RQC) domain (aa 1006&#x02013;1077) and an Helicase, RNAse D C terminal (HRDC) domain (aa 1212&#x02013;1292), all of which are involved in mediating protein&#x02013;DNA interactions, and possibly also protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). To identify the region of BLM that mediates the interaction with p12, we generated a series of BLM deletion mutants and tested them for their ability to interact with full-length p12 in the YTH assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). The results indicated that p12 binds BLM in the region between amino acids 447 and 770. This fragment of BLM comprises the helicase-proximal region of the N-terminal domain and part of the helicase domain. A similar YTH approach was used to map the region of p12 that interacts with BLM. A single short region of p12, comprising amino acids 31&#x02013;60, was found to be necessary and sufficient for interaction with BLM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Interaction region mapping of BLM and p12.

To test this hypothesis, we first determined whether the hPOL &#x003b4; enzyme influences BLM helicase activity. In order to see a potential effect of hPOL &#x003b4;, either positive or negative, the BLM concentration used in the helicase assays was sufficient only for partial unwinding of the substrate during a 15-min reaction period. To prevent the potential degradation of the helicase substrate or product by the exonuclease activity of hPOL &#x003b4;, the hPOL &#x003b4; enzyme used carried a mutation in the exonuclease domain of p125 (D402A) and was, therefore, exonuclease defective. When hPOL &#x003b4; was added to the reaction in concentrations giving molar ratios of 25 to 0.4 times that of the BLM concentration, we saw a significant, concentration-dependent stimulation of helicase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, lanes 6&#x02013;12).

We found that this stimulatory effect was specific to the BLM/hPOL &#x003b4; complex, as hPOL &#x003b4; had no effect on another RecQ helicase, <italic>E. coli</italic> RecQ, in the same concentration range (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn498/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>A, lanes 7&#x02013;17, and B). Moreover, we showed that another human DNA polymerase, hPOL &#x003bb;, which we had shown did not bind to BLM in far-western analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), did not influence BLM helicase activity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn498/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>C, lanes 6&#x02013;17, and D).

We tested, therefore, the effect of recombinant p12 subunit on the helicase activity of BLM. p12 showed a concentration-dependent stimulatory effect on BLM similar to that of the hPOL &#x003b4; enzyme; however, the effective concentration range was such that there was a large molar excess of p12 over BLM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, lanes 6&#x02013;15). Interestingly, heat-denatured p12 was also able to stimulate BLM helicase activity at this high concentration (1.609 &#x003bc;M; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, lane 5), which, in the light of the results showing that a small peptide is also able to stimulate the helicase activity of BLM, is not inexplicable (see below). As described earlier, we saw concentration-dependent stimulation of BLM helicase activity by p12 only at high p12 concentration. Therefore, we designed a different system to study this effect and monitored the progress of the unwinding reaction over time in the presence or absence of p12. This revealed that p12 and the hPOL &#x003b4; enzyme increased the kinetics of the BLM unwinding reaction to a similar extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C and D). The effect was concentration-dependent and reproducible using various molar ratios of BLM and hPOL&#x003b4; or p12 (1 : 0.8&#x02013;1 : 3.9, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn498/DC1">Supplementary Figure 3</ext-link> and data not shown; 1 : 23.5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref>C, D and 5). The initial linear part of the progress curves permitted us to approximate the initial velocity of the reaction. Depending on the molar ratio of hPOL &#x003b4; or hp12 and BLM, we saw a 2&#x02013;15 times increase in the initial velocity of unwinding (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn498/DC1">Supplementary Figure 3</ext-link>, and data not shown).</p><p>This result prompted us to test the effect on BLM activity of the tightly-defined interacting region of p12. For this, two peptides were chemically synthesized: p12<sup>30&#x02013;60</sup> covers the BLM-binding region, while p12<sup>71&#x02013;100</sup> maps to a region of p12 that shows no BLM-binding, as revealed in the YTH mapping studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B).

We observed that hPOL &#x003b4; alone was able to incorporate dNTPs up to the start of the X-junction structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, lane 2). The inability of hPOL &#x003b4; to extend the primer beyond the pause site indicates that the X-junction structure effectively blocked progression of hPOL &#x003b4; along the template strand. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>BLM stimulates hPOL &#x003b4; strand displacement activity.

To detect hPOL &#x003b4; were restricted in our use of antibodies, because our antibody to p12 did not work in immunofluorescence analysis. Hence, we chose an antibody against the catalytic subunit p125, which directly interacts with p12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, lanes 3 and 4). As expected from previous analyses, BLM and hPOL &#x003b4; showed a punctate nuclear pattern of localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Representative images of the staining patterns are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A and B. The degree of co-localization of nuclear foci was then scored. This analysis indicated a low degree of co-localization in an untreated asynchronous cell population, which increased in response to HU treatment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn498/DC1">Supplementary Figure 5</ext-link>). This increase in the extent of co-localization might be restricted to S phase or might be an effect of the HU-induced replication perturbation. To address this, we took advantage of the BrdU labeling of the actively replicating cells. When only the BrdU-positive subpopulation was scored in the untreated cultures, the degree of co-localization was similar to that of the whole asynchronous population. These results suggest that BLM and hPOL &#x003b4; co-localize only to a limited extent <italic>in vivo</italic>, even during an unperturbed S phase, but that perturbation of DNA replication causes an increase in their co-localization. Nevertheless, even after treatment of cells with HU, most BLM and hPOL &#x003b4; foci still did not co-localize, indicating that a significant fraction of BLM remains distant from sites of stalled replication forks. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Dual staining for BLM and hPOL &#x003b4; suggests co-localization <italic>in vivo</italic>, which is stimulated during replicative stress.

This interaction is direct and is mediated via the thus far poorly characterized p12 subunit of hPOL &#x003b4;. We mapped the site of interaction of BLM with p12 to a region representing amino acids 447&#x02013;770. This fragment includes the N-terminal part of the BLM helicase domain and it has been shown previously that this is involved in interaction with the WRN helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). In addition, we mapped the region of p12 that interacts with BLM to a short fragment comprising amino acids 30&#x02013;60. Database searches revealed that this p12 fragment does not represent any known conserved protein domain and that it shows no sequence homology to any known BLM interacting partner. Of most importance, we have also shown that BLM and hPOL &#x003b4; can functionally associate in that their interaction leads to stimulation of the BLM helicase activity and hPOL &#x003b4; strand displacement activity.</p><p>There are a number of possible scenarios in DNA replication/repair where the productive co-operation of BLM and hPOL &#x003b4; might be advantageous. Perhaps the most plausible is during the process of fork regression under circumstances where a replication fork is arrested by a DNA adduct or another blockade, particularly those that block leading strand synthesis. We have shown recently that BLM can promote the regression of a model replication fork <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). This may be a reaction that is beneficial for DNA repair simply because, through promoting fork back-tracking, it allows access to the blocking &#x02018;lesion&#x02019;. However, there is also potential for fork regression to be important in a lesion bypass pathway of DNA damage tolerance. If the lesion blocks leading strand synthesis, it appears that the synthesis of the lagging strand may continue for some distance ahead of the site of the blocked leading strand. This apparently futile uncoupling of leading and lagging strand synthesis has the potential, after fork regression, to permit template switching with the shorter leading strand being extended by copying of the longer lagging strand template. In this way, once the regressed fork is reset, the leading strand would be extended beyond the site of the lesion and normal DNA replication could commence. hPOL &#x003b4; might both recruit BLM to stalled forks and then stimulate its catalytic activity once there. Conversely, BLM might play a role in assisting hPOL &#x003b4; to access the regressed &#x02018;4th arm&#x02019; and catalyse extension of the leading strand.</p><p>It has been suggested that RecQ helicases together with the type 1A topoisomerase, Top3, act at damaged replication forks to resolve recombination structures likely resulting from template switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). We suggest that BLM plays a dual role in rescuing arrested replication forks. One function is in assisting POL &#x003b4; to bypass DNA lesions via fork regression and template switching, and the second function of BLM is to resolve the resulting pseudo double Holliday junction with a help of Top3. These two functions of BLM may be independent of each other.</p><p>A striking feature of the ability of hPOL &#x003b4; to stimulate the helicase activity of BLM was our finding that a short peptide (aa 30&#x02013;60) representing the minimal binding region of p12 is as efficient in this stimulatory role as is the hPOL &#x003b4; enzyme. This would seem to rule out many possible mechanisms for the stimulation, including recruitment of BLM to the DNA substrate. Instead, these results argue for hPOL &#x003b4; acting to alter the conformation of BLM in such a way as to enhance its helicase function. Such a mechanism is further supported by the unusual reaction progress curves: after an initial burst of activity the reaction very quickly reaches its maximum without attaining 100% unwinding. Unwinding by helicases is believed to be a multi-step process: (i) changes of the quaternary structure of the enzyme alter its binding specificity; (ii) the enzyme binds to the substrate with an increased affinity; (iii) DNA binding initiates ATP hydrolysis; and (iv) unwinding commences. Under our single turnover unwinding conditions, we postulate that the rate-limiting step is the activation of the helicase. We postulate that hPOL &#x003b4; facilitates these structural changes, and when the enzyme is mixed with its substrates (DNA and ATP) it is already in its active conformation ready to initiate unwinding immediately upon binding. Furthermore, hPOL &#x003b4; also increases the extent of unwinding by BLM. This increase might be a consequence of increased processivity of the helicase, which in turn might also be the result of conformational changes initiated by hPOL &#x003b4;. A major goal for the future will be to characterize in molecular detail how exactly this stimulation occurs, and how this short peptide can have such a marked effect on the BLM helicase.</p><p>Our data indicate that BLM and hPOL &#x003b4; do not significantly co-localize in the nucleus of human cells under normal growth conditions, including within an unperturbed S phase. This is consistent with the known localization of BLM to PML bodies and not to sites of ongoing replication. However, we were able to detect a consistent increase in the percentage of nuclear BLM foci that co-localize with hPOL &#x003b4; when cells were treated with HU. Taken together, these data indicate that this association at replication foci is driven by replication perturbation and not by cell-cycle phase <italic>per se</italic>. To support these results, we could show direct association of BLM with the p12 subunit of hPOL &#x003b4; <italic>in vivo</italic> in cells which were synchronized in S phase by HU treatment. No interaction between BLM and p12 could be observed in unsynchronized cells. Our data showing that BLM and p12 co-immunoprecipitate from the nuclear extracts of the 293T cells after treatment with 1 mM HU seemingly contrast with the recent data of Zhang and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), who reported that, in HeLa and 293T cells, p12 undergoes ubiquitination and degradation 20 h after the treatment with 2 mM HU. These differences are possibly the result of the different HU concentrations that have been employed in these two studies. Alternatively, it may well be that binding of BLM to p12 prevents p12 ubiquitination and degradation, which is the reason why we did not observe degradation of p12 in our experiments.</p><p>We have also shown that BLM, similar to PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), promotes the strand displacement activity of hPOL &#x003b4;. BLM might help hPOL &#x003b4; to traverse short regions of DNA secondary structure during the process of DNA replication, but we have no direct evidence for this and such a possibility still needs to be investigated. However, we could not observe any effect of BLM on hPOL &#x003b4; polymerase activity on a simple primer/template substrate. It has been shown previously that WRN has a stimulatory effect on the polymerization activity of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> POL &#x003b4; in the absence of PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). However, WRN does not apparently have an effect on DNA synthesis catalysed by the POL &#x003b4;-PCNA complex. These results suggest that WRN may not function in processive DNA synthesis reactions during normal DNA replication; instead, WRN may function in replication restart of stalled or collapsed replication forks from which the replication machinery has dissociated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).</p><p>Our current hypothesis is that BLM may, in a similar manner to WRN, be involved in replication restart of stalled replication forks blocked by DNA damage or unusual secondary structures in DNA template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). One such scenario is during the replication of ribosomal DNA in the nucleolus. Similar to telomeres, ribosomal DNA is GC rich and can adopt alternative DNA structures such as hairpins and G-quadruplexes. These structures are efficiently resolved <italic>in vitro</italic> by BLM and WRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43 B44 B45">43&#x02013;45</xref>). When overexpressed in HeLa cells, WRN can recruit the p50 and p125 subunit of hPOL &#x003b4; from nucleoplasm to the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). In an unperturbed cell cycle, BLM is found primarily in PML nuclear bodies, except during late S phase when it co-localizes with WRN in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Additionally, BLM binds to ribosomal DNA and primarily at the non-transcribed spacer region where replication forks initiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). These findings suggest that BLM may be directly coupled to replication fork initiation and/or progression at particular sites of DNA synthesis. The fact that BLM and hPOL &#x003b4; co-localize more prominently after blockade of replication, but that not all replication foci contain BLM under these conditions, suggests that BLM may be recruited to sites of DNA synthesis only in response to the formation of a particular DNA structure that needs BLM helicase function for its resolution. It will be interesting to address in the future whether BLM is recruited to hPOL &#x003b4; foci only following posttranslational modification of one or both of these factors, or whether the association is mediated by other replication factors to which BLM binds, such as RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn498/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkn498_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="gkn498_nar-00761-w-2008-File011.doc"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-powerpoint" xlink:href="gkn498_nar-00761-w-2008-File012.ppt"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="gkn498_nar-00761-w-2008-File013.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="gkn498_nar-00761-w-2008-File014.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="gkn498_nar-00761-w-2008-File015.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-powerpoint" xlink:href="gkn498_nar-00761-w-2008-File016.ppt"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="gkn498_nar-00761-w-2008-File017.tif"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Pavel Janscak for the gift of purified recombinant WRN, Vladimir Podust for the gift of recombinant baculoviruses encoding the hPOL &#x003b4; subunits, and Grant Brown for critical reading of the article and helpful discussions.
