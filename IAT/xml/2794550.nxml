The only phenotype of mouse PRDM9 knockouts is a meiosis I block that causes sterility in both sexes. The PRDM9 gene encodes a protein with histone H3(K4) trimethyltransferase activity, a KRAB domain, and a DNA-binding domain consisting of multiple tandem C2H2 zinc finger (ZF) domains. We have analyzed human coding polymorphism and interspecies evolutionary changes in the PRDM9 gene. The ZF domains of PRDM9 are evolving very rapidly, with compelling evidence of positive selection in primates. Positively selected amino acids are predominantly those known to make nucleotide specific contacts in C2H2 zinc fingers. These results suggest that PRDM9 is subject to recurrent selection to change DNA-binding specificity. The human PRDM9 protein is highly polymorphic in its ZF domains and nearly all polymorphisms affect the same nucleotide contact residues that are subject to positive selection. ZF domain nucleotide sequences are strongly homogenized within species, indicating that interfinger recombination contributes to their evolution. PRDM9 has previously been assumed to be a transcription factor required to induce meiosis specific genes, a role that is inconsistent with its molecular evolution. We suggest instead that PRDM9 is involved in some aspect of centromere segregation conflict and that rapidly evolving centromeric DNA drives changes in PRDM9 DNA-binding domains.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Allelic incompatibility at the mouse PRDM9 (Meisetz) locus can cause hybrid male sterility due to failure in spermatogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008505-Mihola1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since the ZF domains are the only DNA-binding domains in PRDM9, it is likely that they confer the DNA-binding specificity of PRDM9. Because of its histone modifying activity and DNA-binding domains, it has been assumed that PRDM9 encodes a transcription factor that regulates other genes important for germ line meiosis but there is no direct evidence for such a role.</p><p>The structure of ZF domains of the type found in PRDM9 bound to DNA is well-established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008505-Pavletich1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008505-ElrodErickson1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008505-Kim1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Tandem ZF domains confer DNA-binding specificity in a modular manner, with sequential ZF domains binding sequential 3 nt DNA sequences in target sites. Each core ZF domain is typically 21 residues long and consists of a conserved framework of amino acids that coordinates and positions a highly variable nucleotide contact region. Adjacent core ZF domains are joined by a conserved 7 amino acid linker region, which makes a DNA phosphate contact and coordinates adjacent zinc fingers. Within the core ZF domain, nucleotide contacts are made by an eight amino acid turn-helix that occupies the major groove of DNA. Three amino acids make the major nucleotide contacts and adjacent residues may contribute additional contacts and influence the positioning of the major nucleotide contacts. The positions of all these amino acids are highly conserved and can be directly inferred from ZF domain sequence.</p><p>We report analysis of molecular evolution of the PRDM9 gene based on sequence comparisons between primate species and on human polymorphisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Primate Divergence and Positive Selection</title><p>We identified PRDM9 orthologs in primates and analyzed their molecular evolution. Most of the PRDM9 gene is well conserved in sequence, but the ZF domains are highly divergent. For example, in the 12 ZF domains of human and chimpanzee PRDM9 proteins, 28 of the 36 major nucleotide contact residues differ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008505-g001">Figure 1</xref>), despite a genome-wide average nucleotide divergence of 1.2&#x00025; and protein divergence of 0.12&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008505-The1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. To study selection acting on primate PRDM9 genes, we performed maximum-likelihood analysis of synonymous and nonsynonymous codons in the human, chimpanzee, orangutan, macaque, and baboon. Most of the 894 codons in the PRDM9 alignment are characterized by negative (purifying) selection, indicated by a low estimated d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S</sub> value (frequency of nonsynonymous change relative to synonymous change). However 32 codons had a high estimated d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S</sub> value that reached statistical significance for positive selection (P&#x0003e;0.95). Of these 32 codons, 26 encode major nucleotide contact residues in ZF domains and all 6 other codons are immediately adjacent to major nucleotide contact residues. Several additional codons in DNA-binding turn-helix regions also had high estimated d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S</sub> values that did not reach statistical significance. Divergence in the DNA-binding turn-helix regions is obvious by simple inspection of the protein multiple alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008505-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In addition to rapid divergence in the DNA-binding residues, there are several changes in the number of ZF domains among the five primates. All of these changes are the result of precise insertion or deletion of entire ZF domains, consistent with generation by unequal cross-over events. These changes are also expected to affect DNA-binding specificity. A high degree of amino acid divergence in the DNA-binding turn-helix region and changes in ZF domain number were also observed in other mammals, including rodents (data not shown).</p><fig id="pone-0008505-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008505.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Sites of positive selection in primate PRDM9 genes.</title><p>Schematic of PRDM9 protein showing KRAB, SSXRD (SSX repression domain), SET, and ZF domains.

Of 35 distinct SNPs, 31 are nonsynonymous, indicating an exceptionally high population diversity in PRDM9 protein sequence. The positions of the 31 nonsynonymous SNPs are remarkable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008505-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008505-g002">Figure 2</xref>): 28 of 31 affect ZF domains or the linkers between ZF domains, and 24 of these 28 affect residues in the DNA-binding turn-helix of ZF domains. In the entire PRDM9 protein of 894 amino acids, only 96 amino acids are in a DNA-binding turn-helix region (8 in each of 12 ZF domains), indicating a highly significant enrichment of nonsynonymous SNPs in turn-helix residues (24/31 vs. 96/894, P&#x0003c;0.0001 by Fisher's exact test). Taken together with the strong positive selection acting at the same class of sites, this pattern suggests an ongoing series of partial selective sweeps affecting PRDM9. In the study of Japanese men, allele frequencies were determined for 21 SNPs. Two of these 21 were found only once in patients with azoospermia; neither affects a ZF turn-helix. All of the remaining 19 alleles were common in the Japanese population (&#x0003e;1&#x00025; frequency) and all 19 affect a ZF turn helix. Of the 12 nonsynonymous SNPs found in non-Japanese populations, only one is identical to a Japanese SNP. This lack of overlap suggests that both the Japanese and non-Japanese PRDM9 polymorphisms arose very recently.</p><fig id="pone-0008505-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008505.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Human nonsynonymous polymorphisms according to position in their zinc finger.</title><p>The amino acid sequence below shows the defining C2H2 zinc coordinating residues and their invariant spacing.

We investigated the generality of this pattern by identifying putative PRDM9 sequences from 19 sequenced mammalian genomes (including the primates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008505-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The 19 sequences all encode multiple ZF domains with the same spacing and arrangement as that in human and mouse. The number of ZF domains ranges from 3 to 20 with an average of 8.3. A dot plot of ZF amino acid sequence similarity within genes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008505-g003">Figure 3</xref>. With the possible exception of tenrec, intraspecies ZF domains are clearly more similar than between species. These results are consistent with interfinger recombination resulting in homogenization of most of the ZF sequence. Homogenization among ZF domains in human and mouse is even more striking at the level of DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008505-g004">Figure 4</xref>). For example, of the 28 codons that make up a single ZF domain plus linker, 19 encode the same amino acid in all 12 human ZF domains. All 19 of these codons are 2-fold or 4-fold degenerate, but only 2 of 228 possible synonymous differences are found among the fingers. Similarly, in the mouse only 1 of 264 possible synonymous differences is found. All 3 of these synonymous differences occur in the first or last zinc finger, consistent with partial recombinational isolation of terminal ZF domain sequences.</p><fig id="pone-0008505-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008505.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Zinc finger sequences are homogenized within genes and divergent between genes.</title><p>Panel A.

What could account for these patterns? All other domains in PRDM9 are conserved among species, suggesting that a conserved biochemical function is tethered to a rapidly evolving DNA-binding specificity. The expected histone modification activities of PRDM9 (histone deacetylation and histone H3(K4) trimethylation) suggest a role in transcriptional regulation. However transcription factors are generally characterized by highly conserved DNA-binding domains, yet these are the regions where PRDM9 is most rapidly evolving.

First, a publication provides extensive information on human coding-sequence alleles and frequencies in a Japanese population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008505-Irie1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, dbSNP130 was queried to obtain all known PRDM9 coding SNPs. Third, novel coding SNPs were ascertained by deep sequencing of 12 human exomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008505-Ng1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> plus an additional 4 exomes sequenced by the same method. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008505.s003">Table S1</xref> summarizes information on all the SNPs, including genome position, nucleotide change, and source. The haplotype configurations of the SNPs are unknown. Haplotter summary statistics in the PRDM9 region show no obvious signs of recent population-specific positive selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008505-Voight1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Ortholog Identification</title><p>We wanted to obtain the PRDM9 ZF coding exon from available mammalian genome assemblies. Divergence in PRDM9 ZF sequences combined with large C2H2 zinc finger gene families throughout mammals made PRDM9 identification based on these sequences impossible (data not shown). For low coverage assemblies, the unique upstream coding exons were likewise useless because they were often not present on the same contig as the ZF exon. However, there is a conserved unique protein sequence upstream of the ZF domains in the ZF-containing exon (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008505-g001">Figure 1</xref>) that appears to be diagnostic for PRDM9 genes in mammals. We used this protein sequence as a tblastn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008505-Altschul1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> query of all available mammalian genome assemblies. The DNA corresponding to the best tblastn matches from each genome were extracted along with 1 KB of DNA downstream of the match. These DNA sequences were translated and tested for encoding multiple ZF domains in-frame and downstream of the diagnostic sequence. Finally, candidate sequences that passed this test were translated and a maximum-likelihood tree was made to confirm probable orthology of the sequences (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008505-g003">Figure 3</xref>). As expected because of incomplete assemblies, a PRDM9 ortholog was not found in all species, especially those with 2-fold coverage. In most cases additional confirmation that the sequence is a bona fide PRDM9 gene was obtained as follows: the marmoset, macaque, baboon, orangutan, and chimpanzee genes are complete or nearly complete in their assemblies and are clearly syntenic to human PRDM9; the rat gene is complete and syntenic with the mouse PRDM9 gene; the cow gene is nearly complete; and the cat, mouse lemur (<italic>Microcebus murinus</italic>), dolphin (<italic>Tursiops truncatus</italic>), and bat (<italic>Pteropus vampyrus</italic>) genes have an upstream exon on the same contig that matches the next upstream human exon from PRDM9. Finally, all the sequences except tenrec show clear homogenization of their ZF domain sequences, a very unusual character among tandem ZF domain genes (data not shown). The tenrec sequence is included based on the protein tree, but it should be regarded as a questionable ortholog assignment because it shows no other shared PRDM9 characters. Higher primates have a partial duplicate of the PRDM9 gene (PRDM7) but it completely lacks the tandem ZF domains of PRDM9 and is thus easily distinguished.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0008505.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Generation of 6 SNPs by recombination.
