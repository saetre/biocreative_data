Many have similar functions to one another. In order to understand their roles in cell physiology, these proteins must be characterised.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We have characterised two novel human gene products, hAps1, encoded by the <italic>NUDT11</italic> gene, and hAps2, encoded by the <italic>NUDT10</italic> gene. These cytoplasmic proteins are members of the DIPP subfamily of Nudix hydrolases, and differ from each other by a single amino acid. Both metabolise diadenosine-polyphosphates and, weakly, diphosphoinositol polyphosphates. An apparent polymorphism of hAps1 has also been identified, which leads to the point mutation S39N. This has also been characterised. The favoured nucleotides were diadenosine 5',5"'-pentaphosphate (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> = 11, 8 and 16 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> respectively for hAps1, hAps1-39N and hAps2) and diadenosine 5',5"'-hexaphosphate (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> = 13, 14 and 11 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> respectively for hAps1, hAps1-39N and hAps2). Both hAps1 and hAps2 had pH optima of 8.5 and an absolute requirement for divalent cations, with manganese (II) being favoured. Magnesium was not able to activate the enzymes. Therefore, these enzymes could be acutely regulated by manganese fluxes within the cell.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Recent gene duplication has generated the two Nudix genes, <italic>NUDT11</italic> and <italic>NUDT10</italic>. We have characterised their gene products as the closely related Nudix hydrolases, hAps1 and hAps2. These two gene products complement the activity of previously described members of the DIPP family, and reinforce the concept that Ap<sub>5</sub>A and Ap<sub>6</sub>A act as intracellular messengers.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In addition to the canonical ribonucleoside and deoxyribonucleoside phosphates and cofactors, cells contain a large number of minor nucleotides. Among these are the diadenosine polyphosphates (Ap<sub>n</sub>A, where n = 2&#x02013;7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). Ap<sub>3</sub>A and Ap<sub>4</sub>A are the most intensively studied of these and are generally present in the soluble fraction of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells at concentrations between 10 nM and 5 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Platelet dense granules, adrenal chromaffin granules and certain synaptic vesicles have been reported to contain high concentrations of Ap<sub>5</sub>A and Ap<sub>6</sub>A in addition to Ap<sub>3</sub>A and Ap<sub>4</sub>A, all of which can be exocytosed following appropriate stimuli and bind to target cell purinoceptors causing a variety of physiological responses in the cardiovascular and central and peripheral nervous systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, although Ap<sub>6</sub>A has been detected in erythrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], there are no substantiated measurements of Ap<sub>5</sub>A and Ap<sub>6</sub>A in the soluble fraction of nucleated cells, and it is likely that they are typically present at concentrations much lower than those of Ap<sub>3</sub>A and Ap<sub>4</sub>A. The estimated 7 &#x003bc;M Ap<sub>5</sub>A reported in cardiac muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] may also be confined to granules.</p><p>Whilst the extracellular diadenosine polyphosphates have partially characterised signalling properties, the possible functions of the soluble, intracellular compounds remain unclear. On the one hand, they may simply be by-products of several enzymic reactions (e.g. those catalysed by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and other ligases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). On the other, they may have one or more of a number of important regulatory roles, including involvements in DNA replication/repair, metabolic stress responses, the determination of cellular fate, and the regulation of enzyme activities and ion channels (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). For example, Ap<sub>5</sub>A is a potent inhibitor of adenylate kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>It is clear that cells have a variety of relatively specific enzymes able to degrade these compounds. These include symmetrically-cleaving Ap<sub>4</sub>A hydrolases (in prokaryotes), members of the histidine triad protein family such as the FHIT tumour suppresser protein and (in lower eukaryotes) the related Ap<sub>4</sub>A phosphorylases, and most widespread of all, members of the Nudix hydrolase family (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] for reviews). Nudix hydrolases cleave predominantly the diphosphate linkage in compounds of general structure: <underline>n</underline>ucleoside <underline>d</underline>iphosphate linked to another moiety, <underline>X</underline>. Some family members have a relatively broad substrate specificity, while others have a much more restricted range. They all possess the Nudix sequence signature motif Gx<sub>5</sub>Ex<sub>5</sub> [UA]xREx<sub>2</sub>EexGU (where U is an aliphatic hydrophobic amino acid), which represents the catalytic site of the enzyme. Animal and plant Ap<sub>4</sub>A hydrolases (EC 3.1.6.17) degrade Ap<sub>4</sub>A, Ap<sub>5</sub>A and Ap<sub>6</sub>A, always producing ATP as one of the products. They are most active towards Ap<sub>4</sub>A; however, the related enzymes from <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and <italic>Rickettsia prowazekii </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] show a marked preference for Ap<sub>5</sub>A.</p><p>More recently, distinct members of the Nudix family that prefer Ap<sub>6</sub>A have been purified and characterised. The three human enzymes termed diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolases 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], 2&#x003b1; and 2&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] (hDIPP-1, -2&#x003b1; and -2&#x003b2;) as well as <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> Aps1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Ddp1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] all favour Ap<sub>6</sub>A over Ap<sub>5</sub>A. Activity with Ap<sub>4</sub>A is lower, and is in fact lacking in the case of Ddp1p. Remarkably these Ap<sub>6</sub>A hydrolases are also able to utilise the structurally unrelated non-nucleotide substrates, diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (PP-InsP<sub>5</sub>) and bis-diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate ([PP]<sub>2</sub>-InsP<sub>4</sub>), hence they are commonly referred to as the DIPP subfamily. These substrates are generally favoured <italic>in vitro</italic>, with <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> ratios being 50&#x02013;500-fold higher for PP-InsP<sub>5</sub> compared to Ap<sub>6</sub>A, except for DIPP-2&#x003b2;, which has a significantly reduced relative activity with PP-InsP<sub>5</sub> compared to the others. The intracellular levels of diphosphoinositol polyphosphates appear to be lower than those of the nucleotide substrates. PP-InsP<sub>5</sub> levels are often between 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and 3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] of the levels of InsP<sub>6</sub>, which has been estimated as being between 15 and 100 &#x003bc;M (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]) and [PP]<sub>2</sub>-InsP<sub>4</sub> levels are an order of magnitude lower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and as such are virtually undetectable in many cell types. PP-InsP<sub>5</sub> turnover is regulated by the tumour promoter thapsigargin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], while [PP]<sub>2</sub>-InsP<sub>4</sub> turnover is regulated by cyclic AMP- and cyclic GMP-dependent processes via an undefined mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, as for the Ap<sub>n</sub>As, no clear functions have yet been found for the diphosphoinositol polyphosphates, although they have been implicated in vesicle trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>We describe here two further members of the human DIPP subfamily with novel properties. These proteins, hAps1 and hAps2, products of the <italic>NUDT11</italic> and <italic>NUDT10</italic> genes respectively, closely resemble the other DIPPs in primary structure, but show a selectivity towards Ap<sub>5</sub>A and Ap<sub>6</sub>A and reduced activity towards PP-InsP<sub>5</sub> and [PP]<sub>2</sub>-InsP<sub>4</sub>. They also display a novel pattern of tissue-specific expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Sequence alignment</title><p>An initial BLAST search of the GenBank expressed sequence tag (EST) database with the hDIPP-1 sequence identified two closely related but previously uncharacterised predicted proteins, which we have called hAps1 and hAps2 (<underline>h</underline>uman <underline>Aps</underline>ixA hydrolases <underline>1</underline> and <underline>2</underline>). Alignment of the cDNA sequences with the human genome indicated that the genomic sequences encoding these proteins, FLJ10628 and LOC139770, lie about 150 kb apart on the X chromosome at Xp11.23 and are transcribed in opposite directions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In accordance with the guidelines for the Nudix protein family, the genes for hAps1 and hAps2 have been designated <italic>NUDT11</italic> and <italic>NUDT10</italic> respectively by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/genefamily/npym.html"/>). These proteins are each 164 amino acids long and are most similar to hDIPP-2&#x003b2;, hAps1 showing 76, 90 and 91% identity at the amino acid level to hDIPP-1, 2&#x003b1; and 2&#x003b2;, respectively. In particular, they both possess the additional Gln residue (Q86 in DIPP-2&#x003b2;) that distinguishes hDIPP-2&#x003b2; from hDIPP-2&#x003b1; and hDIPP-1 and which is responsible for the reduced activity of hDIPP-2&#x003b2; towards diphosphoinositol polyphosphates compared to the other DIPPs. hAps1 and hAps2 are also identical to the hDIPP-2 enzymes throughout the Nudix motif (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These observations led us to anticipate that hAps1 and hAps2 would be potent dinucleoside polyphosphate hydrolases with reduced activity towards diphosphoinositol polyphosphates. The existence of two such similar expressed gene products was surprising. Comparison of the open reading frames (ORFs) of hAps1 and hAps2 revealed 6 differences at the nucleotide level, leading to five silent changes (T8, E28, E69, D88 and stop), and an Arg-Pro substitution at position 89. A comparison of the cDNAs for the two gene products showed further divergence in the 3' untranslated region. It appears that the evolution of these closely related genes occurred recently, as hAps1 and hAps2 show greater similarity with each other than with the Aps-like sequences from mouse (of which two genes, XM_135784 and XM_135786 appear to yield the same protein product) or cow (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Further examination of all available hAps1 ESTs revealed a sequence divergence, leading to a point mutation S39N, in the coding region. This is present in two ESTs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and was detected in 10% (3 from 30) of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products generated from a range of normal human cDNA samples from diverse sources. In all other respects investigated, including the 3' untranslated region, it appeared to be identical to hAps1. This would suggest that this minor variant, hAps1-39N, represents a polymorphism present in the human population. Its properties were also examined in this study.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The <italic>NUDT11</italic>/<italic>NUDT10</italic> region of chromosome Xp11.23.</bold> The two known exons of <italic>NUDT11</italic>, encoding hAps1, and <italic>NUDT10</italic>, encoding hAps2 are shown represented as boxes.

Using primers selective for hAps1, PCR products were readily visible from brain, pancreas and testis and less so from lung, thymus, prostate, ovary, small intestine and heart (the least) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Selective primers for hAps2 produced strong signals from brain and liver, but also from heart, placenta, lung, kidney, pancreas, spleen, prostate, testis and ovary (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). No signal for hAps1 was detected in placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, spleen, colon or peripheral blood leukocytes. Likewise, no signal for hAps2 was found in skeletal muscle, thymus, small intestine, colon or peripheral blood leukocytes. A number of tumour cell line cDNA samples were also tested; hAps1 was present in prostate PC3, and ovary GI-102 cells. The prostate PC3 cell line was also found to express hAps2. Tumour cell lines from breast GI-101, lung LX-1, colon CX-1, lung GI-117, colon GI-112 and pancreas GI-103 were found to express neither hAps1 nor hAps2. These results are in broad agreement with the sources of ESTs for these two protein families (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This list is for comparison and is not exhaustive.

These include hDIPP-1, hDIPP-2&#x003b1; and hDIPP-2&#x003b2;, encoded by the <italic>NUDT3</italic> (hDIPP-1) and <italic>NUDT4</italic> (hDIPP-2&#x003b1; and hDIPP-2&#x003b2;) genes, all of which hydrolyse both the higher order diadenosine polyphosphates and diphosphoinositol polyphosphates. In this report, we describe the cloning and functional characterisation of hAps1 and hAps2, two new members of the DIPP subfamily with a novel pattern of expression and substrate specificity. A polymorphism of hAps1 (hAps1-39N) has also been found, its activity and localisation appearing broadly similar to those of hAps1. Unlike the other subfamily members, hAps1 and hAps2 show little activity towards diphosphoinositol polyphosphates, both gene products favouring diadenosine polyphosphates, Ap<sub>n</sub>A, where n = 5 or 6. In each case, Ap<sub>6</sub>A binds with higher affinity than Ap<sub>5</sub>A, whereas the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> for the latter is greater. Given that no other PP-InsP<sub>5</sub> hydrolase activity was observed during the purification of rat hepatic DIPP (most similar to hDIPP-1) and assuming that tissue expression and physiology are broadly conserved between human and rat, these results would suggest that Aps-like proteins do not contribute significantly to inositol phosphate metabolism.</p><p>Both hAps1 and hAps2 show typical Nudix hydrolase requirements, namely an alkaline pH optimum <italic>in vitro</italic> and a requirement for divalent cations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. An unusual feature of hAps1 and hAps2 is that they both require Mn<sup>2+</sup> for activation, and that Mg<sup>2+</sup> is without effect. Optimal [Mn<sup>2+</sup>] is approximately 4 mM, which is in contrast to that estimated for free intracellular [Mn<sup>2+</sup>] of below 0.5 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Free [Mn<sup>2+</sup>] in our <italic>in vitro</italic> assays was not determined. It is well acknowledged that Mn<sup>2+</sup> binds serum albumin very tightly, but despite this we would anticipate free [Mn<sup>2+</sup>] in the assays to be far in excess of intracellular levels. It is known that the activity of metal ion-requiring enzymes in different cellular compartments can be regulated through the controlled trafficking of these ions and therefore through the controlled access of these enzymes to their required ions. This principle has been most thoroughly studied in the case of Ca<sup>2+</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], although analogous observations have been made with Cu<sup>2+</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and Mn<sup>2+</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Since the [Mn<sup>2+</sup>] throughout the cell is known to be non-uniform, the unusual requirement of the hAps enzymes suggests a possible mechanism of regulation through access to this ion.</p><p>Several biochemically distinct Ap<sub>5/6</sub>A hydrolases have been described previously. <italic>S. pombe</italic> Aps1, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Ddp1p and hDIPP-1 and hDIPP-2 have all been shown to metabolise Ap<sub>5</sub>A and Ap<sub>6</sub>A. The activities of hAps1 and hAps2 towards Ap<sub>5</sub>A and Ap<sub>6</sub>A are comparable to hDIPP-1, but their activities towards the diphosphoinositol polyphosphates PP-InsP<sub>5</sub> and [PP]<sub>2</sub>-InsP<sub>4</sub> are greatly reduced, thus making them some 100&#x02013;300-fold more selective towards Ap<sub>5</sub>A and Ap<sub>6</sub>A than hDIPP-1 or hDIPP-2. <italic>S. pombe</italic> Aps1 and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Ddp1p, the sole representatives of the DIPP subfamily in the two yeast genomes, appear to favour the diphosphoinositol polyphosphates. Their modes of action have been shown to differ from their mammalian counterparts. The major products of Ap<sub>6</sub>A hydrolysis by <italic>S. pombe</italic> Aps1 and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Ddp1p are ADP and p<sub>4</sub>A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. As with hDIPP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and hDIPP-2 (Safrany, data not shown), hAps1 and hAps2 produced AMP and p<sub>5</sub>A as major products. With Ap<sub>5</sub>A as substrate, <italic>S. pombe</italic> Aps1 favoured the production of ADP plus ATP, whereas <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Ddp1p favoured production of AMP and p<sub>4</sub>A. In this respect hAps1 and hAps2 as well as hDIPP-1 and hDIPP-2 resemble Ddp1p.</p><p>Due to the chromosomal proximity of Aps1 and Aps2, and the greater degree of sequence identity with each other than with the Aps-like genes from mouse, rat or cow, it seems likely that this gene pair has arisen as the result of a recent gene duplication event on the short arm of the X chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. A popular view of the evolution of catalytic motifs envisages the duplication of relatively non-specific progenitors followed by adaptation to perform special tasks, and the Nudix hydrolase motif appears to be a good illustration of this process. The existence of multiple forms of these enzymes would suggest that the diadenosine polyphosphates have significant biological functions, with the specialised task of hAps1 and/or hAps2 being the regulation of Ap<sub>5</sub>A and Ap<sub>6</sub>A levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Previously, the human DIPP family comprised hDIPP-1, a ubiquitous enzyme able to hydrolyse both inositol phosphates and diadenosine polyphosphates, and hDIPP-2&#x003b1; and -2&#x003b2;, which are predominantly diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolases highly expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney and pancreas. We have now identified two further members, hAps1 and hAps2, which have high selectivity towards the diadenosine polyphosphates. The distinction between DIPP and Ap<sub>n</sub>A hydrolase activities reinforces the importance of Q86 in DIPP-2&#x003b2; and the role of Q85 in hAps1 and hAps2. The addition of this amino acid in hDIPP-2 has been previously shown to have a substantial negative effect upon its activity towards diphosphoinositol polyphosphates, whereas Ap<sub>5</sub>A hydrolase activity was increased. The expression of hAps1 and hAps2 is also restricted. Of the tissues tested, only pancreas showed high levels of hDIPP-2 and hAps1, and only heart showed high levels of hDIPP-2 and hAps2, although ESTs were found suggesting that hDIPP-2 is expressed in testis, ovary and prostate. The presence of hAps1 and hAps2 in such a variety of tissues suggests that Ap<sub>5</sub>A and Ap<sub>6</sub>A may have roles other than as secreted molecules. We find that hAps1 is present in the pancreas, but there is no suggestion that it is secreted. For this reason, hAps1 and hAps2 are expected to control intracellular Ap<sub>5</sub>A and Ap<sub>6</sub>A levels.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified two human Nudix hydrolases that share a novel substrate specificity, metabolising predominantly Ap<sub>5</sub>A and Ap<sub>6</sub>A. These two gene products complement the activity of previously described members of the DIPP family, and reinforce the concept of Ap<sub>5</sub>A and Ap<sub>6</sub>A acting as intracellular messengers.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>NRL performed the cloning and subcloning, determined subcellular localisation in mammalian cells, participated in sequence analysis and obtained the genomic alignment.
