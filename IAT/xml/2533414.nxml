Platelet-activating factor-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), the enzyme that inactivates PAF bioactivity, possesses both acetylhydrolase and transacetylase activities. In the present study, we measured acetylhydrolase and transacetylase activities in human atherogenic aorta and nonatherogenic mammary arteries. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed PAF-AH expression in the intima and the media of the aorta and in the media of mammary arteries. Acetylhydrolase and transacetylase activities were (mean &#x000b1; SE, n = 38): acetylhydrolase of aorta, 2.8 &#x000b1; 0.5 pmol/min/mg of tissue&#x0003b; transacetylase of aorta, 3.3 &#x000b1; 0.7 pmol/min/mg of tissue&#x0003b; acetylhydrolase of mammary artery, 1.4 &#x000b1; 0.3 pmol/min/mg of tissue (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.004 as compared with acetylhydrolase of aorta)&#x0003b; transacetylase of mammary artery, 0.8 &#x000b1; 0.2 pmol/min/mg of tissue (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.03 as compared with acetylhydrolase of mammary artery). Lyso-PAF accumulation and an increase in PAF bioactivity were observed in the aorta of some patients. Reverse-phase HPLC and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis revealed that 1-<italic>O</italic>-hexadecyl-2 acetyl-<italic>sn</italic> glycero-3-phosphocholine accounted for 60% of the PAF bioactivity and 1-<italic>O</italic>-hexadecyl-2-butanoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycerol-3-phosphocholine for 40% of the PAF bioactivity. The nonatherogenic properties of mammary arteries may in part be due to low PAF formation regulated by PAF-AH activity. In atherogenic aortas, an imbalance between PAF-AH and transacetylase activity, as well as lyso-PAF accumulation, may lead to unregulated PAF formation and to progression of atherosclerosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>atherosclerosis</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>smooth muscle cells</kwd><kwd>lipoproteins</kwd><kwd>atherogenesis</kwd><kwd>oxidized LDL</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Published, JLR Papers in Press, June 27, 2008.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>The platelet-activating factor (PAF) (1-<italic>O</italic>-alkyl-2-acetyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine) belongs to a family of potent phospholipid (PL) mediators for numerous inflammatory and thrombotic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). PAF exhibits a wide spectrum of actions on major pro-inflammatory cells, including monocytes/macrophages, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) (as reviewed in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). PAF bioactivity is mediated by the PAF receptor (PAF-R) in a wide range of cellular types&#x0003b; it is a seven-transmembrane receptor coupled to G-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). For expression of PAF bioactivity, the structural requirements of the molecules are: an ether linkage at the <italic>sn</italic>-1 position, a short acyl chain (shorter than five carbons) at the <italic>sn</italic>-2 position, and a choline head group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), and several studies suggest that PAF may play a role in atherogenesis and atherosclerosis (as reviewed in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>).</p><p>PAF is synthesized by the majority of pro-inflammatory cells upon stimulation via enzymatic pathways that are tightly regulated and are related to eicosanoid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). PAF is degraded by specific intracellular PAF acetylhydrolases or those circulating in plasma (as reviewed in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, uncontrolled free radical-catalyzed oxidation of PUFAs attached to the <italic>sn</italic>-2 position of PLs can produce several break-down products that structurally resemble PAF. Oxidized species of phosphatidylcholine have been shown to act in vitro as potent activators of both vascular and blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). The bioactivity of some of these may be due to their structural analogy with PAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).</p><p>Plasma PAF- acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) is a secretory Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent phospholipase A2 (PLA2) belonging to the group VIIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) that inactivates PAF and its analogs (oxidized phosphatidylcholine containing either up to five carbons in native form or up to nine carbons in oxidized form) by hydrolyzing their <italic>sn</italic>-2 acyl chains and thus converting them to lyso-PAF and lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). PAF-AH in plasma is associated mainly with LDL and HDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p><p>Diffusion of LDLs into the vessel wall and their oxidative modification, together with monocyte transmigration along with their maturation into macrophages and foam cell formation, are key events in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). PAF bioactivity is formed upon Cu<sup>2+</sup>-induced oxidation of LDL, in which PAF-AH has been chemically inactivated by serine esterase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). In physiological conditions, PAF is formed in lipoproteins lacking PAF-AH activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), and it is also detected in oxidized LDL subfractions possessing low levels of PAF-AH activity, i.e., LDL particles of intermediate size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). PAF is involved in the monocyte adhesion to endothelium activated by LDL and oxidized LDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), and for this reason, LDL-associated PAF-AH may possess anti-inflammatory properties, protecting lipoprotein particles against formation of PAF and oxidized PLs. The anti-inflammatory activities of PAF-AH in numerous animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>) strongly suggest an anti-atherogenic role for this enzyme in vascular physiology. Indeed, the overexpression of PAF-AH shows marked anti-atherogenic properties in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). However, epidemiological data in the Caucasian population have shown that its level might be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (as reviewed in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Thus, the question about the pro- or anti-atherogenic role of PAF-AH remains to be explored. Of interest, in a recent study by Vadas et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), the proportion of patients with low PAF-AH values increased with the severity of anaphylaxis, and its level was lower in patients with fatal peanut anaphylaxis, underlying the importance of PAF-AH in human physiopathology.</p><p>Two studies have shown that PAF-AH is responsible for both acetylhydrolase and transacetylase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Transacetylase transfers short-chain fatty acids from PAF and its close ether- and ester-linked analogs to ether/ester-linked lyso-PLs. Such transacetylase activity may exceed the acetylhydrolase activity in the presence of exogenously added lyso-PLs) or in the presence of oxidative conditions. Due to the LDL-associated PAF-AH, a PAF-like bioactivity can be formed transiently during the first hour of LDL oxidation. PAF bioactivity occurs in the presence of exogenous lyso-PAF, without chemical inactivation of PAF-AH, especially in the pro-atherogenic small, dense LDL subfraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Enzymatic transfer of acetate from the inactive ester analogs to lyso-PAF may also be responsible for extracellular PAF bioactivity formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). This happens in addition to the extracellular PAF bioactivity formation by chemical peroxidation of PLs with PUFAs esterified at the <italic>sn</italic>-2 position of the molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>).</p><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the PAF system in the progression of atherosclerosis.

For this purpose, full-thickness resections of aortas and internal mammary arteries were obtained from patients undergoing bypass surgery. Specimens were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis, and only those composed of well-defined intima, media, and adventitia layers were characterized as intact vessels. All internal mammary specimens studied showed a healthy intima without inflammatory infiltrate, with only a few scattered monocytes located close to the lumen and adjacent to endothelial cells (data not shown). In contrast, an intimal hyperplasia was observed in 20 out of 28 aortic specimens, and initial lesions with intimal fibrosis in 8 out of 28 patients&#x0003b; thus, all specimens were classified as initial atherosclerotic lesions.

Monocytes located in the lumen and adjacent to endothelial cells, as well as macrophages, were strongly stained with the monoclonal antibodies directed against PAF-R (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).

These factors are: <italic>a</italic>) formation of PAF, <italic>b</italic>) accumulation of lyso-PAF, <italic>c</italic>) PAF-AH and PAF-R expression, and <italic>d</italic>) PAF acetylhydrolase and transacetylase activities. The paired design of this study, in which aortas with atherosclerotic lesions and internal mammary arteries free of lesions from the same patients were used, provided appropriate specimens for investigating the contribution of PAF acetylhydrolase and transacetylase activities in the progression of atherosclerosis.</p><p>The immunohistochemical analysis confirmed PAF-AH expression in the arteries, as has already been shown in human aortic intima obtained from autopsies with several types of atherosclerotic lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). In the present study, we also detected the expression of PAF-AH in the media of aortas and, importantly, in the media of the mammary arteries. Although the observed PAF-AH expression was higher in the aortic lesions than in the mammary arteries, the above finding challenges the strictly pro-atherogenic role of this enzyme in the arterial wall.</p><p>The biological actions of PAF are mediated by a specific cell-surface seven-transmembrane domain receptor, PAF-R, which couples to G-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Thus, we investigated the expression of PAF-R in all arterial specimens. The expression of PAF-R was observed in both the diseased aortic intima and the media. The above results are in accordance with our earlier study on human carotid plaque tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>), where we showed that the dedifferentiated SMCs were positive for PAF-R. The expression of PAF-R may be important for the migration of SMCs from the arterial media into the intima. Such migration in the context of PAF has been suggested in the development of human atherosclerotic lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). The functionality of PAF-R in the media of mammary arteries is less clear.</p><p>In agreement with the immunohistochemical analysis, PAF acetylhydrolase activity was detected in aortas and mammary arteries. In rabbit, PAF acetylhydrolase activity was measured in atherosclerotic arteries and was found to be higher than in healthy control arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). In the present study with human aortas, PAFacetylhydrolase activity was equally higher than the activity in the internal mammary arteries. Two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>) have shown that PAF-AH is responsible not only for acetylhydrolase activity but also for transacetylase activity. The latter is able to transfer short-chain fatty acids from PAF and its close ether- and ester-linked analogs to ether/ester-linked lyso-PLs. The transacetylase activity was described in LDL particles and may be considered as an enzymatic route for extracellular PAF formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Interestingly, in the present study, we detected transacetylase activity in the arteries. In diseased aortas, the transacetylase activity was slightly higher than the acetylhydrolase activity&#x0003b; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance. In contrast, in internal mammary arteries, the transacetylase activity was significantly lower than the acetylhydrolase activity. The above results suggest that transacetylase activity may play a pro-atherogenic role in the arteries.</p><p>In the arterial wall, the enzyme PAF-AH is the main source of these activities, as suggested by: <italic>a</italic>) the enzymatic assay with EDTA and without Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the incubation mixture, <italic>b</italic>) PL as the donor of acetate, and <italic>c</italic>) the inhibition of both acetylhydrolase and transacetylase activities by low doses of Pefablok. The results of the present study also demonstrate that PAF bioactivity is detectable in the lipid extracts of the arteries. PAF was detected in two other earlier studies using human arteries: the first, in the endarterectomy samples taken from coronary arteries with severe atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>)&#x0003b; and the second, in the endarterectomy specimens of carotid plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). In most patients in our study, the amount of PAF detected in aortas was comparable to that detected in the mammary arteries. The higher level of PAF reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> for the aortas was the result of high PAF bioactivity, detected in the aortas of six patients. The PAF levels in the diseased samples in the study of Mueller et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>) also showed a high variability, and no statistically significant difference was seen between PAF levels in arteries with severe atherosclerosis and the control healthy arteries. Thus, the results of the present study, together with those of Mueller et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), suggest that PAF bioactivity accumulates in the lesions of some patients.</p><p>The molecular characterization of PAF by MS in aorta showed that C16:0 PAF was the main component&#x0003b; this molecular species of PAF is the most bioactive member of PAF family. Additionally, an <italic>sn</italic>-2 C4 analog of PAF, C16:0 butanoyl-PAF, was also present in the diseased aorta. In oxidized LDL, the C16:0 PAF and its <italic>sn</italic>-2 C4 analogs (butanoyl- and butenoyl-PAF) are the main components of PAF bioactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). The <italic>sn</italic>-2 C4 analogs of PAF are the products of free radical peroxidation of arachidonoyl-PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). In C16:0 PAF, its formation is due, in addition to peroxidation, to the enzymatic activity of the PAF transacetylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>).</p><p>Oxidatively modified phosphatidylcholine, upon hydrolysis by PAF-AH, generates lyso-PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). The arterial wall also contains other types of secreted PLA2 that may play a role in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). Group II secretory PLA2 is highly expressed in SMCs, in both normal and atherosclerotic arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>), as well as the PLA2GX that is also present in macrophages and foam cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>)&#x0003b; thus, these activities may account for the accumulation of C16:0 lyso-PAF in the arteries observed in the present study. Lyso-PAF is a precursor and a degradation product of intracellular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>) and extracellular PAF metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). At least some of the proinflammatory effects of oxidized LDL are mediated by lyso-PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). The oxidative stress exerted, together with the recruitment and activation of pro-inflammatory cells in the media of atherosclerotic arteries, may explain the higher accumulation of lyso-PAF in the aortas. The positive correlation between transacetylase activity and lyso-PAF accumulation in the arteries may be explained by the presence of high amounts of lyso-PAF and the conditions in which transacetylase activity is favored and acetylhydrolase activity is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). The noncorrelation between PAF formation and transacetylase activity, as well as that between lyso-PAF accumulation and acetylhydrolase activity, respectively, strongly suggests that other enzymes of the tissue, including PLA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>) and intracellular lyso-PAF acetyl-CoA acetyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>), are also responsible for the formation of PAF and lyso-PAF.</p><p>Diffusion of LDL particles and their oxidative modification play an important role in vascular physiopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). Oxidized LDL is present in atherosclerotic lesions in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>) and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). Moreover, oxidative modification of LDL, monocyte migration into the vessel wall, subsequent macrophage activation, and foam cell formation are key events in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). Several characteristics of the PAF system described in the present study regarding human arteries express similarities with the characteristics of the PAF system in LDL. LDL is the main transporter of PAF-AH in human plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>) The LDL-associated PAF-AH possesses both acetylhydrolase and transacetylase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), and upon LDL oxidation, PAF bioactivity and lyso-PAF accumulation are observed in LDL particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). C16:0 PAF and its <italic>sn</italic>-2 C4 analogs are the molecules responsible for PAF bioactivity in oxidized LDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Moreover, monocyte migration into the vessel wall, subsequent macrophage activation, and foam cell formation are also key events in the pathophysiology of the arterial wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). Macrophages secrete PAF-AH activity in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>), and PAF-AH is expressed by macrophages in human arterial lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). Thus, LDL deposition and oxidation, monocyte recruitment and diffusion, macrophage activation, as well as SMCs of contractile phenotype are the factors assigning to the PAF system its main characteristics in the arterial wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>).</p><p>As mentioned earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), the question of the pro- or anti-atherogenic role of PAF-AH is still open. The in vivo results of the present study could suggest a dual role for PAF-AH. The nonatherogenic properties of mammary arteries may in part be due to low PAF formation regulated by PAF-acetylhydrolase activity. Regulated PAF formation may play an anti-atherogenic role via macrophage activation. This activation can then remove LDL oxidation and degradation products. In the diseased arterial intima of aortas, under oxidative stress and lyso-PAF accumulation, an imbalance between acetylhydrolase and transacetylase activity may contribute to unregulated PAF formation and to the progression of atherosclerosis.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry</p></list-item><list-item><p>FIA, flow injection analysis</p></list-item><list-item><p>PAF, platelet-activating factor</p></list-item><list-item><p>PAF-AH, PAF-acetylhydrolase</p></list-item><list-item><p>PAF-R, PAF receptor</p></list-item><list-item><p>PC, phosphatidylcholine</p></list-item><list-item><p>PL, phospholipid</p></list-item><list-item><p>PLA2, phospholipase A2</p></list-item><list-item><p>SMC, smooth muscle cell</p></list-item></list></glossary><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><name><surname>Prescott</surname><given-names>S.
