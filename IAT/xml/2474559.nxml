It is unclear to what extent the KChIPs have distinct functions although they all interact with Kv4 K<sup>+</sup> channels. KChIP3 has also been shown to repress transcription of specific genes via binding to DRE (downstream regulatory element) motifs and all KChIPs may share this function. In the present study, we have compared the function of isoforms of the four KChIPs. KChIPs 1&#x02013;4 were found to stimulate the traffic of Kv4.2 channels to the plasma membrane. KChIP3 expression in PC12 cells resulted in an increase in exocytosis evoked by activation of purinergic receptors. In contrast, KChIPs 1, 2 and 4, although expressed to the same extent, had no effect on secretion. In addition, KChIP3 but not KChIPs 1, 2 and 4 modified the ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal resulting in a delay in recovery after the peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation and also specifically resulted in down-regulation of the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger NCX3, which could explain the effects on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal and secretion. Regulation of NCX3 by KChIP3 has been shown to occur via its DREAM (DRE antagonist modulator) function [Gomez-Villafuertes, Torres, Barrio, Savignac, Gabellini, Rizzato, Pintado, Gutierrez-Adan, Mellstrom, Carafoli and Naranjo (2005) J. Neurosci. <bold>25</bold>, 10822&#x02013;10830] suggesting that this activity might depend on the cellular context of expression of the various KChIPs. These results reveal a new role for KChIP3 in the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated secretion and also suggest that the functions of each of the KChIPs may be more specialized than previously appreciated.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>EF-hand</kwd><kwd>exocytosis</kwd><kwd>Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger</kwd><kwd>neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) protein</kwd><kwd>neurotransmitter release</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>AM, acetoxymethyl ester</kwd><kwd>DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium</kwd><kwd>DREAM, downstream-regulatory-element-antagonist modulator</kwd><kwd>ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>ER, endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>FCS, foetal calf serum</kwd><kwd>GCAP, GC-activating protein</kwd><kwd>GH, growth hormone</kwd><kwd>KChIP, K<sup>+</sup> channel-interacting protein</kwd><kwd>NCS, neuronal calcium sensor</kwd><kwd>NCX, Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger</kwd><kwd>PBT, PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.3% BSA</kwd><kwd>rhod, Rhodamine</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><ref-count count="45"/><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The transduction of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals into physiological responses is mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor proteins that interact with specific target proteins to modify their function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Many of these Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> via EF-hand domains. One such family of proteins are the NCS (neuronal calcium sensor) proteins consisting of NCS-1, neurocalcin &#x003b4;, hippocalcin, VILIPs (visin-like proteins) 1&#x02013;3, recoverin, GCAPs (GC-activating proteins) 1&#x02013;3 and the KChIPs (K<sup>+</sup> channel-interacting proteins) 1&#x02013;4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Certain NCS proteins are expressed only in the retina (recoverin and GCAPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], whereas others are expressed predominantly in the brain or, in the case of NCS-1, in a wide range of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. Mammals have at least 26 different NCS proteins generated by the expression of 14 genes and by differential splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The distinct cellular expression patterns of the NCS proteins, their distinct cellular and molecular properties and in particular their specific target proteins, allows them to regulate a diverse range of neuronal functions in a non-redundant manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The latter point is supported by the presence of clear phenotypes in organisms with genetic disruption of the expression of only a single NCS protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, it is still unclear why so many different NCS proteins are required.</p><p>In mammals, KChIP proteins are encoded by four genes (KChIPs 1&#x02013;4) each of which can give rise to multiple splice variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The KChIPs were so named based on their discovery as proteins that can interact with the pore-forming subunits of K<sup>+</sup> channels of the Kv4 family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The physiological significance of KChIPs 2 and 3 in the heart and the brain has been established from the study of mouse knockouts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. All KChIP proteins examined so far are able to become constitutive subunits of Kv4 channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], stimulate Kv4 channel traffic to the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and modify the gating properties of the channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Different KChIPs or their isoforms have, however, subtly different effects on Kv4 channel gating properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. KChIP3 was independently discovered in two other contexts. First, as calsenilin, a protein able to interact with the presenilins and affect the processing of amyloid precursor protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Secondly, as DREAM (downstream-regulatory-element-antagonist modulator), based on its ability to act as a repressor of transcription when it is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free but not Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In addition to the common interaction with Kv4 channels, isoforms of all four KChIPs have been shown to have DREAM activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and at least KChIP4, in addition to KChIP3, can also interact with presenilins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The KChIPs may not all have overlapping functions, as knockout of KChIPs 2 and 3 leads to non-compensated phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, the non-redundancy may be due to differential expression of KChIPs in different cell types. The requirement for multiple KChIPs may relate to specific neuronal expression patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] allowing differences in fine tuning of Kv4 channel function, for example, in different neuronal cell types. Nevertheless, it is still unclear to what extent the KChIPs have fully overlapping or distinct functional roles. In the present study we have set out to compare the functions of representative isoforms of each of the four KChIPs and this has revealed a specific effect of KChIP3/calsenilin/DREAM in modifying agonist-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and in enhancing secretion from PC12 cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>Plasmid encoding presenilin-1&#x02013;EGFP (where EGFP is enhanced green fluorescent protein) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] was a gift from Dr Christian Haass (Adolf-Butenandt-Institute, Department of Biochemistry, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany).

Since the terminology used for KChIP isoforms in the literature is inconsistent we have defined these by their accession number in the Materials and methods section but will refer to them henceforth as KChIPs 1&#x02013;4 for simplicity. In order to validate the functionality of the constructs and to confirm that the fluorescently tagged KChIPs behaved as expected for the wild-type proteins, we assessed their expression in cell lines and their ability to stimulate the traffic of Kv4.2 to the plasma membrane based on imaging of expressed Kv4.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In initial studies using HeLa cells, we successfully found cells expressing KChIPs 1, 2 or 4 but found poor survival of cells expressing KChIP3&#x02013;ECFP, consistent with the reported apoptotic effect of KChIP3 expression in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In contrast, all four KChIPs were expressed to the same extent in COS-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) and did not appear to affect cell survival.

This system was used to demonstrate a stimulatory effect on regulated secretion due to NCS-1 overexpression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The PC12 cells were co-transfected to express GH and each of the KChIPs as FLAG-tagged constructs. GH secretion was assayed under basal conditions and in response to activation of purinergic receptors following addition of 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M ATP that primarily activates P2X receptors to stimulate secretion in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. None of the KChIPs significantly affected basal release of GH but expression of FLAG&#x02013;KChIP3 specifically increased the amount of GH release due to ATP stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). The FLAG tag was at the N-terminus of the proteins where it would prevent myristoylation of KChIP1 which is important for its membrane targeting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].

In a comparison of KChIPs 1 and 3 it was observed that again KChIP3 expression increased ATP-stimulated GH release but KChIP1 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). These results also show that the effect of KChIP3 was not affected by the presence of the FLAG tag.

Nevertheless, although the multiple KChIP isoforms have a common EF-hand-containing domain they have distinct N-termini suggesting the possibility of distinct interactions and functions. In the present study we have demonstrated a distinct effect of expression of KChIP3, compared with isoforms of KChIPs 1, 2 and 4, on Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to stimulation in PC12 cells that may be due to a specific effect on the expression of the NCX3 plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger and we have also shown that this leads to specific physiological consequences in which KChIP3 but not KChIPs 1, 2 and 4 can enhance stimulus-evoked secretion.</p><p>Previous work has shown effects of KChIP3 on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling. In one case this was attributed to an increased filling of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchangers play crucial roles in the recovery of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> following transient elevations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Expression of an EF-hand mutant of KChIP3 (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent and thereby locked in an activating state) also resulted in a slowing of the recovery from a Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in cerebellar granule cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This was attributed to a reduction in the levels of expression of the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger NCX3 due to a direct repression of its transcription without effects on other exchangers NCX1 and NCX2. The latter study also found that overexpression of wild-type KChIP3 in SH-SY5Y cells resulted in down-regulation of NCX3. Consistent with these findings we found that expression of KChIP3 resulted in a down-regulation in the levels of NCX3 but not NCX2 in transfected PC12 cells. This finding provides an explanation for our observations on the effects of KChIP3 expression on the recovery of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> following a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient.</p><p>A stimulatory effect of KChIP3 was in response to agonist stimulation but was not seen in permeabilized cells in response to buffered Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration suggesting that the effect was probably related to changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling. The changes in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in response to ATP in KChIP3-expressing cells provides an explanation for the increased secretion following stimulation. We can rule out effects of KChIP3 via Kv4 channels and also presenilin interactions. Traffic of Kv4 channels is stimulated by all four KChIPs but we saw no evidence that expression of Kv4.2 could influence exocytosis or the enhancement due to KChIP3 (results not shown). The interaction with presenilin has been described not only for KChIP3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] but also for KChIP4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and their interactions have been suggested to modify aspects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. However, our functional experiments did not implicate a presenilin interaction in the KChIP3 effect on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response or secretion in PC12 cells. Expression of KChIP3 has been reported to trigger apoptosis in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], but other KChIPs do not have this effect. Interestingly, in our initial experiments we found that that HeLa cells transfected with KChIP3 but not KChIPs 1, 2 and 4 failed to survive, consistent with distinct physiological effects of these proteins. In other cell types such as PC12 and COS-7 cells, KChIP3 does not appear to be apoptotic. There may be a link between KChIP3-specific effects on intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> as the pro-apoptotic effect of KChIP3 has been attributed to increased filling of EF Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>The down-regulation of NCX3, but not NCX1 or NCX2, following expression of wild-type or mutant KChIP3 in other cell types was ascribed to the DREAM transcriptional regulator function of the protein and indeed the NCX3 gene was found to harbour DRE motifs in its promoter region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It is surprising therefore that we observed down-regulation of NCX3 only as a consequence of KChIP3 expression and saw no effect of KChIPs 1,2 and 4 as the DREAM activity has been suggested to be shared by isoforms of all four KChIPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Indeed, it has been shown that the EF-hand-containing core of KChIP3 is sufficient for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding to the DRE motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In addition, all four KChIPs were found to bind to DRE sites and to be equally efficient in repressing the transcription from three separate promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In contrast, the results of the present study suggest that the KChIPs may differentially express this function depending on the cellular context. Although this cannot be explained on the basis of expression levels it may be a consequence of the differential intracellular localizations of each of the proteins determined by elements in their variable N-terminal domains including motifs for myristoylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and palmitoylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Further work will be required to determine the extent to which the DREAM activity <italic>in vivo</italic> is determined by KChIP3 alone. Overall our findings suggest that the KChIP proteins may have a higher level of functional specialization than had been appreciated and in particular that differences in KChIP3 levels may specifically exert modulatory effects on regulated secretion and possibly neurotransmission.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by a Wellcome Trust Project Grant to R.
