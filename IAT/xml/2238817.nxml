We report here that levels of Fabp7 mRNA in adult murine brain change over a 24 hour period. Unlike Fabp5, a fatty acid binding protein that is expressed widely in various cell types within brain, RNA analysis revealed that Fabp7 mRNA levels were elevated during the light period and lower during dark in brain regions involved in sleep and activity mechanisms. This pattern of Fabp7 mRNA expression was confirmed using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and found to occur throughout the entire brain. Changes in the intracellular distribution of Fabp7 mRNA were also evident over a 24 hour period. Diurnal changes in Fabp7, however, were not found in postnatal day 6 brain, when astrocytes are not yet mature. In contrast, granule cell precursors of the subgranular zone of adult hippocampus did undergo diurnal changes in Fabp7 expression. These changes paralleled oscillations in Fabp7 mRNA throughout the brain suggesting that cell-coordinated signals likely control brain-wide Fabp7 mRNA expression. Immunoblots revealed that Fabp7 protein levels also underwent diurnal changes in abundance, with peak levels occurring in the dark period. Of clock or clock-regulated genes, the synchronized, global cycling pattern of Fabp7 expression is unique and implicates glial cells in the response or modulation of activity and/or circadian rhythms.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Brain fatty acid binding protein (also known as brain lipid binding protein or Fabp7) is a member of a large family of fatty acid binding proteins (Fabps) of relatively small molecular weight (&#x0223c;15 kD) that are expressed in a diverse set of vertebrate and invertebrate tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Bernlohr1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

In amygdala, Fabp7 mRNA cycled identically to other brain regions with highest mRNA levels present in the light period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001631-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). This distinctive pattern of expression was evident in both basolateral (BLA) and medial (MA) nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001631-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) where significant changes in mRNA levels oscillated throughout the diurnal cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001631-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). More detailed analysis using emulsion autoradiography confirmed elevated levels of Fabp7 mRNA during lights-on (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001631-g004">Fig. 4C1 and C2</xref>). Higher magnification analysis of BLA revealed that silver grain distribution corresponding to Fabp7 mRNA was more disperse at ZT6 compared to ZT18 (compare 4C3 and C4).

Synchronized cycling of Fabp7 mRNA occurred throughout the brain with peak levels present at the beginning of the light period and lowest levels near lights-off. Fabp7 protein was also found to change over a 24 hour period such that an accumulation in protein occurred towards the middle of the dark period when Fabp7 mRNA levels were declining. Interestingly, we observed no changes in Fabp7 mRNA in young postnatal brain but found Fabp7 to cycle in precursor cells of the adult hippocampus. These data suggest that Fabp7 is a novel cycling gene and that its regulation is driven by mechanisms that confer brain-wide, coordinated oscillations in expression.</p><p>Given that Fabp7 expression is downstream of Notch signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Anthony2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, Notch-mediated regulation of Fabp7 is a putative mechanism for the oscillation in Fabp7 mRNA that we observe. In fact, a binding site for the Notch effector CBF1 is essential for the transcriptional regulation of Fabp7 in radial glial cells and CBF1 elements within 400 base pairs of the Fabp7 transcription start site are necessary and sufficient for transgene activity in embryonic and postnatal day (P) 6 brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Anthony2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Further, Notch signaling is thought to synchronize the segmentation clock for somitogenesis where it operates in somite precursor cells of the mesoderm that oscillate through phases of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Giudicelli1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. It is not known whether Notch signaling has a similar role later in development. Also, we did not observe changes in Fabp7 mRNA expression across the light-dark cycle in early postnatal brain (P6) when Notch signaling is known to influence Fabp7 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Anthony2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Since astrocyte migration and maturation is not complete at this time in development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Marshall1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> and because Fabp7 levels are greatly elevated at this age compared to adult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Bennett1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, it may be that an inability to observe time-of-day changes in Fabp7 mRNA levels is a result of a ceiling affect. Conversely, it may be that the diurnal cycling of Fabp7 mRNA is restricted to mature brain. In addition, other transcriptional regulators, such as Pax6 and POU/Pbx have also been found to influence the developmental profile of Fabp7 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Arai1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Josephson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting alternative regulatory mechanisms for Fabp7 transcription.</p><p>Whether Fapb7 expression is tied to known clock mechanisms or is a component of a novel clock pathway is not known. Bioinformatic analyses of the Fabp7 gene suggest an influence of known clock mechanisms given the presence within the proximal Fabp7 promoter of <italic>cis-</italic>elements such as peroxisome proliferater activated receptor (PPRE) and E-box elements. These <italic>cis</italic>-elements play important roles in known clock-related transcriptional regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Kohsaka1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since CLOCK is known to control the transcription of PPARs, and PPREs are present within the Fabp7 promoter, it may be that the diurnal oscillation in Fabp7 observed in this study is driven by a CLOCK, PPAR-mediated pathway. Further, since other fatty acid binding proteins have been shown to translocate to the nucleus and directly influence PPAR-mediated transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Wolfrum1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Adida1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, and we observe peak Fabp7 protein levels that proceed Fabp7 transcript levels, it is intriguing to speculate that Fabp7 protein influences its own transcription via PPAR. The importance of E-box elements in the diurnal regulation of Fabp7, however, is uncertain since per2, but not Fabp7, has been found to cycle in astrocyte culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Prolo1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>; Gerstner and Landry, unpublished observations). Further, unlike Fabp7, circadian genes like CLOCK, per1, per2 and d-albumin binding protein cycle in different temporal phases in different brain regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Yan1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Shieh1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. It is likely that the regulation of Fabp7 expression results from a combination of PPAR and E-box elements as well as other transcriptional mechanisms. Further study will be required to determine the elements that influence Fabp7 expression in mature brain.</p><p>Peak Fabp7 mRNA levels preceded peak protein levels by about 12 hours and a gradual decline in mRNA occurred as protein levels increased. These changes are similar to known circadian and diurnally regulated genes, although the delay that we see here is somewhat longer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-So1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Suri1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. It may be that mechanisms that influence Fabp7 mRNA levels during lights-on are in place to increase the amount of Fabp7 protein during the active (dark) period, perhaps in response to enhanced fatty acid demand at this time. Since high levels in Fabp7 protein in brain during the dark parallel diurnal changes in fatty acid binding proteins in liver and heart, which are also elevated during the active period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Glatz1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, a mechanism for modulating the delivery or utilization of fatty acids during activity may be a common theme in a number of organ systems. Further, the diurnal rhythmicity of fatty acid binding protein expression in heart and liver are influenced by levels of serum cholesterol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Glatz1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref> implicating fatty acid utilization as a modulating factor in fatty acid binding protein expression.</p><p>Diurnal cycling in processes that use fatty acids as functional components may be a common feature of homeostatic mechanisms. For example, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) activity has been shown to cycle throughout the day <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Valenti1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, and to modulate sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-HuitronResendiz1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-MurilloRodriguez1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, the fatty-acid metabolites anandamide and 2-arachidonylgycerol have been shown to vary globally across the light-dark cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Valenti1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref> and endocannabinoids such as these have been found to participate in the regulation of complex behaviors such as feeding, sleep/wake cycles, and response to stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Bisogno1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Chen1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. How fatty acids required for these processes are delivered and distributed within cells of the nervous system is not well understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Qi1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref> and the cycling of Fabp7 is the first report of an oscillating protein involved in the movement of fatty acids. Diurnal changes in the transport and delivery of fatty acids may therefore be a critical component of lipid-dependant, homeostatic mechanisms.</p><p>The brain-wide diurnal regulation of Fabp7 mRNA suggests that either a cell-autonomous mechanism governs its regulation, or that diurnal levels are controlled by a global coordinated signaling system. The diurnal regulation of Fabp7 within granule cell precursors of the hippocampus suggests cell-autonomous mechanisms since these cells are not astrocytes and are only transiently Fabp7 positive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Steiner1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. However, since granule-cell precursors are continually born within the subgranular zone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Kempermann1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> where we observed synchronized diurnal expression of Fabp7, we would predict that Fabp7 cycles similarly in precursor cells of different birth dates, indicating a coordinated (non-cell autonomous) system of regulation. Since astrocytes are known to contact subgranular progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Plumpe1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>, it is likely that radial glial-like precursor cells are capable of receiving signals from astrocytes. Further, populations of astrocytes have been shown to undergo coordinated activity. For example, astrocytic purinergic signaling has been shown to synchronize pulses of calcium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Guthrie1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Bowser1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref> and to modulate heterosynaptic depression through inhibition of presynaptic terminals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Pascual1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, purinergic signaling by adenosine, as well as lipid-derived prostaglandins, is known to modulate behavioral state, long-term potentiation and long-term depression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Chen2">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Huang1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>. Astrocyte derived calcium signals have also been shown to correlate with neuronal activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Winship1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>, and to couple this activity to cerebral microcirculation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001631-Straub1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>. That populations of astrocytes are capable of coordinated activity, therefore, further supports the notion that a broad astrocyte-mediated signaling system occurs in brain. Although, the modulation of the cycling of Fabp7 that we observe maybe extrinsic to the brain, i.e., driven by fluctuating serum lipid concentrations that influence astrocyte metabolism, it seems more likely that Fabp7 expression is driven by a yet undefined intrinsic brain signaling system that involves astrocyte communication.</p><p>This is the first report to describe a diurnally regulated gene, Fabp7 that cycles globally in astrocytes and related cell-types in the mammalian central nervous system. The global cycling pattern of Fabp7 implicates a coordinated mechanism of regulation that extends to radial glial-like cells of the hippocampal subgranular zone and is consistent with growing evidence that astrocytes coordinate homeostatic mechanisms in brain. Although the mechanism for this regulation is uncertain, other globally regulated genes, including circadian and clock-controlled transcripts, cycle in different phases in brain regions outside of the suprachiasmatic circadian pacemaker making the cycling of Fabp7 unique. Given the influence that known circadian genes and lipid metabolites exert on complex behavior, and the role that astrocytes play in homeostasis and plasticity, the global cycling of Fabp7 may be intimately related to the maintenance of these processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Subjects and Handling</title><p>Mice (C57BL/6) were either purchased directly from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (adult) or taken at specific ages from a breeding colony.
