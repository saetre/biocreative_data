The first cullin-RING ligase discovered, yeast SCF<sup>Cdc4</sup>, functions with the conjugating enzyme Cdc34 to regulate the cell cycle. Cdc34 orthologs are notable for their highly acidic C-terminal extension. Here we confirm that the Cdc34 acidic C-terminal tail has a role in Cdc34 binding to SCF<sup>Cdc4</sup> and makes a major contribution to the submicromolar <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> of Cdc34 for SCF<sup>Cdc4</sup>. Moreover, we demonstrate that a key functional property of the tail is its acidity. Our analysis also uncovers an unexpected new function for the acidic tail in promoting catalysis. We demonstrate that SCF is functional when Cdc34 is fused to the C terminus of Cul1 and that this fusion retains partial function even when the acidic tail has been deleted. The Cdc34-SCF fusion proteins that lack the acidic tail must interact in a fundamentally different manner than unfused SCF and wild type Cdc34, demonstrating that distinct mechanisms of E2 recruitment to E3, as is seen in nature, can sustain substrate ubiquitylation. Finally, a search of the yeast proteome uncovered scores of proteins containing highly acidic stretches of amino acids, hinting that electrostatic interactions may be a common mechanism for facilitating protein assembly.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="CS100">National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id rid="CS100">F32 GM074471-01</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regulation of protein degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system is critical for cellular homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Ubiquitylation is governed by a transfer cascade involving three enzyme families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The E1<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>2</sup></xref> enzyme activates ubiquitin and transfers it to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). The ubiquitin-charged E2s engage ubiquitin ligases (E3) that recognize and bind to protein substrates targeted for ubiquitylation. This results in the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to substrate, either directly or via a covalent E3-ubiquitin intermediate. Subsequent ubiquitins can be attached to the ubiquitin conjugated to substrate to initiate formation of an ubiquitin chain. Transfer of at least four ubiquitins in the form of a polyubiquitin chain constitutes a signal for recognition by proteasomes and ensuing degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Thanks to the advances of genome sequencing and powerful algorithms for comparing distantly related protein sequences, it is now understood that there are perhaps as many as 650 distinct ubiquitin ligases encoded by the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), a seemingly daunting statistic for those who wish to understand molecular mechanisms of ubiquitylation. However, up to 350 of these ligases may belong to a single family called cullin-RING-ligases (CRLs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), such that mechanistic insight gained by the analysis of one member of the CRL family may serve as a template for understanding up to half of all E3s. Moreover, mutations in or the misregulation of several CRL subunits have been shown to promote tumorigenesis in numerous forms of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), and thus a mechanistic understanding of how these ligases function may aid in the process of drug discovery.</p><p>The founding member of the CRLs is the yeast ubiquitin ligase SCF<sup>Cdc4</sup>, named after the Skp1, Cul1 (Cdc53 in yeast), and F-box proteins that form this multi-subunit enzyme complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). F-box proteins specifically recognize protein substrates that are to be ubiquitylated by SCF. For instance, the F-box protein Cdc4 binds to the SCF<sup>Cdc4</sup> substrate Sic1, a cyclin-CDK inhibitor and key regulator of the cell cycle in yeast. A fourth subunit of SCF, Hrt1/Rbx1/Roc1, belongs to the RING family of proteins and binds to E2s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The C-terminal domain of Cdc53 binds Hrt1, whereas the N-terminal end of Cdc53 binds to Skp1, which binds to an array of different F-box proteins such as Cdc4. The x-ray structure of the cullin protein reveals an elongated, platform-like shape, such that the cullin acts as a scaffold that brings the F-box-substrate complex and the E2 into proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). There are several excellent reviews that detail structural, functional, and biological aspects of the CRLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>The E2-conjugating enzyme for SCF<sup>Cdc4</sup> is a protein named Cdc34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Although all of the E2s share a common catalytic domain that has a conserved sequence and structure, some of them have additional domains appended to either their N or C termini. In budding yeast, there are three E2s that have unique C-terminal extensions that are remarkable for the abundance of acidic residues in the amino acid sequence: Cdc34, Ubc8, and Rad6. However, the acidic tail of Cdc34 is much longer than the extension on Rad6 and is far more conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution than is the tail on Ubc8. For these reasons, Cdc34 stands alone in the E2 family for its unique acidic tail (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.058529/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1</ext-link>).</p><p>Mutants lacking all or part of the acidic tail have profound phenotypes by biochemical and genetic analysis. For instance, deletion of the acidic tail is lethal in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Interestingly, a Cdc34 null mutant can be rescued by grafting the acidic tail onto the E2 Rad6, suggesting that the function of the tail is portable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). GST pulldown assays with both wild type and tail-truncated yeast or human Cdc34 demonstrated that the acidic tail is likely involved in binding to SCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). However, a different study found no defect in SCF binding for a tail-truncated human Cdc34 mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), but nevertheless tail deletion mutants of human Cdc34 have been reported to be extremely defective in an <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitylation assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>SCF<sup>Cdc4</sup> was the first CRL to be fully reconstituted in an <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitylation system, and SCF ligases remain the best understood members of the CRL family. Nevertheless, we still have only rudimentary insight into how the essential acidic tail of Cdc34 enables ubiquitylation of SCF substrates. To address this gap in our knowledge, we have taken an enzymological approach to understand the role of the acidic tail in Cdc34-SCF function. Our work extends previous observations that the Cdc34 tail is important for SCF binding and establishes that the acidity of the tail is its key functional attribute. We also provide evidence that the tail promotes ubiquitin transfer within the substrate-SCF-Cdc34&#x000b7;Ub Michaelis complex. Finally, we show that the acidic tail is not the only means by which Cdc34 can be productively tethered to SCF, a finding that has important implications for understanding the evolution of ubiquitylation mechanisms. Our results illustrate how kinetic analysis can provide important insights into the function of E2-E3 complexes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Cdc34</title><p>All of the Cdc34 coding sequences were amplified by PCR to encode a six-histidine tag at the C terminus and expressed in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> cells.

A defined length of residues (between 15 and 25) was used as a sliding window over each protein sequence in the yeast proteome. If an acidic stretch of residues (defined as containing aspartate or glutamate residues in greater than 60, 70, or 80% of the positions within the window) was encountered at least once during this process, this protein is counted once, and the next sequence was analyzed. Therefore, the total possible number of hits can be no greater than the number of protein sequences in the data base (5,862 protein sequences).</p><p>To determine the statistical significance of the results, the sequence of each protein was randomized and then analyzed for the presence of acidic stretches using identical criteria as above. This process was repeated 10 times for each sequence in the proteome. This was used to estimate the expected value of acidic stretches for each protein sequence where the expectation is the average number of hits for all 10 randomized sequences. Therefore, the expectation for each sequence will have a range between 0 and 1. The expected value of the number of proteins from the proteome is the total sum of the individual expectations. The entire process was repeated three times.

This loss of activity can be explained by one of three possible hypotheses. First, deletion of the tail may affect binding of Cdc34 to SCF. Second, tail deletion may result in a loss of catalytic activity of the Cdc34-SCF complex. Finally, the acidic tail of Cdc34 may confer both binding and catalytic properties to the conjugating enzyme. Prior pulldown studies in yeast have pointed to a role for the acidic tail in binding to SCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), and this conclusion was supported by a biochemical study of human Cdc34 that utilized autoubiquitylation as a functional read-out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). However, a subsequent analysis of p27 ubiquitylation by human Cdc34 concluded that the acidic tail is dispensable for binding to SCF and instead appears to play a catalytic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).

Because Cdc34 forms Lys<sup>48</sup> ubiquitin chains with high specificity, K48R ubiquitin can form thioesters with Cdc34 but will not attack Cdc34&#x000b7;ubiquitin thioesters. Once Cdc34 was charged fully with the K48R ubiquitin, the reactions were initiated by the addition of unlabeled D77 ubiquitin, which cannot form thioesters with E2 because the terminal glycine residue is blocked but is nevertheless able to attack Cdc34&#x000b7;ubiquitin thioesters because Lys<sup>48</sup> remains intact. The product appears in the form of radiolabeled D77-K48R di-ubiquitin.</p><p>Using a concentration of both Cdc34-&#x00394;270 and Cdc34-&#x00394;190 (2 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) that was sufficient for &#x00394;270 to saturate SCF, we measured the rate of di-ubiquitin synthesis in both the presence and the absence of SCF<sup>Cdc4</sup> (for simplicity, we will refer to SCF<sup>Cdc4</sup> hereafter as SCF unless noted otherwise). Both Cdc34-&#x00394;270 and Cdc34-&#x00394;190 formed di-ubiquitin with nearly identical rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>).

The <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> for Cdc34-&#x00394;190 (16 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) was &#x0223c;100-fold greater, which together with the GST tail inhibition experiment solidifies the notion that the acidic tail of Cdc34 is an important determinant of functional E2 binding to SCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>B</italic> and H, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.058529/DC1">supplemental Fig. S4</ext-link>). We note that <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> for Cdc34-&#x00394;190 and the IC<sub>50</sub> for the GST tail were nearly identical, suggesting that the catalytic domain and the acidic tail of Cdc34 alone have comparable weak affinities for SCF. Direct binding measurements confirmed the kinetic observations reported here that the acidic tail stabilized association of the catalytic domain with SCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the increase in <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic>, we also observed that the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> for Cdc34-&#x00394;190 was &#x0223c;10-fold less than <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> for Cdc34-&#x00394;230. Even when Cdc34-&#x00394;190 was close to saturating SCF, chain elongation on Sic1 was substantially attenuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>). For example, notice that unlike Cdc34-&#x00394;230, there were no high molecular weight products formed with Cdc34-&#x00394;190 that migrated at the top of the gel. Thus, in addition to promoting binding to SCF, the acidic tail also promotes ubiquitin transfer within the Cdc34&#x000b7;Ub-SCF-substrate complex.</p><p>To dissect more finely the different activities of the acidic tail, we created a truncation series in which 5 or 10 residue blocks were progressively deleted from the C terminus of the Cdc34-&#x00394;230 sequence. The first mutant in the truncation series, Cdc34-&#x00394;225, resulted in an activity that was indistinguishable from Cdc34-&#x00394;230 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>H</italic>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.058529/DC1">supplemental Fig. S4</ext-link>). The next mutant, Cdc34-&#x00394;220, exhibited a modest 3-fold increase in <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> but no change in either <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> or ubiquitin chain elongation on substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>H</italic>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.058529/DC1">supplemental Fig. S4</ext-link>). Deletion of an additional 10 residues created a mutant (Cdc34-&#x00394;210) that was severely defective in <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>E</italic> and <italic>H</italic>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.058529/DC1">supplemental Fig. S4</ext-link>). The <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> for Cdc34-&#x00394;210 was comparable with the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> for Cdc34-&#x00394;190, indicating that residues in between amino acids 211 and 220, in the sequence DDENGSVILQ, can mediate binding of Cdc34 to SCF. In addition to the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> defect, there was a noticeable decrease in ubiquitin chain elongation. Finally, Cdc34-&#x00394;205 exhibited a <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> similar to Cdc34-&#x00394;210, but unlike Cdc34-&#x00394;210, Cdc34-&#x00394;205 showed a decrease in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> in addition to a noticeable defect in ubiquitin chain elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>F</italic> and <italic>H</italic>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.058529/DC1">supplemental Fig. S4</ext-link>). In conclusion, we found that residues 211&#x02013;220 in the Cdc34 acidic tail contribute to binding to SCF, whereas the more proximal segment 191&#x02013;210 appears to affect catalysis.</p><p>Although it is clear that the tail is essential for Cdc34 function and interaction with SCF, it is largely unknown exactly what property of the tail comprises its essential function. Our fine scale deletion mapping data cast doubt on the assumption that the acidity of the tail is its critical feature, because the sequence in the region spanning amino acids 211&#x02013;220 (DDENGSVILQ) contains only three acidic residues, but its deletion increases <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> by 36-fold. Meanwhile, both the segments immediately upstream (residues 201&#x02013;210) and downstream (residues 221&#x02013;230) are more enriched for Glu and Asp, but deletion of either segment has only a modest effect on <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic>. To resolve this apparent discrepancy, we sought to address directly the issue of whether the acidity of the tail is in fact relevant to its biological function by replacing the entire stretch of residues from 211 to 230 with acidic amino acids. Remarkably, this mutant, Cdc34-&#x00394;210<sub>ED</sub>-230, was capable of ubiquitylating Sic1 with essentially identical kinetics as compared with Cdc34-&#x00394;230 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). In addition to the highly similar values of <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> for the two proteins, chain elongation on Sic1 was also very similar. This result provides compelling evidence that electrostatic interactions involving tail residues C-terminal to residue Asp<sup>210</sup> play a key role in mediating contacts between Cdc34 and SCF.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p><bold>The distal segment of the acidic tail can be replaced entirely by poly(Glu-Asp).</bold> Reactions containing 1.6 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> yeast E1, 100 n<sc>m</sc> yeast SCF, 1.2 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc><sup>32</sup>P-labeled Sic1, 300 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> ubiquitin, and a 2-fold linearly decreasing titration of Cdc34-&#x00394;210<sub>ED</sub>-230 were incubated for 1 min and quenched by SDS-PAGE buffer.

To test this hypothesis, we sought to construct fusions between human Cul1 and human Cdc34. The rationale for using the human proteins for this experiment is 2-fold. First, there are crystal structures for human Cul1 and Cdc34 but not the yeast proteins. Second, the human Cul1 can be expressed at high levels in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> as two separate fragments, which would facilitate the expression and analysis of chimeric constructs. It is important to note that the acidic tail of human Cdc34 is important for its function in SCF-dependent substrate ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Moreover, we confirmed that the tail domain of human Cdc34, like that of yeast Cdc34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) bound Cul1-Rbx1 in a GST pulldown assay (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.058529/DC1">supplemental Fig. S5</ext-link>).</p><p>To construct an SCF-Cdc34 chimera, we settled on a design in which the N terminus of Cdc34 was fused to the C terminus of Cul1 using a flexible 16-residue glycine-rich linker that was predicted by computational analysis to be long enough to span the two termini in an E2-SCF complex. We anticipated that the fusion should keep SCF and Cdc34 in close proximity, such that SCF would be continuously saturated with Cdc34.</p><p>For the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, wild type Cdc34 and Cdc34-&#x00394;190 fused to Cul1 were co-expressed with Rbx1 in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> and purified. To avoid confusion, the noncovalent complex formed by co-expressed Cul1 and Rbx1 is referred to as Rbx1+Cul1. Fused complexes were either assayed as is or assembled with Skp1-&#x003b2;TrCP expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells. In a direct comparison, unfused wild type Cdc34 and Rbx1+Cul1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic>) and wild type Rbx1+Cul1-Cdc34 fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>) yielded similar activities in the di-ubiquitin synthesis assay. Because it is known that the same interface on E2 binds to both RING and E1 (<italic>i.e.</italic> E2 cannot bind to both E1 and RING simultaneously) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), this result indicated that fusion of Cul1 to Cdc34 did not impede the access of Cdc34 to either Rbx1 or E1 enzyme and that the catalytic domain of the fused Cdc34 can dissociate from and reassociate with SCF to engage in multiple rounds of di-ubiquitin synthesis. As expected, assaying unfused human Cdc34-&#x00394;190 (using the same concentration as wild type Cdc34) with Rbx1+Cul1 produced no detectable product during the reaction time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic>).

Remarkably, the activity of the Cdc34-&#x00394;190 fusion was within 2-fold of the wild type fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>E</italic>). Thus, the acidic tail of Cdc34 was almost entirely dispensable for ubiquitylation of Ub-&#x003b2;-catenin when Cdc34 was fused to Cul1. Interestingly, the activity of the wild type Cul1-Cdc34 fusion toward an authentic substrate was substantially reduced compared with unfused proteins (&#x0223c;15-fold reduction of substrate consumption). Recall that the fused proteins had approximately normal activity in a di-ubiquitin synthesis assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). We suggest that Cdc34 in the fusion complex is overconstrained by having three separate attachments to SCF (the fusion joint, the catalytic domain-RING interaction, and the acidic tail-SCF interaction). Together, these interactions may restrict rotational and conformational flexibility required for juxtaposition of Cdc34&#x0223c;Ub and substrate within the SCF complex.</p><p>Acidic stretches in protein sequences may be a general strategy for promoting protein-protein interactions. Given the critical role of the acidic tail in Cdc34 function, we wondered whether there are additional proteins in the yeast proteome whose function might also depend on highly acidic peptides. To gain insight into this question, the yeast proteome was systematically searched for proteins that contain acidic stretches. Surprisingly there were numerous proteins that contained at least one highly acidic stretch of residues of significant length.</p><p>For example, consider that there is an acidic stretch of 25 contiguous residues in the yeast Cdc34 amino acid sequence (residues 208&#x02013;232) where 72% of those residues are aspartates or glutamates. We found 83 protein sequences in the yeast proteome that each contain at least one acidic stretch spanning 25 contiguous residues in which at least 70% of the residues were Glu or Asp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>). When protein sequences from the entire yeast proteome were shuffled and reanalyzed for the presence of equivalent acidic stretches, essentially no proteins were identified (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.058529/DC1">supplemental Table S1</ext-link>), eliminating the trivial possibility that our analysis revealed protein sequences loaded with acidic residues.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Proteins that contain long acidic stretches are abundant in the yeast proteome, suggesting that the paradigm of Cdc34-SCF represents a common mechanistic solution for facilitating protein assembly.</bold> Each protein sequence in the yeast proteome was searched for peptides of lengths between 15 and 25 residues that contain at least 60% acidic residues (<italic>A</italic>), 70% acidic residues (<italic>B</italic>), or 80% acidic residues (<italic>C</italic>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0031000780006"/></fig><p>Careful inspection of the Cdc34-&#x00394;230 acidic tail sequence (as well as the human ones) identifies a smaller stretch of residues that is even more acidic. These concentrated stretches may be important for biological function. Searching the yeast proteome for acidic stretches of 15 residues where at least 80% of the residues are acidic yielded 146 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>C</italic>), hinting that the binding mechanism utilized by Cdc34 and SCF may be a general phenomenon.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The results of our quantitative biochemical characterization of the Cdc34 acidic tail rationalize prior discrepancies in the literature by providing strong evidence that the acidic tail has multiple effects on the ability of Cdc34 to engage productively the SCF ubiquitin ligase. The acidic tail can be dissected into two domains: a highly acidic distal portion and a less acidic more proximal segment that links the acidic segment to the catalytic domain. The more distal segment of the acidic tail promotes binding of Cdc34 to SCF. The key role of acidity in this interaction is underscored by the observation that a functionally critical segment of the tail (amino acids 211&#x02013;230) can be replaced by poly(Glu-Asp). Strikingly, the role of the tail in recruitment of Cdc34 to SCF can be partially suppressed <italic>in vitro</italic> by direct fusion of Cdc34 to Cul1. Contrary to findings reported by Wu <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), we found that the more proximal segment of the tail does not appear to affect the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> of Cdc34 for SCF but instead promotes ubiquitin transfer from E2 to substrate within the Cdc34&#x000b7;Ub-SCF-substrate complex. We note that this discrepancy may be due to the fact that the kinetic analysis presented here employed the yeast Cdc34 protein, whereas human Cdc34 was analyzed by Wu <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Taken together, our results provide a quantitative biochemical rationale for why deletion of the Cdc34 tail influences both recruitment to SCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) and catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and is a lethal mutation in budding yeast.</p><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Acidic Tail Sequences Have a Role in Binding to SCF</title><p>Enzyme kinetic assays reported here indicate that the acidic tail of Cdc34 contributes to recruitment of Cdc34&#x000b7;Ub to SCF to form the Michaelis complex. Deletion of the tail increases <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> for Cdc34 by &#x0223c;100-fold, testifying to its importance. This observation, combined with the surprising result that residues in the tail important for binding can be completely replaced with acidic residues, argues that the principle function of the tail is to mediate an electrostatically driven interaction with SCF. Further evidence that the tail plays an important role in recruitment of Cdc34 to SCF is provided by the observation that a tail deletion mutant can be partially suppressed by direct fusion of Cdc34 to the Cul1 subunit of SCF. These observations supplement prior work, which had shown that the Cdc34 tail can confer CDC34 genetic function when fused to the E2 Rad6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and that the Cdc34 tail binds SCF in a pulldown assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). However, an important distinction is that pulldown assays yield correlative information on binding that may or may not be relevant to catalysis. For example, it is well known that some E2-RING E3 pairs exhibit strong biochemical activity even if direct binding cannot be detected in a pulldown assay, and conversely, it is possible to form E2-E3 complexes that lack catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Indeed, our own analysis of Cdc34 truncation mutants revealed that deletion of the C-terminal 65 residues from yeast Cdc34 eliminated binding to SCF (as determined by pulldown assay) but had no effect on the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> of Cdc34 for SCF (this work).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4"><sup>3</sup></xref> By contrast, the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> effects reported here provide direct confirmation that the acidic tail contributes to the formation of a functional Cdc34&#x000b7;Ub-SCF-substrate complex.</p><p>Our progressive deletion analysis revealed a particularly critical role for tail amino acids 211&#x02013;220 in mediating Cdc34-SCF association. However, the essentially normal activity of a synthetic chimera in which amino acids 211&#x02013;230 were replaced by poly(Glu-Asp) argues against the presence of any specific information in this segment other than acidic amino acids. Because every subsequent block of 10 amino acids on through the C terminus contains at least three acidic residues, we suggest that there is nothing unique about amino acids 211&#x02013;220 other than that it contains the most proximal acidic segment that can engage SCF productively. We suggest that in the wild type Cdc34, multiple short acidic stretches in the distal half of the tail can bind SCF in a quasi-redundant manner.</p><p>Evaluating the role of the acidic tail in light of the structure of other E2s raises a question: why does Cdc34 use an acidic tail to interact with SCF, whereas other E2s appear to dock to their cognate E3 principally via the N-terminal &#x003b1; helix and loop regions flanked by &#x003b2; strands 3 and 4 (loop 1) and &#x003b1; helices 2 and 3 (loop 2)? Our data indicate that on their own, the catalytic domain and the acidic tail of Cdc34 each have very weak affinities for SCF (&#x0223c;16 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>). We propose that the tail has weak affinity for SCF because charged residues must be desolvated before they can interact with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), which renders electrostatically driven interactions inherently unstable because of the unfavorable energetics of desolvating charged side chains. However, upon binding SCF, the tail would tether the catalytic domain nearby and thereby drive its efficient docking to the RING and Cul1, despite the fact that the catalytic domain by itself has relatively poor affinity. Thus, instead of deriving favorable binding energy from a single interface, the Cdc34-SCF complex is stabilized by independent contributions of two distinct interfaces. In this way, each domain stabilizes binding of the other via an avidity effect, similar to how each Fab contributes to the tight binding of an intact IgG to polyvalent antigen. This strategy of achieving high affinity binding by brandishing two relatively weak interfaces as opposed to a single tight interface may provide a kinetic advantage for forming a functional complex, because there is evidence that electrostatic interactions can occur very rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Indeed, in other work we have shown that the acidic tail maintains a high affinity yet highly dynamic interaction between Cdc34 and SCF by binding to a basic region on Cul1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The Role of Proximal Tail Sequences in Promoting Catalysis</title><p>In addition to promoting functional interaction between Cdc34 and SCF, the proximal region of the acidic tail (<italic>i.e.</italic> residues upstream of residue 210) promotes ubiquitin transfer from Cdc34&#x000b7;Ub to substrate within the Cdc34&#x000b7;Ub-SCF-substrate Michaelis complex. The magnitude of the effect we measured was &#x0223c;10-fold, but this may be an underestimate, because we calculated <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> based on molecules of substrates modified per SCF per unit time, and comparisons of single- and multi-turnover reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) suggest that some step other than the chemical step is rate-limiting under multi-turnover conditions. This is also evident from examining the pattern of conjugates produced by Cdc34 variants that either contain or lack the proximal region of the tail; mutants deleted for the proximal tail yield reaction products of lower average mass (<italic>i.e.</italic> bearing fewer ubiquitin modifications). In any event, this catalytic role of the tail reported here went undetected in prior studies, which relied primarily on binding assays. Although the acidic tail has a demonstrable <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> effect, the mechanism by which this occurs remains unknown and awaits further study.</p></sec><sec><title>Flirting with Evolution: Redesigning the Cdc34-SCF Interaction</title><p>Our results indicate that Cdc34 employs an acidic tail to stabilize its productive interaction with SCF. Other E2-E3 pairs (<italic>i.e.</italic> Rad6-Ubr1 and Ube2g2-gp78) also form contacts other than the canonical catalytic domain-RING interface to stabilize association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Indeed, there is even an extreme example in which E2 and E3 are expressed as a single polypeptide chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). This suggested to us that it may be possible to redesign the Cdc34-SCF pair such that productive interaction of the E2 catalytic domain with the RING subunit of SCF is facilitated by direct protein fusion rather than the distal segment of the acidic tail. Remarkably, fusion of the N terminus of Cdc34 to the C terminus of Cul1 largely negated the benefit of possessing an acidic tail when assays were carried out with a mono-ubiquitylated &#x003b2;-catenin peptide substrate. Taken together with the properties of other E2-E3 pairs noted above, this result suggests that it is important for E2 to be able to bind rapidly to its cognate E3 to effect ubiquitin transfer to substrate but that the exact mechanism by which rapid binding is achieved is not necessarily critical. Thus, we suggest that there will be diverse, convergent evolutionary solutions to facilitate rapid association of E2s and E3s.</p></sec><sec><title>Other Examples of Acidic Tail-containing Proteins and Their Functional Similarity to Cdc34-SCF</title><p>Our observation that a synthetic distal tail with very low sequence complexity (poly(Glu-Asp)) is nevertheless capable of mediating functional interaction of Cdc34 with SCF suggested the possibility that polyacidic (or polybasic) stretches might be used more generally to drive protein-protein interactions. Searching the yeast proteome for other proteins that contain acidic regions produced a bolus of hits. Unlike Cdc34, acidic stretches were not confined to the C-terminal regions of protein sequences but were also found appended at the N terminus or sometimes even in the middle of these proteins, likely in the form of loops. Although it is beyond the scope of this manuscript to delve deeply into a functional analysis of all of these proteins, a cursory glance revealed a couple of striking examples, as detailed below.</p><p>One protein, Qcr6, contains an extraordinary acidic tail of 48 residues near its N terminus. Almost 80% of these residues are either glutamates or aspartates. Qcr6 is a subunit of the cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> complex, a highly conserved multi-subunit enzyme involved in cytochrome <italic>c</italic> maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). It has been known for some time that cytochrome <italic>c</italic> maintains a large positive dipole moment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Although no direct biochemical studies have been done, it has been shown that the reaction rate decreases steadily with increasing ionic strength of the reaction solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), a result that is typically interpreted as evidence for electrostatic interactions between two proteins. It is tempting to speculate that the tremendous rate of electron transfer between cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and the bc1 enzyme is enabled by an electrostatic interaction between Qcr6 and cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, where the acidic tail of Qcr6 helps align cytochrome <italic>c</italic> to promote productive binding to the cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> complex.</p><p>In another example, we found a &#x0223c;60-residue-long acidic tail at the C terminus of Vhs3, a functionally redundant inhibitory subunit of Ppz1p, a Ser/Thr protein phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Interestingly, Ppz1 has a basic N-terminal domain with a theoretical pI of 9.7 and an estimated charge (at pH 7) of 17. Furthermore, the functionally redundant inhibitory subunit of Ppz1, Sis2/Hal3, also maintains an acidic tail at its C terminus.</p><p>As a final note, it has long been understood from the work of Ptashne and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) that some transcriptional regulatory proteins have highly acidic stretches of amino acids in their activator domains. In fact, these acidic sequences can be transferred from one regulator to another, reminiscent of the ability of the Cdc34 tail to function with the catalytic domain of the E2 Rad6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by National Institutes of Health Ruth Kirschstein Postdoctoral Fellowship F32 GM074471-01.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supplementary-material" id="FN2"><label><inline-graphic xlink:href="sbox.jpg"/></label><p>The on-line version of this article (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org">http://www.jbc.org</ext-link>) contains <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.058529/DC1">supplemental text, references, Table S1, and Figs.
