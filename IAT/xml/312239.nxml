The data revealed two novel results: in contrast to previous findings, some of the rRNA mutations affected suppression at UAA and UAG nonsense codons. Secondly, both an increase and a decrease in the efficiency of the suppressor tRNA were induced by the mutations. This is the first report that rRNA mutations decreased the efficiency of a suppressor tRNA. The data are interpreted as there being competition between the two release factors (RF-1 and RF-2) for an overlapping domain and that helix 34 influences this interaction.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00081-0123.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1567"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00081-0124.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1568"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00081-0125.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1569"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00081-0126.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1570"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00081-0127.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1571"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
