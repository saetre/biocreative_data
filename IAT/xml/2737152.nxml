Here, we investigated the role of the TPL-2 signaling pathway in TLR induction of interferon-&#x003b2; (IFN-&#x003b2;) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in these cell types. It has previously been suggested that IFN-&#x003b2; and IL-10 are coordinately regulated after TLR stimulation. However, in the absence of TPL-2 signaling, lipopolysaccharide (TLR4) and CpG (TLR9) stimulation resulted in increased production of IFN-&#x003b2; while decreasing IL-10 production by both macrophages and myeloid DCs. In contrast, CpG induction of both IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b2; by plasmacytoid DCs was decreased in the absence of TPL-2, although extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation was blocked. Extracellular signal-related kinase&#x02013;dependent negative regulation of IFN-&#x003b2; in macrophages was IL-10&#x02013;independent, required protein synthesis, and was recapitulated in TPL-2&#x02013;deficient myeloid DCs by retroviral transduction of the ERK-dependent transcription factor <italic>c-fos.</italic></p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on macrophages and DCs respond to pathogen-derived products to induce the production of effector molecules that regulate innate and adaptive immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Medzhitov, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akira and Takeda, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beutler et al., 2004</xref>). These include the type I IFNs, IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b2;, and the proinflammatory cytokine IL-12, which are important for protective responses to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">O'Garra and Robinson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006</xref>), and IL-10, which suppresses cytokine production by macrophages and DCs, thereby limiting the immune response to infectious agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moore et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The cytoplasmic regions of TLRs share the Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain, leading to associations between TLRs and the TIR-containing adaptors, MyD88, TIRAP (MAL), TIR domain&#x02013;containing adaptor inducing IFN-&#x003b2; (TRIF; TICAM-1), and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akira and Takeda, 2004</xref>), upon ligand binding. TLR4, the receptor for LPS, utilizes all four adaptors, whereas TLR9, the receptor for CpG-DNA motifs, uses only MyD88. Differential responses mediated by distinct TLR ligands may be explained in part by selective usage of TIR adaptor molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boonstra et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colonna, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmitz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rajsbaum et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>TLR stimulation induces activation of the major mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) subtypes (extracellular signal-related kinases [ERK]-1/2, Jun N-terminal kinases [JNK], and p38) and the I&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK) complex for activation of NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akira and Takeda, 2004</xref>). TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 6 is required for MyD88-dependent activation of MAPKs and NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gohda et al., 2004</xref>). TRIF-dependent signaling utilizes TRAF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">H&#x000e4;cker et al., 2006</xref>), which couples TRIF and MyD88, to activate TBK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">H&#x000e4;cker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oganesyan et al., 2006</xref>), a kinase that regulates the activation of IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 3 and IRF7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Honda et al., 2006</xref>). It has been proposed that the TRAF6-dependent pathway, via its activation of MAPKs and IKK, participates in the induction of proinflammatory cytokines, whereas the TRAF3-dependent pathway coordinately regulates the production of type I IFNs and IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">H&#x000e4;cker et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the ratio of TRAF6 versus TRAF3 recruitment to TLRs may dictate the relative production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12, versus type I IFNs and IL-10. However, the observation that LPS induction of IFN-&#x003b2; in macrophages and DCs is dependent on TRIF, but not MyD88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akira and Takeda, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boonstra et al., 2006</xref>), whereas induction of IL-10 requires both adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boonstra et al., 2006</xref>), indicates that IFN-&#x003b2; and IL-10 may not always be coordinately regulated. Furthermore, the signals regulating the induction of type I IFN differ according to the activating TLR and the cell type being stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colonna, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmitz et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, TLR4-mediated induction of IFN-&#x003b2; in macrophages and myeloid DCs involves activation of IRF3 (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akira and Takeda, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colonna, 2007</xref>), whereas TLR9 stimulation of IFN-&#x003b2; in these cells is mediated via IRF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmitz et al., 2007</xref>). However, TLR9 induction of type I IFN in plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) involves activation of IRF7 (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akira and Takeda, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colonna, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The signaling pathways coupling TLRs to the activation of MAPKs diverge downstream of TRAF6 and involve distinct MAPKKKs (MAP 3-kinases; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Symons et al., 2006</xref>). In macrophages, LPS activation of ERK, but not JNK or p38 MAPK, is mediated by the MAP 3-kinase TPL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dumitru et al., 2000</xref>), which phosphorylates and activates the ERK-specific MAPKKs MEK-1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Salmeron et al., 1996</xref>). A role for ERK activation in the induction of IL-10 and down-regulation of IL-12 production has previously been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agrawal et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dillon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2006</xref>). However, it is still unclear whether the inhibition of IL-12 is a direct effect of TLR ligand-induced ERK activation or results as a consequence of IL-10 induction by this signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agrawal et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dillon et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated the role of the TPL-2 signaling pathway in the induction of IFN-&#x003b2; and IL-10 in macrophages, myeloid DCs, and pDCs.

However, the increase in IFN-&#x003b2; production in <italic>Tpl-2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> relative to WT cells was less in BMDCs than in BMDMs. The elevated amounts of IFN-&#x003b2; produced by <italic>Tpl-2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMDMs and BMDCs may result in part from decreased production of IL-10 because IL-10 inhibits IFN-&#x003b2; production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moore et al., 2001</xref>). This may explain why IFN-&#x003b2; production is less affected by TPL-2 deficiency in BMDCs compared with BMDMs because the BMDCs produce lower concentrations of IL-10.

In WT cells, LPS-stimulated rapid ERK phosphorylation, which peaked at 15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>). In contrast, LPS-induced ERK phosphorylation was not detected in <italic>Tpl-2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>), whereas JNK and p38 phosphorylation were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>), as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dumitru et al., 2000</xref>). To confirm that the effects of TPL-2 deficiency on TLR-induced cytokine production resulted from abrogation of ERK activation, WT cells were treated with the MEK inhibitor U0126 to block ERK activation while leaving p38 or JNK activation unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Favata et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies et al., 2000</xref>). U0126 increased IFN-&#x003b2; and IL-12 production and reduced production of IL-10 by LPS-stimulated BMDMs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20091059/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>), similar to the effects of TPL-2 deficiency in this cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>). Comparable results were obtained with a structurally distinct inhibitor of MEK-1/2, PD184352 (a gift from P. Cohen, University of Dundee, Scotland, UK; unpublished data). These data support the hypothesis that TPL-2 promotes IL-10 production while decreasing IL-12 and IFN-&#x003b2; production via its activation of the ERK MAPK pathway.</p><p>We show that activation of ERK by TLR4 in macrophages required TPL-2, in agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dumitru et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Papoutsopoulou et al., 2006</xref>). Our data also suggest that activation of the TPL-2 signaling pathway was required for optimal IL-10 production, but negatively regulated IL-12 production. These findings are in accordance with published data using pharmacological inhibitors to block ERK activation in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feng et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">H&#x000e4;cker et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, our data suggest that TLR4 activation of the TPL-2 pathway negatively regulates the production of IFN-&#x003b2;, in contrast to its positive effects on IL-10 production.</p><p>Although the consequences of TPL-2 deficiency on cytokine production after TLR stimulation were very similar in BMDMs and BMDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>), it has been suggested previously that LPS does not stimulate ERK activation in BMDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">H&#x000e4;cker et al., 1999</xref>). Hence, we reinvestigated whether TLR4 was actually able to induce ERK phosphorylation in BMDCs. In our hands, LPS clearly stimulated ERK phosphorylation in WT BMDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>), although at a reduced intensity compared with WT BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1 a</xref>). This may explain the previous failure to detect ERK phosphorylation in BMDCs after LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">H&#x000e4;cker et al., 1999</xref>). We show that LPS-induction of ERK phosphorylation was blocked in BMDCs from <italic>Tpl-2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>), similarly to BMDMs. p38 MAPK phosphorylation was marginally reduced in <italic>Tpl-2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMDCs compared with WT cells after LPS stimulation, but JNK phosphorylation was unaffected. Thus, altered cytokine production in <italic>Tpl-2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMDCs after TLR stimulation was associated predominantly with a block in ERK activation.</p><p>Our data that TPL-2 negatively regulates IL-12 in BMDCs are consistent with reports from the Pulendran group that pharmacological inhibition of ERK activation increases IL-12 production by human and mouse DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agrawal et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dillon et al., 2004</xref>). The negative regulatory effect of TPL-2 on IFN-&#x003b2; production that we observe in BMDCs stimulated with LPS contrasts to the requirement of TPL-2 for optimal IL-10 induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>). Thus, TLR-induction of IL-10 and IFN-&#x003b2; is oppositely regulated by TPL-2 in both macrophages and myeloid DCs.</p></sec><sec><title>CpG stimulation results in increased IFN-&#x003b2; production in <italic>Tpl-2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages and myeloid DCs, but decreased IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b2; in <italic>Tpl-2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> pDCs</title><p>Because pDCs are a major source of type I IFNs during immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006</xref>), we determined the role of the TPL-2 signaling pathway in TLR-induction of IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b2; in this cell type.

BM cells were cultured in 6-well plates (Corning) in complete RPMI containing GM-CSF as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boonstra et al., 2006</xref>) at 2 ml/well. After 48 h of incubation, 0.5 &#x000b5;g/ml polybrene and 200 &#x000b5;l of concentrated virus was added per well and plates were centrifuged at 2,000 <italic>g</italic> for 1 h at 25&#x000b0;C. On days 3, 4, and 5, each well was further supplemented with 1 ml complete BMDCs medium containing 100 &#x000b5;l of virus. On day 7, nonadherent cells were harvested and sorted for GFP<sup>+</sup> (MoFlo; Cytomation) and 96% of cells were CD11c<sup>+</sup>, and 99% GFP<sup>+</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses.</title><p>Analyses were performed using Prism software (GraphPad).</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material.</title><p>Fig. S1 shows the contribution of ERK activation to LPS-mediated cytokine production.
