They have been implicated in many congenital malformations and developmental cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c2">2</xref>). Insights into homeobox gene function <italic>in vivo</italic> have been gained through the mutagenesis, inactivation or ectopic expression of these genes in different animal models. However, there is little known about the identity of direct homeobox gene targets. It is critical to identify these &#x02018;downstream&#x02019; genes to understand the genetic program used by homeobox genes to determine regional identity, patterning and cell-fate specification during vertebrate development.</p><p>Of six known mouse <italic>Dlx</italic> genes, four (<italic>Dlx</italic>1, 2, 5 and 6) are expressed in the developing forebrain and retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c6">6</xref>). The <italic>Dlx</italic> genes are arranged in bigenic clusters where each pair is linked to a different Hox cluster (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh233f3">3</xref>a) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c7">7</xref>). Mice lacking both <italic>Dlx</italic>1 and <italic>Dlx</italic>2 exhibit a time-dependent block in striatal neuronogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c8">8</xref>). Neurons born after embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) do not fully differentiate and are blocked in their migration to the neocortex, olfactory bulb and hippocampus. In the <italic>Dlx</italic>1/2 mutants, a lateral tangential migration that appears to be the source for most neocortical GABAergic interneurons present in neonatal mice, is blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c10">10</xref>). As well, we have demonstrated abnormal retinal development in these doubly null mice (de Melo,J., Du,G., Fonseca,M., Turk,W.J., Rubenstein,J.L.R. and Eisenstat,D.D., submitted).</p><p>The redundant functions of the <italic>Dlx</italic> genes may be explained by their nearly identical homeodomains, whereas their unique functions may be due to the divergence of their amino acid sequences in other domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c3">3</xref>). In addition, while <italic>Dlx</italic>1, 2, 5 and 6 are localized to the same anatomical regions, they are expressed at different but overlapping stages of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c8">8</xref>), suggesting that distinct <italic>Dlx</italic> genes are required at different stages of development. This temporal and spatial overlap could be the basis for the observed genetic redundancy between <italic>Dlx</italic>1 and <italic>Dlx</italic>2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c12">12</xref>).</p><p>A conserved enhancer located in the <italic>Dlx</italic>5<italic>/Dlx</italic>6 intergenic region (mouse <italic>Dlx</italic>5/6 intergenic enhancer; MI56) is an important site of cross-regulatory interactions between <italic>Dlx</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c13">13</xref>) and shows sequence similarity to an intergenic region of the <italic>Dlx</italic>3&#x02013;7 cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c15">15</xref>). In the <italic>Dlx</italic>1<italic>/Dlx</italic>2 knockout, activity of a reporter transgene regulated by MI56 is markedly reduced, analogous to decreased <italic>Dlx</italic>5 and <italic>Dlx</italic>6 expression in the <italic>Dlx</italic>1/<italic>Dlx</italic>2 double mutant striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c13">13</xref>). Expression from MI56 marks adult mouse cortical GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c16">16</xref>). However, these studies have not addressed whether the observed transcriptional events are due to the direct interaction of DLX homeoproteins with MI56 <italic>in vivo</italic> or via an indirect mechanism, such as regulation of other transcription factors. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that <italic>Dlx</italic>1 or <italic>Dlx</italic>2 regulate <italic>Dlx</italic>5 and/or <italic>Dlx</italic>6 expression <italic>in vivo</italic> by direct transcriptional regulation of MI56 by adapting chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to the developing vertebrate forebrain and retina.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Timed pregnant CD1 mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation following protocols approved by the University of Manitoba under the auspices of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.

We then cross-linked the tissues with PFA concentrations ranging from 1 to 4&#x00025; with fixation times from 30 min to overnight.

This cross-linking reagent was less efficient than 1&#x00025; PFA for yields of DLX1 or DLX2, but relatively higher levels of HDAC1 were obtained.

We designed oligonucleotide primers to encompass both MI56 regions and performed PCR after ChIP of E13 GE fixed in 1&#x00025; PFA for 2 h.

P19 embryonal carcinoma cells are pluripotential cells that can differentiate into neuronal cells under specific conditions, such as treatment with retinoic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c26">26</xref>). DLX2, but not DLX1, co-transfection activated luciferase expression. Western blotting confirmed that recombinant DLX1 and DLX2 proteins are both made in the transfected P19 cells (data not shown). Site-directed mutagenesis of the sixth or ninth TAAT motifs was completed prior to co-transfection with DLX expression constructs. Mutation of the sixth motif significantly reduced reporter gene activity mediated by DLX2, whereas mutation of the ninth motif reduced luciferase activity to a lesser extent following DLX2 co-transfection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh233f6">6</xref>).

Unlike DLX2, reporter gene expression was not affected by DLX1 co-transfection studies with the intact I56i enhancer element or mutated I56i enhancers containing mutations of the sixth and ninth TAAT motifs. Co-transfection of both DLX1 and DLX2 did not demonstrate any additive or synergistic effects compared with co-transfection of DLX2 alone (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have optimized the ChIP assay, using our specific DLX1 and DLX2 antibodies, to demonstrate for the first time that both DLX1 and DLX2 bind to the <italic>Dlx</italic>5/<italic>Dlx</italic>6 intergenic enhancer in embryonic forebrain <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results provide a direct mechanism to explain the marked reduction in both <italic>Dlx</italic>5 and <italic>Dlx</italic>6 expression in the embryonic striatum observed in the <italic>Dlx</italic>1/<italic>Dlx</italic>2 double knockout mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c8">8</xref>). In addition, we have demonstrated similar transcriptional regulation of this enhancer by DLX2 but not DLX1 in the mouse retina, signifying a conservation of function of <italic>Dlx</italic> genes wherever these homeobox genes are expressed.</p><p>The subtle phenotypes observed in the developing forebrain of the <italic>Dlx</italic>1 and <italic>Dlx</italic>2 single knockouts, as well as the overlapping expression domains and co-expression in subsets of embryonic striatum, support functional redundancy of <italic>Dlx</italic>1 and <italic>Dlx</italic>2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c12">12</xref>). However, there are differences between <italic>Dlx</italic>1 and <italic>Dlx</italic>2 expression during early development of the GE and retina. For example, in the GE, more DLX2 than DLX1 expressing cells are cycling at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c4">4</xref>). Onset of DLX1 and DLX2 expression in the retina occurs by E12.5 but more DLX2 than DLX1 expressing cells are in M-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c4">4</xref>). These differences suggest that DLX1 and DLX2 may have different yet overlapping gene targets in developing forebrain and retina.</p><p>DLX1 and DLX2 expression both significantly decrease by late gestation in the embryonic striatum. DLX1 and DLX2 bind to MI56 in E13.5 GE as demonstrated by ChIP assay. The activation of reporter gene expression by <italic>Dlx</italic>2 but not <italic>Dlx</italic>1 co-transfection with MI56 constructs suggests that DLX1 may require additional co-factors not present in the P19 embryonal carcinoma cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, luciferase and other reporter assays are <italic>in vitro</italic> &#x02018;non-chromatin&#x02019; based methods. Hence, using ChIP, the investigator may detect binding without functional activation/repression of regulatory elements <italic>in vitro</italic>. The lack of demonstrated cooperation of DLX1 with DLX2 to activate the MI56 enhancer reporter gene suggests that DLX1 and DLX2 may have some non-overlapping functions during striatal neuronogenesis. These results support the functional differences observed between <italic>Dlx</italic> paralogs in <italic>Dlx</italic>1, <italic>Dlx</italic>2 and <italic>Dlx</italic>1/<italic>Dlx</italic>2 null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c12">12</xref>).</p><p>In the retina, DLX2 and DLX1 expression extends throughout embryogenesis, with DLX2 expressed in the adult. DLX1 expression resembles DLX2 to P0 but is significantly decreased postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c6">6</xref>). At P0, the binding of DLX2 but not DLX1 to the MI56 may reflect decreased DLX1 protein levels in the neonatal retina. Alternatively, binding of DLX1 to the MI56 <italic>in vivo</italic> may not be detected if the specific DLX1 antibody is not sufficiently sensitive to detect low levels of DLX1 protein or able to immunoprecipitate small quantities of DLX1 homeoprotein&#x02013;MI56 enhancer DNA complexes. &#x003b2;-gal antibody may be more sensitive than X-gal histochemistry in detecting <italic>lacZ</italic> expression since more cells are marked with the antibody at P0 and in the adult (data not shown). This could also reflect the possibility that the experimental conditions for tissue fixation and penetration of solutions may be less favorable for detection of the chromogenic substrate. The expression of <italic>lacZ</italic> in adult but minimally in neonatal retina is consistent with peak levels of <italic>Dlx</italic>5 and/or <italic>Dlx</italic>6 expression occurring after P0. Binding of DLX2 to the enhancer in retinal tissue at P0 may also reflect the relative sensitivity of the ChIP assay compared with routine histological detection, rather than false positive results. The ChIP protocol, which uses tissue from multiple embryonic or postnatal tissues to obtain 1&#x02013;2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> cells prior to processing and subsequent PCR amplification, is more likely to detect target sequences that are minimally expressed in developing tissues at a specific temporal or spatial coordinate. The retinal phenotype of the <italic>Dlx</italic>5/6 double knockout may be predicted to be more subtle than the <italic>Dlx</italic>1/2 null retina. Hence, unlike striatum, it may be helpful to perform ChIP at several time-points to obtain specific <italic>Dlx</italic> gene family targets in the developing and postnatal retina.</p><p>ChIP technology represented a major advance towards the identification of direct target genes of specific transcription factors, especially homeobox genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c29">29</xref>). The utilization of biochemical rather than genetic approaches, such as ChIP, provides several advantages. Identified target genes are directly downstream and derive from physiological homeodomain&#x02013;DNA complexes obtained <italic>in vivo.</italic> Isolated gDNA fragments may be from regulatory elements of known or novel genes. ChIP may be applied to diverse species, including <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates. Cross-linking preserves naturally existing (<italic>in situ</italic>) protein&#x02013;DNA interactions. Utilizing these methods, homeodomain targets have been isolated, including transcription factors, growth factors, adhesion molecules and secreted proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c31">31</xref>). The search for homeobox targets in vertebrates has not yielded as many targets as in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Although several candidates have been identified using <italic>in vitro</italic> and tissue culture methods, the significance of these interactions <italic>in vivo</italic> remains to be confirmed.</p><p>Tomotsune <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c24">24</xref>) used ChIP to identify a tumor suppressor gene and putative adhesion molecule as a downstream target of <italic>Hox-C8</italic> from mouse spinal cord, suggesting that it is possible to isolate other direct vertebrate homeobox gene targets. However, the ChIP methodology used by this group may have presented several technical obstacles for subsequent isolation of other homeobox gene targets. For example, cross-linking was performed overnight using 4&#x00025; PFA and the entire spinal cord was used as a tissue source rather than a region expressing high levels of <italic>Hox-C8</italic>. It is unclear whether the specific antibody they used had high affinity for this homeobox protein. Hence, many investigators have eschewed ChIP in favor of cDNA microarray or other techniques to find genes potentially regulated by their transcription factor of interest. Recently, ChIP has been successfully coupled with DNA microarray analysis. Weinmann <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c32">32</xref>) used human CpG microarrays probed with immunoprecipitated chromatin to rapidly identify target promoters for the transcription factor E2F. Hence, combining ChIP and microarray technologies may improve both the efficiency and scale of standard ChIP approaches.</p><p>We have optimized the ChIP approach by reducing the concentration of the cross-linking reagent PFA and incubation time to preferentially obtain homeoprotein&#x02013;genomic DNA complexes from embryonic tissues <italic>in situ</italic>. The polyclonal antisera to DLX1 and DLX2 have been subjected to a rigorous affinity purification process and are sensitive and highly specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c4">4</xref>). In addition, chromatin is derived from nuclear extracts derived from tissues where peak developmental expression of DLX1 and DLX2 occurs in distinct anatomical regions, enriching for the selection of <italic>Dlx</italic>1 and <italic>Dlx</italic>2 specific DNA target fragments. The identification of multiple <italic>Dlx</italic> target sequences <italic>in vivo</italic> will facilitate the elucidation of a consensus <italic>Dlx</italic> DNA binding site initially derived <italic>in vitro</italic> for <italic>Dlx</italic>3 by Feledy <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh233c25">25</xref>). Finally, the expression of novel <italic>Dlx</italic> gene targets identified by ChIP may be altered in the <italic>Dlx</italic>1/2 null mouse, providing further understanding of how <italic>Dlx</italic> genes function throughout development. By combining genetic and molecular approaches, we will identify other <italic>Dlx</italic>-dependent target genes that are critical effectors of forebrain and retinal development. In addition, this optimized ChIP approach can be used to isolate direct targets of other transcription factors during vertebrate development.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh233f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> (<bold>a</bold>) DLX2 expression in the developing forebrain and retina at E13.5.
