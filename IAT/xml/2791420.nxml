A neuropeptide named gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH, SIKPSAYLPLRF-NH<sub>2</sub>) which directly inhibits gonadotropin synthesis and release from the pituitary was recently identified in quail hypothalamus. Here we identify GnIH homologs in the human hypothalamus and characterize their distribution and biological activity. GnIH homologs were isolated from the human hypothalamus by immunoaffinity purification, and then identified as MPHSFANLPLRF-NH<sub>2</sub> (human RFRP-1) and VPNLPQRF-NH<sub>2</sub> (human RFRP-3) by mass spectrometry. Immunocytochemistry revealed GnIH-immunoreactive neuronal cell bodies in the dorsomedial region of the hypothalamus with axonal projections to GnRH neurons in the preoptic area as well as to the median eminence. RT-PCR and subsequent DNA sequencing of the PCR products identified human GnIH receptor (GPR147) mRNA expression in the hypothalamus as well as in the pituitary. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization further identified the expression of GPR147 mRNA in luteinizing hormone producing cells (gonadotropes). Human RFRP-3 has recently been shown to be a potent inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion in cultured sheep pituitary cells by inhibiting Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> mobilization. It also directly modulates GnRH neuron firing. The identification of two forms of GnIH (RFRP-1 and RFRP-3) in the human hypothalamus which targets human GnRH neurons and gonadotropes and potently inhibit gonadotropin in sheep models provides a new paradigm for the regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in man and a novel means for manipulating reproductive functions.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the primary stimulator of gonadotropin secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008400-Matsuo1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008400-Miyamoto1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

The human genome database revealed that a putative homolog of the GnIH precursor polypeptide gene is present in humans (GenBank NM_022150; 29), but the processed peptide products had not been identified until now. Because of several potential cleavage sites in the putative GnIH precursor polypeptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008400-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), there were various possible GnIH peptide products. Thus, based on the human genome, putative human RFRP-1 could be 12, 20, 24, 29, 37, 40, 44, 49 or 54 amino acids in length and human RFRP-3 could be 8 or 31 amino acids in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008400-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Hypothalamic tissue from adult men and women was used to purify and identify human RFRP peptides by immunoaffinity purification followed by MALDI-TOF MS.

The location of GnIH neuronal cell bodies were in general agreement to hamsters (dorsomedial hypothalamus; 23) and sheep (dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus; 26). GnIH-ir axon terminal like structures were observed in close proximity to GnRH neurons in the preoptic area suggesting the regulation of GnRH neurons by GnIH. The interaction of GnIH-ir fibers with GnRH neurons is consistent with results in birds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008400-Bentley1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008400-Ubuka3">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008400-Kriegsfeld1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> sheep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008400-Smith1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and monkey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008400-Ubuka5">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

GnIH-ir axons also projected to the neurosecretory zone of the median eminence suggesting that GnIH might also directly regulate pituitary function. The expression of the human GPR147 mRNA in the pituitary supports this notion. Moreover, <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization for GPR147 mRNA in conjunction with immunocytochemistry for human LH further showed the expression of GPR147 mRNA in gonadotropes of the adult human anterior pituitary. Accordingly, human GnIH homologs may regulate gonadotropin secretion by inhibiting GnRH neurons as well as directly acting on gonadotrope cells in the pituitary as was clearly demonstrated in isolated pituitary cells in the sheep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008400-Clarke1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008400-Sari1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our identification of RFRP-1 and RFRP-3 peptides in the human hypothalamus and the ICC demonstration of targeting GnRH neurons in the human hypothalamus along with the expression of GPR147 in human gonadotropes provide a cogent framework for RFRP regulation of human reproduction. The question arises as to whether the human RPRP peptides are biologically active and inhibit gonadotropins. Similarly, we studied the effects of human RFRP on the mouse gonadotrope L&#x003b2;T2 cell line but detected no effects on any signaling pathway. When we checked GPR147 expression by RT-PCR no products were detected in this immature gonadotrope cell line (data not shown). We detected inhibitory effects in human fetal pituitary cells, but these were inconsistent even though they exhibited robust gonadotropin responses to GnRH (data not shown). This variability may be due to the immaturity of the gonadotropes. However, human RFRP-3, which is identical in sequence to sheep RFRP-3, potently inhibits gonadotropin secretion <italic>in vivo</italic> in sheep and GnRH stimulation of gonadotropin secretion from cultured sheep pituitary cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008400-Clarke1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008400-Sari1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. This strongly suggests RFRP-3 would also be active in the direct inhibition of gonadotropin release from gonadotropes in man. The demonstration that RFRP regulates GnRH neuron firing and early gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008400-Wu1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008400-Anderson1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> suggests that the peptides may also be effective at this level in man. The question also arises as to whether RFRP-1 and RFRP-3 have similar or different functions. It appears from the large pain literature that they both bind GPR147 with similar affinity and recruit similar signalling pathways. Thus, the presence of two peptide products from the same gene may be a means for signal amplification.</p><p>The identification of novel RFamide-related peptides (RFRP-1 and RFRP-3) in the human hypothalamus and the demonstration that human RFRP-3 has potent inhibitory actions on gonadotropin secretion in animal models opens up new vistas for understanding the regulation of reproduction. Many factors such as stress, anorexia, diabetes, obesity and photoperiod inhibit gonadotropin secretion. The possible role of GnIH in mediating these effects has been implicated in animal models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008400-Ubuka4">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008400-Ubuka6">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008400-Kirby1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.

In view of its potent inhibition of gonadotropes, GnIH has the potential of an alternative or adjunct therapeutic agent to inhibit gonadotropins and steroid hormones. Thus this endogenous inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion has therapeutic potential in the treatment of hormone-dependent diseases such as precocious puberty, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatic and breast cancers. Human GnIH may also have potential as a novel contraceptive.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Human hypothalamus and pituitary tissue</title><p>Frozen and fixed adult human hypothalamus and pituitary tissue were obtained from Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center (Belmont, MA).
