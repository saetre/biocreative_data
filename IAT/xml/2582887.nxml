Arf GTPase-activating protein (GAP) catalyzed GTP hydrolysis in Arf1 triggers uncoating and is required for uptake of cargo molecules into vesicles. Three mammalian ArfGAPs are involved in COPI vesicle trafficking; however, their individual functions remain obscure. ArfGAP1 binds to membranes depending on their curvature. In this study, we show that ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 do not bind directly to membranes but are recruited via interactions with coatomer. In the presence of coatomer, ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 activities are comparable with or even higher than ArfGAP1 activity. Although previously speculated, our results now demonstrate a function for coatomer in ArfGAP-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis by Arf1. We suggest that ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 are coat protein&#x02013;dependent ArfGAPs, whereas ArfGAP1 has a more general function.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: ALPS, ArfGAP1 lipid packing sensory; Arf, ADP ribosylation factor; COP, coat protein complex; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; NRK, normal rat kidney.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Coat protein complex I (COPI) vesicles are involved in transport processes within the early secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bethune et al., 2006</xref>). For their biogenesis, the small GTPase ADP ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) in its GDP-bound form is recruited to the Golgi membrane by dimeric transmembrane proteins of the p24 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gommel et al., 2001</xref>) or by interaction with membrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Honda et al., 2005</xref>). The membrane-associated Arf guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1 catalyzes exchange of the bound GDP to GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>). Arf1-GTP dissociates from the p24 proteins and is inserted into the Golgi membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franco et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonny et al., 1997</xref>) as a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beck et al., 2008</xref>) to recruit the heptameric protein complex coatomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Palmer et al., 1993</xref>). Coatomer polymerization leads to the formation of a COPI-coated vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bremser et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reinhard et al., 1999</xref>). Arf GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) catalyze hydrolysis of the GTP bound to Arf1 followed by dissociation of the coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tanigawa et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cukierman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reinhard et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to this role in uncoating, GTP hydrolysis on Arf1 is essential for efficient uptake of cargo into vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nickel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Malsam et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pepperkok et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lanoix et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The ArfGAP family of cytosolic proteins is characterized by a well-conserved catalytical zinc finger domain, whereas their noncatalytical domains differ between subgroups of the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Randazzo and Hirsch, 2004</xref>). Two ArfGAPs have been implicated in COPI transport in yeast, Gcs1 and Glo3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poon et al., 1999</xref>). Both proteins provide overlapping functions and can restore single knockouts of the respective other ArfGAP, but a double knockout of Gcs1 and Glo3 is lethal. The mammalian homologue of Gcs1, ArfGAP1, was the first ArfGAP to be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cukierman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Makler et al., 1995</xref>), and its role in COPI trafficking has been studied intensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huber et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldberg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bigay et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2005</xref>). ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3, both mammalian homologues of Glo3, have been shown only recently to be involved in COPI vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frigerio et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with the findings in yeast, triple knockdowns in mammalian cells are lethal, whereas cells can survive when only ArfGAP1 or both ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 are silenced.</p><p>ArfGAP1, ArfGAP2, and ArfGAP3 show high sequence similarity within the very N-terminal catalytical domain. In ArfGAP1, two ArfGAP1 lipid packing sensory (ALPS) motifs have been identified within the noncatalytical domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bigay et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mesmin et al., 2007</xref>). ALPS motifs are unstructured in solution but form an amphipathic &#x003b1; helix once bound to highly curved membranes as present on a vesicle. Because of this binding behavior, ArfGAP1 displays curvature-dependent ArfGAP activity in vitro, a mechanism suggested to ensure high uncoating efficiency on vesicles, whereas basal activity on flat membranes is rather low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bigay et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2005</xref>). The noncatalytical domains of ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 differ from that of ArfGAP1 and show 50% overall sequence identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frigerio et al., 2007</xref>). There is evidence for an essential functional role of a highly conserved C-terminal motif, the Glo3 motif, which has not been further characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yahara et al., 2006</xref>). A recent study revealed that the noncatalytical domains of ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 interact with coatomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frigerio et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>A role of coatomer in ArfGAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis has been studied in different systems. A 100&#x02013;1,000-fold stimulatory effect of coatomer on GTP hydrolysis was described for the catalytical domain of ArfGAP1 when a soluble version of Arf1, N&#x00394;17Arf1, was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldberg, 1999</xref>). However, only very weak (less than twofold) stimulation by coatomer of full-length ArfGAP1 was found in an assay using full-length myristoylated Arf1 on Golgi membranes. In contrast, the activity of Glo3 was increased significantly (&#x0223c;50-fold) in the presence of coatomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Szafer et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Previous work on ArfGAP activities in COPI vesicle trafficking does not explain functionally the existence of several ArfGAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huber et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frigerio et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to characterize the three mammalian ArfGAPs involved in COPI vesicle trafficking with respect to their individual mechanisms. To this end, the recombinant proteins were expressed in insect cells, purified, and characterized. We find that, in contrast to ArfGAP1, ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 activities are dependent on coatomer. From our data, we conclude that coatomer is required for efficient recruitment of ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 to the Golgi membrane. Once recruited by coatomer, ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 exhibit a strikingly higher activity than ArfGAP1. Two different mechanisms regulate the activities of the three ArfGAPs: binding to membranes by ALPS motifs in the case of ArfGAP1 and recruitment via binding to coatomer in the case of ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3. These two mechanisms implicate different roles of the three ArfGAPs: ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 are the coat protein&#x02013;dependent ArfGAPs, whereas ArfGAP1 has COPI-dependent as well as COPI-independent functions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression and purification of recombinant ArfGAP1, ArfGAP2, and ArfGAP3 in Sf9 cells</title><p>Recombinant ArfGAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huber et al., 2001</xref>) as well as ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Singh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frigerio et al., 2007</xref>) have been described previously, however derived from different species and expression systems.

The concentrations of analyte determined in picomoles per milligram of total protein are illustrated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>. As a result, ArfGAP1 represents the majority of the three ArfGAPs involved in COPI trafficking with ArfGAP3 at a twofold and ArfGAP2 at a 10-fold lower concentration. Thus, the Glo3 homologues, ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3, together make up about one third of the three ArfGAPs. In a similar way, Arf1 and coatomer concentrations were determined. As expected, Arf1 occurs at the highest molar concentration of the components involved in COPI vesicle formation followed by coatomer and by the ArfGAPs, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>.

GAP activity was observed to be increased on highly curved membranes because of increased binding of the ALPS motif to the liposomes. Therefore, we compared the activities of ArfGAP1 with ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 in the same assay. GAP-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis in Arf1 was measured as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bigay et al. (2005)</xref> on liposomes of 200- or 30-nm diameter in a spectrofluorometer. The exchange of GDP for GTP on myristoylated full-length Arf1 is measured as an increase in tryptophan fluorescence. After the addition of ArfGAPs, fluorescence decreases because of GTP hydrolysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Activity of ArfGAP1, ArfGAP2, and ArfGAP3 on liposomes of different sizes.</bold> GAP activity was measured by following the change of tryptophan fluorescence in Arf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bigay et al., 2005</xref>).

After the addition of EDTA, the fluorescence increases because of the exchange of GDP for GTP in Arf1. The GTP state was stabilized by increasing the Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration at the indicated time points. ArfGAPs were added to a final concentration of 50 nM, 500 nM, or 1 &#x003bc;M, resulting in a decrease of tryptophan fluorescence caused by GTP hydrolysis. For comparative analysis, fluorescence at time point 0 was set to 0 arbitrary units (AU), fluorescence of the GTP state was normalized to 100 AU, and the shift in fluorescence resulting from tryptophan residues in the ArfGAP proteins was subtracted.

Under the same experimental conditions, we examined ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>). For both ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3, we observed a basal activity weaker by a factor of 5&#x02013;10 compared with ArfGAP1, although all three GAPs share a highly conserved catalytical domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frigerio et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, no influence of membrane curvature was observed, indicating the absence of an ALPS-like motif in the noncatalytical domains of ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3. At high concentrations of ArfGAP proteins, a decrease of fluorescence intensity below the initial level of Arf1-GDP was observed (as depicted for 1 &#x003bc;M ArfGAP2 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>).

Therefore, we next addressed the question by which mechanism ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 are recruited to the membrane if not by direct binding to the lipid bilayer. A promising candidate to mediate this binding was coatomer, the COP of COPI vesicles, because interaction with coatomer of ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frigerio et al., 2007</xref>). To investigate this possibility, we incubated Golgi membranes with ArfGAPs in the presence or absence of the coat proteins coatomer and Arf1. After centrifugation, the pelleted membranes were analyzed for bound proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>).</p><p>We observed binding of 20&#x02013;30% of the provided ArfGAP1 to Golgi membranes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, lane 9). The amount of bound protein is not affected by the presence of Arf1-GTP&#x003b3;S (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, lane 10), and only a small increase, by less than a factor of two, is found when coatomer was provided additionally (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, lane 11).

However, binding is significantly increased when coatomer is bound to the Golgi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, lane 11). These results are consistent with previous findings that ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 bind to coatomer, as shown in pull-down assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Watson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frigerio et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In summary, these results suggest that the three ArfGAPs are recruited to the Golgi membrane in comparable amounts but by different mechanisms.

In all three cases, a 10&#x000d7; higher concentration (10 nM) resulted in almost complete loss of vesicle signals, whereas a 10&#x000d7; lower concentration (0.1 nM) was not sufficient to cause significant reduction of vesicle yield (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>).</p><p>As the assay was performed with Golgi membranes in the presence of coatomer, all three ArfGAPs should be recruited to the membrane (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>), where they can act on their substrate Arf1-GTP.

This may either reflect the presence of additional ArfGAP effectors on the Golgi or preferential coating at sites with high curvature. In summary, when analyzed in the COPI-budding assay, the three ArfGAPs showed comparable activities, whereas in the uncoating assay, the activities of ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 are markedly higher.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Although a role of ArfGAP1 in COPI vesicle trafficking has been described in some detail in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cukierman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Makler et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huber et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldberg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bigay et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2005</xref>), an involvement of the two human homologues of Glo3, ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3, in COPI-mediated transport was reported only recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frigerio et al., 2007</xref>). Studies in yeast point to an important role of Glo3 in retrograde transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dogic et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lewis et al., 2004</xref>). To elucidate functions of the three mammalian ArfGAPs in COPI trafficking, we analyzed their ultrastructural localizations and biochemical properties. We find that ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 localized across the Golgi stacks in a weak but significant gradient from the cis to the trans side. ArfGAP1 is distributed quite evenly within the Golgi apparatus, which is in good accordance with a wider range of effectors such as complexes with golgins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Drin et al., 2008</xref>). Such a broader range of functions is also consistent with the higher concentration of this enzyme when compared with ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3. We show that in contrast to ArfGAP1, ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 recruitment to the membrane is dependent on coatomer. In the presence of coatomer, ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 display even higher activities in uncoating in a liposomal system as well as on Golgi membranes compared with ArfGAP1. In vesicle formation assays, all three ArfGAPs show inhibition at very low catalytic concentrations.</p><p>Collectively, we find that regulation of ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 activities is based on a mechanism distinct from ArfGAP1, and our results suggest that the roles of the Glo3 homologues in COPI trafficking differ from those of ArfGAP1.</p><sec><title>A role of coatomer in ArfGAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis</title><p>An effect of coatomer on GTP hydrolysis catalyzed by ArfGAPs has been investigated before, yet its precise role is not clear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldberg (1999)</xref> analyzed a truncated soluble form of Arf1, N&#x00394;17Arf1, with the catalytical domain of ArfGAP1 in the absence of membranes. In this assay, ArfGAP1 catalytical domain is present at very high concentrations almost stoichiometric to Arf1, suggesting a very low activity of ArfGAP1 in solution. Addition of coatomer to this system results in a strong (up to 1,000-fold) stimulation of GTP hydrolysis, indicating that in solution, Arf1-GTP, when bound to coatomer, represents a better substrate for the ArfGAP. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Szafer et al. (2000)</xref> investigated ArfGAP1 activity in a liposomal system with the full-length protein and myristoylated full-length Arf1. In this assay, GTP hydrolysis activity is observed at a much lower concentration of ArfGAP, in the nanomolar range. This high activity is not further stimulated by the addition of coatomer. This is consistent with an ALPS-dependent binding to membranes of ArfGAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bigay et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2005</xref>) that is not expected to be further enhanced by coatomer. Likewise, on Golgi membranes, only a very weak stimulation of ArfGAP1 activity by coatomer was observed. In contrast, Glo3 activity is highly stimulated by coatomer on Golgi membranes but only weakly on liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Szafer et al., 2001</xref>). In light of the data presented in this study, this lack of stimulation on liposomes could be explained by the absence of p24 tails that are required for efficient recruitment of coatomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bremser et al., 1999</xref>) and thereby of Glo3 to the membrane.</p><p>A direct interaction of the yeast Glo3 but not Gcs1 with the coatomer complex has been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eugster et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lewis et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, the noncatalytical domains of both Glo3 and ArfGAP2 were found to bind coatomer in almost stoichiometric amounts, as shown by pull-down assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frigerio et al., 2007</xref>). Collectively, our data explain the role of coatomer in ArfGAP-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis. It seems that coatomer does not provide a catalytical cofactor activity but simply acts as a binding partner of Glo3 homologues for efficient recruitment to the membrane. ArfGAP1 acts independently of coatomer, as it binds to the lipid bilayer by its ALPS domains.</p></sec><sec><title>Roles of ArfGAPs in COPI trafficking</title><p>The three ArfGAPs are likely to have overlapping functions and are probably able to substitute for each other, as can be deduced from knockdown experiments in yeast and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frigerio et al., 2007</xref>). However, the two differential modes of membrane binding, coatomer independent in the case of ArfGAP1 and coatomer dependent in the case of ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3, implicate different roles of the three enzymes. From our data, we conclude that ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 are coat protein&#x02013;dependent ArfGAPs, whereas ArfGAP1 plays a more general role, as its activity does not depend on coatomer. ArfGAP1 has been shown to be involved in COPI-dependent as well as COPI-independent events, such as a regulation of an asymmetrical mode of tethering between flat and curved membranes of the golgin GMAP-210 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Drin et al., 2008</xref>), further supporting differential functions of the three ArfGAPs. The strictly coatomer-dependent activities of ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 are reminiscent of the mechanism of coat-controlled specificity of GTP hydrolysis that is also found for the COPII and clathrin coats. The Sar1 GAP activity is mediated by a subunit of the COPII coat itself, Sec23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yoshihisa et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bi et al., 2002</xref>). In clathrin-dependent trafficking, direct specific interactions of the ArfGAPs AGAP1 and AGAP2 with the adapter protein complexes AP-1 and AP-3, respectively, have been shown, ensuring site-specific regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nie et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2005</xref>). Whether ArfGAP2 or ArfGAP3 is bound to coatomer already in the cytosol and recruited en bloc with the complex or whether coatomer is bound first and recruits the ArfGAPs in a second step cannot be distinguished at this time. However, the light-scattering data show that ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 can be recruited after coatomer has attached to the membrane, and their specific activities in this uncoating assay are markedly higher than that of ArfGAP1. Individual roles of ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 will be the subject of future work. One could imagine that the two proteins interact differentially with coatomer isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Futatsumori et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wegmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moelleken et al., 2007</xref>) and therefore might discriminate between different subpopulations of COPI vesicles comparable with AGAP1 and AGAP2 that distinguish between the adapter protein complexes AP-1 and AP-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nie et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, once coatomer isoforms are available, questions as to the functional differences of ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 can be addressed directly.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Expression and purification of recombinant ArfGAPs</title><p>Rat cDNAs (Open Biosystems) coding for ArfGAP1, ArfGAP2, and ArfGAP3 were amplified via PCR and cloned into the pFastBac HTb vector (Invitrogen) via BamHI and XhoI restriction sites.
