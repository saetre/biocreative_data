The Cambridge risk score (area under curve 0.72, 0.69 to 0.76) and the Framingham offspring risk score (area under curve 0.78, 0.75 to 0.82) led to better discrimination of cases than did genotype based tests.

The addition of genotypes to phenotype based risk models produced only minimal improvement in accuracy of risk estimation assessed by recalibration and, at best, a minor net reclassification improvement. The major translational application of the currently known common, small effect genetic variants influencing susceptibility to type 2 diabetes is likely to come from the insight they provide on causes

year period.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> This may rise with the threatened epidemic of type 2 diabetes, driven partly by the increase in obesity, which is projected to result in a prevalence of type 2 diabetes worldwide of 366 million by 2030 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.who.int/diabetes/facts/world_figures/en/">www.who.int/diabetes/facts/world_figures/en/</ext-link>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> This will place a considerable burden on healthcare systems, as type 2 diabetes is a common cause of renal failure and blindness and increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and mortality.</p><p>Estimation of people&#x02019;s absolute risk of coronary heart disease, based on the Framingham, PROCAM, and QRISK equations,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> has become established as a means of targeting preventive interventions to those at highest risk. Earlier risk functions for estimating the risk of type 2 diabetes required an oral glucose tolerance test, which is impractical for screening large numbers of people. Despite evidence that some interventions prevent or delay development of type 2 diabetes in people at high risk,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> the prediction of risk of new onset type 2 diabetes has not been part of routine clinical practice.</p><p>Two risk scores were published in 2007 and 2008. They were based on demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical measures but did not require information from an oral glucose tolerance test. The Cambridge type 2 diabetes risk score is a pragmatic algorithm incorporating the routinely assessed variables age, sex, drug treatment, family history of type 2 diabetes, body mass index, and smoking status.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> In validating this risk score in the EPIC-Norfolk study, Rahman et al reported that the model performed well in distinguishing cases of later type 2 diabetes (discrimination), with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.75 (where 1 indicates perfect discrimination and 0.5 indicates no discrimination).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> The Framingham offspring type 2 diabetes risk score also makes use of routinely collected clinical data and biochemical measures including age, sex, parental history of type 2 diabetes, body mass index, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and fasting glucose. This model also provided good discrimination of incident cases of diabetes, with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.85.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> Notably, the addition of other non-routinely collected measures of glucose metabolism such as the homoeostasis model assessment, fasting insulin, or two hour oral glucose tolerance test did not improve the risk prediction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></p><p>Both risk algorithms include information on family history of type 2 diabetes. However, family history reflects shared environment as well as genotype, and whereas biochemical and non-biochemical features associated with type 2 diabetes alter with age, genetic predisposition is determined at conception and fixed through life. Identifying genotypes that alter susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, and using them on their own or in combination with existing phenotype based risk algorithms, might therefore improve prediction of risk, particularly if genotypes identify differences in the activity of pathways unmeasured in non-genetic risk models.</p><p>Large case-control studies using whole genome arrays of single nucleotide polymorphisms (genome-wide association studies) have identified multiple common risk alleles for type 2 diabetes, many of which reside in or near genes not previously implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> in addition to confirming loci identified by previous candidate gene studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> Around 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with type 2 diabetes have been identified, for which the findings from the discovery study have been independently replicated in additional datasets and the effect sizes evaluated precisely by meta-analysis (as detailed in web table A).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref> For all loci identified to date, effect sizes have been modest, with odds ratios for risk of type 2 diabetes ranging from 1.37 for single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene <italic>TCF7L2</italic> to 1.09 for those in the gene <italic>ADAMTS9</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref> raising the question of whether information on genotype would be useful for prediction of risk. Moreover, risk alleles have been discovered mainly by using case-control studies, which, although efficient for the discovery of disease associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, are suboptimal for evaluating their performance as predictors of risk. This is optimally assessed by genotyping the genetic markers in prospective studies of initially healthy people in whom cases of incident disease accrue over time. However, the study designs, the number of disease associated single nucleotide polymorphisms evaluated, the metrics used to evaluate predictive performance, and the methods used to compare the performance of genotype with non-genetic risk factors have been variable. Despite this, genetic tests for the prediction of type 2 diabetes have already become available in the commercial sector (for example, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.23andme.com">www.23andme.com</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.decodeme.com/">www.decodeme.com/</ext-link>).</p><p>In this study, we first compared the ability of two phenotype based risk algorithms, the Cambridge risk score and the Framingham offspring risk score,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> with genotype based risk models for the discrimination of incident cases of type 2 diabetes in the prospective Whitehall II study of civil servants in the United Kingdom. We then evaluated the effect of addition of genotypes to the two non-genetic risk algorithms on the ability to discriminate between people who developed type 2 diabetes and those who remained free of the disease. We further assessed the effect of adding genotype to the calibration of the risk models (which involves assessing the closeness of the observed event rate to the predicted risk in different risk categories) as well as reclassification (which assesses the extent to which addition of genetic information shifts people to categories of predicted risk that better reflect their eventual outcome).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Between 1985 and 1988, all civil servants aged between 35 and 55 years in 20 departments in central London were invited to a medical examination at their workplace.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> With 73% participation, the cohort included 10&#x02009;308 participants at entry to the study.

For this analysis, phase 3 (when an oral glucose tolerance test was done for the first time) serves as the baseline. Biochemical screening was repeated at phase 5 (1997-9) and phase 7 (2003-4). Additional questionnaire-only phases assessed diabetes status at phase 4 (1995-6) and phase 6 (2001). Of the baseline participants, 6156 participated in phase 7 screening, at which DNA was collected.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical characteristics</title><p>We measured age, sex, body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, lipids, C reactive protein, fibrinogen, glucose, smoking, and coronary heart disease and diabetes status at baseline. Weight was measured in underwear to the nearest 0.1 kg on Soehnle electronic scales. We measured height in bare feet to the nearest 1 mm by using a stadiometer with the participant standing erect with head in the Frankfort plane. We calculated body mass index as weight (kilograms)/height (metres) squared. We measured waist circumference, taken as the smallest circumference at or below the costal margin, with participants unclothed in the standing position by using a fibreglass tape measure at 600 g tension. We measured systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure twice in the sitting position after five minutes&#x02019; rest with the Hawksley random zero sphygmomanometer. We took the average of the two readings to be the measured blood pressure. We took venous blood in the fasting state or at least five hours after a light, fat free breakfast, before a two hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test was done. Serum for lipid analyses was refrigerated at &#x02212;4&#x000b0;C and assayed within 72 hours. We used a Cobas Fara centrifugal analyser (Roche Diagnostics System, Nutley, NJ) to measure cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. We measured high density lipoprotein cholesterol by precipitating non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol with dextran sulfate-magnesium chloride with the use of a centrifuge and measuring cholesterol in the supernatant fluid. We used the Friedewald formula to calculate low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration.

One potential application is the use of genetic information to help predict susceptibility to disease in initially healthy people, so as to focus preventive interventions on those at the highest risk of future disease.

The inclusion of genetic information in the risk models did not improve the discrimination of cases of type 2 diabetes, and nor did it provide clinically important improvement in the accuracy of these models when assessed by calibration. The addition of genetic data to phenotype based risk models also provided minimal net reclassification improvement. The addition of genetic information resulted in the reassortment of people into different risk categories, but not all the shifts were helpful. Although some eventual cases were upgraded to higher risk categories, almost as many had their risk downgraded, and the opposite was true for many of those who remained healthy.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with the nine previous published reports of 10 study populations (table 6<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl6"/>),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref> even though the number and range of genotypes and the phenotype based risk models used for prediction varied across studies (see Forrest plots at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ucl.ac.uk/genetic-epidemiology/WebMaterial">www.ucl.ac.uk/genetic-epidemiology/WebMaterial</ext-link>). All models included age, body mass index, and sex, and much of the predictive information in any phenotype based model is likely to be encompassed in these terms.</p><p>The relations shown in figure 2<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"/> and the web figure illustrate one reason for the poor predictive performance of a panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with common diseases. Although people carrying multiple risk alleles are at more extreme risk of type 2 diabetes than those carrying fewer copies, they represent only a small proportion of the population, because the inheritance of each risk allele is an independent event&#x02014;the probability of inheriting multiple risk alleles is a function of the frequency of each allele in the population. For example, the probability of inheriting 10 independent risk alleles with frequencies around 0.3 is 0.3<sup>10</sup> (about 6&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>). People with an intermediate number of risk alleles would therefore be expected to account for the major portion of cases of type 2 diabetes, because of the large number of people at intermediate risk in the population. This explains the substantial overlap of the distribution of risk alleles among people who developed diabetes and those who remained disease-free, which makes it difficult to set a cut-off point of a gene count (or genetic risk function) that reliably discriminates later cases of type 2 diabetes. Although genetic tests for type 2 diabetes, based on a subset of the alleles studied here, can already be purchased in the commercial sector, our findings suggest that much more rigorous evaluation of their use as a health technology is needed before such tests should be adopted by healthcare organisations.</p><p>As a technology, however, genotype based tests have several inherent advantages over non-genetic tests. Genotype based assays are cheap, have high fidelity, and can be multiplexed, in contrast to multiple phenotypic risk factors and biomarkers, many of which require different methods for their measurement, and which are more affected by biological variability and measurement error than is genotyping. Moreover, because genotype is invariant it offers the prospect of risk assessment from much earlier in life than is possible with phenotype based tests. In the case of cardiovascular risk factors, evidence shows that greater benefits accrue from earlier intervention among people at higher risk (for example, in the form of smoking cessation or cholesterol lowering).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref> The findings of our study should thus not lead to the premature dismissal of genotype based risk prediction as a health technology. Rather, increased efforts should be made to understand the strengths and limitations of such tests as well as their optimal place in health care, a conclusion highlighted in the recent House of Lords Science and Technology Committee&#x02019;s report on genomic medicine (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldselect/ldsctech/107/107i.pdf">www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldselect/ldsctech/107/107i.pdf</ext-link>).</p><sec><title>Limitations of study</title><p>Some limitations of our study should be noted. Although prospective, the Whitehall II study is workplace based and therefore not necessarily representative of the general population. However, the excellent performance in Whitehall II of the non-genetic risk functions for type 2 diabetes, both of which were developed and validated in general populations, suggests that this is unlikely to bias our conclusions substantially. Moreover, our findings are consistent with those of prospective studies set in representative general populations. Our findings are also not generalisable to people of non-European ancestry, who we excluded from this analysis. Although DNA was collected some time after baseline, which could have introduced a survivor bias, we think that this is unlikely to have affected our results given the modest effect of the alleles we studied on risk of diabetes and the long natural history of the development of the life threatening complications of diabetes.</p><p>The two risk tools studied, based on non-genetic markers, performed better than genotype based tests despite the fact that the models, which were developed in different datasets, were not specifically recalibrated for the Whitehall II population. The common diabetes associated single nucleotide polymorphisms we studied might have greater incremental value in the prediction of type 2 diabetes when evaluated against some of the other validated risk models. However, we chose the Framingham and Cambridge risk scores because they are contemporary (which could be important, given the recent increase in the incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes), were developed in populations with a similar profile to the Whitehall II participants, and were based on studies set in the United States and the UK, where many of the genetic studies were done. Moreover, both include variables that are routinely measured in clinical practice. We did not evaluate QDRisk, which is based on routinely collected primary care data (including deprivation scores, ethnicity, and current drug treatment for hypertension or cardiovascular disease and corticosteroid use), which was reported during the preparation of this manuscript.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref></p><p>Because part of the information included in the family history component of a risk score will reflect common genotypes, this may have undermined the incremental value of genetic information for risk prediction. However, the variants we studied explain only a small proportion of the familial aggregation of diabetes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref> Whether genotypes have greater predictive utility in particular categories of patient (such as among leaner people or those of a particular ancestry) could be assessed by pooling participant level data from a large number of prospective studies with the relevant information to ensure adequate power. Our current analysis is limited to the 20 common risk alleles for type 2 diabetes identified by large association or genome-wide studies. However, sequence variants of intermediate frequency but larger effect size are likely to be uncovered by future research, so our interpretation on the predictive utility of genotype should be regarded as interim. Moreover, as the actual causal variants at each gene/region remain for the most part uncertain, the predictive utility of genetic markers may also have been underestimated.</p><p>Our conclusions about the performance of genetic testing for type 2 diabetes are confined to the use of single common alleles at each locus. Other common risk alleles are likely to exist at the same genetic loci (including the causal variants), which could provide additional information relevant to prediction. Our conclusions are also not transferrable to other common diseases. For example, genetic variants underlying the susceptibility to age related macular degeneration have been identified, at least one of which is both common and large in its effect on risk.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref> We previously examined the predictive utility of a common single nucleotide polymorphism associated with the risk of coronary heart disease at the 9p23.1 chromosomal locus (rs10757274) when added to a risk function that included variables incorporated in the Framingham coronary heart disease risk equation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref> Although this genotype added minimally to the ability of the Framingham risk score to discriminate future events, improving the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve by only 3%, it did significantly improve reclassification of risk of coronary heart disease, albeit modestly. Moreover, for some disorders, including age related macular degeneration, few if any non-genetic biomarkers or risk factors exist that can be used to estimate risk of future disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Phenotype based risk models (the Framingham offspring and Cambridge risk scores) provided greater discrimination for type 2 diabetes than did models based on 20 common independently inherited alleles associated with risk of type 2 diabetes.
