In the current study, we developed a protocol for long-term culture of intact mouse retinas, which allows retinal circadian rhythms to be monitored in real time as luminescence rhythms from a PERIOD2::LUCIFERASE (PER2::LUC) clock gene reporter. With this in vitro assay, we studied the characteristics and location within the retina of circadian PER2::LUC rhythms, the influence of major retinal neurotransmitters, and the resetting of the retinal circadian clock by light. Retinal PER2::LUC rhythms were routinely measured from whole-mount retinal explants for 10 d and for up to 30 d. Imaging of vertical retinal slices demonstrated that the rhythmic luminescence signals were concentrated in the inner nuclear layer. Interruption of cell communication via the major neurotransmitter systems of photoreceptors and ganglion cells (melatonin and glutamate) and the inner nuclear layer (dopamine, acetylcholine, GABA, glycine, and glutamate) did not disrupt generation of retinal circadian PER2::LUC rhythms, nor did interruption of intercellular communication through sodium-dependent action potentials or connexin 36 (cx36)-containing gap junctions, indicating that PER2::LUC rhythms generation in the inner nuclear layer is likely cell autonomous. However, dopamine, acting through D1 receptors, and GABA, acting through membrane hyperpolarization and casein kinase, set the phase and amplitude of retinal PER2::LUC rhythms, respectively. Light pulses reset the phase of the in vitro retinal oscillator and dopamine D1 receptor antagonists attenuated these phase shifts. Thus, dopamine and GABA act at the molecular level of PER proteins to play key roles in the organization of the retinal circadian clock.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="special"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The circadian clock in the mammalian retina regulates many retinal functions, and its output modulates the central circadian clock in the brain. Details about the cellular location and neural regulation of the mammalian retinal circadian clock remain unclear, however, largely due to the difficulty of maintaining long-term culture of adult mammalian retina and the lack of an ideal experimental measure of the retinal clock. We have circumvented these limitations by developing a protocol for long-term culture of intact mouse retinas to monitor circadian rhythms of clock gene expression in real time. Using this protocol, we have localized expression of molecular retinal circadian rhythms to the inner nuclear layer. We find molecular retinal rhythms generation is independent of many forms of signaling from photoreceptors and ganglion cells, or major forms of neural communication within the inner nuclear layer, and have characterized light-induced resetting of the retinal clock. Retinal dopamine and GABA, although not necessary for the generation of molecular retinal rhythms, were revealed to regulate the phase and amplitude of retinal molecular rhythms, respectively, with dopamine participating in light-induced resetting. Our data indicate that dopamine and GABA play prominent roles in the organization of the retinal circadian clock.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Long-term culture of mouse retinas reveals a circadian clock in the inner retina that can be reset by light and is regulated by the neurotransmitters dopamine and GABA.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Ruan G-X, Allen GC, Yamazaki S, McMahon DG (2008) An autonomous circadian clock in the inner mouse retina regulated by dopamine and GABA.

In contrast, if the observed suppression of PER2::LUC luminescence rhythms during GABA application did not have an effect on the core clock, but merely on luminescence output, then the phase of restored rhythms should be predicted by the projected phase of the baseline rhythm obtained prior to treatment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060249-g009">Figure 9</xref>C shows the peak times of retinal PER2::LUC rhythms following GABA treatment and washout at the specified time intervals.

None of the major neurotransmitter systems in photoreceptors (melatonin and glutamate), ganglion cells (glutamate), or the inner nuclear layer (dopamine, acetylcholine, GABA, glycine, and glutamate) was required to support generation of retinal circadian PER2::LUC rhythms, nor was intercellular communication through sodium-dependent action potentials and cx36-containing gap junctions, although dopamine and GABA exhibited important effects on retinal PER2::LUC rhythms. A question that arises for interpretation of these negative findings regarding cellular communication is the duration over which pharmacological treatments were effective in vitro. For GABA agonists and antagonists, it is clear that they are effective for at least 7 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060249-g004">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060249-g007">7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060249-g008">8</xref>). For many other target transmitter systems, we have included genetic or chemical alternative tests that mitigate against this concern. For example, melatonin has been depleted genetically, as well as manipulated pharmacologically; dopamine has been depleted chemically, as well as manipulated pharmacologically; and gap junctional communication through the principal neural connexin, cx36, has been lesioned genetically to complement pharmacological disruption of electrical synapses. All of these alternative manipulations gave negative results consistent with the pharmacology.

Thus, we cannot exclude all possibility that these transmitter systems contribute to circadian rhythms generation in the retina; however, the consistent results we have obtained with overlapping types of treatments suggest that these negative results are robust. We also cannot rule out the possibility that multiple transmitter systems play redundant roles, or the possibility that some untested neurochemical signals are critical, but our data do exclude previous models of retinal circadian organization in which a limited population of cells using one of the modulatory neurotransmitters acts as a pacemaker for all retinal neurons, such as the 500 dopaminergic amacrine cells in each retina driving all other retinal oscillator cells through dopamine secretion, or the photoreceptors driving all other retinal oscillators through melatonin release &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060249-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Regulation of the Inner Retinal Circadian Clock by Light and Dopamine</title><p>It is well established that dopamine and melatonin are important neurochemical messengers of the retinal circadian clock that act at multiple sites within the retinal circuitry to shape retinal function into &#x0201c;day&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;night&#x0201d; states &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060249-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060249-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060249-b066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060249-b067">67</xref>&#x0005d;.

Dopamine transmission stimulated by excitatory light input from M-cones via ON bipolar cells and/or from intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) likely acts to phase-shift retinal circadian oscillators and reinforce the rising phase of the &#x0201c;day&#x0201d; state of the retinal clock. At night (i.e., molecularly, roughly the falling phase of PER protein rhythms), excitatory input from OFF bipolar cells enhances the activity of GABA, which suppresses rhythmic amplitude of PER oscillations through the GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors and facilitates the molecular resetting effects of dopamine. In addition, endogenous GABA is proposed to reinforce the falling phase of PER rhythms through fostering degradation of accumulated PER protein.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0060249.g011"/></fig><p>Future studies employing our in vitro retinal explant culture system and other strategies can test our working hypothesis regarding the organization of the mammalian retinal circadian clock, and further elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of retinal circadian clocks and their influence on visual function. The highly ordered and well-characterized property of retinal circuitry will facilitate elucidation of the general principles of the circadian pacemaking system.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals.</title><p><italic>mPer2<sup>Luc</sup></italic> knockin mice, which initially were on a 129SvEv X C57BL/6J genetic background &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060249-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;, were maintained as a continuous backcross to C57BL/6J for 13 generations.
