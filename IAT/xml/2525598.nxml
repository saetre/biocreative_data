We examined the peripheral immune system and found widespread evidence of innate immune activation detectable in plasma throughout the course of HD. Interleukin 6 levels were increased in HD gene carriers with a mean of 16 years before the predicted onset of clinical symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the earliest plasma abnormality identified in HD. Monocytes from HD subjects expressed mutant huntingtin and were pathologically hyperactive in response to stimulation, suggesting that the mutant protein triggers a cell-autonomous immune activation. A similar pattern was seen in macrophages and microglia from HD mouse models, and the cerebrospinal fluid and striatum of HD patients exhibited abnormal immune activation, suggesting that immune dysfunction plays a role in brain pathology. Collectively, our data suggest parallel central nervous system and peripheral pathogenic pathways of immune activation in HD.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: AUC, area under the curve; B2M, &#x003b2;-2-microglobulin; CNS, central nervous system; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; HD, Huntington's disease; QPCR, quantitative PCR; ROC, receiver operating characteristic; TFC, total functional capacity; UHDRS, unified HD rating scale; YAC, yeast artificial chromosome.</p></fn><fn><p>M.

The mutant protein causes neuronal dysfunction and death resulting in the cardinal disease features of movement disorder, cognitive decline, and psychiatric symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Huntingtin is expressed ubiquitously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>), and HD includes several abnormalities outside the central nervous system (CNS), including up-regulation of immune proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). The interactions between CNS pathology and changes detectable in peripheral tissues in HD are poorly understood but may be of importance in measuring or slowing disease progression. We previously demonstrated evidence of immune activation in peripheral plasma in manifest HD using proteomic profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), but no significant differences between controls and premanifest mutation carriers have previously been shown.</p><p>The nature of the immune activation in HD remains incompletely explored. It is not known whether the innate or adaptive arm of the immune system, or both, is activated in HD, and the alterations in each immunomodulatory cytokine at each disease stage are unknown. The cause of the immune activation peripherally is also unknown. IL-6, which triggers the acute phase response, is produced primarily by monocytes and lymphocytes, but this could be due to dysfunction of these cells caused by expression of mutant huntingtin (i.e., a cell-autonomous effect) or in response to inflammation-triggering events outside these cells, such as huntingtin-induced tissue damage or the mutant protein itself being interpreted as an antigen (i.e., non&#x02013;cell-autonomous pathways). Of interest in this respect is the finding that the I&#x003ba;B kinase/NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway that triggers IL-6 release is up-regulated by mutant huntingtin, and this may contribute to neurotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>).</p><p>Critically, the relationship between peripheral inflammation and CNS pathology in HD is unknown. Certain inflammatory proteins, such as complement proteins and clusterin, are also up-regulated both peripherally and in the brain in HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). In vivo imaging, in vitro and postmortem studies have shown that microglia, the CNS counterpart of macrophages, are activated in premanifest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>) and manifest HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), that microglial activation correlates with disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), and that mutant huntingtin is expressed in microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Thus, inflammation is an established, though incompletely understood, feature of HD with likely pathogenic importance. Inflammatory changes in the CNS and peripheral tissues in HD may be due to independent effects of mutant huntingtin in both compartments, causing analogous derangements centrally and peripherally; or inflammatory activation may begin peripherally and spread to the CNS, or vice versa, through the passage of immunomodulatory molecules across the blood&#x02013;brain barrier.</p><p>Insights into CNS and peripheral immune system interactions in HD may provide new biomarkers and improve knowledge of key pathogenic mechanisms, possibly leading to novel therapeutic approaches. The present work seeks to elucidate further the nature of the peripheral inflammatory activation in HD through quantification of levels of key inflammatory and immunomodulatory molecules in human plasma, and serum from three different mouse models of HD. To investigate possible links between peripheral inflammation and neuronal dysfunction, we examined correlations between individual inflammatory molecules and clinical features of HD. We used targeted transcription profiling to examine expression of key immunomodulatory proteins in the HD striatum to determine whether the inflammatory activation seen peripherally is mirrored in the CNS. We examined expression of huntingtin in its WT and mutant forms in human monocytes to investigate the possibility that the immune activation is due to a disease-related cell-autonomous dysfunction of these cells. We confirmed this with functional studies of human monocytes, and macrophages and microglia from HD mouse models, demonstrating that there is disease-related dysfunction of CNS and peripheral inflammatory cells in HD.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>We collected 194 plasma samples from HD mutation carriers ranging from premanifest to moderate HD and from control subjects (Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080178/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080178/DC1</ext-link>) and quantified levels of key inflammatory and immunomodulatory molecules using multiplex sandwich ELISAs and single radial immunodiffusion assays. We found an altered profile of cytokine levels in HD patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The most striking increases across subject groups from controls to progressing disease were in IL-6 and IL-8 (P &#x0003c; 0.0001 in each case). In addition, IL-4, IL-10, and TNF-&#x003b1; levels increased significantly with disease progression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Moreover, IL-6 levels were significantly increased in premanifest subjects with an estimated mean of 16 yr until motor onset (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Interestingly, the cytokines that were increased earliest in the disease course (IL-6 and IL-8) are involved in the innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). IL-10 and IL-4, antiinflammatory cytokines involved in the adaptive immune response, increased significantly in moderate stage disease. There was no difference in levels of Igs (IgG, IgA, or IgM) at any disease stage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), arguing against widespread activation of the adaptive humoral immune system.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Altered immune profile peripherally in HD.</bold> (A) Multiplex ELISA quantification of cytokine levels in plasma from HD patients (premanifest, early and moderate HD stages) compared with control subjects.

Plasma IL-8 levels increased markedly with disease progression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and correlated with clinical measures of HD.

We used stepwise logistic regression analysis to construct receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves that demonstrated a strong ability of combinations of plasma cytokine levels to discriminate between disease groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). We found that a combination of IL-6, IL-10, and IL-5 best discriminated between premanifest HD and controls with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81. A combination of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 best discriminated all HD expansion carriers (premanifest and manifest) from controls (AUC 0.82). IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 together best discriminated between premanifest and manifest HD patients (AUC 0.85).</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>ROC curves demonstrating the ability of different combinations of plasma cytokine levels to discriminate between subject groups.</bold> In a ROC curve plot, the &#x0201c;true positive&#x0201d; diagnosis rate (sensitivity) is plotted against the &#x0201c;false positive&#x0201d; diagnosis rate (1-specificity) for a test with a binary outcome. The AUC summarizes the discrimination of the test, i.e., its ability to classify cases correctly. A perfect test would have an AUC of 1; a worthless test would have an AUC of 0.5. AUC values may be classified as follows: 0.9&#x02013;1, excellent; 0.8&#x02013;0.9, good; 0.7&#x02013;0.8, fair; 0.6&#x02013;0.7, poor; 0.5&#x02013;0.6, fail (reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). For the present analysis, optimum combinations were identified by stepwise logistic regression analysis using a threshold of P &#x0003d; 0.05 for each cytokine removed from the model. A combination of IL-6, IL-10, and IL-5 best discriminated between controls and premanifest HD; a combination of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 best discriminated manifest from premanifest HD; and a combination of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 best discriminated controls from HD gene carriers (both premanifest and manifest).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2051869f04"></graphic></fig><p>IL-6 triggers the acute phase response and is produced primarily by monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). To define the possible source of peripheral cytokines, we purified monocytes from whole blood from HD patients and control subjects by flow cytometric and magnetic sorting. Using RT&#x02013;quantitative PCR (QPCR), we found monocytes from HD patients to express mutant huntingtin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Human monocytes express WT and mutant huntingtin.</bold> (A) RT-QPCR studies of human monocytes obtained by flow cytometry demonstrated huntingtin expression in 100% of monocyte samples tested from controls (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 2) and HD patients (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 3).

Mutant huntingtin thus appears to produce functional overactivity of monocytes. We stimulated isolated macrophages from the yeast artificial chromosome (YAC)128 mouse model of HD with LPS. Echoing the results seen in human HD monocytes, macrophages from the YAC128 responded with enhanced secretion of IL-6 in response to stimulation compared with macrophages from WT mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>). To test whether the presence of mutant huntingtin per se is sufficient to produce dysfunction, we then examined the response to LPS stimulation in macrophages from the YAC18 mouse, which differs from the YAC128 only in the length of the polyglutamine stretch. Excessive IL-6 release was not seen in YAC18 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>). To determine whether microglia, the CNS equivalent of monocytes/macrophages, are also dysfunctional in HD, we performed LPS stimulation of microglia isolated from the widely used R6/2 transgenic mouse model of HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). HD microglia, too, demonstrated hyperactivity in response to stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>HD monocytes, macrophages, and microglia are overactive when stimulated.</bold> (A) No IL-6 was detectable in the supernatant of monocytes from control (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 9) or premanifest HD subjects (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 8) in the unstimulated state or after priming with IFN-&#x003b3;.

Key cytokines of the innate immune system are up-regulated both centrally and peripherally, and robust changes even take place in premanifest HD mutation carriers many years before the onset of motor abnormalities. To our knowledge, the elevated IL-6 level seen in premanifest subjects with a mean of 16 yr until predicted clinical onset represents the earliest plasma abnormality identified to date in HD. The peripheral changes correlate well with clinical variables and are accompanied by alterations in striatal gene expression.</p><p>Although cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10 are increased later in the disease, normal Ig levels throughout the disease course suggest that there is no generalized activation of the adaptive immune response. Whereas IL-6 and IL-8 production are triggered by NF-&#x003ba;B activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), IL-4 and IL-10 act to down-regulate NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). The late involvement of these cytokines may reflect an adaptive response to chronic immune activation, possibly involving altered interactions between monocytes/macrophages and Th2 cells.</p><p>The correlation we show between plasma and CSF levels of IL-6 and IL-8 links the central and peripheral immune activation in HD. We show that IL-6 and IL-8 are increased in plasma and the striatum. These cytokines are not thought to cross the healthy blood&#x02013;brain barrier in the acute setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), and studies of brain penetration of specific molecules in HD have not identified alterations of the blood&#x02013;brain barrier (e.g., reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Mutant huntingtin therefore probably induces parallel dysfunction in both compartments (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). The immune dysfunction we demonstrate in monocytes from premanifest HD gene carriers may reflect similar central changes in HD microglia and therefore act as a window onto central disease pathogenesis at this very early stage in the disease process. Given the dramatic changes seen in striatal cytokine expression and the chronic nature of these changes, passage of cytokines from the CNS into blood is a possibility we cannot exclude, although cytokines are rapidly broken down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>) and would likely be subject to considerable dilution in plasma. However, the presence of primary abnormalities of both peripheral and central cytokine-producing cells (monocytes/macrophages and microglia, respectively) suggests that parallel disease-related derangements in the periphery and CNS are the simplest explanation for these CSF&#x02013;plasma correlations.</p><fig position="float" id="fig10"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p><bold>Immune activation, induced by mutant huntingtin, occurs both peripherally and centrally in HD.</bold> A cell-autonomous effect of the mutant protein may be responsible for the innate immune response. The NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway that triggers IL-6 release is known to be up-regulated by mutant huntingtin (reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), and microglia-derived toxicity can influence disease progression (references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). We find that the innate immune response detectable in plasma very early in the disease is strongly linked to disease progression and recapitulated in HD striatum, that human monocytes express mutant huntingtin, and that monocytes, macrophages, and microglia overexpress IL-6 when stimulated. Early innate immune activation could be a target in the development of disease-modifying therapies.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2051869f10"></graphic></fig><p>Microglia have previously been implicated in the pathogenesis of HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>) and are increasingly seen as key players in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). The increased cytokine production we observe in the CNS and peripherally could be caused by dysfunction of microglia and their counterparts, monocytes and macrophages. We show that monocytes from HD patients express mutant huntingtin. Further, we demonstrate that microglia, monocytes, and macrophages in HD are all hyperactive when stimulated. The NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway that triggers IL-6 release is known to be up-regulated by mutant huntingtin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), and the microglial kynurenine monooxygenase pathway has been identified as a potential therapeutic target in HD, establishing immune dysfunction as a possible pathogenic pathway in HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>).</p><p>The functional overactivity of macrophages from 12-mo YAC128 mice, corresponding to early human HD, was not seen in macrophages from YAC18 mice, which are identical to YAC128 animals except for the length of the polyglutamine tract. This suggests that the presence of mutant huntingtin alone is sufficient to cause derangement of monocytes/macrophages.</p><p>Interestingly, although IL-6 is undetectable in the supernatant of isolated human monocytes, levels of IL-6 in plasma are not zero in control subjects and HD patients. The same is true of mouse macrophages and serum. Thus, there is low-level background cytokine production in vivo, perhaps due to normal cell turnover or environmental immune challenges, that is absent in vitro. A primary dysfunction of monocytes is sufficient to explain the increased plasma cytokine levels in HD, as hyperactive HD monocytes will respond excessively to this physiological background stimulation. However, it is possible that HD also causes differences in the level of background immune stimulation, which could contribute to the later up-regulation of the adaptive immune response cytokines IL-4 and IL-10.</p><p>There is a need for markers of progression (&#x0201c;state biomarkers&#x0201d;) in HD and other neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Our results suggest that inflammatory changes detected in peripheral plasma may be biologically relevant and mirror the neurodegenerative process occurring in the CNS (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). Indeed, combined peripheral markers of inflammation were recently suggested to be biomarkers for diagnosis and progression in Alzheimer's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Remarkably, peripheral inflammatory changes may also reveal early pathogenic events in HD, occurring more than 15 yr before the onset of neurological manifestations. The inflammatory changes seen in patients are echoed in mouse models of HD. Importantly, they may therefore provide translational biomarkers for the use of HD mouse models in the development of therapeutic interventions. Finally, the mechanism of early innate immune activation in HD warrants further study as a potential source of targets for disease-modifying therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Ethical approval.</title><p>All human experiments were performed in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and approved by University of British Columbia (UBC) Clinical Research Ethics Board (Canadian patients) or University College London (UCL)/UCL Hospitals Joint Research Ethics Committee (UK patients), as appropriate.
