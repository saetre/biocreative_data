Glycogen synthase kinase 3&#x003b2; (GSK3&#x003b2;), a key serine/threonine kinase in the destruction complex, is responsible for several phosphorylation events that mark &#x003b2;-catenin for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Because modulation of both &#x003b2;-catenin and GSK3&#x003b2; activity may have important implications for treating disease, a complete understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the &#x003b2;-catenin/GSK3&#x003b2; interaction is warranted. We screened an arrayed lentivirus library expressing small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting 5,201 human druggable genes for silencing events that activate a &#x003b2;-catenin pathway reporter (BAR) in synergy with 6-bromoindirubin-3&#x02032;oxime (BIO), a specific inhibitor of GSK3&#x003b2;. Top screen hits included shRNAs targeting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), the target of the anti-inflammatory compound methotrexate. Exposure of cells to BIO plus methotrexate resulted in potent synergistic activation of BAR activity, reduction of &#x003b2;-catenin phosphorylation at GSK3-specific sites, and accumulation of nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin. Furthermore, the observed synergy correlated with inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3&#x003b2; and was neutralized upon inhibition of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Linking these observations to inflammation, we also observed synergistic inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF&#x003b1;, IL-6, and IL-12), and increased production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to GSK3 inhibitors and methotrexate. Our data establish DHFR as a novel modulator of &#x003b2;-catenin and GSK3 signaling and raise several implications for clinical use of combined methotrexate and GSK3 inhibitors as treatment for inflammatory disease.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>&#x003b2;-catenin signaling is critical in normal development and adult physiology.

In the past several years it has also become clear that GSK3 is a prominent mediator of inflammation, and it is likely that this function of GSK3 underlies the pathology of several disease states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006892-Martin1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006892-Jope1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Although much is now known regarding control of &#x003b2;-catenin and GSK3&#x003b2; function, to better understand how to therapeutically modulate this fundamental pathway additional pathway regulators must be identified.</p><p>High-throughput RNA interference (RNAi) screening in cultured human cells represents a powerful, unbiased, and comprehensive genetic approach for dissecting the contribution of individual genes to signaling pathways or cellular functions. By use of libraries of chemically synthesized small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), or small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) expressed from vectors and packaged as pseudotyped viral particles, we and others have shown the utility of RNAi screens to define modulators of clinically relevant and investigative compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006892-Bartz1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006892-Berns1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006892-Klinghoffer1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Because the &#x003b2;-catenin/GSK3 pathway represents a potentially valuable, albeit complex, target of interest, we performed an RNAi screen to identify potentially druggable modulators of a GSK3-specific inhibitor, 6-bromoindirubin-3&#x02032;oxime (BIO). We screened a library of &#x0003e;13,000 individually arrayed lentiviral shRNA vectors targeting &#x0003e;5,000 druggable human genes for vectors that would activate a &#x003b2;-catenin pathway reporter (BAR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006892-Major1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> synergistically with a suboptimal dose of BIO.

Intracellular &#x003b2;-catenin accumulation and subsequent luciferase expression are tightly regulated in this reporter line by an intact &#x003b2;-catenin destruction complex. In these cells, inhibition of this complex by a GSK3-specific inhibitor results in &#x003b2;-catenin accumulation and translocation to the nucleus and robust luciferase expression. We optimized this reporter assay to identify shRNAs that synergize with GSK3 inhibition by establishing a dose of BIO that activates BAR only in concert with a silencing event that impairs GSK3 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006892-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). To do this we compared BAR activation in cells transduced with an shRNA targeting either GSK3&#x003b2; itself or another gene such as Axin1 that facilitates GSK3 regulation of &#x003b2;-catenin, to untransduced cells or cells transduced with a lentiviral vector control. Although none of the vectors tested resulted in reporter activation in the absence of BIO, cells transduced with shRNA vectors targeting GSK3&#x003b2; or Axin1 consistently enabled a sub-optimal, non-activating dose of BIO (312 nM) to activate BAR luciferase expression compared with vector control and uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006892-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

Forty eight hours after transduction, cells were exposed to a titration of BIO (GSK3i), and luciferase activity was measured after 24 hr of exposure to drug.

As expected, in concert with a sub-optimal dose of BIO, the DHFR shRNAs induced robust activation of BAR to levels similar to that induced by shRNAs targeting GSK3&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006892-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The three DHFR shRNA vectors induced target knockdown to 34&#x00025;, 50&#x00025;, and 21&#x00025; (DHFR shRNAs 1, 2, and 3, respectively) of the DHFR mRNA levels in the vector alone (U6-term) control sample. Correlation between phenotype and silencing was reasonable given that the vector that induced the greatest DHFR silencing also resulted in the strongest pathway activation (DHFR shRNA 3). To strengthen our confidence that the observed reporter activation resulted from on-target inhibition of DHFR, we exposed RKO-BAR cells to a titration of methotrexate in the presence or absence of a suboptimal dose of BIO. Neither methotrexate nor the suboptimal dose of BIO alone significantly increased BAR activity. However, when added in combination, reporter activation increased in a manner dependent on increasing concentrations of methotrexate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006892-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Together with the observation that three distinct shRNAs targeting the same gene resulted in the same phenotype, these results support the conclusion that the observed effect is due to on-target inhibition of DHFR. In addition, synergistic BAR activation was also driven by combined exposure of cells to methotrexate and a second structurally unrelated GSK inhibitor (GSK inhibitor VIII, Calbiochem), but not by the combination of methotrexate and lithium or Wnt-3a conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006892-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly the selectivity of the synergistic interaction correlated with increased phosphorylation of an inhibitory residue (Ser-9) on GSK3&#x003b2; induced by BIO or GSK3 inhibitor VIII, but not by lithium or Wnt-3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006892-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

Because GSK3 regulates &#x003b2;-catenin stability by phosphorylating &#x003b2;-catenin serine and threonine residues (Ser33/37 and Thr41) we examined whether DHFR inhibition affected this phosphorylation event. To enable a comparison of the phosphorylation status of &#x003b2;-catenin between cells with active GSK3 versus potentially inhibited GSK3, &#x003b2;-catenin degradation was blocked in all samples by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. In line with our previous experiments, exposure to methotrexate had no affect on &#x003b2;-catenin protein levels or phosphorylation status compared with control cells treated with MG132 alone. In contrast, treatment of cells with a fully active concentration of BIO (2.5 &#x000b5;M) completely inhibited GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41) as well as laddering of total &#x003b2;-catenin on the protein gel, which is suggestive of decreased &#x003b2;-catenin ubiquitination. Importantly, cells treated with the dose of BIO used in our screen (312 nM) exhibited only modest decreases in &#x003b2;-catenin phosphorylation and laddering, and these effects were significantly enhanced by co-treatment with methotrexate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006892-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Similar to our previous experiments, the enhancement of BIO by methotrexate was neutralized by addition of adenosine.

Our screen revealed the intriguing observation of synergy between a GSK3 specific inhibitor, BIO, and shRNA molecules that silence DHFR, the target of the widely used anti-inflammatory drug methotrexate. This finding highlights a novel interaction between folate metabolism and &#x003b2;-catenin/GSK3 signal transduction pathways and suggests potential opportunities for the use of DHFR and GSK3 inhibitors in the clinic.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first report of modulation of GSK3 activity by inhibition of DHFR. However, links between folic acid intake and &#x003b2;-catenin have been observed previously.

This effect was attributed to DNA hypomethylation and subsequent induction of strand breaks within the APC gene leading to decreased expression of APC mRNA. Consistent with this observation, mice expressing hypomorphic alleles of DNMT1 that result in reduced genomic methylation, exhibit an increased incidence of APC LOH event and increase &#x003b2;-catenin accumulation in microadenomas of the colon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006892-Yamada1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Although we did not observe an obvious effect on APC expression upon inhibition of DHFR, the results described in the two aforementioned studies are consistent with our observation that cellular exposure to SAM, the major donor of one-carbon units in cellular methylation reactions, blocked the synergistic accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin that occurred in response to dual inhibition of DHFR and GSK3. The lack of effect on APC expression in our studies may be due to the short duration of our assays (hours &#x02013; days) compared with the longer studies performed in the mouse models and in the clinic (weeks &#x02013; 1 year). Our data suggest that early consequences of decreased folate metabolism, mediated at least in part by decreased cellular methylation, can lead to a more immediate impact on &#x003b2;-catenin regulation by GSK3 than indicated previously.</p><p>The mechanism of the interaction between DHFR inhibition and &#x003b2;-catenin/GSK3 is likely to be complex and due to cross-talk between these signaling pathways rather than direct activation of GSK3 by DHFR. Although DHFR inhibition increased the potency of BIO, in the absence of BIO, methotrexate and RNAi-induced silencing of DHFR had no effect BAR activity, &#x003b2;-catenin accumulation, or &#x003b2;-catenin phosphorylation. Evidence shown here suggests that alterations in methylation caused by DHFR inhibition may underlie the synergy with BIO. However, to what extent the observed synergy is due to changes in DNA methylation versus changes in protein methylation, or both, remains to be determined. The observation that exposure to adenosine blocked the synergistic effect of combined DHFR and GSK3 inhibition opens the possibility that signaling events outside of those perturbed by changes in methylation may play a role in regulating pathway cross-talk. To date, four key mechanisms have been identified that contribute to regulation of GSK3. These include regulation by phosphorylation of GSK3 itself, the subcellular localization of GSK3, protein-protein interactions with GSK3, and the phosphorylation status of GSK3 substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006892-Jope2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. The data presented here suggest the possibility that inhibition of folate metabolism primes cells for GSK3&#x003b2; inhibition and subsequent &#x003b2;-catenin activation by upregulating activators of PI3K signaling.</p><p>Given the recent demonstration of anti-inflammatory properties of GSK3 inhibitors, and the use of low dose methotrexate as the gold standard treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, our data raise several interesting possibilities for the use of these inhibitors in the clinic. The observation that dual inhibition of GSK3 and DHFR led to a synergistic anti-inflammatory response suggests that the combination of DHFR and GSK3 inhibitors may have merit for use in the clinic. However, it is unclear whether the potent anti-inflammatory effect of combined inhibition requires activation of &#x003b2;-catenin signaling. The ability to separate the anti-inflammatory and pro-oncogenic effects of dual DHFR and GSK3 inhibition will ultimately determine the utility of the proposed combination therapy for treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions. Interestingly, rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with methotrexate were found to have a 50&#x00025; increased risk of developing certain cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006892-Buchbinder1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Increased &#x003b2;-catenin signaling provides a plausible molecular mechanism for this increased risk in patients on methotrexate. While increased &#x003b2;-catenin signaling has clearly been linked to development of certain cancers such as colon cancer, two studies in malignant melanoma suggest that elevated nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin may improve survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006892-Bachmann1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006892-Chien1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. It is possible that depending on the cellular context, &#x003b2;-catenin can promote either oncogenic proliferation or de-differentiation of tumor cells into a less pathologic state. In the latter case, agents such as methotrexate that synergize with &#x003b2;-catenin pathway activators may have a therapeutic effect in the oncology clinic. Further mechanistic understanding of the interactions between DHFR, GSK3, and &#x003b2;-catenin should lead to insights as to how to best modulate GSK3 as a drug target.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents</title><p>293FT producer cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were maintained as per the manufacturer's specifications in DMEM supplemented with 10&#x00025; FBS, and 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acids, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1&#x00025; Pen/strep, and 500 &#x000b5;g/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen).

RKO-BAR cells were transduced with DHFR shRNAs or were exposed to methotrexate with or without BIO and RNA was harvested for Q-PCR analysis with probes specific for Axin1, Axin2, &#x003b2;-TRPC, CK1&#x003b1;, CUL4b, and GSK3&#x003b2;. Of the genes tested, a modest, albeit consistent, reduction in Axin2 expression alone was observed upon silencing and methotrexate inhibition of DHFR. However, as expected with activation of &#x003b2;-catenin, exposure to the combination of BIO and methotrexate led to an increase in Axin2 expression, and Axin2 shRNAs did not lead to GSK3 inhibitor enhancement in our screen. It is therefore unlikely that a reduction in Axin2 levels alone underlies the synergistic interaction between DHFR and GSK3 inhibitors.</p><p>(0.04 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0006892.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006892.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>Establishment of minimal titer values in GFP units required to detect enhancement of BIO-mediated activation of BAR by GSK3&#x003b2; shRNA. Because it is difficult to normalize viral titers across a large collection of packaged vectors we established a minimal titer threshold that would be expected to result in BAR activation if gene silencing enhanced BIO potency. To establish a minimum effective titer, we exposed HT29 cells to serially diluted control virus (U6-TERM, which contains the U6 promoter and two tandem RNA-polymerase III termination sequences but no shRNA) or virus targeting GSK3&#x003b2;. GFP expression was measured 96 h post transduction to determine titer values in terms of fluorescent light units on an Acumen Explorer laser scanning microplate reader (TTP LabTech, Cambridge U.K.). In parallel with the HT29 infections, RKO-BAR cells were infected with same serially diluted control virus or lentiviral shRNA targeting GSK3&#x003b2;. Forty eight hours after infection, cells were exposed to BIO at a concentration (312 nM) that induces luciferase-based luminescence only upon infection with an shRNA capable of negatively modulating GSK3 function. Significance of enhanced activation of luciferase by the GSK3&#x003b2; shRNA infected cells over that observed in control vector infected cells is plotted on the Y-axis. GFP values as Log total intensity fluorescent units as a measurement of viral titer is plotted on the X-axis. Each data point represents the comparison of 4 replicate wells for each dilution of U6-TERM to GSK3&#x003b2; shRNA vector. As expected, we observed a strong correlation between titer of GSK3&#x003b2; shRNA virus and enhancement of luciferase activation by BIO. The arrow denotes the titer value in GFP units (1.7&#x000d7;107 FLU) required for 5-fold enhancement of luciferase activation with a P value of 1&#x000d7;10-4. We set this as our minimal titer value for effective lentiviral shRNA production for this screen.</p><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0006892.s002.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006892.s003"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p>Analysis of titer values for the lentiviral shRNA screening library.
