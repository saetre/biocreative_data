Although mortality associated with BCC is low, BCC accounts for significant morbidity and places a large burden on the health care system. Susceptibility to BCC is believed to result from complex interactions between environmental ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure and genetic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Polymorphisms in genes encoding detoxifying enzymes (cytochrome p450 and glutathione S-transferase), the melanocortin 1 receptor, Agouti signaling protein, tyrosinase, and Patched 1 (PTCH1) have been associated with BCC risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, polymorphic loci in genes that determine susceptibility for many patients who develop BCC and account for the phenotypic variability of BCC remain to be identified.</p><p>Dysregulation of the Sonic hedgehog signal transduction pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis of BCC, presumably based on constitutive activation of GLI family transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Indeed, transgenic mice expressing <italic>GLI1 </italic>in cutaneous keratinocytes develop BCCs, providing evidence that GLI1 plays a role in the genesis of BCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Polymorphic loci of unknown functional significance have been identified in <italic>GLI1</italic>, including c.2651A&#x0003e;C (D884A), c.2798G&#x0003e;A (G933D), c.3034G&#x0003e;T (G1012V), and c.3298G&#x0003e;C (E1100Q) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. None of these loci lies in a known functional domain of <italic>GLI1</italic>, however, nucleotides c.2798, c.3034, and c.3298 flank the carboxy terminal acidic transactivation domain (c.3060 - c.3273) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Theoretically, amino acid differences in these residues could affect the conformation or function of this domain and be associated with disease based on altered transcriptional regulation by GLI1. Since <italic>GLI1 </italic>expression appears to play a fundamental role in the genesis of BCC, we determined whether any of the <italic>GLI1 </italic>genotypes represent risk factors for developing BCC alone or in combination with past sun exposure patterns and whether functional differences exist among the haplotypes. We find that different <italic>GLI1 </italic>genotypes alone or in combination with past sun exposure patterns as assessed in this study do not affect BCC risk.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design and subjects</title><p>A frequency-matched case control study was conducted from February to November 2007. Controls were matched to cases on sex and age (20-39 years, 40-59, 60-69, &#x02265; 70). In an attempt to even the distribution among age categories, we chose broader intervals where we expected fewer cases and narrower ones where we expected more.</p><p>In accord with the Declaration of Helsinki protocols, institutional IRB approval was granted from the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Children's Memorial Hospital prior to study initiation. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to enrollment. Eligible cases were recruited from non-Hispanic Caucasian patients presenting to the Northwestern Memorial Faculty Foundation Dermatology clinic for Mohs resection of histologically confirmed non-metastatic BCC. Eligible controls that had no history of skin cancer were also recruited from non-Hispanic Caucasian patients presenting to the same clinic. Individuals who had a known genetic disease or syndrome were excluded. Information collected included age, sex, skin type, and BCC location. Fitzpatrick skin type was ascertained by the patient's response to a standardized question [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. BCC location was recorded as head/neck, trunk, or extremity.</p></sec><sec><title>Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analysis</title><p>Two buccal swabs (Whatman Omniswab, Florham Park, NJ) were obtained from consenting cases and controls. Genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAmp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Two SNPs in the <italic>GLI1 </italic>gene (c.2798G&#x0003e;A and c.3298G&#x0003e;C) were analyzed via matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) by the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen, Phoenix, AZ). The c.2651A&#x0003e;C (D884A) SNP was not analyzed based on its rare occurrence. The c.3034G&#x0003e;T (G1012V) SNP was not analyzed because it has only been observed in the Asian population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of sun exposure</title><p>A validated sun exposure questionnaire was completed by cases (N = 201) and controls (N = 201) in clinic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Estimates for each of four aspects of sun exposure were determined (1. average adult sun exposure, 2. adult sunbathing score, 3. childhood sunburning, and 4. intermittency score). A measure of the lifetime average sun exposure in hours/day beginning at age 20 years is referred to as the average adult sun exposure. Within each age range a weighted average number of hours of exposure per day was calculated. These averages were combined across the age ranges as a weighted average with weights proportional to the number of years the subject spent in each age range. The adult sunbathing score serves as a measure of time that is spent with a large area of the body exposed to the sun. Nominal categories were converted to a numerical score for each age range as never = 0, rarely = 1, occasionally = 2, and often = 3. A weighted average of a subject's age-range-specific scores was calculated based on the number of years spent in each age range. Childhood sunburning was defined as erythema for &#x02265;48 hours or blistering and recorded as yes or no. The intermittency score provides a measure of the proportion of sun exposure received on non-working days. Intermittency was assessed based on the absolute value of the difference between the weekend and weekday hours of exposure for a subject. An absolute value was determined for each of the age ranges in which a subject had spent time, and the values were combined across the age ranges as a weighted value based on the number of years the subject spent in each age range.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional analysis</title><p>For CAT assays, <italic>GLI1 </italic>cDNA expression constructs that included nucleotides 231 through the polyA tail were prepared in the pM plasmid (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) for each of four haplotypes (c.2798G&#x0003e;A and c.3298G&#x0003e;C). The sequence of all constructs was confirmed by automated sequence analysis. A total of 4 &#x003bc;g of DNA was transfected into HeLa cells in each experiment using Lipofectamine reagent (Gibco-BRL, Rockville, MD), including 1 &#x003bc;g of pG5CAT reporter plasmid (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), 1 &#x003bc;g of pSV-&#x003b2;-galactosidase (Promega, Madison, WI), 0-250 ng of <italic>GLI1 </italic>effector plasmid, and pBluescript carrier DNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in an amount to make up the difference. CAT assays were performed as described by the manufacturer (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). CAT activity was quantitated by scintillation counter and was normalized by measuring &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity spectrophotometrically.</p><p>For transformation assays, pLTR-<italic>GLI1 </italic>expression constructs containing each of the haplotypes in the pLTR-2 vector were prepared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The sequence of all constructs was confirmed by automated sequence analysis. RK3E cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL1895, Manassas, VA) were transfected with 3 &#x003bc;g of each of the pLTR-<italic>GLI1 </italic>constructs using 12 &#x003bc;l of Lipofectamine reagent in 0.3 ml of OptiMEM (Gibco-BRL, Rockville, MD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

We assessed associations between BCC and potential risk factors (e.g., genotypes or sun exposure variables) using unconditional logistic regression models that adjusted for the matching variables. Interactions between potential risk factors were assessed similarly. We assessed associations between BCC location and genotype or exposure variables using unconditional polytomous logistic regression models applied only to cases. These models regarded the three possible locations as outcomes and the other variables as predictors. These polytomous models were also adjusted for the matching variables. Both the case-control logistic regression and case-only polytomous logistic regression measured associations with odds ratios (OR), and provided corresponding confidence intervals (CI) and two-tailed statistical tests. All regression calculations were carried out with SAS version 9.1 statistical software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).</p><p>Analyses of possible associations of sun exposure variables or genotype with skin type were always adjusted for case-control status. Association of childhood sunburning with skin type was assessed with the Cochran-Armitage trend test. Associations of continuous sun exposure variables with skin type were assessed using tests for linear trend embedded in an analysis-of-variance model. Associations of <italic>GLI1 </italic>genotypes with skin type were assessed with the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. These calculations were carried out with either SAS version 9.1 or with StatXact 6 (Cytel Software Corporation, Cambridge, MA).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Characteristics of cases and controls</title><p>419 of 443 subjects (95%) interviewed met eligibility criteria, and 402 of 419 eligible individuals (96%) were enrolled.

Controls were frequency-matched to cases for age and sex (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The slight matching imbalances arose from an excess of female controls in the 40-59 age class and an excess of cases of both sexes in the &#x02265;70 age class. The location of the BCC was head/neck in 157 (78%), trunk in 25 (12%), and extremity in 19 (10%).

The genotype frequencies were not significantly different between the cases and controls at c.2798 or c.3298 whether adjusted for age and sex or not (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Estimated haplotype frequencies were also not significantly different. Since we found no evidence for an association between haplotype and BCC, we combined cases and controls to estimate haplotype frequencies for the population; c.2798A;c.3298C = 0.58, c.2798A;c.3298G = 0.001, c.2798G;c.3298C = 0.08, and c.2798G;c.3298G = 0.34.</p><p>To estimate variability in <italic>GLI1 </italic>genotype distributions among different control groups, we compared the c.2798 and c.3298 genotype frequencies in our controls with a published historic control group consisting of a healthy Australian population with no evidence of BCC or other cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We did not find evidence for any differences in the genotype distribution between our controls and the historic controls at c.2798 (p = 0.6).

We found no evidence for an association between the c.2798 genotype and BCC location (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). However, the odds of developing BCC on the trunk compared with the head/neck region was lower for carriers of the GC than the CC genotype at c.3298.

We recognize that recall bias may limit the validity of the sun-exposure estimates and reduce their value in determining associations between BCC and specific past sun exposure patterns. Similar to other studies, participants self-administered the questionnaire in clinic to reduce the introduction of bias. In contrast to the other studies, we compared BCC patients to individuals who were generally well and without BCC. It is not clear why this comparison would give negative results. It is also possible that perceptions of sunbathing practices or genetic heterogeneity differ between individuals in different populations, sometimes limiting the discriminating value of the questionnaire. Finally, it is possible that UV radiation played a limited role in the development of BCC in the population that was assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>GLI1 </italic>genotypes function similarly and do not affect BCC risk either alone or in combination with past sun exposure patterns.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AW collected patient data, participated in data analysis, and drafted the manuscript.
