To better understand the control of transcriptional regulation by Osx, we identified Osx-interacting proteins using proteomics approaches. Here, we report that a Jumonji C (JmjC)-domain containing protein, called NO66, directly interacts with Osx and inhibits Osx-mediated promoter activation. The knockdown of NO66 in preosteoblast cells triggered accelerated osteoblast differentiation and mineralization, and markedly stimulated the expression of Osx target genes. A JmjC-dependent histone demethylase activity was exhibited by NO66, which was specific for both H3K4me and H3K36me <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and this activity was needed for the regulation of osteoblast-specific promoters. During BMP-2-induced differentiation of preosteoblasts, decreased NO66 occupancy correlates with increased Osx occupancy at Osx-target promoters. Our results indicate that interactions between NO66 and Osx regulate Osx-target genes in osteoblasts by modulating histone methylation states.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>demethylase</kwd><kwd>Jumonji</kwd><kwd>NO66</kwd><kwd>osteoblast</kwd><kwd>Osterix</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bone formation occurs through two distinct processes. Many skeletal elements form by endochondral ossification, which involves a cartilage intermediate. The other skeletal elements, which mainly consist of craniofacial bones, are formed by intramembranous ossification, whereby bones form directly from mesenchymal condensations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Fang and Hall, 1997</xref>). Despite these differences, osteoblast differentiation is controlled by an identical set of transcription factors: Runx2, Osterix (Osx), and &#x003b2;-catenin that have essential roles in both processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Ducy <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Nakashima <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Hill <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Komori, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Rodda and McMahon, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Runx2 is required at an early step and <italic>Osx</italic> is needed at a later step of osteoblast differentiation. The <italic>Osx</italic> is specifically expressed in osteoblast lineage cells and at lower levels in prehypertrophic chondrocytes. The Osx contains a proline- and serine-rich transactivation domain located in the N-terminal part of the protein and three DNA-binding C2H2-type zinc fingers at its C-terminus. <italic>Osx</italic>-null mice, which die at birth, have a normal cartilage skeleton, including the development of normal hypertrophic cartilage, but completely lack bone formation. In all skeletal elements of <italic>Osx</italic>-null embryos, precursor cells are arrested at their differentiation and consequently fail to express osteoblast-specific marker genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Nakashima <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). Several factors, including HDACs, Twist 1 and 2, ATF4, NFATc, Msx, and Dlx also have important roles in the differentiation and function of osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Nakashima and de Crombrugghe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Hassan <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Vega <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Yang and Karsenty, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Koga <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Cheng <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the various classes of transcription factors, the transcriptional control of gene expression also depends on the state of histone modifications, which provides a dynamic control of chromatin activity. Methylation of H3K9, H3K27, or H4K20 is often associated with inactive chromatin, whereas methylation of H3K4, H3K36, H3K79, and H3R17 is largely associated with active gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Strahl and Allis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Lachner and Jenuwein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Martin and Zhang, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The identification of histone lysine demethylases, including lysine specific demethylase1 (LSD1) and jumonji (JmjC)-domain containing proteins has provided strong evidence that histone methylation is reversible and dynamically regulated, much like histone acetylation and phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Shi <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Klose <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Several JmjC-domain-containing histone demethylases (JHDMs) reverse methylation states at lysines 4, 9, 27, 36 and 79 of H3 and thus regulate the activation of target genes in chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Fodor <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Klose <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Tsukada <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Whetstine <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Yamane <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Agger <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">De Santa <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Iwase <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Lan <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In osteoblasts, histone acetylases and deacetylases (HDACs) control the activity of Runx2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Shen <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Schroeder <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Kang <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). In addition, HDAC4 was shown to inhibit the differentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes by negatively regulating Runx2 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Vega <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Moreover, the histone lysine methytransferase Wdr5 has been reported to be involved in osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>), but no histone demethylases have been shown to regulate osteoblast-specific genes.</p><p>In a screen for polypeptides that associate with Osx, we identified the JmjC domain-containing protein NO66. This protein was previously described as a component of nucleoli in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos that co-fractionated biochemically with preribosomal particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Eilbracht <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). The NO66 is highly conserved in eukaryotes, and immunofluorescence studies revealed that the protein is present in both the granular part of nucleoli and in the nucleoplasm of tissue culture cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Eilbracht <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). However, not much is known about its function. Here we show that NO66, which is present in all bones as observed on the basis of histochemical studies, inhibits transcription of Osx-dependent promoters. We present evidence that NO66 is a histone demethylase for H3K4me and H3K36me, and that this activity is required for the inhibition of the transcriptional activation by Osx. Importantly, our experiments strongly support a physiological role for NO66 during osteoblast differentiation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>JmjC-domain containing protein NO66 is an Osx-interacting protein</title><p>To define the regulation of Osx transactivation in osteoblast differentiation, we stably transfected Flag&#x02013;HA&#x02013;Osx into the mouse C2Cl2 line, which differentiates into osteoblasts on BMP-2 addition. The induction of Flag&#x02013;HA&#x02013;Osx in this cell line (referred to as C2-Osx) occurs after tetracycline withdrawal. Using tandem affinity purification followed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE fractionation and mass spectrometry, we identified Osx-interacting polypeptides in nuclear extracts of this cell line. One of the proteins co-purifying with Flag&#x02013;HA&#x02013;Osx was the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing protein NO66 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>The co-purification of NO66 with Osx in lysates of C2-Osx cells grown without tetracycline and with or without BMP-2 treatment was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with &#x003b1;-Flag antibody followed by western blot using &#x003b1;-NO66 antibody. No NO66 was detected after immunoprecipitation of tetracycline-treated C2-Osx cell lysates, confirming that NO66 was co-immunoprecipitated with Flag&#x02013;HA&#x02013;Osx, and that NO66 and Osx are part of a common complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). In a similar experiment, other co-purified proteins, such as Yb-1 and Flightless, were also detected in &#x003b1;-Flag immunoprecipitates, thus confirming our mass spectrometry analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). An association of NO66 and Osx was also observed in HEK293T cells co-transfected with Flag&#x02013;HA&#x02013;Osx and myc&#x02013;NO66 expression vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). Myc-tagged NO66 was found in the &#x003b1;-HA immunoprecipitates of whole cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>, top panel), and Flag&#x02013;HA&#x02013;Osx was present in &#x003b1;-myc immunoprecipitates (bottom panel). In addition, co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous Osx and endogenous NO66 was also observed in rat osteosarcoma UMR 106 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>), which are highly differentiated osteoblasts, further indicating that NO66 is associated with Osx in differentiated osteoblasts. Purified recombinant GST&#x02013;NO66 retained purified recombinant Osx in a pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1E</xref>) indicating that these two proteins interacted directly with each other. Moreover, another pull-down experiment showed that <sup>35</sup>S-labelled NO66 interacted with a segment of Osx (1&#x02013;270) that contains the transactivation domain but lacks the DNA-binding domain, indicating that this Osx segment was sufficient for NO66 interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>NO66 inhibits the transcriptional activation of Osx</title><p>Our previous studies showed that <italic>Osx</italic> is expressed in all endochondral and membranous skeletal elements during mouse embryonic development beginning at E13.5 and continuing after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Nakashima <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). <italic>In situ</italic> hybridizations using an anti-sense RNA probe showed that <italic>NO66</italic> RNA co-localized with <italic>Osx</italic> RNA starting at E14.5. The <italic>NO66</italic> RNA was present in all developing endochondral and membranous bones, such as E15.5 vertebrae and mandible and E18.5 femur, tibia, and fibula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). Immunohistochemistry of skeletal tissue sections using an NO66-specific antibody confirmed the presence of NO66 in developing bones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). Northern blot analyses using a human NO66 cDNA probe also showed expression of <italic>NO66</italic> in the human Saos-2 and rat UMR106 ostesarcoma cell lines, as well as in RNA preparations from human trabecular bone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Others have observed expression of NO66 in several mouse tissues and cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Eilbracht <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). All together these studies indicate that NO66 is widely, but not ubiquitously, expressed.</p><p>In <italic>Osx</italic> null embryos, expression of osteoblast-specific marker genes such as <italic>Osteocalcin</italic> (<italic>Oc</italic>) and <italic>Bone sialoprotein</italic> (<italic>Bsp</italic>) is completely lost, indicating that Osx is required for the expression of these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Nakashima <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). To further examine the effects of Osx on transcription of osteoblast-specific promoters, we transfected HEK293T cells with an Osx expression vector. Osx strongly stimulated the 2-kb <italic>Bsp</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel) as well as the 1.1-kb <italic>Osteocalcin</italic> promoter in a dose-dependent manner (middle panel). Although the basal activity of these reporters showed little change in the presence of NO66, co-expression of NO66 with Osx inhibited Osx-mediated activation of the reporters by 70&#x02013;80&#x00025;. The overexpression of NO66 in these cells did not affect the level of Osx (left, bottom panel). In control experiments, NO66 also did not inhibit the activity of different reporters driven by Sox9, ATF6, or GAL4-DBD-VP16 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3A&#x02013;C</xref>). These results indicate that although NO66 markedly inhibited transcriptional activation by Osx, it is not a general transcriptional inhibitor.</p><p>Previously we have shown that a proline-rich activation domain spanning amino-acid residues 27&#x02013;192 in Osx was required for the activation of the <italic>5XGAL4-Luc</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Nakashima <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). Using GAL4-DBD-Osx (27&#x02013;192) and <italic>5XGAL4-Luc</italic> in reporter assays, addition of either sodium butyrate (inhibitor of class I and II HDACs) or nicotinamide (inhibitor of class III HDACs) did not relieve the NO66-mediated inhibition of Osx-dependent transactivation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3D</xref>). These data suggest that the inhibitory effects of NO66 on Osx-dependent transcription were not mediated by HDACs and that NO66 did not recruit HDACs to repress Osx-mediated transactivation.</p><p>To verify that NO66 inhibits the expression of endogenous osteoblast-specific genes, we measured expression of the endogenous <italic>Osteocalcin</italic> (<italic>Oc</italic>) gene in BMP-2-induced osteoblasts that overexpressed NO66. The transfection of C2C12 cells with NO66 expression vector followed by BMP-2 treatment for 24 and 48 h decreased <italic>Oc</italic> mRNA by almost 50&#x00025; compared with mock-transfected cells after 48 h of BMP-2 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>, right panel).</p><p>To complement the above experiments, we next questioned whether loss of NO66 expression would result in increased expression of Osx-dependent genes in osteoblasts. The C2C12 cells were first either mock transfected or transfected with control or NO66-specific siRNAs, followed by treatment with BMP-2 to induce osteoblast differentiation. Immunoblots of whole-cell lysates using an &#x003b1;-NO66 antibody indicated that the NO66-specific siRNA, but not the control siRNA (Nsi-non-specific), significantly inhibited NO66 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>). Strikingly, knockdown of NO66 by siRNA increased the levels of <italic>Col1a1</italic> and <italic>Oc</italic> RNAs compared with those in control siRNA-transfected C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E</xref>). Similar experiments were performed in pre-osteoblast mouse cell line, MC3T3-E1, which can also differentiate into osteoblasts after BMP-2 treatment. The transfection of NO66-specific siRNA followed by BMP-2 addition led to marked stimulation of <italic>Bsp</italic> expression, when compared with control siRNA-transfected cells, which were also treated with BMP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2F</xref>). However, expression of <italic>Osx</italic> was not affected by transfection of either NO66-specific or control siRNAs in either cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). Thus, knockdown of NO66 in osteoblasts caused increased expression of osteoblast-specific marker genes, suggesting an important role for NO66 in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Knockdown of NO66 accelerates osteoblast differentiation and maturation</title><p>To further test our hypothesis that NO66 has a physiological role as a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation and maturation, we generated MC3T3 cell lines expressing stably transfected NO66-specific and non-specific shRNAs. Levels of NO66 were markedly decreased in NO66sh cells compared with control Nsh cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). Histochemical and quantitative analyses showed that the production of alkaline phosphatase, an early marker of osteoblast differentiation, was accelerated in NO66-shRNA-expressing cells (NO66sh) compared with control Nsh cells, when these cells were cultured in osteogenic medium for the indicated periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Further, the extracellular matrix mineralization, a late event, as shown by alizarin red S staining was also accelerated in NO66sh-treated cells compared with control Nsh-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>). These results suggest that knockdown of NO66 in preosteoblast MC3T3 cells caused these cells to differentiate earlier than control cells.</p><p>In addition, expression levels of the Osx-dependent <italic>Bsp</italic> and <italic>Osteocalcin</italic> matrix forming genes were markedly stimulated in NO66sh cells relative to in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3E</xref>), further indicating our interpretation that acceleration of osteoblast differentiation in NO66-deficient cells was due to increased expression of these matrix genes. All together, these data strongly indicate that knockdown of NO66 accelerates the rate of osteoblast differentiation and maturation of MC3T3 cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>NO66 has histone demethylase activity that is required for inhibition of Osx-dependent activation</title><p>Given the existence of the JmjC domain in NO66, and the presence of conserved amino acids that have been implicated as co-factor-binding sites in several other JmjC-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Klose <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>), we tested NO66 for histone demethylase activity. Using calf thymus histones as substrates, we found that recombinant NO66 very efficiently demethylated H3K4me3 and H3K4me1, and to a lesser extent H3K4me2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). NO66 also demethylated H3K36me3 and H3K36me2. In contrast, no activity was observed towards H3K9me3 or H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;2 and 3&#x02013;4, respectively). These results showed that NO66 is a histone demethylase specific for lysine 4 and 36 of histone H3.</p><p>We next tested whether, as in other JHDMs, the potential co-factor binding sites in the JmjC domain of NO66 were essential for demethylase activity by comparing the activity of wild-type NO66 with that of mutant NO66 protein (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref> for enzyme preparation). Our results showed that a mutant protein bearing two histidine-to-alanine substitutions in conserved sites critical for ferrous binding (H339A, H404A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>) showed no demethylase activity towards H3K4me3 or K36me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). This indicated that the mutations crippled the activity of NO66. The omission of co-factor &#x003b1;-KG from the demethylase reaction mixture inhibited the demethylase activity of NO66 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>, compare lane 2 and 4). In the absence of added Fe<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> ions the inhibition of NO66 activity was less pronounced, maybe because intrinsic Fe<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> ions remained bound to our preparation of NO66 (compare lane 2 and 3). However, addition of EDTA, which chelates Fe<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> ions, markedly inhibited the demethylase activity of NO66 for H3K4me3 (compare lane 2 and 5). The level of H3K4me3 in the presence of EDTA was similar to that present in control reaction with no enzyme (lane 1 and 5). These data strongly suggest that NO66 is a co-factor-dependent JmjC histone demethylase and that co-factors Fe<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> ions and &#x003b1;-KG are needed for full enzymatic activity.</p><p>To determine whether NO66 has demethylase activity in cultured cells, we overexpressed wild-type NO66 or a mutant in COS7 cells and monitored histone methylation levels by immunofluorescence using site-specific antibodies. The overexpression of wild-type NO66 clearly reduced the intensity of H3K4me3 and to lesser extent H3K36me3 staining, but not the intensity of H3K27me3 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4E</xref>). Similarly, the intensity of anti-H3K4me2, K4me1 and K36me2 staining was also reduced by overexpression of wild-type NO66 in COS7 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of the NO66 (H339A/H404A) mutant, which was inactive in the <italic>in vitro</italic> assay, did not reduce immunostaining of H3K4me3 or H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4E</xref>). Thus, both <italic>in vitro</italic> assays and in-cell assays indicate that NO66 exhibited H3K4- and H3K36-specific demethylase activity.</p><p>To test whether the demethylase activity of NO66 was required for the inhibition of transcriptional activation by Osx, we examined the effect of NO66 demethylase mutants on Osx-dependent reporter activation using <italic>5XGAL4-Luc</italic> co-transfected with Osx (27&#x02013;192) and wild-type or mutant NO66.

Two NO66 mutants (M1 and M2) were tested for their ability to physically interact with GST&#x02013;Osx (1&#x02013;270) in pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). The NO66 mutant M1, which retained an intact JmjC domain and the C-terminus of NO66, interacted with GST&#x02013;Osx (1&#x02013;270), whereas the mutant M2, which had an internal deletion including a part of the JmjC domain, did not interact with GST&#x02013;Osx (1&#x02013;270), indicating that the segment between 168 and 386 containing the JmjC domain of NO66 was necessary for strong interactions with the activation domain of Osx.</p><p>Next we examined the effect of full-length NO66 or M1 and M2 mutants on the ability of a GAL4&#x02013;Osx fusion polypeptide (27&#x02013;192) to activate a <italic>5XGAL4-Luc</italic> reporter gene. This domain of Osx was shown previously to be necessary and sufficient for the activation of this reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Nakashima <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). The co-transfection of GAL4&#x02013;Osx (27&#x02013;192) with wild-type NO66 or mutant M1 resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of <italic>5XGAL4-Luc</italic> reporter activity, thereby strongly suggesting that inhibition by NO66 was mediated through the activation domain of Osx (27&#x02013;192) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>). It should be noted that both polypeptides were able to interact physically with Osx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1E and F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5B</xref>). In contrast, the mutant M2, which did not interact with Osx owing to a partial deletion of the JmjC domain, showed weak inhibition of Osx-dependent activation even with the highest levels tested.</p><p>To map the NO66-interacting segment present in Osx, we used Osx deletion mutants together with NO66 mutant M1 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D</xref>). These results indicated that Osx C-terminal truncation mutants (1&#x02013;175 and 1&#x02013;288) that lacked the zinc finger DNA-binding domains co-immunoprecipitated with the NO66 M1 mutant, suggesting that an Osx segment spanning amino acids 1&#x02013;175 residues was sufficient to interact with NO66. However, Osx mutants bearing N-terminal deletions (89&#x02013;428, 175&#x02013;428, and 288&#x02013;428) were not co-immunoprecipitated by the NO66 mutant. Two of these mutations (89&#x02013;428 and 175&#x02013;428) remove parts of the activation domain in Osx. These results strongly indicate that an N-terminal segment of Osx that includes the activation domain of Osx is required for interactions with NO66.</p><p>Furthermore, we examined the effects of NO66 on the ability of the Osx mutants (89&#x02013;428 and 1&#x02013;288) to transcriptionally activate a <italic>Bsp-Luc reporter</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5E</xref>). The Osx (89&#x02013;428) mutant was still able to stimulate <italic>Bsp-Luc</italic> reporter activity, even though the activation domain is partially truncated in this mutant, though the activation was less than that observed with wild-type Osx (1&#x02013;428). The co-transfection of NO66 inhibited the activity of wild-type Osx in the reporter assay, but NO66 was not able to inhibit the activity of the Osx (89&#x02013;428) mutant, consistent with the inability of this mutant to interact with NO66. These results indicate that NO66 functionally interacts with the N-terminus of Osx; hence it is able to interact with and inhibit the activity of wild-type Osx (1&#x02013;428) but not mutant Osx (89&#x02013;428). Another mutant Osx (1&#x02013;288), which contains an intact activation domain but lacks a DNA-binding domain, was unable to stimulate reporter activity, as expected, and NO66 did not further reduce the activity of this mutant. Taken together, these data suggest that under the conditions of our assay, functional interactions between NO66 and Osx are required to inhibit Osx activation of target genes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Association of NO66 with the chromatin of Osx target genes is inversely correlated with their activation in osteoblasts</title><p>The addition of BMP-2 to MC3T3 preosteoblastic cells triggers the sequential activation of osteoblast-specific genes resulting in the differentiation of these cells into osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Katagiri <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Nakashima <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A and B</xref>).

At 15 h after BMP-2 addition, the levels of <italic>Osx</italic> RNA were already high but levels of <italic>Bsp</italic> and <italic>Oc</italic> RNAs were still very low. At 30 h after BMP-2 addition, RNA levels of <italic>Osx</italic>, <italic>Bsp</italic>, and <italic>Oc</italic> were all high.

Chromatin immunoprecipitations from MC3T3 cells after they were treated with BMP-2 for 0, 15, and 30 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>) indicated that NO66 occupancy at the two promoters was high before treatment, whereas as expected, occupancy of Osx at these promoters was negligible. After 15 h, Osx occupancy had markedly increased, whereas NO66 occupancy started to decrease at the <italic>Bsp</italic> promoter, but interestingly, not yet at the <italic>Oc</italic> promoter. At 30 h after BMP-2 treatment, Osx occupancy continued to increase whereas NO66 occupancy was markedly reduced. The expression of <italic>Bsp</italic> and <italic>Oc</italic> genes was seen only after 30 h of BMP-2 addition, at a time when significant depletion of NO66 from promoters of these genes was observed. The interactions of Osx or NO66 with the promoter of the &#x003b2;-<italic>actin</italic> gene appeared to be within background levels, confirming the specificity of our ChIPs. Other experiments showed that occupancy of Osx was much higher at the promoter of the <italic>Oc</italic> gene than at the 3&#x02032;UTR region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>), which is consistent with other biochemical experiments, indicating that the binding of Osx occurs at the promoter of <italic>Oc</italic> gene and that mutations in the Osx-binding site results in a loss of Osx-dependent promoter activity (Sinha <italic>et al</italic>, unpublished observations). Thus, these results revealed a marked correlation between decreased NO66 occupancy and increased Osx occupancy at two Osx target promoters.</p><p>These observations suggest that Osx and NO66 may compete for occupancy of target promoters. To test this idea, we performed a reporter assay using the same osteoblast-specific reporter (<italic>Bsp-Luc</italic>) used in the experiment described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref> (left). In these transfection experiments, an amount of NO66 plasmid (2X, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6D</xref>) that was sufficient to inhibit Osx activation was used together with increasing amounts of Osx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6D</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref> for titration of NO66 dose required to inhibit Osx-dependent activation). Our data showed that inhibition of the Osx-dependent activation by NO66 was overcome, at least in part, by increasing amount of Osx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6D</xref>, left, bars 6&#x02013;8). We also questioned whether in these transfection experiments Osx affects the occupancy of NO66 at the promoter of the reporter gene. Hence, we performed ChIP experiments in cells co-transfected with the reporter, NO66 and Osx. Our results showed that interactions of NO66 with transfected <italic>Bsp</italic> promoter (<italic>Bsp-luciferase</italic>), which occurred in the absence of Osx, were decreased by 60&#x02013;70&#x00025; in the presence of Osx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6D</xref>, right panel).</p><p>In independent experiments using BMP2-treated MC3T3 preosteoblasts, we also observed that levels of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 increased in parallel with the decrease in NO66 occupancy of the <italic>Bsp</italic> gene. Thus, depletion of NO66 at the <italic>Bsp</italic> gene was associated with enhanced methylation of histone H3 lysine residues that are linked with transcriptionally active chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6E</xref>). Furthermore, levels of H3 acetylation, RNA polymerase II and Wdr5 (a BMP2-inducible histone lysine methyl transferase) increased at the promoter of <italic>Bsp</italic> gene in BMP-2-treated MC3T3 cells, consistent with active transcription of this gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). However, levels of H3K27me3, which is not a substrate for NO66-mediated demethylation <italic>in vitro</italic> or in transfected cells, were not changed by the addition of BMP-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). In other control experiments, NO66 occupancy was very low at the promoters of <italic>Osx</italic> (a BMP-inducible gene) and <italic>Col2a1</italic> genes, and was not changed by BMP-2 addition. <italic>Col2a1</italic> is a chondrocyte-specific marker gene and a target of Sox9 activation; it remains transcriptionally inactive in osteoblast cells (data not shown). Taken together, our data suggest that NO66 interactions specifically regulate two Osx target genes, <italic>Bsp</italic> and <italic>Oc</italic>, and that expression of these genes depends on chromatin remodelling activities that mediate histone acetylation and methylation.</p><p>Interestingly, both Osx and NO66 seemed to occupy the same region of Osx target promoters at 15 h post BMP-2 addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>). To obtain additional evidence that Osx and NO66 are able to occupy the same chromatin fragment, we performed a re-ChIP experiment in C2-Osx cells. These data confirmed co-localization of Osx and NO66 in the same segment of the <italic>Bsp</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>), suggesting the possibility that both proteins could be part of the same chromatin bound complex, consistent with the physical interactions we observed between NO66 and Osx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our experiments provide the first evidence that transcriptional activation by Osx can be regulated by the JmjC-domain containing protein, NO66, which acts as a histone demethylase. Given the essential function of Osx in activating a large repertoire of genes in osteoblasts, our data strongly suggest that NO66 has a major role in osteoblast differentiation and function, adding a new layer of control in the regulation of the genetic programme of osteoblasts. Our results further emphasize the idea that chromatin remodelling is crucial for the control of Osx function.</p><p>The negative regulation of Osx activity by NO66 in transient expression experiments required both physical interactions between Osx and NO66, and the demethylase activity of NO66. In these experiments the chromatinization of reporter DNA templates should be less extensive than in the genome. Moreover, although the inhibition of the transcriptional activity of Osx might certainly be due to demethylation of histone H3, it could possibly also be caused by demethylation of proteins that form an active complex with Osx at the <italic>Bsp</italic> and <italic>Oc</italic> promoters or even by demethylation of Osx itself. Previous experiments by others have shown that LSD1 demethylates K370me2 in p53 to regulate its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Huang <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). As NO66 does not affect the activation of several other promoters by specific activators, the inhibition of Osx activity by NO66 in transient transfection experiments was highly specific, which we attribute to direct interaction between Osx and NO66.</p><p>A physiological role for NO66 during osteoblast differentiation is strongly supported by the acceleration of differentiation and the marked increase in expression of osteoblast marker genes during the spontaneous differentiation of MC3T3 preosteoblasts stably transfected with a NO66-shRNA. One possible reason among others for the premature increase in alkaline phosphatase in MC3T3 cells containing a NO66-specific shRNA would be that NO66 regulates the activity of other factors needed for upregulation of early markers in osteoblasts, a hypothesis that needs to be tested. In this context, it is important to note that ectopically expressed Osx in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) increased expression and activity of alkaline phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Tu <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>During osteoblast differentiation both in intact mouse embryos and after BMP-2 addition to preosteoblasts in culture, there is a sequential activation of osteoblast marker genes starting with <italic>Runx2</italic> and <italic>Osx</italic> and continuing later with Osx target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Nakashima <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). Despite the constant cellular levels of NO66 after BMP-2 addition to MC3T3 cells, the occupancy of NO66 at the endogenous <italic>Bsp</italic> and <italic>Oc</italic> promoters decreased. In contrast, occupancy of Osx, acetylation of histone H3, Wdr5, and Pol II at these promoters increased, consistent with active transcription of these genes during osteoblast differentiation. Our data further suggest that the hypothesis that depletion of NO66 from these genes could be due to recruitment of Osx and chromatin modifying enzymes involving histone or factor acetylation and methylation, thus altering the chromatin from a repressed to an active state, although, the exact mechanism by which this occurs is not known.</p><p>The conserved histidine and lysine residues that are needed for co-factor binding in other JHDMs are also present in NO66. As substitution mutations in these conserved residues abrogated the demethylation activity of NO66 and because NO66 was unable to demethylate H3K4me3 in the absence of co-factors, we conclude that, like other JHDMs, NO66 is a co-factor-dependent JmjC histone demethylase. Several other known demethylases, including JMJD2A/2B/2C (KDM4A/4B/4C) and yeast Rph1 possess dual substrate specificity for both H3K9me and H3K36me; LSD1 (KDM1) has substrate specificity for both H3K4me and H3K9me (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Allis <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, the dual substrate specificity we observe for NO66 for H3K4me and H3K36me is so far unique in that it targets these two markers of transcriptionally active chromatin.</p><p>The NO66 belongs to the &#x02018;JmjC-domain only' subfamily and lacks other functional motifs that are present in other JHDMs, including PHD, tudor, bromo, C5HC2- and CXXC-zinc finger, FBOX, Bright/Arid, or TPR domains. These motifs are thought to mediate interactions between JmjC-containing proteins and histones or other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Klose <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Additional studies will need to delineate domains in NO66 that mediate such interactions.</p><p>In summary, our results provide, to the best of knowledge, the first evidence that a specific JmjC family histone demethylase, NO66, controls the activity of a &#x02018;master' transcription factor that is essential for osteoblast differentiation and bone development. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments of NO66 in osteoblasts of mice should elucidate in greater detail the physiological role of NO66 during embryonic development and post-natally.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Generation of cell lines stably transfected with an inducible Osx expression vector</title><p>Mouse C2C12 cells were stably transfected with pTet-off (Clontech) and selected on neomycin (G418).

The antibodies specific to Osx, NO66, and rabbit IgG for control were first conjugated to magnetic coated protein G beads (Magnetic Dyna beads-Protein G, Invitrogen, CA), which were previously blocked with 0.5&#x00025; BSA in PBS. After overnight immunoprecipitation at 4&#x000b0;C with rotation, immunoprecipitated complexes were collected using a magnetic stand. Washing, reversal of cross-links, and purification of DNA from immunocomplexes were done using EZ-ChIP kit (Millipore) as per manufacturer's instructions. For sequential ChIP experiments, chromatins prepared from C2-Osx cells were immunoprecipitated by HA&#x02013;epitope antibody (ab9110, Abcam) and control IgG antibodies. Flag&#x02013;HA&#x02013;Osx-bound chromatin fragments were released from &#x003b1;-HA antibody with HA peptides (1 mg/ml, Roche Diagnostics, USA), which specifically eluted Flag&#x02013;HA&#x02013;Osx-bound chromatin, and then further re-immunoprecipitated with &#x003b1;-NO66 antibody in the presence of 50 &#x003bc;g/ml yeast tRNA and 5 mg/ml BSA. All other conditions were essentially same as described above.</p><p>Quantitative PCR reactions were performed with 500 nM of primers, 5 &#x003bc;l of 2 &#x000d7; SYBR green I PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), 2 &#x003bc;l DNA in a total 10 &#x003bc;l reaction volume. Results were computed as percent antibody bound per input and data were shown after subtracting control IgG values. Representative ChIP assays of at least three independent experiments are shown for which qPCR triplicate assays were performed. The experimental error of triplicate PCR assay is shown by error bar. Primers used for qPCR were tested first with input DNA to analyse a linear range of amplification. Primer sequences are available on the request.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Generation of polyclonal rabbit anti-NO66 antibody</title><p>Rabbit &#x003b1;-NO66 antibody was generated against the peptide epitope (SYPEFVRVGDLPCDSVED), which is conserved at the C-terminus in mouse, rat, and human NO66 protein, and antiserum was affinity-purified on peptide-conjugated matrices (service provided by Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="N0x224bbe0N0x3543250" content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Supplementary Figures S1&#x02013;10</p></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="emboj2009332s1.doc"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="N0x224bbe0N0x35432b0" content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Original scans</p></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="emboj2009332s2.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="N0x224bbe0N0x3543310" content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Review Process File</p></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="emboj2009332s3.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs Ryuji Kobayashi and David Hawke for their technical help in performing peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry; Henry Adams for assistance with deconvolution microscopy; Lingna Zhang and Shelley Stephens for technical assistance.
