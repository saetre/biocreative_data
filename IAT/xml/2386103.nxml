Myelin-forming cells remain remarkably plastic and can revert to the immature phenotype, a process which is seen in injured nerves and demyelinating neuropathies. We report that c-Jun is an important regulator of this plasticity. At physiological levels, c-Jun inhibits myelin gene activation by Krox-20 or cyclic adenosine monophosphate. c-Jun also drives myelinating cells back to the immature state in transected nerves in vivo. Enforced c-Jun expression inhibits myelination in cocultures. Furthermore, c-Jun and Krox-20 show a cross-antagonistic functional relationship. c-Jun therefore negatively regulates the myelinating Schwann cell phenotype, representing a signal that functionally stands in opposition to the promyelin transcription factors. Negative regulation of myelination is likely to have significant implications for three areas of Schwann cell biology: the molecular analysis of plasticity, demyelinating pathologies, and the response of peripheral nerves to injury.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>D.B.

Myelinating cells readily lose their myelin and can dedifferentiate to a phenotype that resembles the immature state, and this transition, like myelination, involves a complex and orderly cellular transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jessen and Mirsky, 2005</xref>). It is an important possibility that this reverse transition also requires distinct gene regulatory proteins that would function as negative regulators of the myelinated state and push myelinating cells back toward the immature phenotype. In this paper, we identify the basic leucine zipper protein c-Jun as a transcription factor that acts in this way in Schwann cells.</p><p>The ability of myelinating cells to dedifferentiate is seen when they are removed from axonal contact in injured nerves or in vitro and also in demyelinating neuropathies. Remarkably, dedifferentiated cells, even in adults, can remyelinate if they are allowed to associate with axons under appropriate conditions. Potentially, this choice between two alternative differentiation states is therefore open to Schwann cells throughout life. Studies of gene regulatory proteins that control the choice between two alternative fates have revealed the importance of cross-antagonistic signaling systems where a major role in fate choice is played by the balance between two sets of transcription factors that both specify alternative fates and inhibit the expression or the activity of each other. Examples of this include the GATA-1/c-Myb and GATA-1/PU.1 transcription factors in erythrocyte development and Scl(Tal1)/Olig2 in astrocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cantor and Orkin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Muroyama et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In Schwann cells, specification of myelin differentiation is dependent on the zinc finger transcription factor Krox-20 (Egr2). It is activated by the axonal signals that induce myelination. Krox-20<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Schwann cells fail to myelinate, although they enter the earliest stage of myelination, the promyelin state. Enforced expression of Krox-20 in Schwann cells is sufficient to induce expression of myelin genes, remove cells from the cell cycle, and reduce susceptibility to apoptosis, all of which are developmental changes that normally take place when myelination begins. Expression of Krox-20 therefore sets in train and/or amplifies a set of changes associated with the adoption of a myelin fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nagarajan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Topilko and Meijer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parkinson et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The transcription factor c-Jun, which is studied here, is a key component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex and forms, with JunB and JunD, the Jun protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mechta-Grigoriou et al., 2001</xref>). Although the phosphorylation of c-Jun at NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal Ser-63 and -73 residues by JNK is important for many of its functions, other actions of c-Jun are independent of c-Jun phosphorylation but dependent on the presence of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raivich and Behrens, 2006</xref>). c-Jun is present in immature Schwann cells, but its expression is repressed by Krox-20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parkinson et al., 2004</xref>). Schwann cells therefore express low levels of c-Jun when they start myelinating.</p><p>In this paper, we report that c-Jun is an important regulator of Schwann cell differentiation because c-Jun acts as a potent suppressor of the myelin phenotype. This function is independent of its role in proliferation and death. c-Jun blocks myelination in neuron&#x02013;Schwann cell cocultures, opposes the function of Krox-20 and cAMP-related myelin signals, and drives the dedifferentiation of early myelinating cells back to the immature Schwann cell phenotype. This effect is seen in injured nerves both in vivo and in vitro, using mice with conditional inactivation of c-Jun in Schwann cells. Some of these effects of c-Jun are possibly channeled through Sox-2, a transcription factor that inhibits myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Le et al., 2005b</xref>). We also show that c-Jun inhibits Krox-20 expression, suggesting that these proteins are components of a cross-inhibitory switch to control two alternative gene programs: while Krox-20 drives the myelination program, c-Jun is a negative regulator of myelination that promotes the opposite program of dedifferentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>c-Jun and phosphorylated c-Jun are down-regulated during myelin differentiation and rapidly up-regulated as myelin breaks down in injured nerves</title><p>In early postnatal Schwann cells, c-Jun protein is down-regulated as proliferation decreases and myelination begins. When it is reexpressed when nerves are injured, Schwann cells reenter the cell cycle and dedifferentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Felipe and Hunt, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stewart, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shy et al., 1996</xref>). We confirmed this for c-Jun, phospho&#x02013;c-Jun, JNK 1 and 2, and phospho-JNK1/2. Up-regulation of these components after nerve injury, particularly of phospho-JNK1/2, was very rapid (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;C</xref>). When purified cultures of primary Schwann cells were exposed to dibutyryl cAMP (db-cAMP) to induce myelin differentiation, c-Jun and phospho&#x02013;c-Jun were suppressed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D&#x02013;H</xref>), which is in line with the down-regulation of c-Jun during myelination in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Monuki et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stewart, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shy et al., 1996</xref>). Unlike in vivo, activation of myelin differentiation in these experiments did not involve cell cycle exit because the cells were quiescent before and after addition of db-cAMP (unpublished data).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Components of the c-Jun pathway are regulated during development, Wallerian degeneration, and in vitro differentiation.</bold> A&#x02013;D show Western blots.

However, when proliferating Schwann cells are removed from perinatal nerves and made quiescent in vitro, they continue to express c-Jun, showing that c-Jun expression is not sufficient for proliferation. Furthermore, when quiescent cells are induced by cAMP or enforced Krox-20 expression to adopt a myelin phenotype, c-Jun is down-regulated even when cell division is absent throughout the experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parkinson et al., 2004</xref>; previous paragraph). Therefore, both in vivo and in vitro, c-Jun expression is suppressed as Schwann cells myelinate. But only in vivo is this correlated with exit from the cell cycle. These observations led us to examine whether down-regulation of c-Jun is important for the activation of the myelination program itself in addition to, and irrespective of, the role of this factor in cell cycle control.</p></sec><sec><title>c-Jun inhibits myelin gene expression</title><p>As mentioned in the previous section, c-Jun is expressed constitutively in quiescent cells maintained under basal conditions in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Felipe and Hunt, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stewart, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shy et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parkinson et al., 2004</xref>; unpublished data). We took advantage of this to test whether c-Jun inhibits myelin differentiation by comparing Krox-20&#x02013;induced myelin gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parkinson et al., 2004</xref>) in normal c-Jun&#x02013;expressing cells with that in c<italic>-Jun</italic>&#x02013;null cells.

They show that in normal cultured Schwann cells, constitutive c-Jun appears sufficient to act as a break on the transition of quiescent immature Schwann cells to the myelin phenotype. The inhibitory effect of c-Jun does not depend on enforced overexpression of c-Jun nor is it contingent on the role of c-Jun in Schwann cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec><title>c-Jun inhibits myelin genes without N-terminal phosphorylation</title><p>The experiments discussed in the previous section showed that genetic removal of c-Jun amplified Krox-20&#x02013; or cAMP-induced myelin differentiation, despite the fact that both agents gradually suppress endogenous c-Jun and reduce it to very low levels by 2&#x02013;3 d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parkinson et al., 2004</xref> and above). We then tested whether prevention of this down-regulation and maintenance of c-Jun expression would have the opposite effect and inhibit myelin gene activation because this would be the predicted outcome if c-Jun acts as a negative regulator of the myelin program.</p><p>By gene transfection, we enforced expression of two different c-Jun molecules: Jun(Asp), in which all potential N-terminal phosphorylation sites have been mutated to aspartic acid, which mimics phosphorylated c-Jun; and Jun(Ala), in which all potential N-terminal phosphorylation sites are mutated to alanine and therefore cannot be phosphorylated by JNK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Papavassiliou et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Watson et al., 1998</xref>).

This cascade is thought to be an important activator of c-Jun signaling in several cell types. We therefore tested whether MKK7 would inhibit myelin differentiation.</p><p>By infecting cells with an MKK7-expressing adenovirus, we found that MKK7 was a powerful inhibitor of Krox-20&#x02013; or db-cAMP&#x02013;induced myelin gene expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). Enforced MKK7 expression also activated c-Jun in the Krox-20&#x02013;expressing cells, in which c-Jun would normally be reduced to undetectable levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C&#x02013;F</xref>). Similarly, MKK7 elevated c-Jun protein in cells in which c-Jun had been suppressed by db-cAMP (see <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>). This suggested that MKK7 inhibited myelin genes by activating c-Jun. To demonstrate this, we compared the effect of MKK7 in <italic>c-Jun</italic>&#x02013;null cells with that in control cells. As expected from the Western blots (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>), MKK7 significantly (P &#x0003c; 0.001) reduced the number of control cells that expressed periaxin in response to Krox-20 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 G</xref>). Importantly, this inhibitory effect was abolished in <italic>c-Jun</italic>&#x02013;null cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 G</xref>).

We verified that myelination in these cultures was associated with c-Jun down-regulation, as seen both in vivo and in response to Krox-20 expression. Double immunolabeling of myelinating Schwann cell/DRG cultures with antibodies to periaxin and c-Jun confirmed that &#x02265;90% of the periaxin-positive myelinating cells no longer expressed c-Jun (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A&#x02013;C</xref>). The remaining periaxin-positive cells showed weak c-Jun labeling, perhaps reflecting suboptimal conditions for myelination in vitro because c-Jun&#x02013;positive nuclei are not seen in myelinating cells of normal nerves in vivo. To determine whether enforced c-Jun expression inhibits myelination, Schwann cells were retrovirally infected with either empty vector (BP2) or vector expressing a c-Jun&#x02013;estrogen receptor fusion protein (BP2/cJunER), in which the transcriptional activity of c-Jun can be activated by the addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bossy-Wetzel et al., 1997</xref>). 2 wk after seeding purified neurons with either control (BP2) or cJunER-expressing (BP2/cJunER) cells, the cocultures were induced to myelinate by addition of ascorbate in the presence of 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M 4-hydroxytamoxifen to activate the cJunER protein. 2 wk later, the cultures were immunolabeled for myelin basic protein (MBP) to identify myelinating cells, and the total number of myelinating Schwann cells per coverslip was counted. We found that activation of c-Jun significantly (P &#x0003c; 0.01) inhibited myelination (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). In related experiments, we also induced c-Jun in DRG/c-JunER Schwann cell cocultures with tamoxifen, 2 wk after ascorbate had been added to induce myelination. In this case too there was a substantial reduction in the number of myelin segments relative to that seen in control cultures without tamoxifen, indicating that induction of c-Jun can exert effects both early and late in the myelination program (see Materials and methods).</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>c-Jun expression inhibits myelination in Schwann cell/DRG neuron cocultures.</bold> (A and B) c-Jun is down-regulated in myelinating cells.

Because c-Jun potentially blocks the forward transition toward myelination, we investigated whether c-Jun was also required for, or promoted, the reverse transition back to the immature phenotype. This possibility was also raised by two previous observations, namely the reactivation of c-Jun in demyelinating cocultures and the finding that delayed activation of c-Jun reversed myelin gene expression already established through enforced Krox-20 expression.</p><p>To test this, we examined the rate of dedifferentiation of neonatal myelinating cells in the absence of c-Jun. To obtain such cells, we used <italic>c-Jun</italic>&#x02013;null Schwann cells from mice in which floxed <italic>c-Jun</italic> (<italic>Jun</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>) had been excised in Schwann cells selectively by breeding with <italic>P<sub>0</sub>-CRE</italic> mice (see Materials and methods). No obvious morphological or immunohistochemical abnormalities were noted in these nerves by a morphological examination (and adult nerves contained the expected numbers of apparently normal myelinated and unmyelinated fibers; unpublished data). Actively myelinating cells were removed from axonal contact by dissociating neonatal nerves (postnatal day [P] 2&#x02013;5) and plating the cells in culture. In wild-type cultures, c-Jun, which had been down-regulated in myelinating cells, was rapidly reexpressed after plating and seen in the large majority of myelinating cells by 6 h, whereas cultures from c-Jun&#x02013;null animals were essentially c-Jun negative (unpublished data). In other cultures maintained for 5&#x02013;7 d, immunolabeling showed that 100% of control cells (<italic>Jun</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>; <italic>P<sub>0</sub>-CRE</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) had c-Jun&#x02013;positive nuclei, whereas &#x02264;5% of cells from <italic>c-Jun</italic>&#x02013;null mice (<italic>Jun</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>; <italic>P<sub>0</sub>-CRE</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) expressed c-Jun, indicating effective removal of c-Jun.

We found that c-Jun suppressed Krox-20 in several types of experiment. First, enforced c-Jun expression in wild-type cells, using <italic>Jun(Asp)</italic> or <italic>Jun(Ala)</italic>, completely blocked Krox-20 expression in response to db-cAMP elevation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, A and B</xref>; and not depicted). Second, db-cAMP&#x02013;induced Krox-20 expression was blocked when c-Jun was activated by enforced expression of the upstream kinase MKK7 and the results were analyzed by Western blot (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>). Note that MKK7 also prevented the db-cAMP&#x02013;induced down-regulation of c-Jun protein and phospho&#x02013;c-Jun. Lastly, we examined the loss of Krox-20 that is seen when neonatal myelinating cells are removed from axonal contact and placed in culture (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, D&#x02013;G</xref>). When cells from control P2 nerves were plated in DM, Krox-20 protein expression disappeared within 24 h as expected. But when cells from <italic>c-Jun</italic>&#x02013;null nerves were used, robust Krox-20 immunoreactivity remained in many cells at 2 d (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 G</xref>), although Krox-20 immunolabeling decreased and eventually disappeared thereafter (not depicted). Therefore, when myelinating cells from normal neonatal nerves lose axonal contact, the resulting reactivation of c-Jun (above) contributes significantly to the rapid drop in Krox-20 that is seen under these circumstances.</p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Cross-inhibitory relationship between c-Jun and Krox-20.</bold> (A and B) Cells cotransfected with empty GFP vector (to visualize transfected cells) and an empty control vector (EV; A) or a <italic>Jun(Asp)</italic> vector (B).

Enforced c-Jun expression also inhibits myelination in cocultures. When early myelinating cells are released from axon-associated promyelin signals and placed in culture, the resulting c-Jun activation drives the cells back to the immature state. Also in vivo, reactivation of c-Jun after injury of neonatal nerves pushes early myelinating cells toward demyelination. In previous work, we also showed that c-Jun is important for events that characterize the immature but not myelinating state, namely cell death and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parkinson et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The most striking abnormality in early postnatal nerves in conditional <italic>c-Jun</italic>&#x02013;null mice is the failure of myelinating cells to dedifferentiate normally after injury. It is therefore likely that the negative influence of c-Jun on myelin differentiation that we have documented is, in vivo, more important for pushing the dedifferentiation program in injured or pathological nerves than for the regulation of myelination during normal development.</p><p>Consistent with the involvement of Krox-20 and c-Jun in antagonistic programs, expression of these factors is mutually exclusive: immature cells express relatively high levels of c-Jun and low levels of Krox-20, switching to high levels of Krox-20 and low levels of c-Jun in myelinating cells. In cut or crushed nerves, Krox-20 falls and c-Jun is reexpressed at high levels as cells transit back to the immature state. Furthermore, c-Jun and Krox-20 show a cross-antagonistic functional relationship because expression of Krox-20 suppresses c-Jun and enforced expression of c-Jun suppresses Krox-20.</p><p>c-Jun is therefore a transcription factor that negatively regulates the myelinating Schwann cell phenotype, representing a signal which functionally stands in opposition to the network of promyelin transcription factors, which includes Oct-6, Brn2, NF&#x003ba;B, Sox-10, and Nab1 and 2, in addition to the key role of Krox-20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Topilko et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nagarajan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jaegle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Le et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ghislain and Charnay, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">LeBlanc et al., 2006</xref>). Negative regulation of myelin differentiation is likely to emerge as a major aspect of Schwann cell biology, with particular importance for plasticity, demyelinating pathology, and responses to injury and regeneration, in addition to developmental regulation. It is also likely that the molecular machinery of myelin suppression will turn out to be equally complex to that of its promyelin counterpart. Thus, inducible nitric oxide synthase, Sox-2, Erk1/2 activation, and Notch signaling have all been implicated in negative control of myelin differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrisingh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ogata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Le et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agthong et al., 2006</xref>; Woodhoo, A., M. Duran, K.R. Jessen, and R. Mirsky. 2004. <italic>Differentiation</italic>. Abstr. 119). Similarly, the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, although important for events immediately before myelination, also accelerates demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fragoso et al., 2003</xref>; unpublished data), and delayed demyelination is seen in mice with genetic inactivation of Toll receptors, nitric oxide synthase, phospholipase A2, and matrix metalloprotease 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shubayev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boivin et al., 2007</xref>). In future work, it will be important to learn about the functional interactions between the different signaling systems that are emerging as potential myelin suppressors.</p><p>We find that Krox-20 represses both c-Jun and Sox-2 and that, in the absence of Krox-20, c-Jun is highly expressed in Schwann cells without the need for specific extrinsic signaling. Therefore, the loss of Krox-20 that follows nerve cut or crush is likely to allow the cells to resume their constitutive c-Jun expression. This will help push the cells toward dedifferentiation and promote proliferation as seen in Wallerian degeneration. A similar mechanism is likely to be operative during the dedifferentiation and proliferation that takes place when Krox-20 is genetically inactivated in adult nerves without axon transection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Decker et al., 2006</xref>). The way in which c-Jun and Sox-2 interact during these events remains to be examined.</p><p>Although we have shown previously that in Schwann cells, as in other cell types, c-Jun has a role in controlling proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parkinson et al., 2004</xref>), this effect can be clearly dissociated from the negative regulation of myelin differentiation. Several of the present experiments demonstrate this, including those in which genetic removal of c-Jun amplifies myelin gene expression in response to Krox-20 or cAMP and where myelin gene activation by these signals is inhibited by enforced expression of Jun or JNK activation by MKK7. It is also seen when clearance of Krox-20 and myelin proteins from early myelinating cells that have been removed from axons and placed in DM is accelerated by c-Jun or JunAA. In all these cases, Jun inhibits myelination or drives demyelination under conditions where Schwann cells are not dividing.</p><p>Suppression of myelination by c-Jun can also be dissociated from the classical N-terminal phosphorylation of c-Jun typically performed by JNK. Rather, suppression of the myelin phenotype appears to depend on the levels of the c-Jun protein itself. This can be seen from the fact that Jun(Ala), in which all potential N-terminal phosphorylation sites are absent, suppressed Krox-20&#x02013;induced myelin gene expression as effectively as Jun(Asp), in which the N-terminal phosphorylation sites have been mutated to aspartic acid to mimic the active phosphorylated c-Jun. It is also evident from the observation that normal c-Jun and nonphosphorylatable c-Jun (in cells from <italic>JunAA</italic> mice) appear to be equally effective at driving down myelin gene expression in experiments where neonatal myelinating cells are removed from axonal contact and placed in culture. This is in line with results from other systems, where phosphorylation of c-Jun by JNK is not required for all its actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrens et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raivich and Behrens, 2006</xref>). The JNK pathway may instead function to control c-Jun protein levels, in part by modulating the activity of several transcription factors that together regulate the <italic>c</italic>-<italic>jun</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Besirli et al., 2005</xref>), which is a situation that would explain the effects of the JNK activator MKK7 in our experiments.</p><p>In injured nerves, loss of myelin differentiation is a beneficial response that helps axonal regeneration and repair. But the loss of myelin differentiation in demyelinating neuropathies, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1A and Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome, is unhelpful and leads to disability. From a clinical standpoint, it will be important to determine whether c-Jun is a component of the mechanism that pushes myelinating cells toward demyelination in these pathological conditions because this would open new avenues for clinical intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>HA-tagged Jun(Asp)- and Jun(Ala)-expressing plasmids were obtained from Dirk Bohmann (University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Papavassiliou et al., 1995</xref>).

DRG neurons were seeded with either control infected (BP2) or cJunER (BP2/cJunER)-expressing Schwann cells and exposed to 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M 4-hydroxytamoxifen to activate cJunER. For dissociated DRG cultures, DRG were dissected from E15 rats and dissociated by trypsin/collagenase digestion. Cells were plated on PDL/laminin-coated glass coverslips in MEM/10% FCS supplemented with 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> M insulin, 0.3% glucose, and 50 ng/ml NGF. Cultures were pulsed twice for 72 h with 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> M cytosine arabinoside to remove endogenous fibroblasts and Schwann cells. Approximately 2 wk after plating, the pure DRG neurons were seeded with either control infected (BP2) or cJunER (BP2/cJunER)-expressing Schwann cells. Cultures were maintained for a further 2 wk to allow Schwann cell proliferation and association with axons before treatment for a further 2 wk with medium containing 50 ng/ml ascorbate, to induce basal lamina and myelination, and 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M 4-hydroxytamoxifen. The number of myelin segments per coverslip was determined after immunolabeling with MBP antibodies. Separate cultures were maintained without seeding exogenous Schwann cells to ensure that there were no endogenous Schwann cells contributing to myelination. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and data are from four independent experiments.</p><p>In other experiments, we added tamoxifen 10&#x02013;14 d after c-JunER Schwann cells had been induced to myelinate by addition of ascorbate. The tamoxifen was added for 4&#x02013;6 d before fixation and immunolabeling for MBP. In this case also there was a substantial reduction in the number of myelin segments relative to control cultures, indicating that induction of c-Jun is able to exert effects both early and late in the myelination program. In two experiments, with a total of 10 experimental and 10 control coverslips, the mean reduction in the total number of myelin segments was 92.1% in cultures to which tamoxifen had been added. In related experiments, we also showed that delayed activation of c-Jun could reverse Krox-20&#x02013;induced P<sub>0</sub> expression in cultured c-JunER Schwann cells in which P<sub>0</sub> expression was already established by adenoviral expression of Krox-20. Cells expressing cJunER were infected with Krox-20 adenovirus and c-Jun was activated 3 d later by addition of tamoxifen for 3 d before fixation and immunolabeling with P<sub>0</sub> antibodies.
