They are characterized by a bipartite structure with a conserved C-terminal core domain and a unique N-terminal domain that varies in length and amino acid composition. The C-terminal domain is formed by either a four- or eightfold repeat of approximately 70 amino acids, each repeat carrying a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site, and is responsible for phospholipid binding. The N-terminal regions are thought to confer functional diversity to the annexin proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The biochemical features in vitro were analyzed extensively, but the in vivo functions of annexins remain unclear.</p><p>Annexin A7, the first annexin to be described, was isolated as the agent that mediated aggregation of chromaffin granules and fusion of membranes and phospholipids in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Expression studies demonstrated the distribution of Annexin A7 in a wide variety of tissues and cells mainly enriched in the cytosol in close association with membranous structures, but it was also described in the nucleus of adrenal chromaffin cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The presence of an alternatively spliced cassette exon gives rise to two Annexin A7 isoforms corresponding in molecular mass to 47 kDa and 51 kDa. The isoforms differ in their N-terminal domain and exhibit a tissue-specific expression pattern. The 47 kDa isoform is present in all tissues except for skeletal muscle, where the 51 kDa isoform is exclusively present. Heart muscle, brain tissue and red blood cells contain both isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Previous studies indicated that the subcellular localization of Annexin A7 changes during myoblast differentiation. In undifferentiated cells the protein is equally distributed between cytosol and membrane fractions while in differentiated cells it is exclusively present in the membrane fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Reports by Clemen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and Herr et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] demonstrated roles for Annexin A7 in shape and osmotic resistance of red blood cells, platelet aggregation velocity, and in the velocity of spreading astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-waves. Annexin A7 is also involved in the maintenance of regular cardiac electrophysiology and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-homeostasis [Schrickel et al., submitted]. Detailed reports on appearance and distribution of Annexin A7 during brain development are not available. In the present study we focus on the distribution of Annexin A7 in the developing brain of mice embryos between E5 and E16, and in the adult mouse brain.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Annexin A7 is expressed in the early mouse embryo</title><p>First we examined the expression of Annexin A7 in ES cells (Bruce4, established from C57BL/6J mice) and the early stages of mouse embryonic development at the mRNA level by northern blot analysis and at the protein level by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Northern blot analysis shows in ES-cells and at embryonic days E7, E11, E15, and E17 two mRNA species of 1.8 kb and 2.4 kb, which result from alternative splicing in the untranslated 3'end (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We found similar Annexin A7 mRNA levels in the four embryonic stages. Reprobing with a &#x003b2;-actin probe verified equal loading; the appearance of a faster migrating mRNA species in addition to the 2.0 kb species is characteristic for &#x003b2;-actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. On the protein level, ES cells express only the smaller Annexin A7 isoform of 47 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, neuro-2a cells and heart tissue are included for control).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of Annexin A7. </bold>(<bold>A</bold>) Northern blot analysis of RNA from ES-cells and embryos E7, E11, E15, E17 probed with a full length annexin A7 cDNA. Transcripts of 1.8 and 2.4 kb are detected in all stages examined (upper panel). Reprobing with a &#x003b2;-actin probe verified equal loading (lower panel, 2.0 kb band). (<bold>B</bold>) Murine ES cells (ES) express only the small Annexin A7 isoform. Both isoforms are expressed in neuroblastoma neuro-2a cells (N2A), heart (HRT) and brain tissue (CNS) from adult mice. Proteins from neuro-2a and ES cells, heart and brain were resolved by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The Western blot was probed with mAb 203&#x02013;217 followed by incubation with a peroxidase coupled secondary antibody. Detection was with enhanced chemiluminescence.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2202-6-25-1"/></fig><p>Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of the protein during early development. Annexin A7 immunoreactivity using mAb 203&#x02013;217, which specifically recognizes both isoforms of Annexin A7, can be observed in the two cell types of the cylinder stage at E5 with a weaker Annexin A7 expression in the ectoderm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;C</xref>). At E8 Annexin A7 can be detected in almost all tissues of the embryo (data not shown). A correlation between the presence of Annexin A7 and the origin of a cell type from one of the three germ layers is not apparent. We specifically noted the localization of the protein in the neuroepithelium of the neural fold and tube (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D&#x02013;F</xref>, proximal, E8; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G&#x02013;I</xref>, distal, E13). At the subcellular level, Annexin A7 was present in punctate structures mainly in the cytosol of all examined cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E,F</xref>). This distribution was also observed during subsequent development.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Annexin A7 immunoreactivity in early mouse embryos. </bold>(<bold>A</bold>) Phase contrast, embryo E5: The egg cylinder consists of an inner cell mass (a) representing the ectoderm and an outer layer of endoderm cells (b). <bold>(B) </bold>Immunostaining of the paraffin section was performed using purified mAb 203&#x02013;217 and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG.

At E13&#x02013;E16 in transverse sections of the embryonic brain, most of the immunoreactive cells are present in the ventricular germinative zone surrounding the lateral ventricle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, overview E16; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H</xref>, overview E13). A closer inspection revealed that Annexin A7 is mainly localized in the cytosol at E13 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B,E</xref>). During further development the immature cells have rounded up two days later, but they retain Annexin A7 in the cytosol at E15 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C,F</xref>). At E16 we observed the first prominent nuclear staining of Annexin A7 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D,G</xref>) in cells of the intermediate zone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3I</xref>, oval), which contains neurons radially migrating towards the growing neopallium cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and also glial cells forming the white matter of the adult cortex. Cells located marginally in the neopallial cortex also exhibit a nuclear stain. Labelling in the ventricular germinative zone is less prominent and the cytosol is no longer more strongly stained than the nucleus.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Subcellular localization of Annexin A7 in embryos E13, E15 and E16. </bold>Paraffin sections of embryonic brain were stained with purified mAb 203&#x02013;217.

In general, we observed two characteristic staining patterns for Annexin A7, a prominent nuclear stain in neurons (determined by lack of GFAP-immunoreactivity, localization, morphology) and a cytoplasmic and nuclear stain in astrocytes (GFAP-positive) in all areas of the mature murine brain. In the neocortex (isocortex) Annexin A7 was strongly enriched in nuclei of neurons of all six cortical laminae (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, section derived from cortex temporalis). For control, in the adult brain type-1 astrocytes can be characterized by a positive GFAP-stain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref> demonstrates the presence of nuclear Annexin A7 in a neocortical neuron of the external granular layer (layer II) and in an astrocytic cell of the neocortical molecular layer (layer I) which additionally exhibits an intense signal in the cytoplasm and in cellular branches. A further cell type of the isocortex showed a strong immunoreactivity in both, nucleus and cytosol, and was identified as pyramidal neuron based on morphology and absence of GFAP immunoreactivity. However, Annexin A7 apparently is more enriched in the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Annexin A7 is present in neurons and astrocytes of the cortex temporalis and hippocampal formation of 10-weeks-old mice. </bold>(<bold>A</bold>) Low magnification of the cortex temporalis presents an Annexin A7 expression in cells of the pial border, in neurons of all six isocortical laminae, and a weak signal in the adjacent white matter.

The astrocytes are mainly localized in the area between cells exhibiting nuclear Annexin A7 staining and show the protein also in the nucleus and the cytoplasm (data not shown). When we analyzed the pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus at a higher magnification we found that Annexin A7 again mainly localized to the nuclei (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>). Polyclonal antibodies gave a similar staining pattern (data not shown). The intense nuclear staining was absent in controls either stained only with the secondary antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>) or in brain sections derived from <italic>AnxA7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice stained for Annexin A7 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H</xref>). The residual staining seen in the <italic>AnxA7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>brain is unspecific as it is also present in corresponding negative controls lacking the primary antibody. The absence of Annexin A7 protein in brain and other tissues of the <italic>AnxA7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mouse has been verified in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In another actual study of the knock out mouse we detected a thickened basal membrane and a widened intercellular space. This may cause unspecific binding of the secondary antibody.</p><p>An equal staining of Annexin A7 was also found in the cerebellum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Nuclei of neurons in the stratum granulosum show the most prominent staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C,D</xref>). In the stratum moleculare, which is poor in cell bodies of neurons, only a few dots appear which also correspond to nuclei of neurons. Astrocytes are also positive for Annexin A7 in the nuclei and cytoplasm (data not shown). The signal of the pial border and the prominent stain of the white matter tracts (laminae medullares) are due to Annexin A7 positive astrocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5 A&#x02013;C</xref>). Higher magnification of the boundary layer between stratum moleculare and granulosum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>) revealed an Annexin A7 signal in nuclei, but also in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane of Purkinje cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). The typical pair of dendrites points to the margin of the cerebellar cortex. The specificity of the Annexin A7 signal was further confirmed in similar brain sections of the <italic>AnxA7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mouse (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>). Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref> shows Annexin A7 in neurites (axons) connecting the laminae medullares with the Purkinje-cell layer. Most likely these are the axons of the Purkinje-cells. Apart from these efferent neurites the laminae medullares (lamina alba, white matter) contain afferent mossy and climbing fibers. Thus, the intense stain of the cerebellar white matter arises from Annexin A7 located in astrocytes and neurites.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Annexin A7 immunostaining in the cerebellum of adult mice. </bold>(<bold>A</bold>) Low magnification of the cerebellum presents an Annexin A7 expression mainly in cells of the stratum granulosum and laminae medullares.

These methods can result in moderate or strong specific antibody staining, but the detectability of other antigens might be decreased. Moreover, the optimal pre-treatment has to be individualised for each antigen.</p><p>To verify the presence of endogenous Annexin A7 in nuclei, we used a biochemical approach and purified nuclei from neuro-2a, PC-12, and C6 cells and treated them with a hypotonic extraction buffer to obtain the nucleoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). The nucleoplasm and the remaining nuclei, from which the nucleoplasm has been extracted partially, were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Western blots probed with mAb 203&#x02013;217 showed Annexin A7 in the nucleoplasm of neuronal (neuro-2a, PC-12) and astroglial (C6) cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>), however, the large isoform could only be clearly extracted with nucleoplasm from C6 cells. For control, antibodies against LAP2&#x003b1;, Emerin and tubulin were used to verify that the nucleoplasm (marker:LAP2&#x003b1;, which is anon-membrane-bound isoform of LAP2) was successfully extracted and also not contaminated by nuclear membranes (marker:Emerin) or by cytoplasm (marker:tubulin). Likewise, in these neuronal and astroglial cell lines Annexin A7 had been observed in the nucleus by immunofluorescence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref> and data not shown). We noticed no difference between PC-12 and neuro-2a cells, however, as for the brain sections, we found an increase of the Annexin A7 staining after pre-treatment with trypsin.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Nuclear localization of Annexin A7. </bold><bold>(A) </bold>Extraction of Annexin A7 from nuclei of neuronal (PC-12, N2A) and an astroglial (C6) cell line using a hypotonic buffer.

Northern blot and immunohistochemistry analysis show the expression of Annexin A7 in all embryonic tissues from day E5 on, the earliest day studied. Differentiating cells, like the neural ectoderm, which is the origin of the cells belonging to the nervous system, show Annexin A7 immunoreactivity mainly in the cytosol. Endodermal as well as mesodermal cells exhibit a similar subcellular localization of the protein.</p><p>In the developing brain we noted a striking change in the subcellular distribution of Annexin A7. Cells in the stratum germinativum of the neopallial cortex, which surrounds the lateral ventricle, show at E13 and E15 a staining for Annexin A7 mainly in the cytosol. But this staining largely disappears and at the following day E16 we detect Annexin A7 in the nucleus of cells in the intermediate and marginal zone of the neopallium. The different expression patterns of Annexin A7-positive cells from the ventricular germinative zone to the marginal zone of the later neocortex observed in this study are similar to the developmental patterns of Tenascin-C-positive astroglial precursors following the guidance of the radial glial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Moreover, the patterns resemble that of migrating and differentiated neurons described by Berry et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Neurons that are generated prenatally in the proliferative ventricular layer of the neopallial cortex subsequently migrate through the intermediate zone to form the different cortical cell layers in a declining inside-out gradient of cell maturation. These observations suggested that the subcellular localization of Annexin A7 depends on developmental stage and cell type.</p><p>In the adult brain we generally observed a nuclear localization for Annexin A7 in neurons whereas astrocytes exhibited both a cytosolic as well as a nuclear staining. However, pyramidal neurons of the isocortex and Purkinje-cells of the cerebellum exhibited a cytosolic stain of intermediate intensity including their neurites and dendrites. We have previously reported the expression of Annexin A7 in human temporal neocortex and hippocampus obtained from neurosurgery for therapy-refractory epilepsy and found the two Annexin A7 isoforms restricted to the cytoplasm and nuclei of astrocytes, whereas neurons lacked any signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The hippocampal area showed typical signs of Ammon's horn sclerosis, but the adjacent temporal neocortex tissue did not show any histopathological alterations. This data is in discrepancy with our actual observation in the murine brain. To determine if this is due to different methods in immunofluorescence staining or indeed different expression patterns in mouse and human, we repeated the immunofluorescence of human brain. This time we investigated sections from human parietal cortex of autopsy brain. The astroglial expression of Annexin A7 could be confirmed, although not all astrocytes exhibited the nuclear staining. Pyramidal neurons however indicated a distinct staining of Annexin A7 most prominent along their dendrites. The different results obtained for the neurons may be explained by the fact that we previously used frozen tissue sections or that they were derived from patients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsia. On the other hand the actual human brain tissue used was from aged patients and did not correspond to the age of the mice included in this study. In cultured cells after cell damage or apoptosis (unpublished observations) or in cells treated with a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ionophore Annexin A7 translocated from the cytoplasm to cellular membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We therefore favor the hypothesis that Annexin A7 in the sensitive neurons of the human autopsy brain may have similarly translocated to the cellular membrane. This property of translocation and membrane binding is common to all annexins and commercially available kits for apoptosis detection employ recombinant AnnexinA5. The presence of nuclear Annexin A7 in murine brain was confirmed by controls using sections from the <italic>AnxA7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mouse and by a biochemical extraction of the protein from the nucleus. Both Annexin A7 isoforms described in brain tissue seemingly are expressed by neurons and astrocytes, which was shown using total cell extracts of cultured neuo-2a, PC-12, and C6 cells. In addition to their expression in brain, both Annexin A7 isoforms have only been described in heart muscle and red blood cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Although the inactivation of the annexin A7 gene did not interfere with the viability and development of knock out mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], their generation allowed us to address the role of Annexin A7 in specific cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Indeed, when we analyzed primary astrocytes from an <italic>AnxA7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mouse for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling processes, we found that they exhibited a significantly increased velocity of mechanically induced astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-waves as compared to wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This led us to propose, that Annexin A7 can act as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-buffer and is involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-homeostasis. In neurons Ca<sup>2+ </sup>ions play major roles in various physiological and pathophysiological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. One can speculate about an involvement of Annexin A7 in the regulation of these Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent processes, propositions that need further investigation. However, such roles are confirmed for heart function by studies of Schrickel et al. [submitted], who described an involvement of Annexin A7 in the maintenance of a regular cardiac electrophysiology and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-homeostasis.</p><p>An altered subcellular location during embryogenesis was also reported for Annexin A11. The developing gray matter of the rat embryonic spinal cord exhibited primarily nuclear localization of Annexin A11, while immunoreactivity was lost from the nuclei in the adult spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In contrast, our studies show a relocation of Annexin A7 from the cytosol to the nucleus in cells of the embryonic neuronal tissue. The Annexin A7 distribution is determined by a variety of factors. An important one appears to be Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which promotes binding of Annexin A7 to membranes and also allows aggregation of annexins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Binding partners of Annexin A7 such as sorcin might represent additional factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Although the members of the annexin family are generally found at the plasma membrane, in the cytoplasm or in association with the cytoskeleton, Annexins A1, A2, A4, A5 and A11 have been described to be localized at least partially in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Studies with human foreskin fibroblasts demonstrated that Annexin A1, A4 and A5 are all present in the nucleus at higher concentration than in the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Raising intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>led to relocation of these annexins to the nuclear membrane. An important role for annexins in mediating the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signal within the nuclei of the fibroblasts was proposed. These results mirror studies with stably transfected C6 cells, in which high intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentrations induced a marked redistribution of Annexin A7 from its localization in the nucleoplasm to the nuclear membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>None of the annexins contains a typical nuclear localization signal and their mechanism of nuclear import remains to be elucidated. For Annexin A11 it was shown that nuclear localization is mediated by its N-terminal region, which also contains a binding side for the S100 protein calcyclin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. More recently Tomas and Moss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] showed, that Annexin A11 and S100A6 assemble at the nuclear envelope during nuclear breakdown. Their role in this process is not known. In general it seems that the nuclear localization of the annexins is actively regulated. For example the nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization of Annexin A2 is controlled by sequestration of the AnxA2/p11 complex modulated by phosphorylation and by a nuclear export signal found in the AnxA2 3&#x02013;12 region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. One function of Annexin A2 in the nucleus, that appears not to involve binding of p11, has been suggested by its purification as part of a primer recognition protein complex that enhances DNA polymerase&#x003b1;-activity in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The annexins may participate in a nuclear response to initial cell stimulation or to a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transient, presumably by regulating DNA replication. For Annexin A7 such a pathway is very speculative at the moment. Future studies are however directed by these findings and will concentrate on the identification of the nuclear localization signal of Annexin A7 as well as on the role of Annexin A7 in the nuclear compartment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this article we report the translocation of Annexin A7 to nuclei of differentiating cells in the developing murine brain. In the adult brain Annexin A7 generally was detected in nuclei of neurons. Astrocytes, cerebellar Purkinje-cells and neocortical pyramidal neurons exhibited both, Annexin A7 in the cytosol and in the nuclei. Thus, the subcellular localisation of Annexin A7 depends on the developmental stage and the cell type. A role of Annexin A7 as well as of other annexins in nuclei remains speculative. The results obtained by immunofluorescence were confirmed by extraction of Annexin A7 from nuclei of neuronal and glial cell lines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and tissue preparation</title><p>129SV strain mice were used.
