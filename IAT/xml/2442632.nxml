Such differentiation of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells is determined by signals provided by components of the innate immune system and is subsequently stabilized by induction and repression of key transcriptional regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Recently, IL-17&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (Th17) have been identified as the key mediators of inflammation and tissue damage in several animal models of human diseases (for review see references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). The commitment of naive murine CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells to the Th17 lineage requires exposure to TGF-&#x003b2; and either IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>) or IL-21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). These cytokines act in a STAT3-dependent manner to induce expression of retinoid-related orphan receptor &#x003b3;t (ROR&#x003b3;t), the critical transcription factor necessary for the development of Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), which subsequently induces a set of effector molecules, including IL-17, IL-21, IL-22, and IL-23R plus several chemokines and other defense molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). In contrast to mice, much less is known about the requirements for generating human Th17 cells. Indeed, although there is consensus that TGF-&#x003b2; is not required for this process, and is actually inhibitory, controversy exists as to whether IL-6 or IL-23, in combination with IL-1&#x003b2;, is the predominant cue that mediates commitment of human naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells to the Th17 lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Given these differences, it is important to dissect further the molecular requirements for the development of human Th17 cells.</p><p>Although inappropriate Th17 differentiation helps explain autoimmune disease and inflammation, the physiological function of Th17 cells appears to lie in host protection against specific pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Based on the anatomical distribution of Th17 cells and the capacity of IL-17 to regulate granulopoiesis, neutrophil chemotaxis, and production of microbiocidal peptides by epithelium in mice, it is likely that Th17 cells confer immunity to pathogens on mucosal and possibly other epithelial surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). For instance, Th17 cells appear to have a predominant role in antifungal immune responses in both humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p><p>Hyper-IgE (HIES), or Job's, syndrome (OMIM 147060) is a primary immune deficiency characterized by abnormal susceptibility to a narrow spectrum of infections, most commonly <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Patients with HIES often suffer from mucocutaneous candidiasis, whereas local and invasive <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections lead to persistent eczematoid eruptions, recurrent skin and joint abscesses, and lung damage. In addition to recurrent tissue-destructive infections, the HIES phenotype includes coarse facies, osteopenia resulting in fractures after relatively minor trauma, scoliosis and craniosynostosis, delayed shedding of the primary dentition, and short stature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Patients also exhibit dramatic increases in serum IgE (&#x0003e;10 times normal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Recently, heterozygous missense mutations and short deletions in <italic>STAT3</italic> have been identified in the majority of HIES patients studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Despite the identification of the genetic cause of HIES, the mechanisms underlying the pathological features of this disease remain to be elucidated. Based on the observations that (a) defects in immunity to both <italic>Candida</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> are prominent features of HIES, especially at epithelial surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), (b) human Th17 cells have specificities for fungal antigens, including <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>), (c) heterozygous <italic>STAT3</italic> mutations are responsible for HIES in the majority of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), and (d) the development of murine Th17 cells is compromised in mice lacking expression of STAT3 in their CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), we hypothesized that <italic>STAT3</italic> mutations conferred specific susceptibility in humans with HIES to infection via an inability to generate Th17 cells.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Characteristics of HIES patients and <italic>STAT3</italic> mutations</title><p>Five unrelated patients with HIES were identified according to their clinical phenotype (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>).

It is important to emphasize that previous assessments of IFN-&#x003b3; production in HIES are inconsistent, which could also be due to heterogeneity of HIES cohorts before genotyping for <italic>STAT3</italic> became available. Indeed, recent evidence indicates that some HIES-like patients with normal STAT3 exhibit deficiencies of IFN-&#x003b3; production, whereas STAT3-deficient patients have no IFN-&#x003b3; defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells fail to differentiate into Th17 cells in vitro</title><p>Human naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells do not produce IL-17 when stimulated through CD3 and CD28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Thus, the detection of IL-17 in the cultures of total CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells activated with anti-CD3/CD28 mAb reflects production by memory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells that have differentiated to the Th17 lineage in vivo. The requirement of STAT3 in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell differentiation in vivo appears to be specific to the Th17 lineage because CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from HIES patients could give rise to effector cells with features of Th1-, Th2-, T reg&#x02013;, and T<sub>FH</sub>-type cells in vivo. Because STAT3 is ubiquitously expressed and functions downstream of numerous cytokine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), it was possible that the inability to generate Th17 cells in vivo was a consequence of a requirement for STAT3 function in non-CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, for instance antigen-presenting cells, that instruct the differentiation of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. It was therefore important to demonstrate an intrinsic requirement of STAT3 in naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells for their commitment to the Th17 lineage. Thus, naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were sort-purified and then cultured with beads coated with anti-CD2, anti-CD3, and anti-CD28 together with various combinations of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and IL-23. Secretion of IL-17A by normal CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells was not detected until the cells had been subjected to three rounds of stimulation in vitro with anti-CD2, anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 mAb-coated beads, and either IL-1&#x003b2; plus IL-6 or IL-23, with each stimulation period lasting 4&#x02013;5 d (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). The combination of IL-1&#x003b2; plus IL-6 was approximately fivefold more effective at inducing production of IL-17A by activated naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells than IL-23, and there was a further two- to threefold increase in the presence of all three cytokines (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>).

Although these culture conditions induced IL-17A, we were unable to detect IL-17A&#x02013;expressing cells by intracellular staining (not depicted).

Furthermore, although IL-23 can also activate STAT-1, -4, and -5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), it would appear that IL-23&#x02013;induced activation of STAT3 plays a predominant role in amplifying the generation of Th17 cells from human naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells induced by IL-6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>Our findings identify a fundamental defect in Th17 differentiation in HIES. Thus, enumeration of IL-17 production by activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, coupled with measuring the frequency of CCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, emerges as a relatively quick and simple procedure that could be used to screen patients suspected of having HIES due to inactivating mutations in <italic>STAT3</italic>. In addition, our findings also point to a crucial role for Th17 cells in the normal host response. Infections with <italic>Candida</italic> spp. and <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the most prevalent etiological agents in the infections encountered in patients with HIES, are also important pathogens in other clinical settings. Mechanisms for defense against <italic>Candida</italic> and other fungal infections have been contentious. Although human Th17 cells respond selectively to <italic>Candida</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>), other evidence suggests that production of IL-17 and IL-23 increases susceptibility to fungal infection in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Furthermore, a role for T reg cells has been proposed, whereby down-regulation of Th17-mediated inflammation is necessary to prevent fungal-induced pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). However, we did not detect a deficiency of T reg cells, at least by cell surface phenotype, in HIES. Our observations using CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from HIES patients supports the data of Acosta-Rodriguez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) that Th17 cells play a crucial role in coordinating the host defense against <italic>Candida</italic>.

Recent evidence from Milner et al.

The mechanism of the HIES component of the phenotype is also likely to be complex because STAT3 operates intrinsically in B cells and is activated in response to many regulatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-10, and IL-21, and, as shown here, T helper signals are also disrupted.</p><p>Finally, illumination of the aspects of the HIES phenotype that arise as a consequence of Th17 deficiency may sound a note of caution when considering IL-17 antagonism in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>).

Data were acquired using a FACSCanto or LSRII (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star). IL-17A in culture supernatants was measured using the human IL-17A ELISA Ready-SET-Go kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (eBioscience). IL-22 secretion was measured using the Human IL-22 ELISA Development kit from PeproTech. Secretion of IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, IFN-&#x003b3;, and TNF-&#x003b1; was determined by ELISA using purified and biotinylated cytokine-specific mAb (IL-4: 8D4-8 and MP4-25D2; IL-10: JES3-12G8 and JES3-9D7; IL-13: PVM13-1 and polyclonal; IFN-&#x003b3;: NIB42 and 4S.B3; TNF-&#x003b1;: MAb1 and MAb11; from BD Biosciences and eBioscience) as the capture and detection mAbs, respectively, and visualization with streptavidin&#x02013;horseradish peroxidase and TMB substrate.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>mRNA quantitation.</title><p>After 2 d of culture, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were harvested and washed with PBS. Total RNA was isolated using the QIAGEN RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. For quantitative RT-PCR, total RNA was reverse transcribed using oligo-dT according to the Invitrogen protocol. cDNA expression was determined using the ABI Prism 7900 sequence detection system and Syber-green reagents (Applied Biosystems). The following primers were used: <italic>ROR&#x003b3;t</italic>, TCAGTCATGAGAACACAAATTGA and GCACCCCTCACAGGTGATAA; <italic>UBE2D2</italic>, TGAAGAGAATCCACAAGGAATTGA and CAACAGGACCTGCTGAACACTG; and <italic>IL22</italic>, AGGCTCAGCAACAGGCTAAG and TCCTTCAGCTTTTGCACATT. Fluorescence signals were measured over 40 PCR cycles, and the cycle (Ct) at which signals crossed a threshold set within the logarithmic phase was recorded. The Ct for the target gene was subtracted from the Ct for UBE2D2 (&#x00394;Ct). The relative amount of mRNA was calculated as 2<sup>&#x00394;Ct</sup>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs.
