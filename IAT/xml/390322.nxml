Telomeres protect the ends of chromosomes from being recognized as broken DNA ends. In vertebrates, telomeres are composed of a 5&#x02013;15 kb tandem repetitive array of T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> sequences (telomeric repeats) and associated proteins, thereby forming a large protein&#x02013;DNA complex. Several telomere-associated proteins have been identified. Among them, TRF1 and TRF2 are unique in that they possess a single repeat of Myb-like helix-turn-helix domain that specifically binds to telomeric repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c2">2</xref>). Importantly, both TRF1 and TRF2 are involved in regulating telomere length <italic>in vivo</italic>. Long-term overexpression of TRF1 or TRF2 by stable transfection leads to a gradual shortening of telomeres in telomerase-positive human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c4">4</xref>). When a dominant-negative mutant of TRF1, which prevents the association of endogenous TRF1 with telomeres, was overexpressed, the telomeres were gradually elongated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c3">3</xref>). Those results led the authors to propose that telomere-bound TRF1 and TRF2 function as a countable measure of the telomere length <italic>in cis</italic> and are components of the negative feedback loop in telomere homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c4">4</xref>). More specifically, when telomeric repeats are long, larger amounts of TRF1 and TRF2 associate with the telomeres, thereby promoting the formation of a closed state, such as the t-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c5">5</xref>). This closed state hinders the action of telomerase, presumably concealing the 3&#x02032;-OH residue of the telomeric DNA end. Accordingly, telomere length is reduced after cell divisions due to the end replication problem. When telomeres become significantly short, the numbers of telomere-bound TRF1 and TRF2 are reduced and the chance for the telomere to switch from the closed state to the open state is increased. When telomerase gains access to telomeres in the open state, telomere elongation is induced. This &#x02018;protein-counting model&#x02019; was originally proposed in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c6">6</xref>). A recent study revealed that the overexpression of TRF2 but not TRF1 in telomerase-negative human cells still resulted in accelerated telomere shortening, suggesting that TRF1 and TRF2 negatively regulate telomere length by targeting different molecular pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c7">7</xref>).</p><p>If the association of TRF1 and TRF2 with telomeres promotes the formation of the closed state <italic>in vivo</italic>, they may hinder not only telomerase but also <italic>trans</italic>-factors involved in other aspects of telomere metabolism, such as DNA replication. However, the replication of telomeres particularly in higher eukaryotes remains poorly understood. In yeast, DNA in telomeric regions is replicated late in S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c10">10</xref>). In general, the replication timing in S phase of a given locus is determined by two factors. Firstly, it depends on whether the origin responsible for the replication of the locus fires early or late in S phase. Secondly, it depends on how fast the replication fork travels from the origin to the locus. The second factor is influenced not only by the distance between the origin and the locus but also by the fork movement speed. Telomeres can influence these different aspects of replication. It is known that the yeast telomere shows characteristics of heterochromatin. In some strains of the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, telomeric repeats are synthesized by a replication fork originating from a nearby replication origin positioned in the subtelomeric Y&#x02032; element and traveling to the telomeres. The Y&#x02032; origin fires late in S phase in a manner dependent on Sir3, a heterochromatin component present in telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c11">11</xref>). In the same study, it was also shown that telomere heterochromatin represses in a Sir3-dependent manner the firing of an ARS (autonomously replicating sequence) present in another subtelomeric element, X. It is also known that the replication fork progression is stalled at telomeric repeats positioned either natively (at DNA ends) or ectopically inside the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c12">12</xref>). Therefore, telomeres affect both the initiation (the efficiency and timing of origin firing) and elongation (fork movement) steps of replication in yeast. However, it is known that human telomeric repeats are replicated concomitantly with or even earlier than the replication of bulk DNA, suggesting that telomere replication mechanisms in human are not necessarily similar to those in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c15">15</xref>). In this study, we focus our analysis on the replication fork progression at human telomeres.</p><p>To analyze the replication of the end of linear DNA in a human cell-based system, we previously developed an SV40-based <italic>in vitro</italic> system that reconstitutes the semi-conservative replication of linear DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c16">16</xref>). Although it was generally believed that the SV40-based system replicates linear DNA very poorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c17">17</xref>), we found that linear DNA can be efficiently replicated under optimized conditions. In this system, terminally biotin-labeled linear DNAs are conjugated to avidin-coated beads, and subjected to replication reactions <italic>in vitro</italic>. Replication products that have replicated from the original DNA templates are specifically analyzed by purifying bead-bound replication products (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f1">1</xref>). The initiation step of the SV40-based system utilizes non-physiological elements, the SV40 replication origin and the SV40-encoded T-antigen, making the system unsuitable for the study of the initiation step. However, the elongation step of the system faithfully recapitulates physiological DNA replication, and the system has uncovered fundamental mechanisms of the elongation step of mammalian replication (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c18">18</xref>). Using this system, we showed that the leading strand is completely synthesized up to the end of linear DNA having unique sequences, whereas the lagging strand synthesis is gradually halted in the terminal &#x0223c;500 bp region, leaving 3&#x02032;-overhangs, an observation leading to the formal demonstration of the end replication problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c16">16</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we first examined how telomeric repeats positioned at one end of a linear DNA molecule are replicated in the SV40-based system. Together with the results obtained using TRF1-overexpressing HeLa cells, we conclude that telomere-associated TRF proteins significantly inhibit the progression of the replication fork.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Construction of pT2AG3 and pSVO11-2K</title><p>In order to clone the T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> repeat into pSVO11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c19">19</xref>), double-stranded oligonucleotide (CTAGATCTTTAGATATCGTCTTCGACGT/CGAAGACGATATCTAAAGATCTAGAGT) was first inserted into the AatII site of pSVO11 (pSVO11-EcoRV, BglII). Another double-stranded oligonucleotide (AGCTTCAGTGCAGCATATGTCAGACTG/GATCCAGTCTGACATATGCTGCACTGA) was cloned between the BamHI site and the HindIII site of pBluescript (pBS-BsgI). The T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> repeat was amplified by PCR as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c20">20</xref>) and cloned into pT7Blue(R) (Novagen) (pT7Blue-T2AG3). pT7Blue-T2AG3 was then digested with BamHI and NdeI, and the fragment containing the T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> repeat was cloned between the BamHI site and the NdeI site of pBS-BsgI (pBS-BsgI-T2AG3). From pBS-BsgI-T2AG3, the T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> repeat was again cut out with BsgI and BamHI. The BsgI site was blunted by T4 DNA polymerase. The T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> containing fragment was then cloned between the EcoRV site and the BglII site of pSVO11-EcoRV, BglII (pT2AG3). BbsI is a restriction enzyme that cuts DNA several base pairs away from its recognition site. Taking advantage of this, the plasmid was designed so that after the digestion with BbsI, one of the ends would harbor &#x0223c;1.9 kb of the T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> repeat to the ultimate end. pSVO11-2K was constructed by inserting the BamHI&#x02013;SspI (1983 bp) fragment derived from pMX-neo vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c21">21</xref>) between the EcoRV and BglII sites of pSVO11-EcoRV, BglII.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> replication of linear DNA</title><p>Linearized plasmids end-labeled with biotinylated dNTPs was prepared and used for replication reactions as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c16">16</xref>).

The vector was used to obtain recombinant baculovirus expressing TRF1, TRF2 and Myb-like domain-only TRF1. The procedure was carried out according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. Sf9 cells producing the proteins were harvested 60 h after infection of the virus. Cells were suspended in buffer A (0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.9) containing 5 mM imidazole. After sonication, the extract was centrifuged on an SW55 rotor at 20000 r.p.m. for 20 min at 4&#x000b0;C. To purify His-tagged proteins, His trap kit (Pharmacia) was used. TRF1, TRF2 and Myb-like domain-only TRF1 were eluted from an Ni-charged column with buffer A containing 0.5 M imidazole.

Cells were fixed for 10 min in PBS containing 2&#x00025; paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized in PBS containing 0.2&#x00025; Triton X-100 for 5 min, washed with PBS, and fixed for 20 min in MeOH at &#x02013;20&#x000b0;C. After two washes with PBS, cells were incubated in PBS containing 5 mg/ml BSA and 20 mM glycine for 30 min. Cells were stained with anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) antibody (1/100 dilution, PC10; Santa Cruz), followed by FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody, both of which were diluted with PBS containing 5 mg/ml BSA. Then, the cells were fixed with 4&#x00025; paraformaldehyde for 7 min and incubated in PBS containing 5 mg/ml BSA and 20 mm glycine for 30 min, and subjected to telomere FISH.

Restriction digestion of this plasmid with BbsI at the single recognition site leaves two 5&#x02032;-protruding ends, one positioned at the very end of the telomeric repeats and the other at a unique sequence. The direction of the telomeric repeats is the same as that of native telomeres, i.e. the 3&#x02032;-end of the G-rich strand facing the DNA end. The ends were filled-in to produce two biotin-labeled blunt ends. We also constructed pSVO11-2K as a control plasmid by inserting a 1983-bp non-telomeric unique DNA fragment into the corresponding position of the telomeric repeats in pT2AG3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f2">2</xref>A). These terminally biotinylated linear DNA molecules were conjugated with avidin-coated beads (pT2AG3-beads and pSVO11-2K-beads). The replication reaction was started by adding SV40 T-antigen and S100 cell extracts from 293 cells. Replication reactions can take place multiple times in this system. Because products that have replicated using the nascent strand as a template lose the terminal biotin, we are able to examine specifically products that have experienced a single round of replication from the original DNA strands by analyzing the labeled product that remains associated with the beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c16">16</xref>).</p><p>We first examined whether the telomeric DNA could be replicated efficiently in our <italic>in vitro</italic> replication system. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f2">2</xref>B, lanes 1 and 5, pT2AG3- and pSVO11-2K-beads incorporated dNMPs efficiently and full-length products were obtained from both reactions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f2">2</xref>B, lanes 1 and 5, arrowheads). The reaction was not observed when SV40 T-antigen was omitted, indicating that the DNA synthesis is a result of replication reactions (data not shown and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f2">2</xref>D). Although we incubated the same amounts of pT2AG3 and pSVO11-2K in each reaction, we consistently noted smaller amounts of full-length products from pT2AG3-beads compared with those from pSV011-2K-beads, suggesting that pT2AG3 is a relatively poor substrate for the replication reaction. To determine the region of pT2AG3 resistant to replication, the replication products were digested with AlwNI and HindIII. These digestions produced two terminus-derived fragments and one internal fragment from the full-length product (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f2">2</xref>A). pSVO11-2K produced those three fragments with the expected sizes. The signal intensities of the bands were different from those expected from the assumption that the labeling efficiency on a length basis is equal. Specifically, the signal of the &#x0223c;1 kb internal fragment appeared stronger than expected from those of the &#x0223c;1.4 and &#x0223c;2.4 kb terminus-derived fragments. We previously demonstrated that the internal DNA of a linear DNA molecule is completely synthesized in both leading and lagging strand syntheses in this SV40-based system. In contrast, the terminal &#x0223c;500 bp regions are synthesized completely by the leading strand synthesis but not by the lagging strand synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c16">16</xref>). Accordingly, the terminal fragment recognized as a full-length product is produced only by the leading strand synthesis and by half the amount expected from the semi-conservative replication. We think the apparently stronger signal intensity of the internal fragment is a reflection of the relatively lower yields of the full-length terminus-derived fragments. Consistent with this interpretation, the three bands were labeled proportionally to the length of fragments, when the very low level of DNA synthesis, which occurred in the absence of T-antigen presumably due to repair DNA synthesis, was analyzed in a similar manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f2">2</xref>D).</p><p>Upon examination of the replication products from pT2AG3-beads, we found that the non-telomeric terminus (the &#x0223c;1.4 kb left terminus) and the &#x0223c;1.0 kb middle fragment of pT2AG3 were replicated at levels comparable to those of the corresponding fragments in pSVO11-2K. In contrast, the signal intensity of the telomeric terminus (the &#x0223c;2.4 kb right terminus) of pT2AG3 was significantly lower than that of the corresponding fragment in pSVO11-2K (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f2">2</xref>C, lanes 1 and 5). We therefore concluded that telomeric repeats are not a good substrate for the replication reaction in this system.</p></sec><sec><title>TRF1 and TRF2 reduce the replication efficiency of telomeric repeats <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>It was reported that both telomeric-repeat binding factors TRF1 and TRF2 are bound to telomeres throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c2">2</xref>). It is therefore expected that those proteins remain associated with telomeres during telomeric DNA replication. To analyze the effects of TRF1- and TRF2-binding on the replication efficiency of telomeric DNA, we included purified baculovirus-derived recombinant TRF1 and TRF2 in the replication reaction. It was reported that the isolated Myb-like domain of TRF1 specifically binds to AGGGTT as a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c28">28</xref>). Full-length TRF1 forms a very stable homodimer and the two Myb-like domains of the TRF1 dimer bind to two independent AGGGTT sites with a cooperativity of &#x0223c;10-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c27">27</xref>). We incubated full-length TRF proteins at a stoichiometry of five TRF1 or TRF2 molecules to one repeat of telomeric sequence, a ratio that was shown to saturate all telomeric repeats with TRF proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c29">29</xref>). It was found that the addition of TRF1 or TRF2 (250 ng/50 ng template DNA in 25 &#x000b5;l) significantly reduced the replication efficiency of the telomeric repeats (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f2">2</xref>B, lanes 5&#x02013;7). Moreover, when both TRF1 and TRF2 were included (250 ng each/reaction), the inhibitory effect appeared to be additive (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f2">2</xref>B, lane 8). The inhibitory effects of TRF1 and/or TRF2 on the replication reaction were specific to telomeric repeats because the same amount of proteins did not affect the efficiency of the control pSVO11-2K replication (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f2">2</xref>B, lanes 1&#x02013;4).</p><p>When TRF1 and/or TRF2 was included in the replication reaction, we noted an increase in the intensity of a smear signal with an apparent size of &#x0223c;3 kb (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f2">2</xref>B, lanes 6&#x02013;8, bracket). As 3 kb is similar to the size of pT2AG3 without the telomeric repeats (2.9 kb), it was possible that most replication products failed to synthesize the telomeric DNA in the presence of TRF1 and/or TRF2. We digested the replication product with AlwNI and HindIII to determine which part of the template molecules did not complete the replication. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f2">2</xref>C, the replication of the middle fragment and the non-telomeric left terminus was not affected by the addition of TRF1 or TRF2. In contrast, the full-length product derived from the telomeric right terminus of pT2AG3 was barely detectable when TRF1 or TRF2 was added (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f2">2</xref>C, lanes 5&#x02013;8), whereas the replication of the corresponding fragment of pSVO11-2K was not affected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f2">2</xref>C, lanes 1&#x02013;4). We noted that the S100 extracts used in the replication reaction contained significant amounts of endogenous TRF1 and TRF2 (data not shown). Given that TRF1 and TRF2 inhibit the replication reaction of telomeric repeats, it is not possible to determine whether the inefficient replication of pT2AG3-beads even in the absence of exogenous TRF1 or TRF2 is due to the effect of endogenous TRF proteins or to an inherent nature of the DNA sequence <italic>per se</italic>.</p><p>It was possible that the inhibitory effect of TRF1 and TRF2 on the replication of telomeric repeats was caused by a non-specific inhibitory effect of these recombinant proteins on DNA replication. To examine this possibility, we took two approaches. Firstly, we included increasing amounts of TRF1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f2">2</xref>E, 250 ng, 500 ng and 1 &#x000b5;g/25 &#x000b5;l reaction in lanes 2 and 9, 3 and 10 and 4 and 11, respectively). The replication of telomeric repeats was almost completely abolished when 1 &#x000b5;g TRF1 (4-fold higher amount than those used in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f2">2</xref>B and C) was added to the reaction. In contrast, these higher amounts of TRF1 did not influence the replication efficiency of non-telomeric regions of the same plasmid (the non-telomeric end and the internal fragment of pT2AG3) or the non-telomeric plasmid pSVO11-2K (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f2">2</xref>E, lanes 11 and 4, respectively). Addition of BSA at the same protein concentration (1 &#x000b5;g/25 &#x000b5;l reaction) did not show any effect on the replication of pSVO11-2K or pT2AG3, (lanes 7 and 14, respectively), indicating that the high protein concentration <italic>per se</italic> does not cause the replication failure. TRF1 consists of three regions: the N-terminal acidic region, the central TRFH (TRF-homology) region, and the C-terminal Myb-like domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c26">26</xref>). The Myb-like domain is responsible for the DNA binding. However, the truncated mutant containing only the Myb-like domain fails to bind to telomeric DNA, since the dimer formation mediated by the TRFH domain is required for efficient DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c27">27</xref>). We then prepared the recombinant Myb-like domain-only TRF1 (amino acids 369&#x02013;431). Addition of the DNA-binding-defective Myb-like domain-only TRF1 at 500 ng/25 &#x000b5;l reaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f2">2</xref>E, lanes 5 and 12) or 1 &#x000b5;g/25 &#x000b5;l reaction (lanes 6 and 13) did not show any effect on the DNA replication of pSVO11-2K or pT2AG3. Taken together, we concluded that TRF1 specifically inhibits the replication of telomeric repeats via its binding to telomeric DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>TRF1 and TRF2 stall replication fork progression at telomeric repeats <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Because the telomeric terminus-derived fragment was almost undetectable in the replication products of pT2AG3-beads in the presence of TRF1 or TRF2, it was surmized that both the leading and lagging strand syntheses were blocked at telomeres, i.e. the replication fork progression was stalled. To examine this possibility, we employed the neutral&#x02013;neutral 2D gel electrophoresis technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c30">30</xref>). In this technique, the Y- and bubble-shaped replication intermediates are resolved as a &#x02018;Y arc&#x02019; and a &#x02018;bubble arc.&#x02019; If the replication fork stalls somewhere in the Y- or bubble-shaped intermediates, an intense spot signal in the cognate arc is recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c31">31</xref>). Radiolabeled replication products were obtained from pT2AG3- and pSVO11-2K-beads in the presence or absence of recombinant TRF1 (250 ng/50 ng DNA), and were subjected to 2D gel electrophoresis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f3">3</xref>A and B). The replication products obtained from pSVO11-2K-beads showed two types of arc-shaped signals that were interpreted as a Y arc and a bubble arc, judging from the typical slow migration patterns in the second dimension of electrophoresis. There was no spot signal on the arcs irrespective of the presence or absence of TRF1, indicating that TRF1 did not result in replication fork stall when pSVO11-2K was used as a template (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f3">3</xref>A, the two left panels). The replication products from pT2AG3-beads in the absence of TRF1 also showed similar Y and bubble arcs, although we noted a slight increase of Y-shaped intermediates in the pT2AG3-derived products (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f3">3</xref>A, third panel). Signals at or close to the 2n spot were observed, indicating the presence of products that have completed the replication reaction. In contrast to the results obtained with pSVO11-2K-beads, however, when TRF1 was included in the reaction, the signal pattern showed significant changes. Firstly, the signals close to the 2n spot disappeared, indicating that most molecules failed to complete the replication. Secondly, the intensity of the signals at the upper half of the Y arc and the bubble arc was significantly increased. As the replication reaction proceeds, the signal of the products in the 2D electrophoresis ascends leftward on the bubble arc, and then moves onto and descends leftward on the Y arc. The strong smeared signals at the top of the bubble and Y arcs indicate that the replication reaction was gradually stalled when TRF1 was added. Because the restriction digestion of the replication product of pT2AG3 in the presence of TRF1 indicates that the telomeric end failed to replicate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f2">2</xref>C), it is most likely that the replication fork stall revealed by the 2D gel electrophoresis occurred at the telomeric repeats. The mobility in the first dimensional electrophoresis relatively well reflects the mass of DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c22">22</xref>). The signal that increased in intensity when TRF1 was added showed a wide range of mobility (&#x0223c;6&#x02013;9 kb) in the first dimension (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f3">3</xref>A). Assuming that the replication fork stall happens when the replication fork approaching the telomeric end reaches the telomeric repeats, the estimated DNA length of such an intermediate is calculated to be &#x0223c;5.9 kb (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f3">3</xref>C). This value agrees well with the observed mobility of signals that represent the earliest stalled intermediate (&#x0223c;6 kb). Together, these results strongly suggest that the replication fork moving toward the telomeric end begins stalling as it encounters telomeric repeats. The fact that the increased signal intensities in the Y and bubble arcs appeared not as a spot but as a smear suggested that the replication at telomeric repeats was lagging yet progressed slowly to produce heterogeneous intermediates. The replication origin is located approximately at the center of the linear DNA template. If the replication had occurred normally, the replication fork should have reached the two ends at approximately the same time course. However, the most advanced replication intermediate was detected on the Y arc, thereby indicating that the replication at the non-telomeric end is completed, whereas the fork replicating at the telomeric end is stalled.</p></sec><sec><title>TRF1-overexpression leads to cell cycle arrest in human cells</title><p>After finding that TRF proteins inhibit the replication of telomeric repeats <italic>in vitro</italic>, we next examined if this effect is relevant <italic>in vivo</italic>. To this end, we overexpressed TRF1 as well as LacZ as control in HeLa cells by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. The production of full-length TRF1 was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Cells were pulse-labeled by BrdU at intervals, harvested, fixed and stained with propidium iodide (PI). BrdU-staining and DNA content as revealed by PI were analyzed by FACScan and the fractions of cells in G<sub>1</sub>, S and G<sub>2</sub>/M were calculated based on to the criteria of BrdU-negative cells with 2N DNA content, BrdU-positive cells with 2N&#x02013;4N DNA content and BrdU-negative cells with 4N DNA content, respectively.</p><p>As summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh309tb1">1</xref>, TRF1-expressing cells showed: (i) larger fractions of cells in S phase at 36 and 48 h post-infection (54.6 and 41.6&#x00025; in TRF1-expressing cells versus 47.2 and 36.5&#x00025; in LacZ-expressing cells, respectively); (ii) larger fractions of cells in G<sub>2</sub>/M phase at 48 h post-infection (26.9 versus 12.8&#x00025;); and (iii) smaller fractions of cells in G<sub>1</sub> phase at 36 and 48 h post-infection (24.2 and 28.4&#x00025; in TRF1-expressing cells versus 36.9 and 48.1&#x00025; in LacZ-expressing cells, respectively). The results suggest that cell cycle progression was delayed or arrested during S&#x02013;G<sub>2</sub>/M phases in TRF1-overexpressing cells. When incubated for a longer time, cells at 96 h post-infection and thereafter underwent apoptosis as determined from the sub-G<sub>1</sub> DNA content (data not shown). Similar observations of TRF1-induced apoptosis were reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c32">32</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Replication fork stall at telomeres by TRF-overexpression <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Since the classification of S and G<sub>2</sub>/M cells in the above-mentioned experiments depends on the measurements of BrdU uptake and DNA content, we had to be cautious of whether those cells indeed represented those cell cycle stages. For example, if TRF1 overexpression allowed the replication of whole genomes except telomeres but blocked the telomeric replication, the cells would be counted as &#x02018;G<sub>2</sub>/M&#x02019; due to the inability of BrdU uptake and a nearly 4N DNA content. However, the cells in fact did not complete the replication (at telomeres).</p><p>To further characterize the immediate effect of TRF1 overexpression, we analyzed the replication focus in TRF1-overexpressing cells. HeLa cells infected with adenoviruses expressing TRF1 or LacZ were harvested 36 h post-infection, and subjected to simultaneous detections of PCNA by indirect IF and of telomeric DNA by FISH using DeltaVision. PCNA staining has been widely used to detect the replication focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c34">34</xref>). In mammalian cells, the replication focus shows characteristic morphologies according to the stage in S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c36">36</xref>). The replication foci in early, mid and late S phases are characterized by small granules present throughout the nucleus, large granules in perinuclear regions, and extremely large granules at intranuclear heterochromatin, respectively. We found that the frequency of cells exhibiting large PCNA granules (i.e. mid and late S phases) among the total asynchronous cells is much higher in TRF1-overexpressing cells (46&#x00025;, 31/67) than in LacZ-overexpressing cells (20&#x00025;, 21/85), consistent with the idea that TRF1-overexpressing cells are arrested at mid-to-late S phase.</p><p>We next examined the colocalization of PCNA signals with telomeric DNA signals, which presumably represented replication foci replicating telomeric DNA, unless the colocalization happened fortuitously. This analysis was difficult to perform for early S phase cells because the number of replication foci was too large to give a confident judgment of the colocalization. We therefore focused on the above-mentioned mid-to-late S phase cells. Because it is expected that telomeres are replicated in a narrow window of S phase, the probability of detecting replication foci replicating telomeres in a randomly chosen S phase cell should be very low. As expected, telomere&#x02013;PCNA colocalization was infrequently observed (&#x0223c;5&#x00025; &#x000b1; 6&#x00025;; the percentage of colocalization-showing telomere signals among total telomere signals, 10 randomly chosen mid-to-late S phase cells were analyzed; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f4">4</xref>A and C) in LacZ-overexpressing cells. In contrast, TRF1-overexpressing cells showed a significantly higher frequency (&#x0223c;30 &#x000b1; 14&#x00025;, analyzed in 10 mid-to-late S phase cells) of the colocalization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f4">4</xref>B and C). To test that this higher representation of PCNA-positive signals in TRF1-overexpressing cells is not a general phenomenon observed with other loci but is specific to telomeres, we also calculated the percentage of telomere-colocalizing PCNA signals among total PCNA signals in 10 randomly chosen mid-to-late S phase cells. Telomeres were frequently colocalized at PCNA signals in TRF1-overexpressing cells (7.1&#x00025; &#x000b1; 2.7&#x00025;), whereas infrequently in LacZ-overexpressing cells (1.0&#x00025; &#x000b1; 1.0&#x00025;) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh309f4">4</xref>D). The simplest interpretation of these results is that it took a longer time for telomeres to be replicated in TRF1-overexpressing cells by the slowly progressing or stalled replication fork at telomeres.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we found that telomere-associated TRF proteins inhibit replication fork progression at telomeric repeats both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using the <italic>in vitro</italic> SV40-based replication system of linear DNA molecules, we showed that TRF1 and TRF2 inhibit DNA replication at telomeric repeats. The 2D electrophoresis assay revealed that TRF1 addition to the system led to an accumulation of Y- and bubble-shaped replication intermediates in which the replication fork stalled at the telomeric repeats. When we overexpressed TRF1 in HeLa cells, the accumulation of cells in S and G<sub>2</sub>/M phases was observed. Detailed analyses of the replication foci in TRF1-overexpressing cells suggested that the immediate effect of TRF1 overexpression is the replication fork stall at telomeres, rather than the arrest or delay in cell cycle progression. Interestingly, the TRF1-overexpressing cells eventually underwent apoptosis, suggesting that a prolonged delay in telomere replication is hazardous to cells.</p><sec><title>Replication fork stall at telomeres</title><p>The replication fork is stalled under various circumstances, either accidentally or in a programmed manner (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c38">38</xref>). In some cases, the primary sequence of template DNA is responsible for the replication fork stall. For example, d(TC)<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>&#x02013;d(GA)<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>, a microsatellite sequence highly dispersed in mammalian genomes and known to assume a triplex structure <italic>in vitro</italic>, stalls the replication fork progression both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c39">39</xref>). In other cases, the replication fork progression is stalled by protein&#x02013;DNA complexes, the most extensively studied of which is the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> termination sites (<italic>Ter</italic>) of replication (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c40">40</xref>). In <italic>E.coli</italic>, bidirectional replication starts from a single origin of the circular genome and two oppositely traveling forks merge at a diametrically opposed region. When one of the two forks passes the natural merging point, it is trapped by <italic>Ter</italic> sites where it waits for the second fork to arrive. A DNA-binding protein, Tus (terminus utilization substance), specifically binds as a monomer to <italic>Ter</italic> sites. The <italic>Ter</italic>&#x02013;Tus complex is necessary and sufficient for the replication fork stall. It should be noted that the inhibition of DNA polymerase is not a non-specific outcome of DNA&#x02013;protein interactions in general: complex formation between Gal4-DBD (DNA-binding domain) and its target sequence (Gal4 operator sequence) did not affect the DNA synthesis by T7 polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c41">41</xref>). Significantly, the <italic>Ter</italic>&#x02013;Tus interaction is very specific and long-lived <italic>in vitro</italic> (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> &#x0003d; 3.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;13</sup> M, T<sub>1/2</sub> &#x0003d; 550 min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c42">42</xref>). Therefore, a very strong and stable DNA&#x02013;protein interaction appears to interfere with the progression of the replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c43">43</xref>). Telomeres and centromeres in yeast, which comprise a large DNA&#x02013;protein complex, also interfere with replication elongation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c44">44</xref>). Here we demonstrated that the tandem array of telomeric repeats and its binding proteins stall the replication fork in human cells.</p><p>In this study, it was not possible to determine whether the telomeric sequence <italic>per se</italic> possesses an inherent nature to resist replication reaction or not, because the S100 extracts used to support the replication reaction contained endogenous TRF1 and TRF2. Previously, it was suggested that the purified calf polymerase &#x003b1;/primase complex is stalled and dissociates from single-stranded TTAGGG-repeat templates <italic>in vitro</italic>, presumably at the run of guanines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c45">45</xref>). As G-rich DNAs potentially form unusual DNA structures, such as the G-quartet structure (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c46">46</xref>) and the more recently reported parallel quadruplex structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c47">47</xref>), it is possible that G-rich DNA in general is not a good substrate for the replication apparatus.</p><p>We found that replication fork stall at telomeric repeats happens when TRF1 and TRF2 proteins are added to the <italic>in vitro</italic> system or overexpressed <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is likely that TRF1 does not bind to telomeric repeats as tightly as Tus binds to <italic>Ter</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c27">27</xref>). It is also likely that TRF1 does not bind to DNA in a specific manner that blocks the approach of the replication fork as Tus does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c43">43</xref>). However, TRF1 is unique in that the two Myb-like domains of the TRF1 homodimer bind to two AGGGTT sites independently and with extreme flexibility in terms of the spatial arrangement of the two target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c27">27</xref>). This unique binding mode enables TRF1 to form string, loop and synaptic structures within or between telomeric repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c29">29</xref>). It is likely that such higher-ordered structures contribute to the observed replication fork stall at the TRF&#x02013;telomeric repeats complex.</p></sec><sec><title>TRF1 overexpression leads to telomere replication defects and a delay of exit of S phase</title><p>Previous studies have revealed that cells stably overexpressing either the wild-type or the dominant-negative mutant TRF1 protein do not show reduced viability and growth rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c3">3</xref>). However, when TRF1 was highly overexpressed by a transient transfection method, cells with 4N DNA content were accumulated, followed by an increase in apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c32">32</xref>). When we overexpressed TRF1 using the adenovirus vector, we also observed similar findings, namely, an increase in the &#x02018;G<sub>2</sub>/M&#x02019; fraction. However, we surmize that the primary effect of the TRF1 overexpression is not the accumulation of G<sub>2</sub>/M cells that have completed the DNA replication in S phase. If TRF1 overexpression specifically inhibits the DNA replication at telomeric repeats without affecting the replication in other genomic regions, the apparent DNA content of such cells should be 4N, yet, by definition, these cells have not completed the S phase. Consistent with this idea, we observed a significant increase in the number of TRF1-overexpressing cells at the mid or late stage of S phase compared to the LacZ-overexpressing cells. Moreover, the incidence of telomere&#x02013;PCNA colocalization was significantly higher in the mid or late S phase cells that overexpressed TRF1 than in those that overexpressed LacZ. Those observations suggest that the immediate effect of TRF1 overexpression is to stall the replication fork progression at telomeres while other genomic regions finish replication normally, and delay the completion of S phase. TRF1-overexpressing cells eventually underwent apoptosis at 96 h post-infection. In the future, it would be interesting to study whether the apoptosis is a result of a long-standing activation of a checkpoint mechanism or of abnormal cell cycle progression due to mechanical reasons (such as splitting sister chromatids at anaphase without the completion of telomere replication). In this regard, it is interesting to note that <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> expressing template-mutated telomerase RNA showed an anaphase block and subsequent cell death, presumably due to a failure of the separation of telomeric regions in chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c48">48</xref>). It was also reported that a segregation failure due to mechanical reasons occurs in a fission yeast mutant strain defective in telomere-binding protein Taz1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c49">49</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanisms in the completion of replication at telomeres</title><p>Given that human telomeres are replicated in a kinetics similar to that of bulk DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c15">15</xref>), if telomere-bound TRF1 and TRF2 indeed interfere with the replication of telomeric DNA, there should be a regulatory mechanism to avoid this interference. Previous IF studies showed that TRF1 and TRF2 are associated with telomeres throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c2">2</xref>). It is estimated that a typical mammalian replication fork progresses at a speed of &#x0223c;2 kb/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c50">50</xref>), inferring that telomeric repeats of 10 kb will be replicated in &#x0223c;5 min if the repeats are replicated at the same speed as that for the bulk DNA. If TRF proteins dissociate from telomeres only during the actual replication of telomeric repeats, it will be technically difficult to detect the TRF dissociation that happens during this very narrow window in S phase (&#x0223c;5 min among &#x0223c;10 h, a typical period of S phase). Alternatively, TRF proteins may accommodate the replication fork in a manner that cannot be detected by cytological methods. Interestingly, a recent study using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay in yeast reported a cell cycle-dependent variation in the association of telomere factors to telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c51">51</xref>).</p><p>TRF1 undergoes several modifications.

It was also reported that TRF1 is phosphorylated by ATM upon DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh309c54">54</xref>). It is possible that those modifications regulate the telomere-binding activity of TRF proteins during replication fork progression at telomeres.</p><p>Alternatively, the replication machinery for replicating telomeric DNA may utilize specific components that relieve the TRF-mediated replication fork stall.
