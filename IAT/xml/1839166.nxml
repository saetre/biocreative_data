RIN4 is a regulator of basal host defense responses. Targeting of RIN4 by AvrB is recognized by the host RPM1 nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat disease resistance protein, leading to accelerated defense responses, cessation of pathogen growth, and hypersensitive host cell death at the infection site. We determined the structure of AvrB complexed with an AvrB-binding fragment of RIN4 at 2.3 &#x000c5; resolution. We also determined the structure of AvrB in complex with adenosine diphosphate bound in a binding pocket adjacent to the RIN4 binding domain. AvrB residues important for RIN4 interaction are required for full RPM1 activation. AvrB residues that contact adenosine diphosphate are also required for initiation of RPM1 function. Nucleotide-binding residues of AvrB are also required for its phosphorylation by an unknown <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protein(s). We conclude that AvrB is activated inside the host cell by nucleotide binding and subsequent phosphorylation and, independently, interacts with RIN4.

A small upper lobe (amino acid residues 123 to 217) contains three alpha-helices (&#x003b1;5, &#x003b1;6, and &#x003b1;7) surrounding a five-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet (&#x003b2;1-&#x003b2;5-&#x003b2;4-&#x003b2;3-&#x003b2;2). A large lower lobe (residues 28 to 122 and 218 to 317) is composed strictly of alpha-helices &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030048-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. The junction of the two lobes forms a large solvent-accessible cleft with a volume of over 900 &#x000c5;<sup>3</sup> that extends into the lower lobe to form a pocket rich in conserved residues. Chimeras of AvrB with the closely related paralog avirulence protein C (AvrC) (which does not activate RPM1) were used to demonstrate that the upper lobe of AvrB (residues 126 to 216) is required for RPM1 activation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030048-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. The lack of sequence conservation in the upper lobe among AvrB paralogs from various plant pathogens that do not trigger RPM1 mediated responses (see below) further supports this contention. In contrast, the lower lobe and the interlobal cleft are highly conserved in sequence among the AvrB family members.

In addition, phosphorylation of AvrB occurs in the presence of a host cofactor or kinase and may represent a third prerequisite for recognition by RPM1.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Structure of AvrB Bound to RIN4</title><p>Previous work using gel filtration and native gel electrophoresis demonstrated that AvrB bound a small RIN4 fragment consisting of amino acids 142 to 179 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030048-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. We cocrystallized AvrB with RIN4<sub>142&#x02013;176</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g001">1</xref>C, and 1E; <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030048-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Thus, essentially all of the binding energy for interaction with AvrB is contained in RIN4<sub>142&#x02013;176</sub>. The structure of AvrB complexed to RIN4<sub>142&#x02013;176</sub> revealed that the peptide forms a &#x0201c;Z&#x0201d; shape with the N-terminal half contacting the upper lobe and the C-terminal half straddling the interface between the two lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g001">1</xref>C, and 1E; <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030048-t001">Table 1</xref>). The interaction of AvrB with RIN4<sub>142&#x02013;176</sub> does not alter the overall structure of AvrB (unpublished data). Using this cocrystal structure, we identified residues of AvrB that interact with RIN4<sub>142&#x02013;176</sub> and could potentially be important for binding affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g002">2</xref>C). The N-terminal half of RIN4<sub>142&#x02013;176</sub> interacts mainly through hydrophobic burial of RIN4 W154 plus a hydrogen bond between the indole nitrogen of RIN4 W154 and AvrB D213 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). RIN4 W154 is part of an AvrRpt2 cleavage site on RIN4 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030048-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Additionally, AvrB T182 contacts RIN4 Y151, and AvrB V128 contacts RIN4 D155, S161, and G162.</p><p>The most extensive interactions of RIN4<sub>142&#x02013;176</sub> with AvrB involve the C-terminal half of the RIN4 peptide. First, there is a set of antiparallel beta-strand hydrogen-bonding interactions between main-chain AvrB residues 120 to 124 (within strand &#x003b2;1) and RIN4 residues 167&#x02013;171. Second, there is a hydrogen bond between the main-chain of RIN4 N170 and the AvrB R209 guanidinium group. These interactions allow this region of RIN4 to form an additional strand of the beta-sheet in the upper lobe of AvrB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030048-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Importantly, in forming this strand, the RIN4 T166 side-chain is directed toward the interior of AvrB such that the hydroxyl group hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of AvrB T125, which in turn hydrogen bonds to the imidazole ring of AvrB H217 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g002">Figure 2</xref>C).</p><p>Above this hydrogen-bonding arrangement, the aromatic rings of RIN4 Y165 and F169 as well as interleaving H167 are thrust against the surface formed from the last two turns of AvrB helix &#x003b1;7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). This &#x0201c;ring-stack&#x0201d; of RIN4 spans from the AvrB upper lobe (R209) to the interlobe boundary (R266) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). These aromatic and indole side-chains stack in a nearly parallel arrangement with each other that is energetically very favorable. The guanidinium groups of AvrB R209 and AvrB R266 buttress the termini of the ring-stack, contacting RIN4 F169 and Y165, respectively, via &#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0; interactions such that the guanidium groups are also almost parallel to the three stacked aromatic rings of RIN4. In the middle of this ring stack, AvrB Q208 forms additional contacts with RIN4 H167 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). AvrB Y210 may play a weak role in RIN4<sub>142&#x02013;176</sub> binding since additional electron density from RIN4<sub>142&#x02013;176</sub> appears to be contacting this residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). No additional electron density is observed for the last four residues of the RIN4 peptide (sequence REER).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The C-Terminal Regions of RIN4<sub>142&#x02013;176</sub> Are Required for Binding to AvrB</title><p>RIN4 and AvrB interact in yeast two-hybrid assays and can be coimmunoprecipitated from plant tissue &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030048-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.

To test whether the aforementioned AvrB residues are involved in RIN4 binding (listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030048-t002">Table 2</xref>), we mutated the relevant amino acids individually to alanine. These mutants were assayed for their ability to bind full-length RIN4 by in vitro gel filtration and/or in vivo by yeast two-hybrid assay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030048-t002">Table 2</xref>). In addition, the binding affinity of selected AvrB mutants and RIN4<sub>142&#x02013;176</sub> was measured by ITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>The cocrystal structure revealed that the side-chains of several AvrB upper lobe residues make contacts with the N-terminal region of RIN4<sub>142&#x02013;176</sub>. For example, D213 of AvrB interacts with W154 within the N-terminal portion of RIN4<sub>142&#x02013;176</sub>. However, substitution of D213 to alanine did not disrupt either binding to RIN4 or the ability to trigger RPM1-mediated responses. The substitution of nearby residues of AvrB (i.e., V128A and T182A) also did not disrupt binding to RIN4 or activation of RPM1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030048-t002">Table 2</xref>; unpublished data). These AvrB residues contact the N-terminal region of RIN4<sub>142&#x02013;176</sub> that contains an AvrRpt2 cleavage &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030048-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030048-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Hence, our data suggest AvrB and AvrRpt2 target two distinct amino acid sequences of this short, 35&#x02013;amino acid residue region of RIN4.</p><p>In contrast, disruption of AvrB residues contacting the C terminus of RIN4<sub>142&#x02013;176</sub> strongly affected RIN4 binding. AvrB<sup>T125A</sup> and AvrB<sup>H217A</sup> were unable to bind RIN4<sub>142&#x02013;176</sub> under our ITC conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Loss of RIN4 binding activity was not due to significant structural disruptions, since AvrB<sup>T125A</sup> or AvrB<sup>H217A</sup> were properly folded, as measured by circular dichroism (unpublished data). Similar mutation of AvrB residues directly supporting the side-chains of the ring-stack also affected RIN4 binding. The single mutation AvrB<sup>R209A</sup> had very little effect on RIN4 binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030048-t002">Table 2</xref>) but a triple mutation of Q208, R209, and Y210 to alanine (hereafter AvrB<sup>QRY/AAA</sup>) significantly lowered the affinity for RIN4 (<italic>k<sub>d</sub></italic> &#x0003d; 9 &#x003bc;M for AvrB<sup>QRY/AAA</sup>) and destabilized the AvrB/RIN4 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030048-t002">Table 2</xref>). Overall, two regions of the upper lobe make distinct and functional contacts with the C-terminal region of RIN4<sub>142&#x02013;176</sub>: (1) AvrB residues Q208, R209, and Y210, which directly support the side-chains of the ring-stack, and (2) AvrB residues T125 and H217, which interact with RIN4 T166, between Y165 and H167 of the ring-stack.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>RIN4-Interacting Residues of AvrB Are Required to Activate RPM1</title><p>AvrB induces phosphorylation of RIN4 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030048-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, but it remained unclear whether AvrB must interact with RIN4 to trigger RPM1-mediated disease resistance and HR.

The preceding experiments identified AvrB mutants that varied in binding affinity to RIN4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030048-t002">Table 2</xref>).

Unsurprisingly, these mutants have no effect on the ability of AvrB to activate RPM1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030048-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).

We hypothesized that this large cavity, rich in residues that are highly conserved across the AvrB protein family (see below), could serve as a binding site for a cofactor for AvrB activity. Because the presence of AvrB renders RIN4 marginally hyperphosphorylated &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030048-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, we wondered whether AvrB is an atypical kinase. We therefore examined binding to nucleotides, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), guanosine diphosphate, and nonhydrolyzable ATP and guanosine diphosphate analogs, by soaking these into AvrB crystals. We found that crystallized AvrB could bind ADP within the lower lobe pocket of the large cavity (referred to as the ADP pocket; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g001">Figures 1</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g001">1</xref>D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g001">1</xref>F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g002">2</xref>B, and 2D; <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030048-t001">Table 1</xref>). We observed only weak density corresponding to other nucleotides in the lower lobe pocket (unpublished data).

Y65 stacks below the adenine ring and hydrogen bonds to the 2-OH group of the ribose, while R99 and R266 form salt bridges with the alpha- and beta-phosphates, respectively. N62 and F113 also contact the adenine base and phosphates, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g002">2</xref>D). F113 also appears to contribute to proper positioning of R99 and R266.

Thus, all of the AvrB loss-of-function mutants in the ADP binding cavity eliminated the initiation of RPM1 function. We note, however, that they are each produced and properly folded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030048-sg002">Figure S2</xref>D and circular dichroism, unpublished data) and translocated into host cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030048-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). Although AvrB<sup>Y65A</sup> and AvrB<sup>D297A</sup> failed to bind RIN4 in ITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g003">Figure 3</xref>), they, along with AvrB<sup>R99A</sup>, did bind RIN4 in yeast two-hybrid assay, gel filtration, or both (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030048-t002">Table 2</xref>). We discuss these data further below.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>AvrB Is Phosphorylated in the Host Cell</title><p>Since RIN4 phosphorylation is induced by AvrB, it was hypothesized that AvrB may possess kinase activity.

We also found no evidence for in vitro autophosphorylation of AvrB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). We did, however, observe phosphorylation of AvrB in the presence of wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). AvrB phosphorylation was sensitive to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and heat denaturation of the plant extract by boiling prior to assays, suggesting that AvrB phosphorylation requires cations and a heat-labile plant factor (unpublished data). Phosphorylation activity was specific for AvrB, the only member of this type III effector family demonstrated to trigger RPM1 function, since related paralogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g005">Figure 5</xref>C) did not or only weakly incorporated radiolabeled phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).

Titrating increasing amounts of purified full-length RIN4 protein into extracts from <italic>rin4 rpm1 rps2</italic> did not alter the level of AvrB phosphorylation in vitro (unpublished data).

Mutation of these AvrB residues interferes with the ability to trigger RPM1 function, demonstrating that physical interaction of AvrB with RIN4 is required for recognition by RPM1.

All of these residues are in the AvrB upper lobe. The hydrophobic I215 lies underneath T125, and its mutation would likely disrupt the structural integrity of this region, and hence interaction with RIN4. Q164 is not solvent exposed and is also likely to disrupt AvrB structure when mutated. S268 is also in the lower lobe, and its substitution to isoleucine abrogated RIN4 binding in yeast two-hybrid assays &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030048-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. The polar side-chain of S268 is partially buried and its mutation to a residue with a bulkier, nonpolar side-chain could have detrimental effects on the structure of AvrB, thus resulting in loss of RIN4 binding. A RIN4 ortholog is present in soybean and possesses an intact BBS domain. Whether this soybean RIN4 ortholog interacts with AvrB and is required for <italic>Rpg1-b</italic>&#x02013;mediated resistance remain to be determined.</p><p>We also observed binding of ADP to the lower lobe pocket of AvrB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g005">5</xref>B). Nucleotide contact residues (AvrB Y65, R99, and R266) are conserved between AvrB family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g005">Figure 5</xref>C) and are required for RPM1-mediated disease resistance responses. Thus, the ability of AvrB to trigger RPM1 function in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> requires both interaction with RIN4 and an intact nucleotide binding pocket. Strikingly, Rpg-1b&#x02013;mediated HR in soybean also required an intact AvrB nucleotide-binding pocket &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030048-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. In these studies, AvrB<sup>R266A</sup> did not elicit an HR in soybean.

If so, then AvrB might have a kinase or protokinase activity required to phosphorylate RIN4. Tertiary structure-matching programs such as DALI or MSD-Fold did not reveal significant structural similarity between AvrB and known kinases. However, the AvrB structure is similar to typical Ser/Thr protein kinases such as cAMP-dependent kinase, in that both contain a bilobal structure with a large lobe composed predominantly of alpha-helices and a small lobe with a mixed alpha-helix beta-sheet content &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030048-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. We present a model of a ternary AvrB/RIN4/ADP structure created by superimposing the AvrB/RIN4 and AvrB/ADP coordinates and subsequent insertion of the ADP coordinates into the AvrB/RIN4 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). In this model, the distance between the oxygen atoms of the beta-phosphate of ADP and the T166 O&#x003b3; atom is quite short (4.2 &#x000c5;), indicating that RIN4 T166 is a strong candidate for phosphorylation by AvrB.</p><p>We compared our modeled ternary complex to the structure of a ternary complex between cAMP-dependent kinase, AMPPNP, and an inhibitor peptide in which the acceptor serine 17 is replaced by an alanine &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030048-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). This comparison revealed that AvrB residues necessary to elicit an RPM1-dependent HR correspond in position to residues critical for the kinase activity of this cAMP-dependent kinase. Also, the positions of the phospho-acceptor in the inhibitor peptide and the putative acceptor T166 of RIN4 are similarly positioned. In cAMP-dependent kinase, the nucleotide binds in a cavity between the small lobe and large lobe, with the small lobe making up the majority of the interactions, whereas in AvrB the nucleotide binds in the major cavity of the large lobe. As a result, the orientation of the nucleotide is different between the two structures.</p><p>In cAMP-dependent kinase D168 deprotonates the acceptor serine/threonine residue and T201 positions D168 by hydrogen bonding. A similar role can be envisioned for AvrB H217 and T125, respectively, with regard to the putative acceptor T166 of RIN4. In addition, cAMP-dependent kinase K72 plays a role in phosphate binding and in stabilization of the transition state. It is analogous in position to R99 in AvrB. Although R266 in AvrB could also play this role, this residue is spatially most similar to D184 in cAMP-dependent kinase, which is involved in ligating a Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion that chelates the terminal phosphate group. In the AvrB/ADP structure, we could not definitively observe a Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion. The mechanism of metal binding in AvrB complexes remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Finally, protein kinases contain an activation loop joining the two lobes whose phosphorylation is necessary for protein kinase activity. In cAMP-dependent kinase, phosphorylation of T197 in the activation loop (residues 191 to 199) is necessary for kinase activity. In AvrB, residues 115 to 121 could form the activation loop, and three residues in this loop (T118, S119, and T121) could serve as phosphorylation sites. Additionally, this loop also borders the region (residues 120 to 125) that forms an antiparallel beta-sheet with residues 166 to 171 of RIN4. Hence, phosphorylation of this loop region may also affect RIN4 binding.</p><p>Despite this plausible similarity to kinases, pure AvrB neither autophosphorylates nor transphosphorylates pure RIN4 in vitro (unpublished data). However, we found that AvrB is phosphorylated in the presence of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> extracts, suggesting that AvrB's possible kinase activity would require accessory plant factors. In vitro, this phosphorylation event is RIN4 and RPM1 independent. The <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. syringae</named-content> type III effector avirulence protein <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> tomato (AvrPto) is also phosphorylated in the presence of plant extracts independently of its corresponding plant disease resistance proteins, Pto and Prf &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030048-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Additionally, NopL and NopP are TTSS effector proteins from <named-content content-type="genus-species">Rhizobium</named-content> sp.

Hence, there is a class of type III effector proteins that are phosphorylated once delivered to the host cell. We anticipate that this modification is linked to effector activation in all of these cases.</p><p>AvrB phosphorylation in the presence of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> extract is dependent on the AvrB nucleotide-binding residues we defined, such as Y65 and R266. While nucleotide binding residues are required for AvrB to be phosphorylated, they are not sufficient, because AvrC and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Xanthomonas campestris</named-content> campestris avirulence protein (AvrXccC) encode the conserved nucleotide-binding region and are not phosphorylated in the presence of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> extract. These data suggest that nucleotide bound to AvrB is required for the recruitment and/or function of a host kinase. Alternatively, AvrB could act as a &#x0201c;protokinase&#x0201d; that lacks intrinsic phosphor-transfer activity that can be enhanced by association with plant accessory protein(s). We speculate that each AvrB family member has evolved to usurp a plant species-specific protein that contributes to their activation by phosphorylation following delivery into host cells.</p><p>The ability of AvrB to trigger RPM1 function requires its nucleotide-binding pocket, which in turn is required for AvrB phosphorylation induced by an unknown <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cofactor(s) or kinase, and interaction with RIN4. Neither AvrB<sup>Y65A</sup>, AvrB<sup>Y131A</sup>, nor AvrB<sup>D297A</sup> nor bound RIN4 in ITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g003">Figure 3</xref>), although all three did in gel filtration and/or yeast two-hybrid assays (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030048-t002">Table 2</xref>). The most parsimonious explanation for these binding data requires very slow association and dissociation rates of complex formation for AvrB and RIN4. For the wild-type proteins, these slow rates result in a modest equilibrium (<italic>k</italic><sub>d</sub> approximately 1 &#x003bc;M) measurable by ITC and sufficient for isolation of AvrB&#x02013;RIN4 complexes when the two proteins are incubated together prior to gel filtration chromatography. Similarly, the two proteins would likely interact when coexpressed during yeast two-hybrid analysis. We propose, however, that AvrB<sup>Y65A</sup>, AvrB<sup>Y131A</sup>, and AvrB<sup>D297A</sup> preferentially decrease the on-rate for AvrB&#x02013;RIN4 complex formation. Hence, complexes could still form and be isolated by gel exclusion chromatography or inferred from yeast two-hybrid data due to the very slow off-rate. However, the resulting decrease in the overall equilibrium constant would prevent accurate affinity measurement by ITC. Implicit in this model is the likely requirement for a conformational change in AvrB that is slow and required prior to the binding of RIN4. Importantly, Y131 and D297 reside at the interlobal boundary of AvrB, and their substitution can easily be envisaged to shift the conformational equilibrium of AvrB and lock it in a state unfavorable for RIN4 association. This interpretation is consistent with the finding of Ong and Innes (2006) that AvrB<sup>D297A</sup> enhanced binding of AvrB to RIN4 in their yeast two-hybrid system.</p><p>Our data are consistent with the activity of the AvrB protein family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). None of the AvrB homologs induce RPM1 function, although the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Xanthomonas campestris</named-content> protein AvrXccC interacts with RIN4 in yeast two-hybrid experiments and binds RIN4 weakly in vitro (unpublished data). Most of the AvrB-RIN4 contact residues are poorly conserved, particularly those in &#x003b1;6 and &#x003b1;7 helices, including AvrB Q208, R209, and Y210, which support the ring-stack of RIN4. For example, these AvrB residues correspond to AvrC residues A239, A240, and S241. AvrB T125, located on &#x003b2;1, is essential for RIN4 interaction and is conserved in all homologs of AvrB. Hence, the regions of AvrB that support the ring-stack of RIN4 appear to contribute to the functional specificity of AvrB for RIN4-dependent, RPM1-mediated HR. By contrast, the important ADP-contacting residues Y65, R99, and R266 in the lower lobe pocket are conserved in all AvrB homologs, suggesting that nucleotide binding is a core function for this entire type III effector family. However, an intact ADP binding cavity is not sufficient for phosphorylation of AvrB by <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> extracts, since the AvrC and AvrXccC possess them (including N62 and F113) but are not readily phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Furthermore, while AvrXccC interacts with RIN4, at least in yeast, and possesses the nucleotide-binding pocket, it does not trigger RPM1. This suggests that RIN4 interaction and nucleotide binding are not sufficient for the activation of RPM1 by AvrB family members.</p><p>AvrB Y131 and D297 are 4 &#x000c5; away from the nucleotide binding site and are located in the solvent-exposed region of the interlobe cleft. Many of the solvent-exposed residues of the interlobe cleft are highly conserved within the AvrB family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030048-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). The electrostatic surface of the interlobe cleft and the sheer size of the cleft highly suggest that this might be an active site required for an as-yet-undefined activity of AvrB, or for the docking of an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protein that is required for AvrB phosphorylation. We speculate that the divergent sequences of the AvrB paralogs, centered on the interlobe cleft, are critical for recruitment of plant species-specific cofactors that enhance nucleotide turnover on each AvrB family member and/or align substrates of AvrB with potential catalytic residues in the cleft. We speculate that this set of atomic events would be required to trigger RPM1 (or other NB-LR) function in diverse plant species.</p><p>Besides acting as an avirulence factor to trigger resistance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and soybean, AvrB can also serve as a virulence factor in susceptible hosts.

Combined with our structural data, these results indicate that RIN4- and ADP-binding regions, as well as functions provided by the interlobe cleft, are required for the virulence activity of AvrB. Therefore, interaction with RIN4, nucleotide binding, and host phosphorylation are correlated with both the virulence activity of AvrB and for its recognition by independent plant NB-LRR proteins. This corroborates the &#x0201c;guard&#x0201d; model hypothesis where NB-LRR proteins monitor the activity of type III effectors for recognition rather than direct interaction &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030048-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030048-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Our three-dimensional crystal structures of AvrB in complex with its host target RIN4 or the ADP, and the combined functional studies detailed here and in Ong and Innes (2006), suggest a plausible series of events required for both AvrB virulence activity on susceptible hosts and for its ability to trigger disease resistance recognition in two plant species: AvrB is delivered by the TTSS of <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000. Inside the host cell, AvrB binds to a nucleotide, or another small molecule of similar shape. The AvrB&#x02013;nucleotide complex recruits a plant cofactor that transforms AvrB into a kinase capable of autophosphorylation. Alternatively, the nucleotide-bound form of AvrB mimics a substrate for an unknown plant kinase and becomes phosphorylated itself. Because soluble AvrB can be labeled in an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> extract, we infer that phosphorylation of AvrB is independent of, and hence might precede, myristoylation and plasma membrane localization &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030048-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Phosphorylated AvrB becomes myristoylated and directed to the plasma membrane. At the plasma membrane, AvrB interacts with RIN4, and its conformation is altered. This stable heterodimer guides RIN4 phosphorylation. The AvrB&#x02013;RIN4 complex, and potentially the phosphorylated form of RIN4 itself, triggers RPM1-mediated activation of disease resistance. RIN4 functions as a negative regulator of basal defense &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030048-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;.

The LR reaction was left to proceed overnight at 16 &#x000b0;C. Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed using the MATCHMAKER LexA system (Clontech, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clontech.com">http://www.clontech.com</ext-link>) following the manufacturer's protocols. The yeast strains used in this study are EGY48 (Clontech) and RFY206.

The standard yeast mating procedure was followed according to the manufacturer's protocols (Clontech Yeast Protocols Handbook). A 100-&#x003bc;l aliquot of the mating culture was spread on SD Glucose Agar base supplemented with &#x02013;Ura/&#x02013;His/&#x02013;Trp DO to select for diploids.

Labeled residues are stick representations of those critical for AvrB/RIN4<sub>142&#x02013;176</sub> or AvrB/ADP interaction in (A), and those critical for S17 phosphorylation, inhibited by S17A, as shown in (B).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.0030048.g006"/></fig><table-wrap id="ppat-0030048-t001" content-type="1col" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>X-Ray Data Collection and Refinement Statistics</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.0030048.t001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="ppat-0030048-t002" content-type="1col" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>List of AvrB Mutations</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.0030048.t002"/></table-wrap></sec><fn-group><fn id="n104" fn-type="current-aff"><p>&#x000a4;a Current address: Department of Cell and Systems Biology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada</p></fn><fn id="n105" fn-type="current-aff"><p>&#x000a4;b Current address: CH Best Institute, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada</p></fn><fn id="ack1" fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions.</bold> DD, AUS, AJW, BCM, ZN, JS, and JLD conceived and designed the experiments.
