Nevertheless, its expression in prolactinomas and its relation with the pituitary dopamine receptor 2 (D2R) are not well defined. We sought to determine the pituitary level of pttg in three different experimental models of prolactinomas with altered dopaminergic control of the pituitary: the dopaminergic D2R knockout female mouse, the estrogen-treated rat, and the senescent female rat. These three models shared the characteristics of increased pituitary weight, hyperprolactinemia, lactotrope hyperplasia and reduced or absent dopaminergic action at the pituitary level. We also studied samples from human macroprolactinomas, which were characterized as responsive or resistant to dopamine agonist therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>When compared to female wild-type mice, pituitaries from female D2R knockout mice had decreased PTTG concentration, while no difference in pttg mRNA level was found. In senescent rats no difference in pituitary PTTG protein expression was found when compared to young rats. But, in young female rats treated with a synthetic estrogen (Diethylstylbestrol, 20 mg) PTTG protein expression was enhanced (<italic>P </italic>= 0.029). Therefore, in the three experimental models of prolactinomas, pituitary size was increased and there was hyperprolactinemia, but PTTG levels followed different patterns.</p><p>Patients with macroprolactinomas were divided in those in which dopaminergic therapy normalized or failed to normalize prolactin levels (responsive and resistant, respectively). When pituitary pttg mRNA level was analyzed in these macroprolactinomas, no differences were found.</p><p>We next analyzed estrogen action at the pituitary by measuring pituitary estrogen receptor &#x003b1; levels. The D2R knockout female mice have low estrogen levels and in accordance, pituitary estrogen receptors were increased (<italic>P </italic>= 0.047). On the other hand, in senescent rats estrogen levels were slightly though not significantly higher, and estrogen receptors were similar between groups. The estrogen-treated rats had high pharmacological levels of the synthetic estrogen, and estrogen receptors were markedly lower than in controls (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001). Finally, in patients with dopamine resistant or responsive prolactinomas no significant differences in estrogen receptor &#x003b1; levels were found. Therefore, pituitary PTTG was increased only if estrogen action was increased, which correlated with a decrease in pituitary estrogen receptor level.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that PTTG does not correlate with prolactin levels or tumor size in animal models of prolactinoma, and its pituitary content is not related to a decrease in dopaminergic control of the lactotrope, but may be influenced by estrogen action at the pituitary level. Therefore it is increased only in prolactinomas generated by estrogen treatment, and not in prolactinomas arising from deficient dopamine control, or in dopamine resistant compared with dopamine responsive human prolactinomas. These results are important in the search for reliable prognostic indicators for patients with pituitary adenomas which will make tumor-specific therapy possible, and help to elucidate the poorly understood phenomenon of pituitary tumorigenesis.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Pituitary tumors rarely produce metastasis, but cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Prolactinomas are the more prevalent among pituitary tumors. They are usually benign, and can be effectively treated with dopaminergic agents. Nevertheless, 15% of them may be or become resistant to classical pharmacological therapy, can be invasive, and require extirpation. In general, pituitary tumors result from monoclonal growth and intrinsic genetic defects which are related to oncogenes, suppressor genes, and genes responsible of differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. On the other hand, growth factors of hypothalamic or pituitary origin may act on aberrant cells, contributing to their proliferation. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Point mutations identified up to date can only account for a small percentage of pituitary tumors, and the mechanism of pituitary tumorigenesis is still unraveling.</p><p>Pituitary tumor transforming gene (pttg) is a recently cloned oncogene that was identified in rat pituitary tumor cells by differential mRNA display [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It has been proposed as an important paracrine growth factor involved in early lactotrope transformation and onset of angiogenesis in pituitary hyperplasia in estrogen-treated rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. PTTG (protein encoded by pttg) has been recognized as a mammalian securin that maintains binding of sister chromatides during mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. PTTG must be proteolysed during cell division for sister chromatid separation to occur, and failure in this process, as in PTTG overexpression, elicits inappropriate sister chromatid exchange, resulting in genetic instability as an early tumorigenic event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Several lines of evidence support the role of PTTG in tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Overexpressed PTTG induces cell aneuploidy, transforms NIH3T3 cells <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>, stimulates basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) production, and stimulates proliferation and angiogenesis. Furthermore, PTTG transactivates the oncogene c-myc, which in turn may influence cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. PTTG is expressed in high levels in different pituitary tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and other neoplasms including carcinomas of lung, breast, colon, thyroid, adrenal, liver, kidney, endometrium, uterus, ovary leukemia and lymphomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The expression of PTTG in normal tissues is restricted, with highest expression in the testis.</p><p>The role of PTTG in prolactinomas is not clear, furthermore, the relation of PTTG expression and dopamine control of pituitary function has not been established. We sought to determine the level of PTTG expression in three different experimental models of lactotrope hyperplasia with altered dopaminergic control of lactotropes: the dopaminergic D2R knockout female mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], the estrogen-treated rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and the senescent female rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These three models share the characteristics of a tumoral pituitary, hyperprolactinemia, lactotrope hyperplasia and reduced or absent dopaminergic action at the pituitary level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We also studied human prolactinoma tissue from patients who were characterized as responsive or resistant to dopamine agonist therapy.</p><p>We believe that the elucidation of the factors involved in the regulation of lactotrope proliferation and pituitary angiogenesis might open new possibilities in the treatment of prolactinomas, especially in those cases with resistance or intolerance to dopamine agonists.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>PTTG levels in pituitaries from animal models of prolactinoma</title><p>PTTG protein and mRNA expression were determined in the lactotrope hyperplasia of the D2R female knockout mouse.

In particular, it is ubiquitously expressed in pituitary tumors at higher levels than those detected in normal pituitary. PTTG is required for tissue self-renewal and pttg-null mice have hypoplastic testes, spleen, and pituitary glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, PTTG overexpression results in focal pituitary hyperplasia and adenoma formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless the expression of pttg in prolactinomas, and in particular, in dopamine resistant prolactinomas has not been well defined. In humans, pttg overexpression in pituitary tumors has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], but controversies on correlation between pttg levels and tumor behaviour or type exist. Higher pttg expression was detected in somatotrope tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and non functioning adenomas in comparison to other hormone secreting pituitary tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and pttg correlated with GH secretion in one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In another study, pttg was also highly expressed in nonfunctioning and in GH-secreting tumors but there was, in general, an ubiquitous presence of high pttg in most pituitary adenomas, and in particular, increased pttg was observed in hormone-secreting tumors that had invaded the sphenoid bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Finally, in some studies there was no correlation of pttg levels and imaged tumor volume or invasiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In rats, on the other hand, pttg is clearly involved in early pituitary lactotrope tumors induced by pharmacological administration of estrogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Our results show that increased PTTG or pttg mRNA is not a common feature of lactotrope hyperplasia in experimental rodent models with decreased pituitary dopaminergic function, or in human dopamine agonist resistant compared with responsive prolactinomas. Nevertheless, PTTG protein expression is sensitive to high estrogen levels, which decreases dopaminergic control of the lactotrope.</p><p>The D2R female knockout mouse is an excellent model to study pituitary dopamine resistance. Dopamine is the principal hypothalamic inhibitory factor for lactotrope cells. Its main receptor in the pituitary is the D2R, and therefore these knockout mice develop lactotrope hyperplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] followed by lactotrope tumor formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Pituitary glands of the female D2R knockout mice have markedly increased number of cells containing prolactin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These lactotropes were hyperstimulated with rapid turnover of prolactin and limited storage capacity. Furthermore, we found that the expression of the angiogenic protein, vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF), was increased in pituitaries from D2R knockout female mice, and increased pituitary VEGF expression was mainly dependent on the lack of dopaminergic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In the present work we show that PTTG, another angiogenic protein, is not increased in the proliferating pituitary gland of the D2R knockout mouse. This would suggest that PTTG is not regulated by dopamine. Furthermore, we found low expression of PTTG in D2R knockout compared to wildtype mice despite similar pttg transcripts. This could suggest a post-translational regulation of PTTG (e.g. an increased degradation of PTTG within the ubiquitin proteasome system in knockouts) that could be part of a protective mechanism against tumor development in the setting of lactotrope hyperplasia. On the other hand, these knockout mice have a low estrogenic environment. High prolactin levels throughout life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] are certainly related to the relative infrequent estral cycles observed in these mice, which cease to reproduce around the fourth month of life. Therefore, low estrogenic input at the pituitary level may be insufficient to promote pttg expression.</p><p>In the female rat, we have shown that aging is characterized by a high incidence of prolactin secreting pituitary adenomas and diffuse prolactin cell hyperplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These changes cannot be accounted for by different serum profiles of gonadal steroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Estrogen levels were not significantly increased in aging rats, even though we found a marked enlargement of the pituitary gland. On the other hand, aging brings about a progressive loss of both tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic system and periventricular dopaminergic system neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], which may contribute significantly to lactotrope hyperplasia. There are no reports in the literature with regard to the pituitary expression of angiogenic growth factors in senescence. We found that the pituitary content of PTTG was similar in senescent and young rats, indicating that this protein is not involved in the age-related hyperplastic progression of lactotropes in aging female rats.</p><p>Chronic administration of estrogens to rats induces enlargement of the anterior pituitary and increases the synthesis and secretion of prolactin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Histologically, the resulting tumors are composed of hyperplastic and hypertrophied lactotropes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Damage to hypothalamic dopaminergic neurones in response to estrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] as well as a direct action of estrogen at the pituitary level decreasing dopamine sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] have been proposed as causative factors. Besides, the effect of estrogen can be accounted for by alterations in different growth factors: VEGF, and FGF-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], even though increases in such growth factors do not necessarily imply their strict requirement for tumor development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In accordance with the literature, we describe a marked increase in pituitary PTTG expression in the estrogen-treated rats.</p><p>PTTG was initially proposed as an angiogenic and/or oncogenic factor in human pituitary tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In fact, abundant and concordant PTTG and bFGF expression in different human pituitary tumors was described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, anti-estrogens reduced PTTG expression in human pituitary tumors <italic>in vitro </italic>(three gonadotroph, five nonfunctioning) and suppressed experimental tumor growth <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. But, we describe that PTTG expression is not increased in human dopamine resistant when compared to dopamine responsive prolactinomas. This is consistent with experimental animal results presented herein which demonstrate that reduced dopaminergic action at the pituitary is associated with pituitary enlargement, hyperprolactinemia but not necessarily with increased PTTG expression.</p><p>Therefore, taken together, our results suggest that PTTG increment in estrogen-induced prolactinomas is not related to the deficient dopaminergic control of the pituitary found in this model, but to another estrogenic pathway.</p><p>We measured pituitary estrogen receptors in order to establish a link with circulating estrogen and pituitary PTTG expression. Cellular estrogen receptor levels are dynamic and are particularly sensitive to changes in circulating levels of 17&#x003b2;-estradiol. The level of steroid receptors in cells changes with varying physiological states. In most cases, the primary endocrine regulator is the ligand itself. In an autoregulatory feedback loop, estrogen induces a decline in both ER&#x003b1; protein and mRNA in lactotrope cells. It has been demonstrated through a number of studies that the decline in ER&#x003b1; upon exposure to 17&#x003b2;-estradiol results from a combination of mechanisms that control both receptor synthesis and degradation through transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and posttranslational mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The most rapid of these regulatory mechanisms is the direct loss of ER&#x003b1; protein brought about by the induction of proteasome-mediated proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Our results show that the only experimental model with low pituitary estrogen receptors was the estrogen-treated rat, indicating a down regulating effect of the pharmacological administration of the synthetic estrogen. On the other hand, in the pituitary of the D2R knockout female mouse estrogen receptors were high when compared to their wildtype counterparts, indicating reduced serum levels of estradiol which correlate with the reduced fertility of these mice, and with results of another D2R knockout mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In aging rats neither pituitary estrogen receptor levels nor serum estrogen levels were significantly different from young rats. And finally, in the pituitaries from human prolactinomas estrogen receptors were not significantly different between responsive and resistant tumors.</p><p>So even though PTTG expression is increased in rapidly proliferating cells in some experimental models supporting that it may play a role in the control of cell proliferation, we postulate that it does not participate in the prolactinoma development caused by deficient dopamine control of the lactotrope. Emerging data clearly indicate that different molecular mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of the various pituitary tumor subtypes, and PTTG may be increased in somatotropinomas and other pituitary tumors, but not in dopamine resistant in comparison to dopamine sensitive prolactinomas, and it is not regulated by dopamine in different experimental prolactinomas. On the other hand, high estrogen levels could impact on PTTG expression. Finding reliable prognostic indicators for patients with pituitary adenomas will make tumor-specific therapy possible, and elucidation of the particular oncogenes or growth factors involved in each pituitary tumor subtype will be fundamental to determining the poorly understood phenomenon of pituitary tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><sec><title>A) D2 dopamine receptor female knockout mice (KO)</title><p>(official strain designation B6; 129S2-<italic>Drd2</italic><sup><italic>tm1low </italic></sup>by the Induced Mutant Resource at The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), generated by targeted mutagenesis of the D2R gene in embryonic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] were used.
