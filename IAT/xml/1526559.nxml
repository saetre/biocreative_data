Cartilage consists of an extracellular matrix composed mainly of proteoglycans and collagens, in which chondrocytes, the only cell type, are embedded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Degradation of proteoglycan is rapid and reversible but the breakdown of collagen is slow and essentially irreversible. Thus, collagen degradation is a key step in connective tissue breakdown.</p><p>The major extracellular proteolytic enzymes involved in cartilage resorption are the metallo- and serine proteinases, which function through a series of interacting cascades. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent endopeptidases that, at neutral pH, are collectively able to degrade all components of this extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The collagenases (MMP-1, MMP-8, MMP-13), membrane-type 1 MMP and gelatinase (MMP-2) cleave fibrillar collagen into characteristic three-quarter and one-quarter length fragments and so are key enzymes involved in cartilage collagen turnover. Cleaved collagen is unstable, unwinds and is susceptible to non-specific proteolysis. Degradation of the collagenous network is excessive in arthritis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and elevated levels of MMPs are detected in serum, synovial fluid, synovial membrane and cartilage from patients with arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. MMPs are regulated at critical steps: synthesis, secretion, activation, inhibition, localization and clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Activation of pro-collagenases is a crucial control point in determining if cartilage collagen resorption occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Serine proteinases are involved in these activation cascades, although the exact serine proteinase(s) involved are not known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Over the past few years several membrane bound serine proteinases have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Specific mechanisms localize proteolysis to the cell surface, which can enhance activity, limit the access of inhibitors, concentrate proteinases to their specific target substrates and limit the extent of proteolysis to discrete pericellular regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These mechanisms are important for regulating proteolytic activity. In osteoarthritis (OA), initial collagen degradation is observed around chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Thus, membrane bound MMPs and serine proteinases, as well as secreted proteinases that localize to the cell, are all important cell surface enzymes that could initiate this pericellular proteolysis. Membrane bound serine proteinases are ideally positioned to interact in these proteolytic cascades at the cell surface. The expression and characterization of membrane serine proteinases in joint tissues has not been studied and, together with the observations described above, represent an important and yet neglected area of cartilage biology.</p><p>The combination of the cytokines IL-1 and oncostatin M (OSM) added to cartilage explant cultures synergistically induces the synthesis and activation of proMMPs, leading to cartilage collagen resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. IL-1 has been shown to be involved in collagenase-mediated cleavage of collagen in OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Increased levels of both cytokines are present in the arthritic joint and adenoviral gene transfer of IL-1 in combination with OSM induces MMPs and joint damage in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Many proteinases are regulated by complex post-transcriptional mechanisms, the understanding of which requires analysis at the protein level. Biotinylated fluorophosphonate (FP-biotin) is a rapid, specific and high-sensitivity probe enabling direct proteomic profiling of serine hydrolase activities in crude cell and tissue samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. FP-biotin has been used previously to isolate active serine proteinases in complex proteomes. The reactivity of FP with serine proteinases requires the enzyme to be in a catalytically active state. FP-biotin binds irreversibly to serine but not cysteine, aspartate and metalloproteinases and labelled proteins are then isolated using streptavidin-agarose beads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>This is the first report showing the use of activity based profiling to identify active serine proteinases on chondrocyte membranes. We identify for the first time the expression of fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP&#x003b1;), an integral membrane serine proteinase on chondrocyte membranes, under conditions that promote cartilage resorption and elevated expression in cartilage from OA patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Recombinant human IL-1 was a generous gift from Dr Keith Ray (GlaxoSmithKline, Stevenage, UK).

Briefly, 0.7 g of cartilage chips (approximately 2 mm in diameter by 1 to 2 mm thick) from bovine nasal septum cartilage were placed in T25 flasks and incubated overnight in 10 ml of control, serum-free medium (DMEM containing 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM glutamine, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 2.5 &#x003bc;g/ml gentamicin and 40 u/ml nystatin). Fresh control medium (10 ml) with or without IL-1 (1 ng/ml) and OSM (10 ng/ml) (each condition in triplicate) was then added (day 0). At day 7, culture supernatants were harvested and replaced with fresh medium containing the same test reagents as day 0. Cartilage and culture supernatants were harvested at days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 14 and RNA was immediately extracted from cartilage as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].

Thus, membrane proteinases are ideally positioned to interact in pericellular proteolysis. FP binds irreversibly to active serine proteinases; therefore, we have used FP-biotin to probe chondrocyte membranes for serine proteinase activities. We have previously shown that the addition of IL-1 plus OSM to cartilage explant cultures results in cartilage resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. To identify serine proteinases synthesized by chondrocytes under these conditions, bovine nasal cartilage chondrocytes were stimulated with IL-1 plus OSM for 24 h. The use of bovine cells enabled large-scale preparation of membranes for protein identification by mass spectrometry. Following incubation of chondrocyte membranes with FP-biotin, a major band was observed at approximately 97 kDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This was not detected in membranes incubated in the absence of FP-biotin, confirming specificity. Tandem mass spectrometry enabled sequencing of 11 peptides (162 amino acid residues: Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) from the tryptic digest of the 97 kDa band. When searched against the Uniprot database using FASTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], these deduced amino acid sequences matched human FAP&#x003b1; (Uniprot ID:Q12884) with 95% identity (the bovine ortholog is not yet present in any publicly available protein database). The slight divergence from the human sequence (for example, deletion of G143; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) was comparable to that between human and mouse FAP&#x003b1;. Thus, probing the chondrocyte membrane with FP-biotin has identified active FAP&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of <italic>FAP&#x003b1; </italic>gene expression in chondrocytes</title><p>The regulation of FAP&#x003b1; gene expression by IL-1 and OSM, cytokines known to promote cartilage resorption, was investigated in the SW1353 chondrocytes using real-time PCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). IL-1 alone induces low levels of FAP&#x003b1; gene expression and OSM alone induces higher expression, while the combination of IL-1 and OSM further increases FAP&#x003b1; expression. Thus, FAP&#x003b1; expression is up-regulated under conditions that promote cartilage resorption.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of <italic>FAP&#x003b1; </italic>gene expression in resorbing cartilage</title><p>Collagenases degrade cartilage collagen and our previous work has shown that serine proteinases are involved in the cascades leading to activation of these pro-collagenases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].

IL-1 plus OSM induces a rapid breakdown of proteoglycan, with over 80% release by day 5 of culture (data not shown).

This is the first study to show that chondrocytes synthesize FAP&#x003b1; (also known as seprase) when stimulated with the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and OSM. <italic>FAP&#x003b1; </italic>gene expression is induced just prior to collagen degradation in a model of cartilage resorption, thus suggesting that FAP&#x003b1; is associated with collagen resorption. Furthermore, <italic>FAP&#x003b1; </italic>gene expression is significantly elevated in cartilage from patients with OA. Immunohistochemistry analysis shows staining for FAP&#x003b1; on chondrocytes in the superficial zone of OA cartilage. In OA, the superficial zone is characterised by fibrillations and degenerative matrix changes, and proteinases involved in cartilage resorption, such as the collagenases (MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13), also show highest expression in the superficial zone of OA cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These observations support a role for FAP&#x003b1; in the mechanisms leading to cartilage degeneration in OA.</p><p>FAP&#x003b1; was initially identified as a cell surface glycoprotein present on stromal fibroblasts of human epithelial cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and on the invadopodia of a human malignant melanoma cell line LOX, which exhibits aggressive behaviour in experimental metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Immunohistochemistry has shown that FAP&#x003b1; is transiently expressed in certain normal fetal mesenchymal tissues, but in normal adult tissues FAP&#x003b1; expression is absent. Most of the common types of epithelial cancers, including over 90% of breast, lung and colorectal carcinomas, contain abundant FAP&#x003b1; expression. It is strongly expressed by the reactive tumour stromal fibroblasts surrounding the newly formed blood vessels of epithelial cancers and in reactive fibroblasts found in the granulation tissue of healing wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. FAP&#x003b1; is also expressed by stellate cells at the tissue remodelling interface in human cirrhosis but not in normal livers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Thus, FAP&#x003b1; is expressed in many pathologies.</p><p>FAP&#x003b1; is a type II transmembrane serine proteinase with a cytoplasmic tail that contains six amino acids followed by a 20 amino acid transmembrane domain at the amino terminus, a region with several potential <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites, a cysteine rich substrate-binding domain and a stretch of 200 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus containing the catalytic serine, aspartate and histidine in a non-classical orientation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The active enzyme is a homodimer that contains two 97 kDa subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. FAP&#x003b1; is structurally very similar to dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV). Both enzymes have dipeptidyl peptidase activity and cleave prolyl peptide bonds (Pro-Xaa). DPPIV has a variety of known substrates, including chemokines, growth factors, neuropeptides and vasoactive peptides; however, the natural ligand of FAP&#x003b1; is not known. FAP&#x003b1; has been shown to have both exo- and endopeptidase activity and can cleave gelatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Thus, during cartilage resorption FAP&#x003b1; may contribute to the degradation of denatured collagen (gelatin) after the initial cleavage by collagenases. FAP&#x003b1; associates with DPPIV, MMP-2, membrane-type 1 MMP and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor at invadopodia of human malignant melanoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and so may interact with these proteinases and receptors and associated cascades. For example, DPPIV and FAP&#x003b1; can form a complex localised at invadopodia of fibroblasts on collagenous fibres that has both gelatinolytic and gelatin binding activities, which allow cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>In a murine collagen-induced arthritis model, gene-expression profiling using the Mu11K array (Affymetrix) showed a seven- fold increase in <italic>FAP&#x003b1; </italic>gene expression together with MMP expression in inflamed, compared to non-inflamed, paws [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In addition, <italic>FAP&#x003b1; </italic>maps to a chromosomal region containing collagen-induced arthritis linked susceptibility loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], which is also consistent with a role in arthritis. The <italic>FAP&#x003b1; </italic>ortholog in <italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>has been reported to be induced during tadpole metamorphosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], a process intimately associated with collagenolysis. The first collagenase enzyme was isolated from such tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>FAP&#x003b1; </italic>is also induced at regions of active tissue remodelling during mouse embryogenesis, including somites and perichondrial mesenchyme from cartilage primordia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>These data and our own observations clearly support a role for FAP&#x003b1; in tissue remodelling processes during normal development and in pathology. Further studies are required to determine the exact mechanistic role of FAP&#x003b1; in tissue proteolysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Using an active-site probe, we have identified for the first time active FAP&#x003b1;, a serine proteinase on the chondrocyte membrane. We have shown that <italic>FAP&#x003b1; </italic>gene expression is up-regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and OSM in chondrocytes and is induced during cartilage collagen resorption. Furthermore <italic>FAP&#x003b1; </italic>gene expression is significantly elevated in cartilage from OA patients when compared to age-matched normal controls. Immunohistochemistry analysis of cartilage from OA patients shows FAP&#x003b1; staining on chondrocytes in the superficial zone. Although the exact function of FAP&#x003b1; remains to be elucidated, we clearly show an association between FAP&#x003b1; and chondrocytes in the context of cartilage degradation. The surface location of FAP&#x003b1; ideally positions it for a role in pathological pericellular tissue degradation and remodelling in cartilage as is seen in arthritic diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>DMEM = Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DPPIV = dipeptidyl peptidase IV; FAP&#x003b1; = fibroblast activation protein alpha; FP-biotin = biotinylated fluorophosphonate; IL = interleukin; MMP = matrix metalloproteinase; OA = osteoarthritis; OSM = oncostatin M; PBS = phosphate buffered saline; PCR = polymerase chain reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JMM helped conceive, design and coordinate the study and carried out membrane preparations, FP-biotin experiments, preparation of cDNA from bovine cartilage, real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and drafted the manuscript.
