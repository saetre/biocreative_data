Studies after the <italic>Exxon Valdez</italic> oil spill demonstrated that fish embryos exposed to low levels of PAHs in weathered crude oil develop a syndrome of edema and craniofacial and body axis defects. Although mechanisms leading to these defects are poorly understood, it is widely held that PAH toxicity is linked to aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) binding and cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) induction. Using zebrafish embryos, we show that the weathered crude oil syndrome is distinct from the well-characterized AhR-dependent effects of dioxin toxicity. Blockade of AhR pathway components with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides demonstrated that the key developmental defects induced by weathered crude oil exposure are mediated by low-molecular-weight tricyclic PAHs through AhR-independent disruption of cardiovascular function and morphogenesis. These findings have multiple implications for the assessment of PAH impacts on coastal habitats.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cardiovascular function</kwd><kwd>fish development</kwd><kwd>non-point source pollution</kwd><kwd>oil spill</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Every recent assessment of coastal habitats worldwide, from tropical reefs to temperate estuaries, has cited land-based pollution or runoff as a major threat to aquatic ecosystem health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ehp0113-001755">Fabricius 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ehp0113-001755">Li and Daler 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ehp0113-001755">Pew Oceans Commission 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-ehp0113-001755">U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy 2004</xref>). As pervasive components of runoff from impervious surfaces, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a part of this problem, and there is very little understanding of their biologic impacts on aquatic resources. Because of urbanization and increased heavy vehicle use, storm water runoff and atmospheric deposition are now the largest sources of aquatic PAH contamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ehp0113-001755">Li and Daler 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ehp0113-001755">Lima et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ehp0113-001755">National Research Council 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-ehp0113-001755">Van Metre and Mahler 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-ehp0113-001755">Van Metre et al. 2000</xref>). An understanding of the effects of PAHs on aquatic organisms is essential to understanding fully the impacts of urbanization and non-point source pollution on coastal habitats.</p><p>On a smaller scale, oil spills have provided a more conspicuous view of the impacts of PAH pollution on aquatic resources. Hydrocarbons from oil spills can persist in nearshore sediments for decades or longer and have long-term effects on aquatic ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ehp0113-001755">Peterson et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ehp0113-001755">Reddy et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-ehp0113-001755">Short et al. 2004</xref>). The deleterious effects of PAHs on fish early-life stages were investigated extensively after the 1989 <italic>Exxon Valdez</italic> oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska, which contaminated nearshore and intertidal spawning grounds for Pacific herring (<italic>Clupea pallasi</italic>) and pink salmon (<italic>Oncorhynchus gorbuscha</italic>) with Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude oil. Field and laboratory studies in these species and others demonstrated a common syndrome of oil-induced embryolarval toxicity that occurs in a range of teleosts, including marine, freshwater, temperate, and tropical species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ehp0113-001755">Carls et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ehp0113-001755">Couillard 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ehp0113-001755">Heintz et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ehp0113-001755">Marty et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ehp0113-001755">Pollino and Holdway 2002</xref>). This was characterized by pericardial and yolk sac edema, jaw reductions, and curvature of the body axis. Increased weathering of crude oil enriches the fraction of tricyclic PAHs and their alkylated homologs and increases the frequency of malformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ehp0113-001755">Carls et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ehp0113-001755">Heintz et al. 1999</xref>). Additionally, delayed mortality also occurred in the absence of external malformations, as indicated by the reduced oceanic survival of pink salmon exposed to weathered crude oil as embryos and released as smolts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ehp0113-001755">Heintz et al. 2000</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms leading to PAH-associated malformations and sublethal effects during fish development are unknown. Most PAHs bind the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated basic-helix-loop-helix-Per-Arnt-Sim family transcription factor that controls the expression of a battery of genes encoding enzymes that convert PAHs to water-soluble derivates that are excreted, including mixed-function oxygenases such as cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ehp0113-001755">Nebert et al. 2004</xref>). Although CYP1A for decades has been the most widely used biomarker for PAH exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-ehp0113-001755">Whyte et al. 2000</xref>), its role as a bioindicator of PAH toxicity has been debated. Genetic analysis in the mouse has led to a dual model in which the AhR pathway mediates both an adaptive response by which xenobiotic compounds are metabolized and detoxified, and a toxic response whereby receptor activation results in negative impacts in the exposed animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ehp0113-001755">Nebert et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ehp0113-001755">Schmidt and Bradfield 1996</xref>). Generally, the toxic response occurs with AhR ligands that are poor substrates for CYP enzymes, in particular, halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as dioxins and poly-chlorinated biphenyls. Because these ligands are resistant to metabolism, they accumulate in tissues and persistently activate the AhR. On the other hand, PAHs are classically associated with the adaptive response, by which they are eliminated from tissues. Nevertheless, some high-molecular-weight PAHs such as benzo(<italic>a</italic>)pyrene are converted to carcinogenic reactive intermediates by CYP1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ehp0113-001755">Phillips 1983</xref>), and it is widely held that much of the acute toxicity of PAHs is due to oxidative stress and cellular damage arising from CYP1A catalytic activity.</p><p>In fish embryos, PAH and dioxin toxicities are usually equated because exposure to potent AhR ligands such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-<italic>p</italic>-dioxin (TCDD) induces a super-ficially similar syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ehp0113-001755">Peterson et al. 1993</xref>). In zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>), a brief exposure to TCDD shortly after fertilization results in the appearance of vascular dysfunction, pericardial and yolk sac edema, and anemia in hatching-stage larvae at 72&#x02013;96 hr postfertilization (hpf) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ehp0113-001755">Belair et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ehp0113-001755">Henry et al. 1997</xref>). These effects of TCDD exposure require a functional AhR. Because of genome duplication, many teleosts have two <italic>AhR</italic> genes, <italic>AhR1</italic> and <italic>AhR2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ehp0113-001755">Hahn 2002</xref>). AhR1 protein is most similar in structure to the single mammalian AhRs, whereas AhR2 is divergent. Although TCDD is a ligand for both receptors from several fish species, <italic>AhR2</italic> transcripts are more abundant and widely distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ehp0113-001755">Hahn 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ehp0113-001755">Karchner et al. 1999</xref>), and in zebrafish only AhR2 was found to be a functional receptor for TCDD and other common halogenated AhR ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ehp0113-001755">Andreasen et al. 2002</xref>). Consistent with these findings, targeted knockdown of AhR2 in zebrafish embryos with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) prevented all of the toxic effects of TCDD that occurred within the time frame of morpholino efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ehp0113-001755">Prasch et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-ehp0113-001755">Teraoka et al. 2003</xref>). However, AhR-dependent developmental defects were CYP1A independent. A CYP1A morpholino did not alter dioxin toxicity in zebrafish embryos, implicating other AhR target genes in dioxin pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ehp0113-001755">Carney et al. 2004</xref>).</p><p>A previous analysis showed that micro-molar concentrations of individual tricyclic PAHs representing the homologous series most abundant in weathered crude oil (fluorene, dibenzothiophene, and phenanthrene) caused a syndrome of edema and craniofacial and body axis defects after dose-dependent cardiac dysfunction that was first observed at about 36 hpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ehp0113-001755">Incardona et al. 2004</xref>).

Among four-ring compounds, chrysene (9 &#x003bc;M), which is enriched in highly weathered crude oil, was nontoxic, whereas pyrene (1&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;M), which is generally absent from weathered ANS crude oil, induced a syndrome with features similar to TCDD exposure that occurred between 80 and 96 hpf. Here, we show that <italic>a</italic>) both toxic and non-toxic PAHs induce CYP1A in zebrafish embryos, acting tissue specifically through AhR1 and AhR2; <italic>b</italic>) pyrene toxicity is AhR dependent, whereas tricyclic PAH toxicity is not; <italic>c</italic>) weathered ANS crude oil causes a syndrome in zebrafish embryos that is both clearly distinct from TCDD toxicity and consistent with cardiac dysfunction expected from the most abundant tricyclic compounds; and <italic>d</italic> ) the cardiovascular toxicity of weathered crude oil is independent of both AhR1 and AhR2.

Each experiment was replicated at least three times. For crude oil exposures, embryos were incubated statically in a water-accommodated fraction (WAF) of crude oil, or in the continuously flowing effluent from a gravel column. The WAF was prepared by an overnight high-energy spin of 50 mL ANS crude &#x0005b;partially weathered by heating to 70&#x000b0;C until 20% reduction in mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ehp0113-001755">Marty et al. 1997</xref>)&#x0005d; in 30 L zebrafish system water using a large fiberglass tank and a paint mixer fixed to a fan motor. The WAF contained an estimated 2.8 mg/L total PAH (initial) but has the disadvantage of a high proportion of other oil components such as alkanes because a large fraction is present in particulate or colloidal form. WAF was diluted with system water to 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, and 1:100, and static exposures were performed in 30 mm glass Petri dishes (25 embryos in 4 mL) in an incubator at 28.5&#x000b0;C.</p><p>We used oiled gravel columns to achieve a more environmentally relevant exposure.

However, despite this effect on CYP1A induction, AhR2 morphants (i.e., MO injected) were not protected from phenanthrene- or dibenzothiophene-induced cardiac dysfunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ehp0113-001755">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ehp0113-001755">Table 1</xref>).

Although we did not quantify changes in the dose response, AhR2 morphants generally had a higher degree of AV block than did controls at a given phenanthrene or dibenzothiophene concentration, consistent with a protective effect of CYP1A induction. Injection of AhR1-MO alone did not prevent CYP1A induction by phenanthrene (data not shown) and, in combination with AhR2-MO, did not prevent tricyclic PAH toxicity (Supplemental Movie 1; Supplemental Material available online (<ext-link xlink:href="http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2005/8230/supplement.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2005/8230/supplement.pdf</ext-link>)&#x0005d;. Therefore, although the tricyclic PAHs phenanthrene and dibenzothiophene induce CYP1A weakly in some blood vessels through AhR2, the primary toxicity of these PAHs in fish embryos is AhR independent, and their cardiac effects are not associated with AhR activation or CYP1A induction in the endocardium.</p><p>In contrast to the tricyclic PAHs, the effects of pyrene during zebrafish development overlap considerably with those previously reported for TCDD exposure. Despite widespread induction of CYP1A throughout the vascular endothelium observed as early as 36 hpf (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ehp0113-001755">Table 1</xref> and data not shown), the overt signs of pyrene toxicity do not appear until after 80 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ehp0113-001755">Figure 2</xref>). By 100 hpf, uninjected or AhR2-MIS&#x02013;injected embryos exposed to pyrene showed edema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ehp0113-001755">Figure 2A,C</xref> and data not shown), cell death in the neural tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ehp0113-001755">Figure 2E</xref>), and anemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ehp0113-001755">Figure 2G</xref>), as well as CYP1A immunofluorescence in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ehp0113-001755">Figure 2K</xref>) and throughout the vascular endothelium of the trunk and head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ehp0113-001755">Figure 2I,K</xref>). Most pyrene-exposed larvae die later in the fifth day of development (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ehp0113-001755">Table 1</xref>). Injection of AhR2-MO largely prevented the morphologic and lethal effects of pyrene exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ehp0113-001755">Figure 2B,D,F,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ehp0113-001755">Table 1</xref>) and markedly reduced the levels of CYP1A immunofluorescence assayed at both 48 hpf (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ehp0113-001755">Table 1</xref>) and 100 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ehp0113-001755">Figure 2J,L</xref>). At comparable time points, CYP1A morphants exposed to pyrene generally had defects that were less severe than those of controls. For example, pericardial edema was more severe at 96 hpf in AhR-MIS&#x02013;injected larvae than in CYP1A morphants, indicated by pericardial cross-sectional areas of 0.034 &#x000b1; 0.008 mm<sup>2</sup> and 0.021 &#x000b1; 002 mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 10 for each, <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). However, CYP1A-MO injection did not ultimately protect from pyrene toxicity because all of the defects associated with pyrene exposure (including lethality) appeared in CYP1A morphants 12&#x02013;18 hr later than in controls, possibly due to loss of MO efficacy at later stages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ehp0113-001755">Table 1</xref>). These findings indicate that, like phenanthrene and dibenzothiophene, pyrene selectively activates AhR2, but unlike these tricyclic PAHs, pyrene toxicity is AhR dependent. Moreover, delay of pyrene toxicity in CYP1A morphants suggests the involvement of a toxic CYP1A-derived pyrene metabolite.</p><p>A trivial explanation for the absence of embryonic toxicity for some compounds &#x0005b;e.g. chrysene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ehp0113-001755">Incardona et al. 2004</xref>)&#x0005d; could be a lack of tissue uptake during the course of the exposure. For example, because of differences in water solubility of PAHs with different ring arrangements but similar molecular weight (e.g., 0.67 &#x003bc;M pyrene vs. 0.009 &#x003bc;M chrysene), the effective exposure levels would be very different. However, exposure to 9 &#x003bc;M chrysene, which produces no apparent toxic effects, resulted in robust CYP1A immunofluorescence throughout the epidermis and the vascular endothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ehp0113-001755">Figure 3A,G</xref>). Most cranial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ehp0113-001755">Figure 3G</xref> and data not shown) and trunk vessels (data not shown), as well as the endothelial cells lining the cardiac ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ehp0113-001755">Figure 3H</xref>), expressed CYP1A after chrysene exposure. Remarkably, injection of AhR2-MO blocked induction of CYP1A in the epidermis by chrysene while leaving the vascular induction intact and generally increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ehp0113-001755">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, injection of AhR1-MIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ehp0113-001755">Figure 3C</xref>) or AhR1-MO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ehp0113-001755">Figure 3D</xref>) had no effect on CYP1A induction by chrysene, but coinjection of both AhR1-MO and AhR2-MO markedly reduced both epidermal and endothelial CYP1A immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ehp0113-001755">Figure 3E</xref>). Injection of CYP1A-MO eliminated virtually all CYP1A immunofluorescence associated with chrysene exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ehp0113-001755">Figure 3F</xref>). These findings indicate that chrysene can activate both AhR1 and AhR2 in a tissue-specific manner. Although either AhR1 or AhR2 can mediate the vascular induction of CYP1A by chrysene, the epidermal induction of CYP1A by chrysene is AhR2 specific. However, AhR activation and CYP1A induction by chrysene are not associated with any overt developmental toxicity or cardiac dysfunction (despite CYP1A induction in cardiac endothelial cells).</p></sec><sec><title>Embryonic cardiac dysfunction and the weathered crude oil syndrome.</title><p>We exposed zebrafish embryos to ANS crude oil weathered using two methods: generation of a WAF by an overnight high-energy spin of an oil&#x02013;water mixture and incubation in the effluent from a column loaded with oiled gravel (OGE) or control (clean) gravel (CGE).

Grossly, all embryos exposed to weathered crude oil showed dorsal curvature of the body axis; mild to moderate pericardial edema was seen in OGE-exposed embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ehp0113-001755">Figure 4B,D</xref>), and yolk sac edema was seen in WAF-exposed embryos (data not shown).

Cardiac looping was assessed quantitatively by measuring the angle between the cardiac chambers relative to the left&#x02013;right body axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ehp0113-001755">Figure 4E,F</xref>). CGE-exposed embryos fixed at 39 hpf had a mean inter-chamber angle of 28 &#x000b1; 5&#x000b0; (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6), whereas OGE-exposed embryos with weak contractility had a mean interchamber angle of 50 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0; (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 7, <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).

The late cardiac morphology typically showed chambers that were stretched along the anterior&#x02013;posterior axis, with the ventricle stiff and reduced in diameter and the atrium relatively dilated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ehp0113-001755">Figure 4D</xref>).

In most cases, and in particular in WAF-exposed embryos, both cardiac chambers ultimately collapsed into a stringlike structure when embryos were exposed for longer durations (data not shown).</p><p>Intracranial hemorrhage and doming of the head due to ventricular edema was very common among embryos exposed to either preparation (85% of OGE-exposed embryos in one experiment, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 66) and most often involved the mesencephalon/third ventricle and hindbrain/fourth ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ehp0113-001755">Figure 4H</xref>). Hemorrhage occasionally involved the branchial arches or eye but was never observed in tissues outside the head (data not shown). The sensitive period for intracranial hemorrhage was late during the second day of development to early in the third day; although not observed at 30 hpf, hemorrhage first occurred between 30 and 39 hpf, with the number of affected embryos maximal by 58&#x02013;63 hpf.</p><p>Finfold defects involving all fins and consisting of irregular edges or blisters were also common by 63&#x02013;72 hpf (94% of OGE-exposed embryos, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 66; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ehp0113-001755">Figure 4J,L</xref>).

The key finding is that the complex PAH mixture that comprises weathered crude oil caused early cardiac dysfunction similar to effects of model tricyclic PAHs, rather than a syndrome that arises later during the larval period, such as that associated with pyrene or TCDD exposure. Weathered crude oil also produced additional defects in zebrafish embryos (intracranial hemorrhage and finfold defects) that either are not observed with exposure to individual model PAHs or dioxins, or arise during an earlier developmental stage than AhR-mediated TCDD toxicity.</p></sec><sec><title>A protective role for the AhR pathway.</title><p>Embryos exposed to WAF or OGE showed identical robust patterns of CYP1A induction by 36 hpf. In OGE-exposed embryos, CYP1A immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ehp0113-001755">Figure 5</xref>, green) was strong in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ehp0113-001755">Figure 5B</xref>), cranial vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ehp0113-001755">Figure 5C</xref>), trunk vasculature (data not shown), and the endothelium lining both the atrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ehp0113-001755">Figure 5D</xref>) and ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ehp0113-001755">Figure 5E</xref>), but was absent in the myocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ehp0113-001755">Figure 5D,E</xref>, red fluorescence). CGE-exposed embryos showed only background immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ehp0113-001755">Figure 5A</xref>). As we observed for chrysene, injection of AhR2-MO blocked the epidermal induction of CYP1A by weathered crude oil, leaving the vascular induction intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ehp0113-001755">Figure 5I</xref>). Confocal imaging showed that the vascular CYP1A immunofluorescence was actually higher in AhR2 morphants than in uninjected or control morphants (data not shown). Nevertheless, AhR2-MO injection, in three separate experiments with maximum morpholino levels allowing viability, did not influence the cardiac dysfunction or intracranial hemorrhage caused by weathered crude oil exposure (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003e; 200, data not shown). In contrast, coinjection of AhR1-MO and AhR2-MO markedly reduced CYP1A immunofluorescence in both the epidermis and vasculature in OGE-exposed embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ehp0113-001755">Figure 5J</xref>). CYP1A immunofluorescence was virtually eliminated in OGE-exposed CYP1A morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ehp0113-001755">Figure 5K</xref>). In contrast to what we observed with pyrene, defects were more severe in OGE-exposed morphants with an inactive AhR pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ehp0113-001755">Figure 5F</xref>). At the earliest time point assayed (39 hpf), both AhR1/AhR2 double morphants and CYP1A morphants showed a significantly larger fraction with no circulating erythrocytes due to severe reductions in contractility (~ 50%, chi-square <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), and weak circulation with atrial regurgitation (~150% of controls, chi-square <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Although a very small but statistically significant increase in cardiac dysfunction was observed in either control or antisense morpholino-injected embryos incubated in CGE, the nature of the cardiac defects was different from that seen with weathered crude oil exposure and consistent with injection artifact (data not shown). Overall, these data indicate that the AhR pathway actually provides some degree of protection from PAH-induced cardiac toxicity.</p><p>Because cardiac output and intracranial hemorrhage are likely to be functionally related, it was difficult to determine whether AhR activation or CYP1A induction played a causal role in intracranial hemorrhage. Both CYP1A morphants and AhR1/AhR2 double morphants had a reduced overall occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage, but this was most likely due to the preponderance of embryos with no circulation. In these animals, erythrocytes would pool in the yolk sac. Intracranial hemorrhage was still present among most embryos that had circulation and a lack of CYP1A immunofluorescence (data not shown), which strongly suggests that the underlying pathophysiology is AhR independent. Because morpholinos are most effective at earlier developmental stages, we focused primarily on cardiac function. We did not assess whether the finfold defects resulting from weathered crude oil exposure required a functional AhR pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>PAHs of different molecular weight and structure generally are thought to share a common toxic mechanism mediated by the AhR pathway. The data presented here demonstrate that different PAH classes act via distinct toxic mechanisms during fish development. Moreover, our data reveal the complexity of different PAH classes with respect to their distribution in tissues and interactions with AhR family members. The very low abundance of zebrafish AhR1 mRNA coupled with a lack of TCDD binding and transactivation ability suggested that it encodes a nonclassical receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ehp0113-001755">Andreasen et al. 2002</xref>). However, non-halogenated PAHs were not tested in those studies, and it is clear from our results that AhR1 can be activated by some ligands. Although generally nontoxic to zebrafish embryos, chrysene appears to activate AhR1 and AhR2 <italic>in vivo</italic> in different tissues. Although the tricyclic PAHs and pyrene cause primarily vascular endothelial CYP1A induction, exposure to chrysene results in extensive CYP1A expression in the epidermis, as well. Although either AhR1 or AhR2 can mediate the vascular induction of CYP1A by chrysene, the epidermal induction of CYP1A by chrysene is AhR2 specific. The simplest interpretation is that chrysene accumulates in or binds to epidermal cells, possibly due to its higher hydrophobicity, whereas pyrene and the tricyclic PAHs do not, and that epidermal cells do not express AhR1. In contrast, based on the present results, we would predict that phenanthrene, dibenzothiophene, and pyrene selectively bind zebrafish AhR2 over AhR1.</p><p>Of the four model PAHs examined here, only one&#x02014;pyrene&#x02014;has dioxin-like (i.e., AhR-dependent) toxicity. Although there is considerable overlap between the effects of pyrene and TCDD on zebrafish larvae, there are distinct features to both syndromes. For example, exposure to pyrene during embryogenesis does not result in the jaw malformations observed with TCDD exposure. Similarly, although there is increased apoptotic cell death in the brain of TCDD-exposed larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ehp0113-001755">Dong et al. 2002</xref>), the developing spinal cord does not show the widespread cell death as observed with pyrene exposure. Most important, although CYP1A knockdown failed to modulate TCDD toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ehp0113-001755">Carney et al. 2004</xref>), the onset of pyrene toxicity was markedly delayed in CYP1A morphants. Most evidence suggests that TCDD toxicity is related to its poor metabolism by CYP enzymes and concomitant bioaccumulation with persistent, futile AhR activation. Moreover, the toxicity of halogenated aromatic compounds generally correlates with affinity for the AhR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ehp0113-001755">Hestermann et al. 2000</xref>) and, by extension, the degree of CYP1A induction. Of the model PAHs tested here, chrysene is the most potent CYP1A inducer &#x0005b;two orders of magnitude greater than pyrene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ehp0113-001755">Barron et al. 2004</xref>)&#x0005d; but the least toxic. Thus, even though metabolites of some individual PAHs (e.g., pyrene) may be embryotoxic, CYP1A induction or catalytic activity in itself appears to play little role in the developmental toxicity of petrogenic PAHs. Similarly, because chrysene had no overt toxicity in AhR1/AhR2 double or CYP1A morphants, neither unmetabolized chrysene nor CYP1A-derived metabolites are likely to contribute to the embryotoxicity of weathered crude oil.</p><p>Compared with urbanized aquatic systems, where PAHs are almost always mixed with other contaminants (e.g., metals, persistent organochlorines, pesticides), the weathered ANS crude oil model provides a fairly simple system for dissecting the effects of an environmentally relevant PAH mixture. The effects of weathered crude oil exposure have little in common with pyrene or TCDD toxicity and instead overlap to a surprising degree with those of individual tricyclic PAHs. The earliest and most pronounced effect of weathered crude oil is on cardiac function during looping stages and subsequent cardiac morphogenesis. These findings, coupled with our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ehp0113-001755">Incardona et al. 2004</xref>), indicate that the tricyclic components of weathered crude oil are the major toxic fraction and that the abundant alkylated PAHs probably have cardiac-specific activities similar to the nonalkylated homologs. Moreover, toxicity can be attributed to the parent compounds because metabolism of PAHs via the AhR pathway confers a degree of protection. These findings have widespread implications for ecological assessment and natural resource management.</p><p>First, PAH-contaminated environments are often characterized by mixtures derived from both petrogenic (e.g., oil spills) and pyrogenic (e.g., vehicle exhaust) sources. Within a mixture, the composition of individual PAHs can vary considerably from low- to high-molecular-weight compounds. Because different PAHs act on fish embryos via independent toxic mechanisms, understanding the cumulative toxicity of PAH mixtures will be more challenging than previously appreciated.</p><p>Second, these findings implicate cardiovascular dysfunction as a major proximal cause of deformities associated with exposure to petrogenic PAHs. This raises the possibility that lower exposure concentrations cause subtle cardiovascular effects in fish that otherwise appear normal. This might explain, for example, the reduced marine survival of pink salmon exposed as embryos to lower levels of weathered ANS crude oil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ehp0113-001755">Heintz et al. 2000</xref>).</p><p>Third, the variety of cardiac function abnormalities we observed with both model tricyclic PAHs and weathered crude oil suggests several potential targets in the myocardium, which, in addition to HERG potassium channels, includes sarcoplasmic or plasma membrane calcium channels, as well as gap junctions. In this light, it is notable that among PAHs with two to five rings, tricyclic compounds were the most potent in blocking dye coupling via gap junctions in an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ehp0113-001755">Blaha et al. 2002</xref>). The identification of direct cardiovascular pathophysiology as a key process underlying petrogenic PAH toxicity provides a conceptual framework for the development of better tools for assessing PAH effects in wild freshwater and marine fish.</p><p>Fourth, our findings emphasize the current limitations to assessing the effects of oil spills and other sources of aquatic PAH contamination. For many years, measuring CYP1A in field-collected samples has been the basis for assessing ecological damage and recovery after oil spills or remediation efforts in urbanized watersheds. However, CYP1A appears to play a protective rather than a causal role in petrogenic PAH toxicity. This greatly reduces the significance of CYP1A as a biomarker of PAH effect.</p><p>Finally, these results highlight the relative toxicity of low-molecular-weight tricyclic PAHs, which previously were considered to be weakly toxic based on the AhR agonist model. Phenanthrene inputs into the environment have remained constant in the last two decades, even in areas receiving inputs of predominantly pyrogenic PAHs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ehp0113-001755">Lima et al. 2002</xref>). An understanding of the impacts of tricyclic PAHs on at-risk fish species thus deserves greater emphasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary
