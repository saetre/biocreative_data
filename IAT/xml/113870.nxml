It is known to form a dimer with Ino2p, which regulates phospholipid biosynthetic genes. Mammalian bHLH proteins have been shown to form multiple dimer combinations. However, this flexibility in dimerization had not been documented for yeast bHLH proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay and a biochemical assay we show that Ino4p dimerizes with the Pho4p, Rtg1p, Rtg3p and Sgc1p bHLH proteins. Screening a yeast cDNA library identified three additional proteins that interact with Ino4p: Bck2p, YLR422W and YNR064C. The interaction with Bck2p prompted us to examine if any of the Bck2p-associated functions affect expression of phospholipid biosynthetic genes. We found that hyperosmotic growth conditions altered the growth phase regulation of a phospholipid biosynthetic gene, <italic>CHO1</italic>. There are two recent reports of initial whole genome yeast two-hybrid interactions. Interestingly, one of these reports identified five proteins that interact with Ino4p: Ino2p, Hcs1p, Apl2p, YMR317W and YNL279W. Ino2p is the only protein in common with the data presented here. Our finding that Ino4p interacts with five bHLH proteins suggests that Ino4p is likely to be a central player in the coordination of multiple biological processes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A common mechanism used to coordinate the expression of multiple genes is regulation of transcription. For example, regulation of genes involved in proliferation and differentiation is governed in part by a set of basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix (bHLH) proteins, Myc, Max, Mad and Mxi. The significance of this regulation is evident in the fact that abnormal regulation of these factors can result in malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c1">1</xref>). A hallmark of bHLH proteins in mammalian cells is their capacity to form multiple heterodimer combinations to regulate different pathways. Here we show that yeast bHLH proteins also have this capacity.</p><p>The role of the HLH domain is to create dimers by interactions between the amphipathic helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c3">3</xref>). Dimerization juxtaposes two regions, rich in basic residues, that create a DNA-binding interface which interacts with the consensus sequence, 5&#x02032;-CANNTG-3&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c3">3</xref>). The ability of bHLH proteins to form multiple dimer combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c5">5</xref>) allows them to recognize variations of the consensus sequence. However, there is dimerization specificity, since Myc and MyoD do not appear to form dimers. In the case of Max, dimerization is dependent on partner availability; Myc protein is transiently expressed in growth factor-stimulated cells and Mad protein is expressed during differentiation.</p><p>The <italic>INO2</italic> and <italic>INO4</italic> genes regulate expression of the phospholipid biosynthetic genes in response to inositol and choline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c6">6</xref>). The Ino2p and Ino4p proteins share significant homology to the bHLH region of the Myc family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c8">8</xref>). Neither Ino2p nor Ino4p can form homodimers but they do form a heterodimer which interacts with a conserved 10 bp element (5&#x02032;-CATGTGAAAT-3&#x02032;) called UAS<italic><sub>INO</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c10">10</xref>). The first six bases of the UAS<italic><sub>INO</sub></italic> element contain the consensus bHLH binding site. Ino2p contains an activation domain while Ino4p is required for dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c10">10</xref>). <italic>INO2</italic> gene expression is regulated &#x0223c;12-fold by inositol and choline in a manner similar to that of its genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c11">11</xref>). Unlike <italic>INO2</italic>, <italic>INO4</italic> expression is only modestly regulated by inositol and choline at the post-transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c12">12</xref>).</p><p>We have previously suggested that Ino4p may form dimers with multiple bHLH proteins. This was based on the identification of <italic>INO4</italic>-dependent&#x0002f;<italic>INO2</italic>-independent elements in the promoters of the <italic>CTR1</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>HMN1</italic> and <italic>INO1</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c14">14</xref>). It has also been proposed that Ino4p interacts with an, as yet unknown, myristoylation-sensitive transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c15">15</xref>). In addition to Ino2p and Ino4p, there are five well-studied bHLH proteins in yeast. The <italic>PHO4</italic> gene was the first yeast gene shown to encode a bHLH protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c16">16</xref>). Binding of a Pho4p dimer (to the sequence 5&#x02032;-CACGTG-3&#x02032;) is required for the &#x0223c;1000-fold induction of gene expression in response to phosphate starvation. The <italic>CPF1</italic> (<italic>CEP1</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>CBF1</italic>) gene encodes a protein that binds a centromeric sequence called CDEI (5&#x02032;-RTCACRTG-3&#x02032;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c18">18</xref>) to regulate chromosomal segregation. Cpf1p is also required for regulation of methionine biosynthetic genes. The <italic>RTG1</italic> and <italic>RTG3</italic> genes were identified as regulators of <italic>CIT2</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c20">20</xref>). Expression of the nuclear encoded <italic>CIT2</italic> gene is regulated in response to the functional state of the mitochondria (termed retrograde regulation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c19">19</xref>). In strains lacking mitochondrial DNA, <italic>CIT2</italic> expression is induced 6- to 30-fold. The <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence (UAS<sub>r</sub>) required for induction of <italic>CIT2</italic> expression forms an <italic>RTG1</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>RTG3</italic>-dependent complex but does not contain any sequences that resemble the consensus bHLH binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c20">20</xref>). Rtg1p is responsible for recruiting the activation domain of Rtg3p to the UAS<sub>r</sub> element, allowing for transcriptional activation of the target genes. The <italic>SGC1</italic> gene is required for expression of glycolytic genes in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c21">21</xref>). It is not known whether Sgc1p binds a consensus bHLH binding site.</p><p>Recently, two published reports document initial results from whole genome two-hybrid arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c23">23</xref>). One of the reports identified several Ino4p interactors using a high throughput screening procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c22">22</xref>). Here we report that Ino4p interacts with five bHLH proteins (Ino2p, Pho4p, Rtg1p, Rtg3p and Sgc1p) and three non-bHLH proteins (Bck2p, YLR422W and YNR064C). The only overlap with the published report is Ino2p. We also show that hyperosmotic growth conditions alter growth phase regulation of the <italic>CHO1</italic> phospholipid biosynthetic gene. This observation is consistent with the hypo-osmosensitive phenotype of a <italic>BCK2</italic> null allele.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains, yeast strains and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> KC8 cells (<italic>hsd</italic>R, <italic>leu</italic>B600, <italic>trp</italic>C9830, <italic>pyr</italic>F::Tn<italic>5</italic>, <italic>his</italic>B463, <italic>lac</italic>&#x00394;X74, <italic>str</italic>A, <italic>gal</italic>U, <italic>gal</italic>K) were used to shuttle the two-hybrid library plasmids out of yeast.

Previous one-hybrid assays suggest that Ino4p does not contain an activation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c10">10</xref>). However, we found that the Y190 yeast strain containing the pGBT9-INO4<sub>2&#x02013;151</sub> construct did yield blue colonies after a 4 day incubation. Quantitation of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity revealed that, unlike earlier reports, Ino4p can modestly activate transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd635f1">1</xref>A). However when strain Y190 was simultaneously transformed with pGBT9-INO4<sub>2&#x02013;151</sub> and the pGAD424 vector this modest activity was eliminated (data not shown). This most likely results from a lower plasmid copy number in the double transformant, which brings the level of activation by pGBT9-INO4<sub>2&#x02013;151</sub> below the level of sensitivity of the reporter.</p><p>To map the transcriptional activation domain of Ino4p we created a set of Ino4p N- and C-terminal deletions fused to the Gal4BD. The various deletions were transformed into Y190 and <italic>lacZ</italic> expression was determined. Deleting 21 residues from the N-terminus and&#x0002f;or deleting 16 residues from the C-terminus eliminated expression of the <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd635f1">1</xref>A). Curiously, these deletions were still able to complement an <italic>ino4</italic>&#x00394; strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd635f1">1</xref>B), suggesting that the Gal4BD&#x02013;Ino4p fusion was still capable of interacting with Ino2p. This also demonstrates that the ability to activate transcription is not required for complementation. Constructs deleting 42 residues from the N-terminus and&#x0002f;or 50 residues from the C-terminus were unable to complement an <italic>ino4</italic>&#x00394; strain or activate transcription of the <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd635f1">1</xref>A).</p></sec><sec><title>Ino4p interacts with multiple yeast bHLH proteins</title><p>It has been established that in mammalian cells bHLH proteins can form homodimer and multiple pairwise heterodimer combinations. This prompted us to examine if yeast bHLH proteins also form multiple heterodimer combinations. In <italic>S.cerevis</italic>i<italic>ae</italic> there are five other known bHLH proteins in addition to Ino4p and Ino2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c30">30</xref>). The coding sequence of <italic>INO4</italic> was employed as the bait (in pGBT9) and the coding sequences of <italic>INO2</italic> and the other five bHLH genes (<italic>PHO4</italic>, <italic>RTG1</italic>, <italic>RTG3</italic>, <italic>CBF1</italic> and <italic>SGC1</italic>) were used as the prey (in pGAD424). These plasmids were simultaneously transformed into Y190. Trp<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0002f;Leu<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants were replica plated onto Trp<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0002f;Leu<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0002f;X-gal plates. The plates were monitored daily for 4&#x000a0;days for the blue colony phenotype and positive transformants were assayed for &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity using a liquid assay. By both assays, Ino4p and Ino2p were shown to interact, confirming previous biochemical and two-hybrid results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c31">31</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd635f2">2</xref>). These assays also demonstrated that the gene products of <italic>RTG1</italic>, <italic>RTG3</italic>, <italic>SGC1</italic> and <italic>PHO4</italic> all interact with Ino4p. Cpf1p was the only bHLH protein that did not interact with Ino4p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd635f2">2</xref>). However, the Gal4AD&#x02013;Cbf1p fusion was able to complement the methionine auxotrophy of a <italic>cbf1</italic>&#x00394; strain, indicating that the fusion protein was expressed (data not shown). The amount of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity ranged from 15 (Sgc1p as the prey) to 104 U (Ino2p as the prey). However, these values do not reflect the strength of interaction, since some of the bHLH proteins have activation domains (Ino2p, Pho4p and Rtg3p).</p><p>A biochemical assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd635f3">3</xref>) was used to confirm the interactions observed with the two-hybrid assay. To do this, each of the bHLH preys was labeled via an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription&#x02013;translation reaction. 6&#x000d7;His&#x02013;Ino4p was produced in <italic>E.coli</italic> and incubated with each of the labeled preys. 6&#x000d7;His&#x02013;Ino4p and associated proteins were purified through a nickel affinity column and the proteins fractionated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. As a negative control the labeled proteins were incubated with an extract from <italic>E.coli</italic> transformed with plasmid pET-15b (parental plasmid). This assay confirmed the interactions with Ino2p, Pho4p, Rtg3p and Sgc1p. The Rtg1p interaction was not confirmed because it was not produced by the <italic>in vitro</italic> labeling system.</p></sec><sec><title>Ino4p interacts with YLR422W, YNR064C and Bck2p</title><p>We screened a yeast library to determine if there are other proteins that interact with Ino4p. The cDNA library and pGBT9-INO4<sub>2&#x02013;151</sub> were simultaneously transformed into Y190. Approximately 33 000 transformants were plated onto Trp<sup>&#x02013;</sup>&#x0002f;Leu<sup>&#x02013;</sup>&#x0002f;His<sup>&#x02013;</sup>&#x0002f;X-gal. The plates were monitored daily for the presence of blue colonies. After 4 days the Y190 strain transformed with pGBT9-INO4<sub>2&#x02013;151</sub> by itself begins to turn blue. Therefore, any colony that turned blue after 4 days was considered to result from activation by plasmid pGBT9-INO4<sub>2&#x02013;151</sub>. The 32 Trp<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0002f;Leu<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0002f;His<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0002f;X-gal<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants that turned blue before day 4 were selected for further study.</p><p>A number of control transformations were performed to eliminate false positives. Initially, the isolated library plasmids were retransformed along with pGBT9-INO4<sub>2&#x02013;151</sub> into Y190 to ensure that the original &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity was the result of the isolated library plasmid. Next, the library plasmid was transformed into Y190 alone, to ensure that the &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity was the result of an interaction between the library plasmid and pGBT9-INO4<sub>2&#x02013;151</sub> and not autoactivation by the library clone. The library plasmids were transformed with three different control plasmids: pGBT9, Gal4BD; pLAM5&#x02032;, human lamin C; pVA3, murine p53(72&#x02013;390). These transformations are used to determine if the library plasmids encoded non-specific binding proteins or Gal4BD-specific binding proteins. In addition, the identity of the library inserts was determined by sequencing the prey plasmids and searching the Stanford yeast genome database (genome-www.stanford.edu&#x0002f;Saccharomyces ). Seven transformants were common false positives that have turned up in multiple two-hybrid screens and are confirmed as false positives by independent experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c32">32</xref>). These false positives consist of, but are not limited to, mitochondrial proteins, splicing factors and cell cycle proteins. Seven transformants contained artifacts of library construction that consisted of either two genes fused together or sequences in the wrong orientation.</p><p>We selected for further study two ORFs of unknown function, YLR422W and YNR064C, and <italic>BCK2</italic>, a serine&#x0002f;threonine protein kinase in the cell wall integrity and osmoregulatory pathways. The library plasmids only contained small portions of YLR422W, YNR064C and <italic>BCK2</italic>, raising the possiblity that the interaction with the bait may be due to altered protein conformations present in the prey fusions. To eliminate this possibility, the entire coding sequences of YNR064C and <italic>BCK2</italic> were cloned into pGEM-T and subsequently cloned into&#x000a0;pGAD424. Because of the large size of YLR422W, only the C-terminal 767 amino acids were used. This region contains the sequences present in the original library isolate. These clones were transformed simultaneously into Y190 with pGBT9-INO4<sub>2&#x02013;151</sub> and Trp<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0002f;Leu<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants were selected. The transformants were assayed for &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity. Similar to the original library clones, these new constructs also activated the <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter, suggesting that the encoded proteins are in fact interacting with Ino4p (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd635tb2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>CHO1</italic> expression is regulated by growth phase</title><p>The above results indicate that Ino4p interacts with several yeast proteins. This suggested the possibility that these interactions might affect regulation of the phospholipid biosynthetic genes under previously uncharacterized conditions. We investigated the effect of several conditions on regulation of the phospholipid biosynthetic genes using several <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter fusions. We found that hyperosmotic conditions affected phospholipid biosynthetic gene expression. This is consistent with the interaction with <italic>BCK2</italic>, since <italic>bck2</italic>&#x00394; mutants are hypo-osmosensitive.</p><p>In addition to being regulated by inositol and choline, the phospholipid biosynthetic genes are also regulated by growth phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c33">33</xref>). Confirming previous results, we found that <italic>CHO1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>lacZ</italic> expression was regulated by growth phase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd635f4">4</xref>A). More specifically, <italic>CHO1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>lacZ</italic> expression levels in I<sup>&#x02013;</sup>C<sup>&#x02013;</sup> medium (derepressing) start out low at the beginning of the lag phase and increase throughout the log phase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd635f4">4</xref>B). &#x003b2;-Galactosidase levels peak at the beginning of stationary phase and decrease precipitously until it reaches the initial expression levels seen in early lag phase. The expression pattern is similar in I<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>C<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> medium, however, because expression levels are repressed in this medium, the overall expression levels are lower than those observed in I<sup>&#x02013;</sup>C<sup>&#x02013;</sup> medium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd635f4">4</xref>A).</p><p>Expression of the <italic>CHO1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>lacZ</italic> gene was altered in response to external solute concentration. In the presence of 0.7 M NaCl <italic>CHO1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>lacZ</italic> expression begins at approximately the same levels as cultures grown in the absence of solutes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd635f4">4</xref>A). However, in the presence of 0.7 M NaCl <italic>CHO1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>lacZ</italic> gene expression stays at this initial level throughout the entire growth phase. Because <italic>CHO1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>lacZ</italic> gene expression is not completely repressed by inositol and choline, we were also able to look at both growth phase regulation and the osmotic response under I<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>C<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> conditions. In the presence of 0.7 M NaCl <italic>CHO1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>lacZ</italic> gene expression levels were again equal to those seen in cultures grown without solutes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd635f4">4</xref>A). This initial expression level was maintained with no obvious growth phase regulation. Therefore, the addition of solutes separates growth phase regulation from the inositol and choline response.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In contrast to the previously reported one-hybrid results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c33">33</xref>), we observed a low level of activation from the Gal4p&#x02013;Ino4p fusion protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd635f1">1</xref>A). Short deletions from either the N- or C-terminus of Ino4p eliminated the activation function (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd635f1">1</xref>A). However, these deletions were still able to activate transcription of the <italic>INO1</italic> gene. One possible explanation for the loss of activation is that regions at the N- and C-termini may include an activation domain. Consistent with this possibility, the sequences that were deleted included short stretches of acidic residues. However, the question remains, is this activation activity physiologically relevant? To address this question, it will be necessary to determine if the activation function is required for expression of the <italic>INO4</italic> target genes.</p><p>In mammalian cells bHLH proteins have been shown to form multiple heterodimers in order to regulate a diverse set of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c5">5</xref>). Our results demonstrate that Rtg1p, Rtg3p, Pho4p and Sgc1p all interact with Ino4p (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd635f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd635f3">3</xref>). Mutant alleles of the yeast bHLH genes are not inositol auxotrophs, suggesting that these proteins do not play a direct role in phospholipid biosynthesis (B.P.Ashburner and J.M.Lopes, unpublished data; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c21">21</xref>). These observations suggest that Ino4p is at the center of a network designed to coordinate multiple cellular functions. <italic>RTG1</italic> and <italic>RTG3</italic> are required for communication between the mitochondria and nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c34">34</xref>) which allows the cell to adjust to changes in mitochondrial activity and biogenesis. Increased mitochondrial activity may signal increased biosynthesis of mitochondria and therefore, an increased need for phospholipids. Sgc1p is a regulator of glycolytic gene expression. This interaction would suggest that energy production might be coordinated with phospholipid biosynthesis. An increase in the glycolytic flow may increase growth rates that might require an increase in phospholipid biosynthesis.</p><p>The two-hybrid assay established an interaction with Pho4p (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd635f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd635f3">3</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that <italic>PHO5</italic>, a gene directly regulated by Pho4p, contains a putative UAS<italic><sub>INO</sub></italic> element (5&#x02032;-CATGTGCGAT-3&#x02032;) and is responsive to inositol in an <italic>INO2</italic>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c35">35</xref>). This suggests that Ino2p&#x0002f;Ino4p heterodimers may bind to the <italic>PHO5</italic> promoter to regulate its expression in an inositol-dependent manner. Ino2p&#x0002f;Ino4p binding to UAS<italic><sub>INO</sub></italic>-like elements as in the <italic>PHO5</italic> promoter is one mechanism for cross-regulation of pathways. Another mechanism is the formation of different heterodimers, like Pho4p&#x0002f;Ino4p. However, it is unlikely that these heterodimers regulate <italic>PHO5</italic>, since its regulation is <italic>INO2</italic>-dependent. Using microarrays, we have recently discovered that Ino4p represses expression of the <italic>PHO13</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> genes (K.A.Robinson and J.M.Lopes, unpublished data). This repression may be the result of an Ino4p:Pho4p interaction.</p><p>One of the next challenges will be to identify the binding sites for the Ino4p:bHLH dimer combinations. The crystal structure of Max and Pho4p allows one to make some predictions as to how the yeast bHLH dimers might interact with their cognate binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c36">36</xref>). Pho4p homodimers bind the DNA sequence 5&#x02032;-CACGTG-3&#x02032;, with each monomer forming three contacts with each half-site. The complementary base at the first position (G residue) is bound by H5 of the basic region (3&#x02032;-<bold>G</bold>TGCAC-5&#x02032;), while the CA residues are bound by E9 (5&#x02032;-<bold>CA</bold>CGTG-3&#x02032;) and the complementary base at the third position (G residue) is bound by R13 (3&#x02032;-GT<bold>G</bold>CAC-5&#x02032;) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd635f5">5</xref>A). Rtg1p:Rtg3p binding to the UAS<sub>r</sub> is difficult to predict because Rtg1p contains a truncated basic region and the UAS<sub>r</sub> (5&#x02032;-GGTCAC-3&#x02032;) is not a consensus bHLH binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c19">19</xref>). However, Rtg3p does contain a complete basic region which likely interacts with the distal half-site (5&#x02032;-GGT<bold>CAC</bold>-3&#x02032;) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd635f5">5</xref>B). The distal half-site in the UAS<sub>r</sub> resembles the proximal bHLH half-site. Thus, Rtg3p may be facing in the opposite direction from the other bHLH proteins. It is difficult to predict how Rtg1p binds to the UAS<sub>r</sub> element because of the absence of certain conserved amino acids in the basic region. The UAS<italic><sub>INO</sub></italic> element 5&#x02032;-CATGTGAAAT-3&#x02032; is not a palindrome, which complicates predicting the orientation of the Ino2p&#x0002f;Ino4p interaction with the bHLH binding site. The distal half-site probably forms the same contacts described above with either Ino2p or Ino4p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd635f5">5</xref>C). However, the proximal half-site has an A instead of a G residue at the complementary base of the third position. Therefore, R13 of Ino2p or Ino4p might interact with this A residue. The orientation of Ino2p&#x0002f;Ino4p on the UAS<italic><sub>INO</sub></italic> element may be directional, since the binding site is not a palindrome. These heterodimer:DNA interactions allow one to infer possible interactions for the new heterodimer combinations. For example, Pho4p:Ino4p may bind to the following elements: 5&#x02032;-CACGTG-3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-CATGTG-3&#x02032; or 5&#x02032;-CACATG-3&#x02032;. However, the actual binding sites will have to be determined experimentally.</p><p>A two-hybrid screen of a yeast cDNA library demonstrated that the products of two ORFs and the gene <italic>BCK2</italic> interact with Ino4p (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd635tb2">2</xref>). One ORF, YNR064C, encodes a 33 kDa protein with homology to the family of serine esterases. There is no additional information about the other ORF, YLR422W. <italic>BKC2</italic> encodes a serine&#x0002f;threonine kinase that plays a role in the PCK pathway that is responsible for cell integrity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd635c37">37</xref>). As the yeast cell grows and divides, as well as during mating and sporulation, the cell wall must be continuously remodeled and expanded. These are also conditions under which the phospholipid membrane must be remodeled and expanded. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to suggest that these two pathways would be coordinately regulated. The <italic>BCK2</italic> pathway also helps maintain proper osmolyte concentrations, since <italic>bck2</italic>&#x00394; strains are hypo-osmosensitive. Consistent with this phenotype, we discovered that the concentration of salt in the medium affected the expression of some of the phospholipid biosynthetic genes. Growth phase regulation of the <italic>CHO1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>lacZ</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd635f4">4</xref>) and <italic>INO1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>lacZ</italic> reporter genes (data not shown) was eliminated or altered in the presence of 0.7 M NaCl.</p><p>The interaction of Ino4p with the other bHLH proteins demonstrates the potential to regulate a vast set of genes with a few regulatory genes. This information places a premium on determining what genes are regulated by these new heterodimers. Most importantly, the finding that yeast bHLH proteins also form multiple dimer combinations and the wealth of knowledge on the roles of the individual proteins make yeast a model organism for the study of cross-pathway regulation by bHLH proteins.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd635f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> One-hybrid and complementation assays of Gal4BD&#x02013;Ino4p deletions.
