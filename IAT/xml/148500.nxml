Here, the kinetics of removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) by both pathways is determined at base resolution in the transcribed strand (TS) and the non-transcribed strand (NTS) of the sprpb2 +gene. UVDR does not remove lesions in a strand-specific manner, indicating that UVDR is neither stimulated nor inhibited by RNA polymerase II transcription. In contrast, in a UVDR-deficient strain the TS is repaired preferentially. This strong strand bias suggests that in S.pombe, as in other species, NER is coupled to transcription. In repair-proficient S.pombe the TS is repaired very rapidly, as a consequence of two efficiently operating pathways, while the NTS is repaired more slowly, mainly by UVDR. Furthermore, we demonstrate that UVDR is not always faster than NER.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
