In the mammalian olfactory bulb (OB), NO plays a role in the formation of olfactory memory evoked by pheromones as well as conventional odorants. While NO generated by the neuronal isoform of NO synthase (nNOS) regulates neurogenesis in the olfactory epithelium, NO has not been implicated in olfactory signal transduction. We now show the expression and function of the endothelial isoform of NO synthase (eNOS) in mature olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of adult mice. Using NO-sensitive micro electrodes, we show that stimulation liberates NO from isolated wild-type OSNs, but not from OSNs of eNOS deficient mice. Integrated electrophysiological recordings (electro-olfactograms or EOGs) from the olfactory epithelium of these mice show that NO plays a significant role in modulating adaptation. Evidence for the presence of eNOS in mature mammalian OSNs and its involvement in odorant adaptation implicates NO as an important new element involved in olfactory signal transduction. As a diffusible messenger, NO could also have additional functions related to cross adaptation, regeneration, and maintenance of MOE homeostasis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a small gaseous molecule that can diffuse through lipid membranes and plays important roles in various intra- and inter-cellular signalling processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005499-Dawson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

In our studies we found no evidence for a role of eNOS in basal cell proliferation though we cannot rule out functions for eNOS in cell homeostasis or migration. Its presence in the upper layer of the lamina propria can be explained by the presence of epithelial blood vessels in the lamina and the association of eNOS with blood vessels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005499-Lamas1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Though eNOS expression cannot be excluded completely, immunohistochemistry does not show detectable levels of eNOS protein in the olfactory cilia of mature OSNs. However, the diffusible character of NO does not necessarily require the enzyme to occur in the transduction zone in order for it to play a role in signal transduction per se. Presumably, NO could diffuse from the dendritic knob to at least the basal regions of the cilia. This would be consistent with our functional data discussed below suggesting that NO might play a role in odorant adaptation. Nonetheless, the presence of eNOS in the dendrite and soma would allow NO to additionally fulfill one or more other secondary signalling functions.</p><p>We assume the amperometric signal was specific for NO since the specificity of the nickel tretrasulfonated phthalocyanine based platinum electrodes we used has been extensively tested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005499-Bedioui1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005499-Chang1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. At the potential applied, it is NO that is almost exclusively oxidized at the catalytic surface of the electrode. Additionally the NO-microsensors are coated with a Nafion membrane as an anti-interference layer which repels negatively charged molecules such as NO<sup>2&#x02212;</sup>, the main contaminant in NO-measurements. The only remaining potential contaminant would be dopamine, which is known to be released from free nerve endings in the olfactory mucosa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005499-Lucero1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. However, since we are measuring NO release from dissociated OSNs, dopamine contamination from free nerve endings could not interfere with the signal. Our measurements do not allow quantifying the amount and kinetics of NO release because the distance between the cell and the electrode could not be determined. As NO is not stable and gets oxidized at the electrode in close proximity to the cell, only the flux of molecules is relevant information. The concentration cannot be calculated due to the unknown volume (defined in large part by the unknown distance between cell and electrode) and the changes in flux over time. Consequently, we opted to express the flux of NO released from the cell as the current generated by oxidation of NO to NO<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> at the sensor surface.</p><p>NO appears to be released from mature, functional OSNs. Most experiments were performed on OSNs isolated from OMP-GFP mice, which allowed using the green fluorescence of the cells in addition to the morphology to ensure the cells were mature, intact OSNs. We demonstrate that depolarization of these cells leads to NO-release and that this release is dependent on the presence of functional endothelial NO-synthase. We could also show that NO is released upon stimulation with forskolin as well as odorants, the normal physiological stimulus for OSNs. Since we also showed that NO-release is dependent on extracellular calcium, eNOS is potentially activated by the rise in intracellular calcium that occurs when the olfactory neuron is excited. Together, this argues that activation of eNOS is a general process in mature mammalian OSNs that is triggered by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx into the cells through the odorant-activated cyclic nucleotide signaling cascade as well as through opening of voltage activated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels. While simultaneous measurement of NO release and the odorant-evoked electrophysiological or calcium response of a cell would provide more direct evidence that NO is released from mature, functional OSNs, this experiment is not possible to achieve with the technology we used.</p><p>Since 100&#x00025; of all tested wild-type neurons respond to veratridine with a detectable NO-signal, we suggest that most if not all OSNs are able to produce NO, not just a small subpopulation of the cells. The lower incidence in NO-release upon stimulation with KCl or forskolin does not argue against that contention, but rather more likely reflects experimentally-imposed limitations in those experiments. Similar lower activation rates in response to KCl or forskolin stimulation, for instance, were obtained in patch-clamp experiments using OSNs from OMP-GFP animals (data not shown).</p><p>The difference in EOG amplitudes between wild type and eNOS-deficient mice argues that eNOS contributes to response adaptation. The decline in amplitude of the EOG in the eNOS-deleted mutants in response to repeated odorant stimulation was significantly slower than the decline observed in wild-type mice. The fact that similar results could be obtained by blocking eNOS in the OE by the potent NOS-inhibitor L-NMMA clearly indicates that this change in adaptation is due to the deficiency of eNOS rather than some other unknown genetic factor.</p><p>Our experiments do not address the mechanism by which NO regulates adaptation. Since the major target for NO is soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), NO could act via sGC by increasing intracellular cGMP. Consistent with this notion, odorants can elevate cGMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005499-Breer1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005499-Moon1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, and the rise in cGMP-concentration can be inhibited by the NOS-inhibitor L-NOARG (L-NG-nitro arginine) as well as by the NO-scavenger hemoglobin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005499-Breer1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Another possible pathway is S-nitrosylation of olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005499-Broillet1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, which has been shown to modulate the open probability of the channel. The nature of the change in adaptation kinetics as well as the longevity of this effect would be more consistent with cGMP mediation, especially, since cGMP has been implicated in a form of long lasting odor adaptation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005499-Zufall1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> that occurs upon strong odorant stimulation of OSNs and can last up to 6.5 min. Previously, this pathway has been linked to cGMP production by another gaseous messenger, carbon monoxide, produced by heme oxygenase in OSNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005499-Ingi1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Collectively, our evidence for the presence of eNOS in mature mammalian OSNs and its involvement in odorant adaptation implicates NO as an important new element involved in olfactory signal transduction. Because NO is a gaseous second messenger, it could also have paracrine effects. NO has been shown to act simultaneously in both an autocrine and a paracrine manner in other cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005499-Torroglosa1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. It may therefore also subserve a paracrine function, for example mediating cross-talk with other cells in the MOE such as sustentacular cells, glands, and basal cells, or even neighbouring OSNs. Establishing the presence of eNOS in the MOE therefore may not only further our understanding of olfactory signal transduction but also shed new light on research on cross adaptation to different odorants, regeneration, and maintenance of MOE homeostasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>For experiments wild-type (C57BL6) and OMP-GFP mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005499-Potter1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> (provided by P.

The catalytic surface of the electrodes consisted of a layer of Nickel tetrasulfonate phthalocyanine tetrasodium salt (Ni-TSPc) polymerized on the microelectrode surface, resulting in a disc-like surface with a diameter of 10 &#x000b5;m. The electrodes were coated with a permselective nafion membrane to prevent negative ions from binding to the catalytical surface. Dissociated cells of the MOE were plated on coverslips and placed into a recording chamber with the electrodes positioned above OSNs under optical control on an inverted microscope (Axiovert 25C, Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For experiments with low extracellular calcium the cells of the MOE were washed with a solution containing low calcium buffered to 1 nM (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0,1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4) prior to stimulation with forskolin dissolved in the same solution. In experiments with the unspecific NOS inhibitor L-NAME (N(G)-Nitro-L-Arginine-methyl-ester, obtained from SIGMA, Deisenhofen, Germany) cells were incubated with 1 mM L-NAME at least 15 min prior to stimulation. Veratridine, forskolin (10 mM stock solution in DMSO), KCl, octanal and geraniol (1:1 diluted in DMSO) (all obtained from SIGMA, Deisenhofen, Germany) were dissolved in Ringer's solution and delivered directly to the bath as a single bolus with a stimulus pipette. The application method produced NO signals that were often preceded by large current deflections with a much faster time constant than NO-elicited electrode currents. These current deflections were considered as artifacts since they also occurred on application of Ringer's solution and/or when cells were absent. They were subsequently removed for clarity. Changes in NO concentration were measured by amperometric recording, using a low-noise Petite Ampere potentiostat (BAS Instruments, West Lafayette, USA) at a constant electrode potential of &#x0002b;750 mV versus an Ag/AgCl bath electrode.

Quantification of BrdU-positive cells was done at three levels along the anterior posterior axis of the MOE located about 3 mm apart from each other and referred to as front, middle and back.
