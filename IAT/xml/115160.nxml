Models for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by recombination invoke nuclease processing at multiple steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c1">1</xref>). Nucleases are predicted to resect the ends at DSBs to generate intermediates with 3&#x02032; single-stranded tails. This could occur by the activity of a double-stranded exonuclease, or a single-stranded endo- or exonuclease working in concert with a helicase. Intermediates with 3&#x02032; single-stranded tails have been identified during meiotic recombination and at the <italic>MAT</italic> locus during mating type switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c3">3</xref>). Following homologous pairing and strand invasion to produce heteroduplex DNA, the displaced strand (D-loop) may pair with the other side of the break to form an intermediate with Holliday junctions. The Holliday junctions can be resolved by branch migration or endonucleolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c4">4</xref>). Alternatively, the D-loop formed by strand invasion could collapse after limited DNA synthesis to displace the invading 3&#x02032;-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c5">5</xref>), resulting in gap repair without an associated crossover. Mismatches present in heteroduplex DNA are repaired by the mismatch repair system, which involves exonucleolytic processing of one strand of the heteroduplex to the site of the mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c7">7</xref>).</p><p>The nucleases involved in each of these steps in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> have been identified by genetic and biochemical methods, however, much less is known of the nucleases with equivalent functions in eukaryotes. Of the genes required for ionizing radiation resistance in yeast, most function at a step subsequent to the processing of DNA ends. The exceptions are the <italic>MRE11</italic>, <italic>RAD50</italic> and <italic>XRS2</italic> genes, the products of which function as a complex to regulate the processing of DSBs <italic>in vivo</italic>. In these mutants there is a delay in the resection of DSBs generated by the HO endonuclease, but repair still occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c8">8</xref>). The Mre11 protein has endonuclease and 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonuclease activities <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c12">12</xref>). However, point mutations that abolish the nuclease activity of Mre11 <italic>in vitro</italic> cause no apparent defect in the processing step <italic>in vivo</italic> in mitotic cells, although they are defective in processing DSBs produced during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c13">13</xref>). Furthermore, as the polarity of the Mre11 exonuclease is opposite to that predicted for resection of DSBs, this has raised the issue of whether Mre11 functions directly in the processing of ends. An alternate hypothesis is that the Mre11&#x0002f;Rad50&#x0002f;Xrs2 (MRX) complex unwinds DNA ends for the Mre11 endonuclease to clip off the 5&#x02032; strands, and this nuclease activity is redundant with other nucleases in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c12">12</xref>).</p><p>Exonuclease I was identified from fractionated extracts of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> as a 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; double-stranded deoxyribonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c15">15</xref>). As the polarity of degradation was the same as shown for resection of DSBs <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the activity was induced 5-fold in meiotic extracts of <italic>S.pombe</italic>, it appeared to be a good candidate for the nuclease active in processing DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c14">14</xref>). However, <italic>exo1</italic> mutants are not sensitive to ionizing radiation, are proficient at mating type switching and have only weak defects in meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c17">17</xref>). Although spore viability is not dramatically reduced in <italic>exo1</italic> mutants, there is a significant decrease in intergenic recombination and an increase in meiosis I non-disjunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c20">20</xref>). Exo1 interacts with Msh2 and <italic>exo1</italic> mutants have a mutator phenotype suggesting a role in mismatch repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c21">21</xref>). The role of Exo1 in mitotic recombination is complex: the mutants show a decrease in spontaneous mitotic recombination between direct repeats and an increase in homeologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c22">22</xref>). The latter is thought to be due to anti-recombination between diverged sequences observed for many mismatch repair mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c23">23</xref>).</p><p>Rad1 is an essential component of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway and mutants show high sensitivity to UV light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c25">25</xref>). Rad1 forms a heterodimer with Rad10 that exhibits structure-specific endonuclease activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c27">27</xref>). This nuclease cleaves at the junction between duplex and single-stranded DNA at the 5&#x02032; side of a UV photoproduct during NER. In addition to the essential role in NER, Rad1 is required for certain mitotic recombination events to trim recombination intermediates with 3&#x02032; heterologous tails and in the repair of loop heteroduplexes formed during meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c29">29</xref>). <italic>rad1</italic> mutants also exhibit defects in mitotic conversion tract length, gene replacement and in plasmid integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c31">31</xref>). The Rad1 nuclease has been shown to cleave artificial Holliday junctions generated from oligonucleotides, but the cleavages are not symmetrical like those observed for other Holliday junction resolvases, such as RuvC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c33">33</xref>). Although <italic>rad1</italic> mutants of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> are sporulation proficient, mutation of the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> homolog of <italic>RAD1</italic>, <italic>mei-9</italic>, causes a defect in meiotic crossing over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c35">35</xref>). It is possible that the Rad1 nuclease is redundant with another Holliday junction resolvase in yeast, or that the endonuclease activity cleaves other types of branched intermediates formed during recombination.</p><p>We have used a plasmid gap repair assay to evaluate the role of these nucleases in mitotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c37">37</xref>). A plasmid containing a double-strand break or gap within a region of the plasmid homologous to chromosomal sequences is efficiently repaired when introduced into yeast cells by transformation. Homology-dependent gap repair predominates in recombination proficient cells, but end-joining events can also occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c37">37</xref>). If the gapped plasmid contains no origin of replication, only repair events associated with crossing over to integrate the plasmid at the homologous chromosomal locus are recovered. However, if the gapped plasmid contains an origin of replication repair events unassociated with crossing over also occur. Heteroduplex DNA formed adjacent to the gap during plasmid gap repair can be monitored by co-conversion of markers flanking the plasmid-borne gap. Thus, plasmid gap repair provides a convenient system to measure conversion tract lengths and associated crossing over during double-strand gap repair. Here we show that several nucleases implicated in mitotic recombination have both quantitative and qualitative effects on plasmid gap repair.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>All strains are derivatives of W303-1A or W303-1B with the corrected <italic>RAD5</italic> allele and are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd659tb1">1</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c39">39</xref>).

Cultures and plates were incubated at 30&#x000b0;C unless otherwise stated. Methods for yeast transformation and tetrad dissection were as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c40">40</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmid gap repair assays</title><p>Plasmids to be used as substrates for gap repair were digested with <italic>Bsp</italic>EI and <italic>Eco</italic>NI, and the large DNA fragment gel purified. Transformation of yeast cells was by the lithium acetate method using 100 ng of gapped plasmid or 100 ng of uncut pSB110 (transformation efficiency control) in the presence of 50 &#x000b5;g of denatured salmon sperm carrier DNA. For the <italic>mre11 rad1</italic> and <italic>mre11 exo1</italic> double mutants, 300 ng of gapped pSB110 and 600 ng of gapped pSB101 were used. The amounts of DNA used for transformation were determined to be in the linear range. The transformation efficiency using gapped plasmids was improved by inclusion of a 20 min, 30&#x000b0;C incubation step in SOS (1 M sorbitol, 0.3&#x00025; yeast extract, 0.6&#x00025; bacto-peptone, 6.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) medium following heat shock. The transformed cells were diluted and plated onto SC-Ura and SC-Ura-Met media and colonies counted after 3 days incubation at 30&#x000b0;C. The gap repair frequency was calculated as the number of Met<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants per microgram of transformed gapped plasmid divided by the number of Met<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants per microgram of uncut pSB110. The gap repair assay was performed at least three times for each strain and the mean values are presented.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of gap repair products</title><p>Ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants were picked from transformation plates and patched on SC-Ura plates. After 2 days of growth, the cells were replica plated to SC-Met and YEPD plates to score for the Met phenotype and to allow non-selective growth. After 2 days of growth on YEPD, the transformants were replica plated onto 5-FOA and Pb<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> plates to assess the mitotic stability phenotype. Confluent growth on 5-FOA indicated that the Ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> phenotype was unstable. Integration of the plasmid results in a direct repeat and a stable Ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> phenotype due to the low rate of excision of the plasmid from the chromosomal duplication. Met<sup>&#x02013;</sup> cells are pigmented dark brown due to the accumulation of PbS when grown on plates containing Pb<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. Transformants that grew on SC-Met, but were dark brown on Pb plates following non-selective growth, were scored as unstable Met<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. The data in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd659tb3">3</xref> were pooled from three independent transformations of each strain with the exception of the <italic>mre11 rad1</italic> strain, for which two independent analyses were performed. Within each strain, there was little variation in the ratios of Met<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> to Met<sup>&#x02013;</sup> and integrated to non-integrated between transformations. Significance was determined by chi-squared tests.</p><p>The efficiency of gene replacement was determined by transforming strains containing the <italic>met17::ADE2</italic> allele with a 2.5&#x000a0;kb <italic>Spe</italic>I fragment containing <italic>MET17</italic> derived from pSB101 and selecting Met<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants. Correct replacement of the <italic>met17::ADE2</italic> allele results in a Met<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Ade<sup>&#x02013;</sup> phenotype; the rare Met<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Ade<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants were deducted from the total number of Met<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> to calculate recombination efficiencies. The number of Met<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants was normalized to the transformation efficiency using uncut pSB110.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Plasmid gap repair assay</title><p>We previously described a gap repair assay based on a series of plasmids containing the selectable&#x0002f;counter-selectable marker, <italic>URA3</italic>, and the selectable, colony-color marker, <italic>MET17</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c37">37</xref>). A 238 bp double-strand gap was made within the plasmid <italic>MET17</italic> gene by digestion with <italic>Bsp</italic>EI and <italic>Eco</italic>NI endonucleases. The gapped plasmid DNA was introduced into host cells containing a nonsense mutation within the chromosomal <italic>MET17</italic> gene, <italic>met17-sna</italic>, by transformation. The efficiency of repair was determined from the number of Met<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants relative to the transformation efficiency with an uncut replicating plasmid. We assume linear and circular molecules enter cells with equal efficiency and this ratio is not altered in any of the mutants tested. To determine the spectrum of repair events, Ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants were selected and analyzed for the Met phenotype and also for the mitotic stability of the plasmid markers. Gap repair unassociated with crossing over results in a Ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> phenotype that is mitotically unstable (Ura<sup>&#x0002b;u</sup>), whereas gap repair associated with crossing over (integration) generates a stable Ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> phenotype (Ura<sup>&#x0002b;s</sup>). Although direct repeat recombination can result in excision of the plasmid, these events occur at much lower frequency than plasmid mis-segregation. Four major classes of events were recovered from wild-type cells using the gapped <italic>ARS</italic>-containing plasmid (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd659f1">1</xref>): Ura<sup>&#x0002b;u</sup> Met<sup>&#x0002b;u</sup>, Ura<sup>&#x0002b;u</sup> Met<sup>&#x02013;</sup>, Ura<sup>&#x0002b;s</sup> Met<sup>&#x0002b;s</sup> and Ura<sup>&#x0002b;s</sup> Met<sup>&#x02013;</sup>. Forty-nine percent of the Ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants obtained from the wild-type strain were Met<sup>&#x02013;</sup> and for both the integrated and episomal events the Met<sup>&#x02013;</sup> phenotype was due to conversion of the plasmid <italic>MET17</italic> gene to <italic>met17-sna</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c37">37</xref>). Conversion from the chromosomal marker to the plasmid could occur by extension of the gap, or heteroduplex DNA (hDNA) formation adjacent to the gap, followed by mismatch repair (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd659f2">2</xref>). For both HO-induced mitotic recombination and DSB-induced meiotic recombination the 3&#x02032;-end at break sites remains intact and conversion events are thought to occur by mismatch correction of asymmetric hDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c42">42</xref>). The frequency of conversion of a marker adjacent to the break or gap is distance-dependent and reflects the length of the 3&#x02032; single-stranded tail formed by resection of the 5&#x02032; strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c3">3</xref>). Although we assume the ratio of Met<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> to Met<sup>&#x02013;</sup> transformants is directed by the length of the 3&#x02032; single-stranded tail, post-synaptic processing and mismatch repair could also influence co-conversion.</p></sec><sec><title>Decreased efficiency of gap repair and reduction in conversion tract length in the <italic>mre11</italic> mutant</title><p>The Mre11 nuclease is implicated in the end-processing step based on physical studies of DNA intermediates formed during DSB repair. We expected to see an increase in the ratio of Met<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> to Met<sup>&#x02013;</sup> transformants in <italic>mre11</italic> mutants if the Mre11 nuclease in involved in the processing reaction. The efficiency of gap repair with gapped pSB110 was reduced 3-fold in the <italic>mre11</italic>&#x00394; strain with a significant increase in the number of Met<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants and a decrease in the number of integration events (<italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd659tb2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd659tb3">3</xref>). The class of transfomants showing the greatest alteration in number was the Ura<sup>&#x0002b;u</sup> Met<sup>&#x0002b;u</sup> class, which represented 55&#x00025; of the total Ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants in the <italic>mre11</italic>&#x00394; strain, compared with 40&#x00025; in the wild-type strain (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd659tb3">3</xref>). To determine whether the nuclease activity of Mre11, or some other function of Mre11, is responsible for the alteration in the spectrum of recombination products, the gap repair assay was performed in an <italic>mre11-H125N</italic> strain, which contains a point mutation abolishing the Mre11 nuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c12">12</xref>). The efficiency of gap repair was only slightly reduced compared with the wild-type strain and was significantly higher than the <italic>mre11</italic>&#x00394; strain (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd659tb2">2</xref>). Surprisingly, the percentage of Ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants that were Met<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> was much lower than the wild-type and <italic>mre11</italic>&#x00394; strains (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd659tb3">3</xref>).

The <italic>mre11</italic>&#x00394; strain showed a significant reduction in the number of integration events, suggesting that the defect in gap repair was likely to be enhanced using the non-replicating vector, pSB101. Ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants derived from pSB101 are all stable and result from integration of the plasmid. There was a 10-fold decrease in gap repair efficiency of pSB101 in the <italic>mre11</italic>&#x00394; strain, compared with wild-type, an even greater decrease than predicted.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmid integration is reduced in <italic>rad1</italic> mutants</title><p>Mutation of the <italic>RAD1</italic> gene has previously been shown to cause severe defects in plasmid integration and one-step gene replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c30">30</xref>).

The ratio of Met<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:Met<sup>&#x02013;</sup> events was not significantly different from the wild-type strain, suggesting that Exo1 does not normally affect the processing of DSBs. Strains deleted for both <italic>MRE11</italic> and <italic>EXO1</italic> show enhanced sensitivity to methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) and slower processing of an HO-induced DSB than <italic>mre11</italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c20">20</xref>). To determine whether the Mre11 and Exo1 nucleases act independently in processing plasmid DSBs, the gap repair assay was repeated in an <italic>exo1 mre11</italic> double mutant. The efficiency of gap repair of pSB110 was reduced 19-fold compared with the <italic>exo1</italic> strain, 10-fold compared with wild-type and 3-fold compared with the <italic>mre11</italic> strain, consistent with the synergism observed in other DNA repair assays. Analysis of Ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> products revealed the same distribution of Met<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:Met<sup>&#x02013;</sup> transformants as observed for the <italic>mre11</italic> strain and the high level of crossing over characteristic of the <italic>exo1</italic> strain. In this strain, 24&#x00025; of the Ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants were stable Met<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. Although the gap repair efficiency of pSB110 was reduced 10-fold, one-third of the products contained integrated plasmids suggesting that gap repair of pSB101 might be reduced only 3-fold compared with pSB110. However, the gap repair efficiency of pSB101 was reduced 100-fold in the double mutant, compared with the <italic>exo1</italic> strain, 50-fold compared with wild-type and 5-fold compared with the <italic>mre11</italic> mutant. The recombination frequency of gapped pSB101 in the <italic>exo1 mre11</italic> strain may be even lower than presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd659tb2">2</xref> because only one Met<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> colony was obtained from four independent transformations.</p></sec><sec><title>The frequency of gene replacement is elevated in <italic>exo1</italic> and <italic>mre11</italic> mutants</title><p>Plasmid gap repair is thought to be similar to the repair of chromosomal DSBs in the requirement for templated repair of&#x000a0;the gap from a homologous donor duplex. In contrast, gene replacement could occur by assimilation of a single strand from the linear duplex, or by two independent end invasions involving both ends of the targeting fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c43">43</xref>). Previous studies revealed no defect in gene replacement in <italic>rad50</italic> mutants, and a 50-fold decrease in <italic>rad1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c44">44</xref>). We measured the efficiency of replacement of the chromosomal <italic>met17::ADE2</italic> insertion allele by a 2.5 kb fragment containing the <italic>MET17</italic> gene. Each end of the targeting fragment has 600&#x000a0;bp of homology shared with the chromosomal locus and there are no heterologies present at the ends that could present barriers to efficient recombination. Correct gene replacement results in a Met<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Ade<sup>&#x02013;</sup> phenotype. The efficiency of targeting was increased almost 3-fold in the <italic>exo1</italic> and <italic>mre11</italic> strains and reduced 3-fold by the <italic>rad1</italic> mutation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd659tb2">2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have used a plasmid gap repair assay to determine the efficiency of double-strand gap repair, as well as alterations in processing of recombination intermediates, in several nuclease-deficient strains of yeast. Most of the mutants examined were proficient at plasmid gap repair, but showed alterations in either conversion tract length or plasmid integration. These results are discussed in detail below.</p><sec><title>Role of the Mre11 nuclease in end-processing events</title><p>Null mutations of <italic>MRE11</italic> cause severe defects in meiotic recombination and in survival to a variety of DNA damaging agents, including ionizing radiation, MMS and inter-strand crosslinking agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c46">46</xref>). Although the DNA repair defect is generally attributed to defective homologous recombination, <italic>mre11</italic>&#x00394; mutants show elevated rates of spontaneous heteroallelic recombination and only a small reduction in sister chromatid recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c47">47</xref>). Kinetic studies of mating type switching revealed a reduction in the rate of resection of the 5&#x02032;-end at HO-induced DSBs, and a delay in repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c48">48</xref>). Although Mre11 has endonuclease and exonuclease activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, mutations that abolish the nuclease activity do not alter the rate of resection of HO-induced DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c12">12</xref>). This suggests alternate roles for Mre11 (or the MRX complex) in regulation of the processing activity, or functional redundancy for the nuclease-processing step in mitotic cells. We found a 3-fold reduction in the efficiency of plasmid gap repair in <italic>mre11</italic>&#x00394; mutants, but the <italic>mre11-H125N</italic> strain, defective for the nuclease function, showed almost wild-type levels of gap repair. In contrast, <italic>rad52</italic> and <italic>rad51</italic> mutants show 500- and 100-fold decreases, respectively, in the efficiency of gap repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c49">49</xref>). Therefore, the <italic>mre11</italic> deficiency in gap repair is much less severe than for other mutants of the <italic>RAD52</italic> epistasis group, but is consistent with studies of mating type switching and spontaneous mitotic recombination.</p><p>The altered ratio of Met<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:Met<sup>&#x02013;</sup> events is consistent with decreased processing of the 5&#x02032;-ends of break sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd659f2">2</xref>). The <italic>Sna</italic>BI site is less likely to be incorporated into hDNA if the 3&#x02032; tails are shorter and, consequently, less likely to be co-converted with the gapped region. This alteration in the length of hDNA could possibly contribute to the hyper-recombination phenotype observed for heteroallelic recombination in <italic>mre11</italic> diploids. During heteroallelic recombination hDNA is likely to span both alleles and co-repair of both mismatches would not generate a prototroph. However, if hDNA tracts are shorter so that only one of the two alleles is incorporated then prototrophs will be generated at higher frequencies. Surprisingly, repaired products were biased to Met<sup>&#x02013;</sup> from the strain containing the nuclease defective <italic>mre11-H125N</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c12">12</xref>). Our previous studies indicated no defect in mating type switching in this strain, but the physical analysis may not have detected an increase in the length of the 3&#x02032; single-stranded tails. We previously suggested redundancy for the nuclease-processing step in mitotic cells based on the weak DNA repair defects of the <italic>mre11-H125N</italic> strain. Based on the results presented here, we propose the MRX complex unwinds ends to provide access to the Mre11 endonuclease, or other nucleases that degrade single-stranded DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd659f3">3</xref>). In the absence of Mre11, the complex is absent and ends are processed inefficiently by a double-stranded DNA exonuclease, such as Exo1. In <italic>mre11-H125N</italic> strains, the ends are still unwound by the MRX complex, but are degraded by a more processive single-stranded DNA exonuclease or endonuclease, resulting in longer 3&#x02032; tails and increased co-conversion of the <italic>Sna</italic>BI site.</p><p>Previous studies of spontaneous mitotic recombination have found a correlation between conversion tract length and crossing over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c50">50</xref>). We found a bias towards Met<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (short heteroduplex) among the non-crossover recombinants and a bias towards Met<sup>&#x02013;</sup> (long heteroduplex) among the crossover recombinants in the wild-type strains (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd659tb3">3</xref>). Therefore, the decrease in crossing over observed in <italic>mre11</italic>&#x00394; strains could be a consequence of shorter heteroduplex tracts.</p></sec><sec><title>Rad1 influences crossing over during gap repair</title><p>The Rad1 endonuclease is reported to cleave artificial Holliday junctions generated from oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c33">33</xref>). Although this result has been contested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c51">51</xref>), the <italic>rad1</italic> mutation clearly affects plasmid integration, a process thought to occur by resolution of a Holliday junction intermediate. There are several possible explanations for this observation. First, as mentioned above, shorter heteroduplex tracts are associated with lower crossing over. This seems unlikely to be the cause of the integration defect in the <italic>rad1</italic> strain because co-conversion of the <italic>met17-sna</italic> marker is the same as observed in the wild-type strain. Second, Rad1 could resolve some Holliday junction intermediates, especially if they contain single-stranded DNA near the junction. Third, Rad1 might cleave the D-loop formed by strand invasion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd659f4">4</xref>). This cleavage could possibly stabilize the intermediate by allowing pairing of the cleaved strand with the other side of the break to form a Holliday structure. The resulting double Holliday junction intermediate could then be resolved to form either crossover or non-crossover products. In the absence of Rad1, more intermediates would be resolved by D-loop collapse leading to fewer crossover events. Chiu <italic>et al</italic>. identified a structure-specific nuclease activity from <italic>E.coli</italic> extracts that stabilizes paranemic joints formed by recA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c52">52</xref>); Rad1&#x0002f;10 could potentially act in a similar way to stabilize strand invasion intermediates made by Rad51. Finally, the D-loop could be cleaved by another endonuclease, and the tail subsequently removed by Rad1 to prevent competition for pairing with the invading strand.</p><p>Most of the previous studies demonstrating a defect in mitotic recombination in <italic>rad1</italic> mutants utilized substrates with heterologies at the site of a DSB that would require removal by the Rad1&#x0002f;10 endonuclease to complete the recombination event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c28">28</xref>). In our studies of plasmid integration and gene replacement there are no heterologies present at the ends of the plasmid&#x0002f;fragment that might prevent efficient recombination. The defect in gene replacement observed in <italic>rad1</italic> mutants could be due to a requirement for Rad1 in processing the loop structure predicted to arise by single-strand assimilation, or by defective resolution of a strand invasion intermediate, as suggested above for plasmid gap repair.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>exo1</italic> mutants exhibit a hyper-recombination phenotype for gap repair and gene replacement</title><p>Strains deleted for <italic>EXO1</italic> have a complex phenotype indicative of defects in recombination and mismatch repair pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c22">22</xref>). Although we detected no effect on end-processing events, the <italic>exo1</italic> strains showed a significant increase in both the frequency of gap repair and associated crossing over. Consistent with this observation, no alteration in heteroduplex tract length was observed at the <italic>HIS4</italic> locus during meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c19">19</xref>). The increase in gap repair efficiency could be due to elimination of a degradative enzyme. However, this seems unlikely because we have not detected an increase in plasmid end joining in <italic>exo1</italic> strains (J.Ferguson and L.S.Symington, unpublished data) and a large excess of carrier DNA is used during transformation.</p><p>The substrates for gap repair are homologous except for a single base pair insertion to create the <italic>met17-sna</italic> allele, 200 bp from the gapped region. This may be sufficient to trigger anti-recombination by the mismatch repair system. A recent study showed elevated rates of spontaneous recombination between homologous sequences in <italic>exo1</italic> strains. Therefore, it seems likely that the increased levels of gap repair and gene replacement observed in the <italic>exo1</italic> strains are due to a defect in the mismatch repair system. The increase in plasmid integration may also be attributed to a defect in mismatch repair as several studies have documented increased crossing over in mismatch repair defective strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c54">54</xref>). During meiosis, intergenic recombination is reduced almost 2-fold in <italic>exo1</italic> homozygotes in contrast to the increase in crossing over observed for plasmid gap repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c20">20</xref>). Exo1 is induced during meiosis and may interact with other meiosis-specific proteins to form complexes with altered specificity for recombination intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c20">20</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>exo1 mre11</italic> double mutant has slow growth and the efficiency of transformation was reduced ~20-fold compared with the wild-type strain. The frequency of plasmid gap repair was reduced in the double mutant, consistent with studies showing an enhancement of the <italic>mre11</italic> mutant MMS sensitivity by an <italic>exo1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c20">20</xref>). Although physical studies at the <italic>MAT</italic> locus revealed a greater stability of the cut fragment in <italic>exo1 mre11</italic> strains, the ratio of Met<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:Met<sup>&#x02013;</sup> transformants during gap repair was not significantly different from the <italic>mre11</italic> single mutant. Like the <italic>exo1</italic> strain, the <italic>exo1 mre11</italic> double mutant showed a significant increase in crossing over of the <italic>ARS</italic>-containing plasmid, even though conversion tracts were shorter. Because integration events were common with the <italic>ARS</italic>-containing plasmid, we expected to observe only a 3-fold reduction in the gap repair frequency using the integrating plasmid, compared with the <italic>ARS</italic>-containing plasmid. However, the frequency was much lower than expected. This was also found for the <italic>mre11</italic> single mutant. Based on this, we suggest the <italic>ARS</italic> element plays an important role during gap repair in <italic>mre11</italic> strains. It is possible that gap repair can occur by an alternate mechanism, such as break-induced replication from the two ends of the plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd659c56">56</xref>), and these events are dependent on close proximity of an <italic>ARS</italic> element.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd659f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> The gap repair assay.

Alternatively, the displaced strand of the unbroken duplex could pair with the single-strand tail on the other side of the break to form a double Holliday junction. We suggest Rad1 could cleave the D-loop structure to allow more efficient pairing or stabilization of the D-loop with the single-strand tail on the other side of the break.
