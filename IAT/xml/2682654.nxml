Mice deficient in the calcium-stimulated adenylyl cyclases, AC1 and AC8 (DKO), demonstrate increased sedation duration and impaired phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) following acute ethanol treatment.

Phosphorylation of synapsins I and II, as well as phosphorylation of non-PKA targets, such as, eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2) and dynamin is significantly impaired in the brains of DKO mice. This deficit is primarily driven by AC1, as AC1-deficient, but not AC8-deficient mice also demonstrate significant reductions in phosphorylation of synapsin and eEF-2 in cortical and hippocampal tissues. DKO mice have a reduced pool of functional recycling vesicles and fewer active terminals as measured by FM1-43 uptake compared to WT controls, which may be a contributing factor to the impaired presynaptic response to ethanol treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>These data demonstrate that calcium-stimulated AC-dependent PKA activation in the presynaptic terminal, primarily driven by AC1, is a critical event in the reactivation of neurons following ethanol-induced activity blockade.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ethanol is a widely used central nervous system depressant that results in sedation.

AC1 is intensely expressed in hippocampal mossy fiber projections and the cerebellum and at lesser amounts throughout the cortex and thalamus. Subcellular analyses revealed prominent postsynaptic/extrasynaptic expression of AC1, while AC8 localized with presynaptic/extrasynaptic proteins, suggesting that AC1 and AC8 are critical to synaptic events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Conti1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> As extrasynaptic protein localization represents both pre- and post-synaptic compartments, it is possible that AC1 can also function presynaptically while AC8 may play a postsynaptic role.</p><p>Genetic deletion of AC1 (AC1KO), AC8 (AC8KO) and/or AC1/AC8 (DKO) disrupts long-term depression and potentiation (LTP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Wang1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Schaefer1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Villacres1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> as well as late-phase LTP, resulting in memory impairment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Wong1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

We hypothesize that ethanol-mediated induction of PKA phosphorylation is part of a compensatory homeostatic mechanism initiated by AC1 and/or AC8. Here, we have used phosphoproteomic techniques and identified several PKA target proteins involved with presynaptic function, including synapsin, vacuolar H&#x0002b;-ATPase, and dynein, that are phosphorylated following acute ethanol exposure in WT mice. Identification of additional proteins phosphorylated after ethanol treatment include dynamin and eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2). Of these, we have demonstrated that phosphorylation of synapsin I, II, eEF-2 and dynamin is impaired in the brains of DKO, and in some cases, AC1KO mice following acute ethanol exposure. Together these data suggest that calcium-stimulated ACs, largely involving AC1, contribute to the presynaptic homeostatic response to ethanol-induced inhibition of neuronal function by facilitating PKA activation of proteins involved in presynaptic vesicle release.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Targets of ethanol-induced PKA phosphorylation are components of presynaptic vesicle recycling machinery</title><p>To identify phosphorylation targets, we performed high-resolution 2-Dimensional Gel Eelectrophoresis, PKA target protein detection using an anti-PKA substrate-specific antibody followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI/TOF/TOF) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005697-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

Phosphoproteomic analyses identified targets primarily localized to presynaptic vesicle transport machinery that were phosphorylated following acute ethanol exposure in the brains of WT mice. Changes in phospho-synapsin I and II, phospho-eEF-2 and phospho-dynamin were further validated with immunoblot and immunohistochemical techniques and found to be significantly reduced in the cortex and hippocampus of DKO and in some cases, AC1KO mice compared to WT controls. Reduced integrated intensity of FM1-43 uptake in DKO hippocampal neurons demonstrated a decreased number of functional recycling vesicles and a reduced number of active terminals, which likely contributes to the impaired presynaptic response observed in DKO mice.</p><p>Ethanol has been shown to modulate several aspects of the cAMP/PKA signaling cascade. PKA activation and nuclear translocation is increased after ethanol exposure and is accompanied by cAMP response element (CRE) binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation, CREB binding protein (CBP) phosphorylation and CRE-mediated gene transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Constantinescu1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Yang1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Additional proteins phosphorylated after ethanol treatment included dynamin and eEF-2. Dynamin, a microtubule associated motor enzyme, supports the transport and/or budding of vesicles along microtubules. In addition, the expression of dynamin I is neuron-specific and enriched in nerve terminals where it is required for synaptic vesicle fission from the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Smillie1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

As it is primarily phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5), the detection of dynamin phosphorylation suggests the possibility of cross-reactivity of the phospho-PKA-substrate antibody to cdk5 phosphorylation sites.</p><p>The ATP-dependent proton pump, v-ATPase, acidifies intracellular compartments, including synaptic vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Stevens1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

This suggests that alterations in transporter phosphorylation may lead to changes in transmitter packaging/release, ultimately resulting in changes in synaptic efficacy. In this case, postsynaptic currents would be affected while FM1-43 uptake into vesicles may remain unchanged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Cousin1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Previous studies have demonstrated that deletion of genes regulating hydrogen-transporting ATPase activity and vacuole acidification conferred cosensitivity to several alcohols, including ethanol, in a genome-wide screen of yeast deletion mutants suggesting that v-ATPase function is required for alcohol tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Fujita1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Elongation factor-2, a key component in peptide-chain elongation, has recently been implicated in the mechanism by which ethanol inhibits protein synthesis in skeletal myocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-HongBrown1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

This suggests that eEF-2 phosphorylation is a mechanism by which increases in intracellular calcium concentrations, a known consequence of ethanol exposure, can modulate the rate of protein synthesis.</p><p>Synapsins have been shown to bind synaptic vesicles to the cytoskeleton, segregating them to form a reserve pool and an active pool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Greengard1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Valtorta1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Synapsins are phosphorylated by PKA at serine 9, which inhibits their binding to phospholipids and dissociates them from synaptic vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Hosaka1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.

These data are in agreement with the observation that prolonged synaptic inactivity increases the size of the presynaptic active zone, the number of docked vesicles and the total number of vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Murthy1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Increased phosphorylation of dynamin, v-ATPase and synapsin suggest that presynaptic vesicle transport and release are critical to the neuronal response to ethanol exposure, while phosphorylation of v-ATPase and eEF-2 are associated with cell maintenance and function in the presence of ethanol.</p><p>The localization of AC1 in cortical and hippocampal regions strategically poise it to modulate cAMP-dependent activation of PKA following ethanol treatment. AC1 is strongly expressed in axons and terminals of the mossy fiber pathway and in subcellular synaptic fractions that are enriched with synaptophysin, a presynaptic vesicle protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Conti1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. This places AC1 proximal to the robust expression of phospho-synapsin in the CA3 region of the hippocampus after ethanol exposure and associates AC1 with presynaptic vesicle regulation. In the present study, AC1KO mice exhibited impairments in synapsin and eEF-2 phosphorylation while AC8KO mice did not. These data are in agreement with previous studies from our laboratory demonstrating that both AC1KO and DKO mice exhibit enhanced sensitivity to the sedating effects of ethanol as compared to WT mice, whereas AC8KO mice do not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Maas1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, underscoring the importance of AC1 in the initiation of presynaptic homeostatic events following activity blockade. Although AC1 has previously been associated with postsynaptic mechanisms, these data emphasize the importance of AC1 in presynaptic vesicle release mechanisms and are supported by the recent findings in <italic>barrelless</italic> mice containing a loss-of-function mutation in the AC1 gene. <italic>Barrelless</italic> mice demonstrate deficits in neurotransmitter release attributed to reductions in AC1-dependent PKA phosphorylation of RIMs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Lu1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Likewise, PKA phosphorylation of synapsins is reduced in <italic>barrelless</italic> mice suggesting impairments in synaptic vesicle mobilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Lu1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Chi1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Together, these data support the hypothesis that interventions that alter levels of neuronal activity, such as ethanol exposure, result in counteractive homeostatic mechanisms against such alterations.</p><p>Here we demonstrate that WT, but not DKO, mice respond to acute ethanol exposure with an increase in synapsin phosphorylation. While ethanol exposure does not affect the net size of the recycling vesicle pool in WT or DKO mice, phosphorylation status of synapsin has been shown to drive the rate of its dispersion, thereby regulating the dynamics of vesicle pool turnover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Chi1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. In this way, synapsin regulates the rate of synaptic vesicle mobilization and release in a phosphorylation-state-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Chi1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Together, these data suggest that while recycling vesicle pool size is unchanged in WT and DKO mice after ethanol treatment, an increase in vesicle cycling rate may drive the reactivation of WT neurons, a mechanism that is impaired in DKO mice due to impaired synapsin phosphorylation. Combined with the decreased integrated intensity of FM1-43 labeling observed in DKO neurons, which represents a reduction in the pool size of recycling vesicles, the lack of synapsin phosphorylation may contribute to a slower rate of vesicle recycling and therefore a disruption in neuronal reactivation following activity blockade by ethanol in DKO mice. Similarly, phosphorylation of dynamin has been suggested to regulate the rate of synaptic vesicle endocytosis (SVE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Anggono1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. While alterations in the rate of SVE may not be manifested as a change in the recycling vesicle pool size, reactivation of neurons from ethanol-induced activity blockade may depend on the efficiency of neurotransmission. This is supported by data from dynamin I-deficient mice that exhibit impaired stimulation-dependent synaptic vesicle recycling and the requirement of dynamin for SVE during periods of high neuronal activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005697-Ferguson1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. These data suggest that a threshold of vesicle recycling is required for the appropriate neuronal response to activity blockade. As evidenced by the baseline reduction in the percentage of active synapses in DKO compared to WT mice and the decrease in the percentage of active synapses after ethanol exposure in DKO neurons compared to WT, AC1 and AC8 contribute to maintaining a critical threshold of synaptic activity both in the presence or absence of ethanol.</p><p>Together, these data demonstrate a pivotal role for the calcium-stimulated ACs, mainly AC1, in the initiation of a presynaptic response to ethanol-mediated neuronal inhibition. Further identification of PKA targets uniquely regulated by AC1 and AC8 will provide additional insight into the mechanisms of the neuronal response to the inhibitory effects of ethanol.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animal Husbandry</title><p>All mice were backcrossed a minimum of ten generations to wild type C57BL/6 (WT) mice from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).
