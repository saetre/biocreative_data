The classical mechanism proposed for the slow inactivation observed in cell-free membrane patches&#x02014;the so called C inactivation&#x02014;is a constriction of the external mouth of the channel pore that prevents K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ion conduction. This constriction is antagonized by the external application of the pore blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA). In contrast to C inactivation, here we show that, when recorded in whole <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, slow inactivation kinetics in <italic>Shaker</italic> IR K channels is poorly dependent on external TEA but severely delayed by internal TEA. Based on the antagonism with internally or externally added TEA, we used a two-pulse protocol to show that half of the channels inactivate by way of a gate sensitive to internal TEA. Such gate had a recovery time course in the tens of milliseconds range when the interpulse voltage was &#x02212;90 mV, whereas C-inactivated channels took several seconds to recover. Internal TEA also reduced gating charge conversion associated to slow inactivation, suggesting that the closing of the internal TEA-sensitive inactivation gate could be associated with a significant amount of charge exchange of this type. We interpreted our data assuming that binding of internal TEA antagonized with U-type inactivation (Klemic, K.G., G.E. Kirsch, and S.W. Jones. 2001. <italic>Biophys. J.</italic> 81:814&#x02013;826). Our results are consistent with a direct steric interference of internal TEA with an internally located slow inactivation gate as a &#x0201c;foot in the door&#x0201d; mechanism, implying a significant functional overlap between the gate of the internal TEA-sensitive slow inactivation and the primary activation gate. But, because U-type inactivation is reduced by channel opening, trapping the channel in the open conformation by TEA would also yield to an allosteric delay of slow inactivation. These results provide a framework to explain why constitutively C-inactivated channels exhibit gating charge conversion, and why mutations at the internal exit of the pore, such as those associated to episodic ataxia type I in hKv1.1, cause severe changes in inactivation kinetics.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: COVC, cut-open oocyte voltage clamp; MES, methanesulfonic acid; NMG, <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-glucamine; TEVC, two-electrode voltage clamp.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In neuronal cells, sustained or prolonged depolarization inactivates voltage-gated potassium channels, favoring an increase in excitability. Slow inactivation was first described as a reduction in potassium permeability in the squid-delayed rectifier after holding the giant axon at voltages around 0 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ehrenstein and Gilbert, 1966</xref>). It was not until the beginning of the nineties that works on voltage-gated <italic>Shaker</italic> K channels from the laboratories of Aldrich and Yellen set the groundwork for what is now the classical view of potassium channel slow inactivation. They described two types of inactivation processes, the N-type and the C-type inactivation, each having different molecular bases. The N-type inactivation occurs when a movable protein segment localized toward the N terminus of the protein blocks ion conduction by binding to the open conformation of the internal entrance of the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoshi et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zagotta et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Demo and Yellen, 1991</xref>). Removal of part of the N terminus of <italic>Shaker</italic> abolishes N inactivation but uncovers another, slower inactivation process reminiscent of the one observed in the squid axon, the so-called C inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoshi et al., 1990</xref>). Structural determinants of the C inactivation appear to be localized toward the external entrance of the pore (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oliva et al., 2005</xref>) and toward the N terminus of the sixth transmembrane segment of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoshi et al., 1991</xref>). In the conventional view, the C-inactivated state is produced by a localized constriction of the external mouth of the channel, which thereby interrupts K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ion conduction. Such conformational change is antagonized by the extracellular addition of K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">L&#x000f3;pez-Barneo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baukrowitz and Yellen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Molina et al., 1998</xref>) or TEA, a generalist K channel blocker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yellen, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Today, other slow inactivation processes have been described for <italic>Shaker</italic> K channels, involving additional components of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olcese et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Loots and Isacoff, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klemic et al., 2001</xref>). The voltage sensor gets engaged in a highly stable set of conformational states, even in constitutively slow inactivated channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olcese et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, mutations at the internal mouth of the pore severely alter the slow inactivation rate, suggesting an involvement of this structure in slow inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holmgren et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D'Adamo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klement et al., 2008</xref>). In other voltage-gated K channel subfamilies, a functional correlation between the intracellular entrance and slow inactivation has been found. For example, during slow inactivation gating, Kv1.4 extrudes a volume of water toward the cytosolic side of the channel that is comparable to that displaced during activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2003</xref>). Also, slow inactivation in Kv2.1 is interfered by internal TEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kerschensteiner et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that in whole cell recordings from <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes expressing N inactivation&#x02013;removed <italic>Shaker</italic> K channels, at least half of the channels inactivate by a mechanism that is interfered by internal TEA. Such TEA sensitivity, similar to that of the activation gate, is in contrast to conventional C inactivation mechanism. Internal TEA also prevents a significant amount of gating charge conversion associated to slow inactivation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olcese et al. (1997)</xref>, suggesting that part of this charge exchange is not functionally associated with C-type inactivation. These data are consistent with a closed state&#x02013;accessed inactivation as a U-type inactivation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klemic et al., 2001</xref>), in which an open channel blocker causes an allosteric delay of slow inactivation by trapping the channels in the open conformation. But, the inactivation delay produced by internal TEA is also consistent with the existence of an internally located slow inactivation gate, sterically interfered by this quaternary ammonium. Such type of gates have been proposed before for HCN and Kv4.2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dougherty et al., 2008</xref>), and for the ultraslow inactivation in Na channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sandtner et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting a common repertoire of nonconducting conformations for members of the voltage-gated ion channel family.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Salts were purchased from Merck Chile S.A, and gentamicin, EGTA, HEPES, and methanesulfonic acid (MES) were from Sigma-Aldrich.

To remove oocytes, the frogs were anesthetized with 0.5% ethyl 3-amino-benzoato MES salt. Follicular membranes were separated by 1&#x02013;2-h treatment with 3 mg/ml collagenase type 2 at room temperature. After several washes, the oocytes were kept at 18&#x000b0;C in a solution (SOS) containing (in mM): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4. 0.1&#x02013;1 ng cRNA was injected in a volume of 50 nl using a nanoject 2000 injector (WPI). During injection, oocytes were kept in a similar solution to SOS, with all Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> being replaced with extra Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>.

Voltage pulses and data acquisition were obtained through a PCI-MIO-16XE-10 card (National Instruments Corp.) under the control of the WinWCP software (University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland). TEVC traces were usually filtered to 1 kHz with the output filter of the amplifier and digitized at 0.25&#x02013;10 kHz. The voltage and current electrode were filled with a solution of 3 M KCl, 1 mM EGTA, and 5 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, and had resistances of 0.3&#x02013;1.0 M&#x003a9;. TEVC recording solution was composed of (in mM): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4. Usually, TEA was added to this solution by equivalent replacement of Na to keep ionic strength constant, except for the experiments shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, in which TEA or <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-glucamine (NMG) were added to the solution without compensating for ionic strength. For the long measurements of voltage-dependent slow inactivation at near steady state (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), channel availability was tested after 60-s long voltage prepulse by a 5-s pulse to 50 mV (60-s isochronal inactivation). To minimize electrode polarization produced by these long voltage pulses, the amount of cRNA injected was adjusted to keep the ionic current size at &#x0003c;4 &#x003bc;A. In addition, the voltage electrode potentials were measured at the end of each experiment (see details in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oliva et al., 2005</xref>), and experiments having voltage drift of &#x0003e;&#x000b1;5 mV were rejected.</p><p>For experiments with internal perfusion of TEA, cut-open oocyte voltage clamp (COVC) experiments were made with a Dagan CA-1B amplifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Taglialatela et al., 1992</xref>). Voltage pulses and data acquisition were performed through a Digidata 1200 card (MDS Analytical Technologies) under the command of the pClamp 8 software suite (MDS Analytical Technologies). To gain perfusional and electrical access to the intracellular side, the bottom of the oocyte was permeabilized by a brief treatment with 0.1% saponin. Pipettes were filled with 2 M tetramethylammonium-MES, 50 mM NaCl, and 10 mM EGTA and yield resistance from 0.5 to 1.2 M&#x003a9;. For the recording of ionic currents, the external solution was usually composed of (in mM): 100 NaCl, 25 KCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.8 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.2. The internal solution contained 120 KMES, 0.1 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.0. For the gating current measurements, the external solutions was (in mM) 120 NMG, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 HEPES titrated with MES acid, pH 7.0, plus 5 &#x003bc;M agitoxin II, whereas the internal solution was 120 NMG, 0.1 EGTA, and 10 HEPES titrated with MES acid, pH 7.0. In earlier experiments with 10 or 1 mM EGTA in the internal solution, we consistently observed rundown of the K currents, usually without detectable effects on gating. We avoided this inconvenience by lowering EGTA concentration to 0.1 mM. To ensure the stability of the current sizes, we monitored the K channel activity for at least 20 min before the beginning of internal perfusion of TEA.</p><p>The COVC is a low-impedance voltage-clamp technique with several sources of leakage currents needing to be electronically compensated. These currents are completely eliminated with the usual linear capacitance and leakage digital subtraction protocols as described for the giant squid-axon voltage clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Taglialatela et al., 1992</xref>). This subtraction is not feasible with pulses lasting tens of seconds and recoveries in the time scale of the pulse protocol. Thus, uncertainties about true zero current level remain within &#x000b1;100 nA, and currents leaking between the recording and the guard pools as large as the latter figure may be added to the uncorrected K current. This artifact contaminates all data obtained with COVC.</p><p>Signal analyses and curve fitting were done with Clampfit 9 (MDS Analytical Technologies) and Microcal Origin 3.5 and 4.1 (Microcal). With both electrophysiological techniques, two exponential functions were usually required to fit the time course of inactivation; however, to simplify the analysis, all relaxations were fit to single exponentials. We found a day-to-day variability in the inactivation time constant that could be attributed to uncontrolled changes in room temperature of up to 5&#x000b0;C or to variability in the extent of C-type inactivation in whole oocyte due to individual <italic>X. laevis</italic> variability.</p></sec><sec><title>Current Simulations</title><p>Simulations of an allosteric model of <italic>Shaker</italic> K channel with an activation and two inactivation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klemic et al. 2001</xref>) were conduced within the NEURON simulation environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hines and Carnevale, 1997</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.neuron.yale.edu">http://www.neuron.yale.edu</ext-link>). The P/C inactivation pathway was called C instead of I<sub>P</sub> for the classical C inactivation, and I<sub>U</sub> was called U. The model was used with the published values for the rate constants and allosteric factors. The model had three additional states that were blocked with TEA applied internally: an open-blocked, a C-inactivated&#x02013;blocked, and a U-inactivated&#x02013;blocked state (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13</xref>).

In the classical C inactivation paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 1991</xref>), the decay in current represents mostly channels going from the open conformation to the inactivated state. This inactivated state is produced by a localized constriction of the external mouth of the channel, which interrupts K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ion conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yellen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 1996</xref>). Such conformational change is sterically prevented when TEA, a generalist potassium channel blocker, binds to the external entrance of the pore in a mutually exclusive fashion. Consistent with such a functional picture of inactivation, we can draw the following scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 1991</xref>):<disp-formula id="sc1"><label>SCHEME 1</label><inline-graphic xlink:href="jgp1320633Scheme1.jpg"/></disp-formula>where I, O, and B<sub>ex</sub> correspond to the inactivated, the open-unblocked, and the TEA-blocked channels, respectively. The blockade by TEA equilibrates rapidly with a dissociation constant K<sub>Dex</sub>, whereas inactivation and recovery are first-order processes having rate constants <italic>k</italic><sub>i</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>r</sub>, respectively. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="sc1">Scheme 1</xref> indicates that slow inactivation can only occur from open-unblocked channels; thus, as the external TEA concentration is increased, the effective inactivation rate is reduced according to <italic>k</italic><sub>i</sub> times the unblocked fraction. On the other hand, the recovery rate is independent of external TEA provided that the inactivated state does not bind TEA. Thus, only the onset of the slow inactivation kinetics should be delayed by TEA. Contrary to these expectations, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows that with TEVC, the effect of external TEA on the time course of inactivation was very modest, even at concentrations blocking 80% of the K currents.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Slow inactivation in <italic>Shaker</italic> IR is weakly sensitive to external TEA.

For example, internal TEA delays slow inactivation in Kv2.1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kerschensteiner et al., 2003</xref>). On the other hand, the osmotic work performed by the Kv1.4 <italic>Shaker</italic> homologue during gating revealed equivalent volumetric changes in the internal vestibule during slow inactivation, activation, and deactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, the conformational changes that occur during activation and slow inactivation gates could be structurally similar and share functional elements in the cytosolic face of the channel. Therefore, we tested whether internal TEA prevents the closing of the slow inactivation gate as it does with the activation gate in voltage-gated K channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armstrong, 1966</xref>).</p><p>To measure the internal TEA effects on slow inactivation and deactivation kinetics, it is necessary to gain perfusional access to the cytosolic side of the channel. We used the COVC technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Taglialatela et al., 1992</xref>) instead of excised membrane patches because dramatic changes in the inactivation kinetics have been observed with the latter technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oliva et al., 2005</xref>; see Discussion). With the purpose of obtaining a larger signal to monitor the deactivation tails of current, we increased the K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-driving force by elevating the external K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> concentration to 25 mM instead of the 2 mM used in TEVC recordings. This operation did not introduce significant modification to either the inactivation kinetics or the inactivation extent at the end of a 15-s pulse (see <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 A</xref>). Thus, with COVC the slow inactivation kinetics were indistinguishable from those obtained with the TEVC technique.</p><p>After establishing the voltage-clamp configuration, we waited &#x0003e;20 min to allow the current to stabilize before starting with the voltage protocols and the perfusion of an internal solution containing 5 mM TEA (vertical dashed line in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, C&#x02013;E</xref>; see Materials and methods for details). The solution exchange was monitored once every minute with the voltage-pulse protocol depicted in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>. We analyzed three variables in each current trace: (1) the amplitude at 0 and &#x0002b;40 mV to examine the extent of the blockade by TEA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>), (2) the time constant of the current decay during a 15-s pulse to 0 mV to follow the effect of TEA on the inactivation kinetics (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A</xref>, right, and D), and (3) the time constant of deactivation at &#x02212;110 mV after the 20-ms pulse to &#x0002b;40 mV (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>) to track the interference of TEA on the deactivation kinetics (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, B and E</xref>). The letters a, b, and c in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> indicate various stages during the progress of the experiment (see figure legend for details). At the end of the solution exchange, both deactivation and inactivation time constants had increased dramatically, approximately four- and twofold, respectively. Although the effect of the internal TEA on the deactivation kinetics was as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armstrong, 1966</xref>), its effect on slow inactivation is not anticipated by the classical C inactivation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 1991</xref>). To illustrate the dramatic delay introduced by internal TEA on the slow inactivation kinetics, we show representative traces in response to a 60-s pulse to &#x02212;15 mV (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) before (thin trace) and at the end of an internal 5-mM TEA perfusion experiment (thick trace). The extent of the slowdown is such that the current traces intersect each other, illustrating the paradoxical fact that the K currents recorded in the presence of the pore blocker are larger than they are in its absence. Such a result shows that this quaternary ammonium antagonizes the inactivation forward rate while the backward rate remains mostly unaffected (see below).</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Diffusional perfusion of internal TEA.

The top of <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 A</xref> shows that the families of current traces obtained with both voltage-clamp techniques are nearly identical at the onset as well as in the recovery from inactivation.

These results indicate that when the channels are internally blocked by TEA, they preferentially inactivates to a state having the slower recovery kinetics, possibly the C-inactivated state.

(1997)</xref> proposed that slow inactivation introduces a large negative shift to the curve describing the voltage dependence of the charge movement, as if inactivation locked the voltage sensor in a different conformation, requiring the application of more negative voltages to make the charges return to the resting state. These authors proposed that in <italic>Shaker</italic> IR, the voltage sensor moves in two parallel energy paths associated with the normal and the slow inactivated gating (Q1 and Q2, respectively). Such exchange between Q1 and Q2 also occurred in the constitutively C-inactivated <italic>Shaker</italic>&#x02013;IR-W434F, suggesting that a significant fraction of the charge exchange would not be functionally linked to C inactivation. We tested if the internal perfusion with TEA alters Q1-Q2 conversion by measuring its effect on the voltage dependence of gating charge movement. To measure the gating currents in <italic>Shaker</italic> IR, we removed the K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> from the internal and the external solutions, and added 5 &#x003bc;M agitoxin II externally to block ionic currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hidalgo and MacKinnon, 1995</xref>). <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11 A</xref> shows leakage- and capacitance-subtracted gating currents from an oocyte equilibrated with NMG-MES internal solution before (left) and &#x0223c;70 min after the beginning of the perfusion with NMG-MES plus 5 mM TEA (right). Gating currents were elicited by 20-ms pulses from two different holding voltages: from &#x02212;90 mV to observe the normal gating path between closed and open states, and after 5 min at 0 mV to observe the slow inactivated gating path. As internal perfusion with 5 mM TEA progressed, inward-going gating currents became progressively slower and smaller, whereas outward-going currents did not changed noticeably, illustrating that TEA interfered only with the closing of the activation gate. <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11 B</xref> shows the outward charge movement as a function of the pulse voltage from both holding voltages (Q-V relation) before (open symbols) and after 70 min of internal TEA perfusion (filled symbols). With the holding potential at &#x02212;90 mV, TEA introduced a negligible shift to the Q-V relation (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11 B</xref>, circles), indicating that although the channels were closed, TEA interfered weakly with the charge movement. Additionally, internal TEA shifted the Q-V curve for inward-gating current &#x0223c;5 mV in the negative direction, revealing the expected interference with the closing gate (not depicted). However, with the holding voltage at 0 mV, a visible distortion in the Q-V relation was observed (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11 B</xref>, squares). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olcese et al.

In our measurements, internal TEA increased Q1 from &#x0223c;10 to &#x0223c;45%, demonstrating its interference with the Q2 component.

The description of the classical C inactivation mechanism implies a localized constriction at the external half of pore. This picture emerged because external TEA, but not internal TEA, retards inactivation kinetics in a mutually exclusive manner, consistent with <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="sc1">Scheme 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 1991</xref>), and is antagonized by the addition of external K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">L&#x000f3;pez-Barneo, et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baukrowitz and Yellen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Molina et al., 1998</xref>). In this picture, the occupancy of an externally accessible binding site by either K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or TEA prevented the closure of the inactivation gate as a foot in the door. In agreement with these observations, residue 449, located at the external pore entrance, when substituted by cysteine, can coordinate divalent metals with several thousand&#x02013;fold higher affinity in the slow inactivated state than in the open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yellen et al., 1994</xref>). This pore constriction must be very localized, even within the pore, because inactivated channels bind pore-occluding scorpion toxins as well as closed channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 1996</xref>), and, on the other hand, pore-occluding peptide toxins do not antagonize with inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oliva et al., 2005</xref>). This clear picture on how slow inactivation occurs was constructed mostly from experiments done with the patch-clamp technique. However, a more complicated and blurry picture of slow inactivation arose with the use of other electrophysiological techniques applied to <italic>Shaker</italic> K channels in whole oocytes. Gating current measures indicated that during slow inactivation, the voltage sensor is arrested in a very stable set of conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olcese et al., 1997</xref>). Although these results involved other functional loci in the slow inactivated conformational state, they did not affect the localized pore collapse hypothesis as long as slow inactivation occurred after the voltage sensor had reached the active conformation, near the open state. However, the non K-conducting <italic>Shaker</italic> mutant W434F, a constitutively inactivated channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang et al., 1997</xref>), also exhibited this type of charge arrest, indicative of, at least, two separate slow inactivation mechanisms. Fluorescent probes attached to either S4 or the external vestibule also reported two, possibly sequential, conformational changes associated with slow inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cha and Bezanilla, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Loots and Isacoff, 1998</xref>). Thus, P inactivation, a term coined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Biasi et al. (1993)</xref> to account for the effect of mutations in the pore loop of Kv2.1, was assumed to be an initial pore collapse, whereas C inactivation was a more generalized stabilization of the nonconducting conformation. The experimental difficulties for a clear phenomenological dissection between these processes led to the use of the P/C inactivation terminology (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Claydon et al., 2007</xref>). Several other results complicated the mechanistic interpretation of slow inactivation in <italic>Shaker</italic> K channels. Unlike the experiments done with patch clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Molina et al., 1998</xref>), slow inactivation was nearly insensitive to external TEA in TEVC experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, in clear opposition to the expectations from the classical C-type inactivation paradigm, inactivation at voltages near zero appeared to be enhanced by external application of TEA or high K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klemic, et al., 2001</xref>). At more positive voltages, macroscopic inactivation resembled more the classical C-type inactivation, suggesting two separate coexisting inactivation pathways. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klemic et al. (2001)</xref> suggested that high positive voltage favors C-type inactivation, whereas moderate depolarization favors an inactivated conformation visited from partially activated closed states. Thus, at voltages near zero, both types of inactivation are present and inactivation is maximal, resulting in a U-shape for the voltage dependence. For this closed-state visited inactivation, these authors coined the term U-type inactivation.</p><p>Structural as well as molecular dynamic studies on bacterial potassium channels have provided molecular pictures for the constriction in the selectivity filter that could account for the classical C-type inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bern&#x000e8;che and Roux, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cordero-Morales et al., 2007</xref>).

As U-type inactivation, the internal TEA-sensitive inactivation is associated with the fast component of the recovery, a component enhanced by external TEA (and here, diminished by internal TEA; <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). Also, as U-type inactivation, this component did not interconvert with C-type inactivation. The results reported here are largely consistent with the idea that U-type inactivation is sensitive to internal TEA.</p><sec><title><italic>Shaker</italic> IR Slow Inactivation in Whole Oocyte</title><p>In open contradiction to the experiments describing the basic features of C inactivation, here we report that in whole oocytes, <italic>Shaker</italic> IR slow inactivation is weakly sensitive to external TEA, but markedly sensitive to internal TEA (compare <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

Profound kinetic alterations in slow inactivation take place when membrane patches are removed from cells to obtain the outside-out configuration; for example, inactivation kinetics become three- to fourfold faster and more complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oliva et al., 2005</xref>). Inactivation can be appreciably antagonized by external TEA only after patch excision, and in outside-out patch clamp, recovery from inactivation is mono-exponential with a time constant that compares to the slow component of recovery seen in the present work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oliva et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, while in excised membrane patches the classical C-type inactivation mechanism dominates the slow inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 1991</xref>), in whole oocytes, and in cell-attached patch clamp, a slower and kinetically complex inactivation prevails (see for example: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olcese et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klemic et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oliva et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klement et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Because the classical C inactivation is slowed down by high external K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, local K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> accumulation at the extracellular oocyte membrane infoldings could explain the slower inactivation observed in whole oocyte recordings. However, in our experiments in whole oocytes, inactivation kinetics was independent of the size of the ionic currents within a range of two orders of magnitude (0.1&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;A), and nearly independent of the external K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (2&#x02013;25 mM). Moreover, recording of the nonconducting W434F <italic>Shaker</italic>-IR in whole oocyte, in which potassium accumulation is not an issue, charge immobilization and remobilization associated to slow inactivation closely match the kinetics of inactivation and recovery of the ionic currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olcese et al., 1997</xref>). In our hands, regardless of the number of channels in the patch (from one to thousands), slow inactivation kinetics remain nearly unchanged in outside-out patch-clamp measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garc&#x000ed;a et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Naranjo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oliva et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Although K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> accumulation could specifically slow down the C-type component in a K channel having multiple inactivating pathways, this hypothesis is insufficient to explain the overall slower inactivation kinetics observed in whole oocyte because, even with 100 mM external K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, inactivation time constants in outside-out patches are 25&#x02013;50% of those seen in whole oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">L&#x000f3;pez-Barneo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baukrowitz and Yellen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Molina et al., 1998</xref>). The K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> accumulation hypothesis is also inadequate because under our recording conditions, potassium accumulation would lead to a moderate increase in the rate of inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klemic et al., 2001</xref>). Instead, we favor the idea that multiple inactivation processes coexist in <italic>Shaker</italic> IR, and the type of inactivation dominating slow inactivation kinetics could be determined by experimental manipulations affecting cell integrity, as occurs after patch excision. We propose that in whole oocytes, in addition to the C inactivation gate, the internal TEA-sensitive slow inactivation contributes significantly to the slow inactivation kinetics. What makes <italic>Shaker</italic> IR K channels inactivate mostly in the classical C-type mechanism after patch excision remains to be solved.</p></sec><sec><title>A Single TEA Binding Site?</title><p>The correlation between the introduced delay in both the slow inactivation and the closing of the activation gate promoted by internal TEA could result from the binding of this quaternary ammonium to the ionic pathway in the open channel, interfering with both processes. This is the most simplistic interpretation. However, TEA could be binding to two different sites, one governing the activation gate and the other controlling the slow inactivation gate. Because neither gates close while TEA is bound to the channel, as in a foot in the door mechanism, the involvement of a single site seems more likely. In such a case, the affinity and voltage dependence of the TEA binding site that delays inactivation should be the same as the one retarding the closing of the activation gate, both being identical to the TEA binding site that interrupts ionic current.</p><p>The drawback of the internal perfusion experiments for measuring affinity for TEA (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) is that ordinarily we could perfuse thoroughly only with a single TEA concentration. A direct estimation of the TEA-dissociation constant of the binding site(s) governing deactivation and inactivation requires testing at equilibrium several TEA concentrations in the same oocyte. Such experiments are difficult to achieve because it usually takes &#x0223c;1 h for the internal perfusion to reach a plateau, and oocytes in the cut-open configuration seldom survive more than 2 h. However, assuming that during the progress of the internal perfusion TEA occupancy of the channels remains constant during the &#x0223c;16 s that spans the application of deactivation and inactivation protocols shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>, we can obtain the ratio between the dissociation constants governing both processes. This invariance in the TEA concentration would be a bold assumption at the beginning of the perfusion because the rate of change in the current inhibition is the largest. However, as seen in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>, only a few points, usually &#x0003c;10, show inhibition corresponding to a change of &#x0003e;10% in the occupancy between consecutive pulses (arrows <italic>b</italic> in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Thus, the assumption is reasonably correct for a large majority of the data collected with the internal TEA perfusion protocol (arrows <italic>c</italic> in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). As a first approximation to obtain the ratio between both dissociation constants, we assumed homogeneous, although unknown, distribution of [TEA] under the voltage-clamped casket in the COVC. This assumption is approximately correct given that the tail relaxations could be closely fit by a single exponential function (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>). We also assumed that the pore binding kinetics are much faster than channel gating. With these assumptions, the unblocked fractions of currents at 0 and &#x02212;110 mV are, respectively:<disp-formula><tex-math id="M3">\documentclass[10pt]{article} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pmc} \usepackage[Euler]{upgreek} \pagestyle{empty} \oddsidemargin -1.0in \begin{document} \begin{equation*}U_{(0)}=(1+[{\mathrm{TEA}}]/K_{{\mathrm{D(0)}}})^{-1}\hspace{.167em}{\mathrm{and}}\hspace{.167em}U_{(-110)}=(1+[{\mathrm{TEA}}]/K_{{\mathrm{D}}(-110)})^{-1},\end{equation*}\end{document}</tex-math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>K</italic><sub>D(0)</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>D(&#x02212;110)</sub> are the dissociation constants for both blockade equilibriums.

Given the uncertainty of the internal TEA distribution, and the true position of the zero current level in the COVC experiments (see Materials and methods), these determinations seek internal experimental consistency rather than pretending to measure the true voltage dependence of the TEA binding equilibrium. Similar voltage dependencies suggest a single TEA binding site regulating inactivation and deactivation. Such a binding event of pore blockade by TEA would not only control permeation, but also deactivation and slow inactivation. In agreement with this proposal, and with the current structural picture of the binding site for tetraalkyammonia in the internal cavity of the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhou et al., 2001a</xref>), all the effects promoted by internal TEA examined in this paper require that it binds to the open conformation, a conformation that, to our knowledge, has a single cytosolically exposed TEA binding site, the pore-occluding site.</p></sec><sec><title>A Kinetic Model</title><p>Consistent with the weak effect of external TEA on the kinetics of slow inactivation of <italic>Shaker</italic> IR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), we could not detect any effect on the voltage dependency of inactivation at near steady state (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>Shaker</italic> IR T449S, the variant with enhanced C-type inactivation, was sensitive to external TEA, and accordingly, this pore blocker produced a significant shift along the voltage axis in the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Thus, we expected that the delay of the inactivation onset produced by internal TEA was accompanied by a shift along the voltage axis in the steady-state inactivation voltage dependency. It was somehow surprising that we could not detect any voltage shift after internal perfusion with 5 mM TEA (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Because inactivation kinetics is weakly voltage dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olcese et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang et al., 1997</xref>), these results suggest that slow inactivation occurs mostly after an important fraction of the gating charge has moved forward in the activation pathway. This suggestion is consistent with TEA having only a weak effect on the voltage dependence of the outward-gating charge movement elicited from a holding voltage of &#x02212;90 mV (when most of the channels are closed), but preventing Q1 from changing to Q2 during inactivation (in the nomenclature of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olcese et al., 1997</xref>; see <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>).</p><p>In the two-pulse protocols, external and internal TEA antagonize with the fast and the slow recovery phases, respectively (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). These results suggest at least two separate slow inactivation pathways that within the time span of the experimental protocol essentially do not interconvert (see also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klemic et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kurata et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, C-type inactivation recovers slowly, whereas the internal TEA-sensitive slow inactivation recuperates faster. Internal TEA slows down the closing of internally gated inactivation but does not affect its apparent rate of recovery (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>, inset), suggesting that this quaternary ammonium does not bind, or binds weakly, to the internally inactivated channels from the internal side.</p><p>The gating current experiments (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>) suggest two or more parallel energy pathways for the forward and backward movement of the gating charges; one corresponding to normal gating between closed states and the others to gating between slow-inactivated conformations. Thus, a minimal kinetic model to describe inactivation requires at least as many inactivated states as closed states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olcese et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dougherty et al., 2008</xref>). In this case, such an allosteric type of model must have three parallel activation pathways, the normal, the C-inactivated, and the internally gated inactivation. Thus, we tested the allosteric kinetic model published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klemic et al. (2001)</xref> for two coexisting inactivation pathways, the classical C-type inactivation and the U-type inactivation, here antagonized by internal TEA (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13A</xref>). In this model, <italic>I</italic> and <italic>U</italic> pathways are not directly interconnected as results shown in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> suggest. Three additional states bound to internal TEA were attached: the open state (<italic>O</italic><sub>TEA</sub>), the last C-inactivated state (<italic>I</italic><sub>5TEA</sub>), and the last U-inactivated state (<italic>U</italic><sub>5TEA</sub>). This model resembles others used to describe closed-state inactivation in other Kv channels, a usually absorbing inactivated state visited from a pre-open closed conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayer and Sigworth, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kerschensteiner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Claydon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dougherty et al., 2008</xref>). In this model, as the channel moves forward in the voltage activation pathway, it visits inactivated states increasingly faster by a constant allosteric factor and recovers increasingly slower by the same factor (see figure legend for details and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klemic et al., 2001</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig13"><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><p>An allosteric kinetic scheme for slow inactivation of <italic>Shaker</italic> IR.

Such slowdown in the inactivation kinetics predicts a crossing in the time course of current decay at 0 mV (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13B</xref>). (2) TEA produced a shift of &#x02212;2 mV in the voltage dependence of inactivation at near steady state (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13 C</xref>), below our detection limit, suggesting that the U-type inactivation state is mainly accessed from the C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub>, i.e., after a significant amount of charge has been mobilized to the active position in the normal activation pathway. (3) TEA reduces the amplitude of the fast recovery component without affecting its time constant (compare <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13 D</xref> with <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 B</xref>). We could not, however, predict the clear increase in the fraction of Q1 in the gating currents elicited from holding voltage of 0 mV. We attribute this deficiency to the slow voltage-independent recovery rates <italic>k</italic><sub>i</sub> from the <italic>I</italic> states, where most of the channels reside in the presence of TEA, such that most of the charge returns through the <italic>I</italic> pathway. Manipulation of the rate constants or allosteric factors in the model could, in principle, provide a better description of the gating charge data. However, without additional experimental data designed to estimate such parameters, any modification to the model seems too arbitrary.</p><p>In the model shown in <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13</xref>, the transit from the open state to the U-type inactivation at 0 mV is disfavored by the allosteric factor <italic>g</italic> &#x0003d; 0.005 or less (providing a destabilizing factor of 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> or higher), making state <italic>U</italic><sub>5</sub> seldom visited (with at most &#x0003c;1% occupancy). With <italic>g</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05, the probability of <italic>U</italic><sub>5TEA</sub> is too high to give a reasonable account for the two-pulse data shown in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>, increasing, instead of decreasing, the size of the fast recovery component. On the other hand, values of <italic>g</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005 or less provided a good qualitative description of the data (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13, B&#x02013;D</xref>). Thus, the antagonism between slow inactivation and internal TEA results from the very low probability of existence of the states <italic>U</italic><sub>5</sub>-<italic>U</italic><sub>5TEA</sub> (with a combined probability of &#x0003c;0.01). For us, this condition is experimentally undistinguishable from a kinetic model in which internal TEA truly antagonizes U inactivation in a mutually exclusive fashion. Although similar in their numerical outcome, both modeling conditions, small allosteric factor <italic>g</italic> versus mutual exclusiveness, bring about dramatically different mechanistic implications. A small allosteric factor <italic>g</italic> implies that in the U-inactivated channels the internal TEA binding site is physically exposed. Whereas, classical mutually exclusive antagonism means that the binding site does not exist, or is not physically accessible, in the U-inactivated state. The addition of extra-infrequently visited states that provide an equally good qualitative description of the main features of our data can be justified because, for the model shown in <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13</xref>, it delivers symmetry to the allosteric scheme. But it also introduces the allosteric factor <italic>g</italic>, a variable for which we do not envision a physical meaning.</p><p>But, not only parsimony mandates to shave away states <italic>U</italic><sub>5</sub>-<italic>U</italic><sub>5TEA</sub> from the scheme in <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13</xref>. That the binding site for internal TEA does not exist, or is not physically accessible, in the U-inactivated channels is more appealing because it is consistent with current inactivation models proposed for other voltage-gated ion channels. As discussed below, functional, and possible physical, overlapping between the slow inactivation gate and the primary activation gate has been proposed for other members of the voltage-gated ion channel family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sandtner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dougherty et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Functional Overlapping between the Internal Slow Inactivation Gate and the Activation Gate</title><p>The existence of a single TEA binding site that would functionally interfere with activation and slow inactivation is consistent with a single putative site for the binding of TEA in the K channel pore in the open and closed conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou et al., 2001b</xref>). This dual role of the TEA implies that both activation and deactivation gates either share a significant extent of structural components, or are tightly functionally coupled. In agreement with this conclusion, there are a number of mutations in the second half of the inner helix that promote alterations in both slow inactivation and deactivation kinetics (see for example: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holmgren et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D'Adamo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sukhareva et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Del Camino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Claydon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klement et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, in the <italic>Shaker</italic> homologue, Kv1.4, the conformational changes involving activation and slow inactivation displace a similar number of water molecules to/from the cytosolic face of the channel, implying similar volumetric changes in the internal vestibule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2003</xref>), revealing an intimate association between both gates.</p><p>In HCN and Kv4.2, other members of the voltage-gated K channel family, the primary activation gate recloses, or remains closed, during inactivation while its voltage sensors are in the active position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dougherty et al., 2008</xref>). In these channels, inactivation is viewed as a voltage-desensitized state. Although internal TEA accessibility has not been tested in the inactivated state of these channels, interference by internal TEA, as observed here, is also expected to occur. U-type inactivation in <italic>Shaker</italic> K channels possibly occurs by reclosing of the activation gate. Such a mechanism seems to be widely present. For example, muscle sodium channel Nav1.4 also closes a cytosolic gate during ultraslow inactivation, a process interfered by intracellular applied lidocaine, presumably acting in a foot in the door fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sandtner et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, it is not surprising that members of the same voltage-dependent ion channel protein family share a common repertoire of functional conformations. The balance of the time spend in each conformation, within a given physiological context, specifies the functional role of each ion channel. Thus, whether <italic>Shaker</italic>'s activation gate is closed or open during the internal TEA-sensitive slow inactivation remains to be tested.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Ram&#x000f3;n Latorre and John Ewer for insightful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript, and Victoria Prado for excellent technical help.</p><p>This work was funded by Programa Anillo de Ciencia y Tecnolog&#x000ed;a award ACT (no. 46 to A.
