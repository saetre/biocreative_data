To identify candidate ligand-receptor pairs potentially involved in the process of oocyte maturation, we performed DNA microarray analyses of ovarian transcripts in mice and identified Kit ligand (Kitl) as an ovarian factor stimulated by the LH/hCG surge.

Before ovulation, preovulatory oocytes undergo maturation. Oocyte maturation includes nuclear maturation events characterized by germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and the extrusion of first polar body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In addition to nuclear maturation to complete the first meiotic division, oocytes also undergo cytoplasmic maturation characterized by cytoplasmic changes essential for monospermic fertilization, processing of the sperm, and preparation for development to preimplantation embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge triggers oocytes to resume meiosis characterized by GVBD, chromosome condensation, and extrusion of the first polar body in preparation for fertilization and early embryonic development. However, oocytes express few or no LH receptors and are insensitive to direct LH stimulation. Thus, factors released by the LH-responsive granulosa or theca cells likely convey the LH stimuli to oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Recent studies demonstrated that the endocrine hormone LH stimulates ovarian production of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like factors from granulosa cells and insulin-like 3 (INSL3) from theca cells to promote GVBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Preovulatory increases in LH also stimulate granulosa cells to produce brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) that is capable of promoting first polar body extrusion and the cytoplasmic maturation of oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>We performed DNA microarray analyses using ovaries from immature mice following gonadotropin stimulation and identified candidate ligand-receptor pairs potentially involved in the process of oocyte maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Among different candidate genes, we found major increases in the ovarian expression of kit ligand (Kitl, also known as stem cell factor) during the preovulatory period. KITL is a pluripotent growth factor which is important in the differentiation and growth of diverse stem cell lineages including hematopoietic stem cells, neuroblasts, primordial germ cells, et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and its receptor is c-kit (CD117), a receptor protein tyrosine kinase belonging to the platelet-derived growth factor receptor family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. KITL and c-kit are the products of Steel (Sl) and White Spotting (W) loci in mice, respectively. Mutations in these loci will lead to infertility due to impairment of primordial germ cell survival, migration and proliferation, as well as defective follicle development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. KITL exists as both soluble (KITL1) which mediates cellular migration and membrane-bound (KITL2) proteins which contributes to cell survival and proliferation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Both KITL1 and KITL2 transcripts can be detected in ovaries and recent study showed that KITL2, but not KITL1 promoted mouse oocyte growth[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Although the KITL/c-kit signaling pathway is essential for diverse ovarian processes, including the initiation of primordial follicle development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], growth of oocytes in primordial and pre-antral follicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], proliferation of granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], recruitment of theca cells, and the regulation of ovarian steroidogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], few studies have explored the roles of KITL in oocyte maturation.</p><p>Here, we demonstrated preovulatory increases of KitL transcripts in ovarian granulosa and cumulus cells, but not its receptor, c-kit, which is predominantly expressed in mouse oocytes.

Forty-eight hours later, some animals were treated ip with Pregnyl (5 IU per animal, Organon) containing LH activity to induce ovulation. Ovaries were dissected from animals killed bi-hourly after Humegon treatment (three mice per group) and hourly after Pregnyl treatment (one mouse per group) for RNA extraction (TRIzol, Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). Aliquots of 6 &#x003bc;g of total RNA at 1 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l for one-chipset hybridization were stored at -80 C.

Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were obtained by puncturing the largest follicles of preovulatory ovaries, and denuded oocytes (DOs) were separated from cumulus cells by mechanical pipetting. Granulosa cells were obtained separately by puncturing preovulatory follicles, followed by the removal of COCs.</p><p>Quantitative real-time RT-PCR of transcript levels were performed using whole ovaries and isolated ovarian cells using a Smartcycler (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The primers and hybridization probes for real-time PCR of Kitl, c-kit and histone H2a are as follow: Kitl: sense 5'-ACATGGTGGCTGCTCTTCTT-3', antisense 5'-TGCAGACCTGATAGCATTGG-3', probe 5'-6-carboxy-fluorescein (FAM)-TGGTCTCTAGTTCCTTCTCTAATGCTCTGA-carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamine (TAMRA)-3'; c-kit: sense 5'-CGTGAACTCCATGTGGCTAA-3', antisense 5'-CGTCTCCTGGCGTTCATAAT-3', probe 5'-FAM-AAGCACAATAGCTGGCACCGG-TAMRA-3'; histone H2a: sense 5'-ACGAGGAGCTCAACAAGCTG-3', antisense 5'-TATGGTGGCTCTCCGTCTTC-3', probe 5'-FAM-AACATCCAGGCCGTGCTGCT-TAMRA-3'. To determine the copy number of target transcripts, cloned plasmid cDNAs for individual genes were used to generate a calibration curve. Purified plasmid cDNA templates were measured, and copy numbers were calculated based on absorbance at 260 nm. A calibration curve was created by plotting the threshold cycle against the known copy number for each plasmid template diluted in log steps from 10<sup>6 </sup>to 10<sup>1 </sup>copies. Each run included diluted plasmids to generate a calibration curve, a negative control without a template, and samples with unknown mRNA concentrations. Data were normalized based on histone H2a transcript levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>To localize KITL, ovaries were obtained from PMSG-primed mice at 4 h after hCG treatment.

The vials were flushed at the start of the culture with O2/N2 (at a 1:1 ratio), sealed, and cultured at 37 C with gentle shaking for 8 h. After culture, COCs were isolated, and, after cumulus cell removal, oocytes are examined for the occurrence of GVBD under a Hoffman contrast microscopy (Nikon Inc., Tokyo, Japan).</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of first polar body extrusion</title><p>Either COCs or DOs were cultured with or without KITL to evaluate the effect of KITL on the transition from metaphase I (MI) stage to metaphase II (MII) stage oocytes.

Fifty oocytes were homogenized in a buffer containing 137 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 10% glycerol, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride(PMSF), and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml leupeptin. Samples were boiled for 3 min, and separated by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-PAGE. Prestained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) standards (Invitrogen) were used as molecular weight marker. They were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Protran; Schleicher &#x00026; Schuell Bioscience, Dassel, Germany) pre-incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer containing 5% nonfat dry milk. The membranes were incubated with mouse anti-cyclin B1 monoclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, 1: 2000 dilution) at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. As control for loading, the membranes were also incubated with a rabbit anti-&#x003b2;-actin polyclonal antibody (sc-1616, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) at a dilution of 1:1000. Goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zhongshan, Beijing, China) was used as the secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:2000. Blots were developed using chemiluminescent substrate from the detection system (ECL; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and exposed to Kodak film.

Using isolated ovarian cells, we further showed major increase of Kitl transcripts in granulosa cells, and predominant expression of c-kit in preovulatory oocytes. In in vitro cultures, KITL directly acts on preovulatory oocytes to stimulate first polar body extrusion, but not GVBD and cytoplasmic maturation.</p><p>Previous studies on the control of oocyte maturation have focused mainly on endocrine regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. However, it has been recognized that intraovarian factors are also important in regulating oocyte maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The preovulatory LH surge triggers a cascade of events in ovarian follicles, including the resumption of meiotic maturation, luteinization, expansion or maturation of the cumulus cells, and follicle rupture. However, oocytes express few or no LH receptors and are insensitive to direct LH stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thus, the LH-responsive granulosa or theca cells could secret paracrine factors to regulate oocyte functions. To identify such intraovarian factors important for oocyte maturation, we performed DNA microarray analyses of the ovarian transcriptome during the peri-ovulatory period to provide a genome-wide screen of candidate genes. Here, we identified increases in the expression of Kitl mRNA after hCG stimulation in whole ovaries and isolated ovarian granulosa cells. Although Kitl mRNA was also increased in cumulus cells following hCG treatment, its level was lower than that of granulosa cells. Furthermore, KITL protein could be detected in granulosa, but not cumulus cells of preovulatory follicles obtained from ovaries of PMSG-primed mice at 4 h after hCG treatment. Granulosa cells in preantral and early antral follicles also expressed KITL, suggesting diverse role of KITL and c-kit throughout folliculogenesis and oogenesis, including the establishment of primordial germ cells within the ovary, primordial follicle activation, oocyte survival and growth, granulosa cell proliferation, theca cell recruitment, et al. The observed increases of Kitl mRNA in whole ovaries and granulosa cells are consistent with an earlier report using PMSG-primed rats at 6 h after hCG treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Likewise, low expression of Kitl was shown in cumulus cells of mouse antral follicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Our findings of the predominant expression of c-kit mRNA in preovulatory oocytes are also consistent with earlier reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Because c-kit is also expressed in theca cells of antral follicles, corpora lutea, and some interstitial cells of the ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], paracrine actions of KITL on the these cells cannot be ruled out.</p><p>Completion of the nuclear maturation of oocytes involves GVBD and extrusion of the first polar body. Although treatment of cultured COCs with KITL did not affect GVBD of preovulatory oocytes, it facilitated first polar body extrusion by 55% vs. control groups without treatment. This effect is comparable to that of another ovarian factor, IGF-I, showing 57% increases in first polar body extrusion vs. controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The dose range of KITL used in the present studies was similar to that used in the rat study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Furthermore, the concentrations of KITL in human preovulatory follicular fluid were comparable to those levels[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Similar to the BDNF stimulation of first polar body extrusion, but not GVBD, it is apparent that sequential steps of nuclear maturation of the oocyte are controlled by different paracrine factors. Although we detected transcripts of c-kit in both cumulus cells and oocytes in COCs, KITL induced first polar body extrusion in denuded oocytes, suggesting its direct effects on oocytes. Cyclin B is the regulatory subunit of maturation promoting factor, which induces meiotic resumption of immature mammalian oocytes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Mouse oocytes do not require de novo synthesis of proteins to undergo GVBD in vitro, whereas the synthesis of cyclin B1 is indispensable for the progression of meiotic maturation after GVBD. Rate of cyclin B1 synthesis controls the length of the first meiotic M phase[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Our data on the increase in cyclin B1 protein in MI oocytes following KITL treatment suggest that cyclin B1 is involved in KITL promotion of completion of meiosis I.</p><p>Although a previous study reported that treatment of isolated preovulatory oocytes with KITL transiently blocked GVBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], we did not observe an effect of KITL on GVBD of preovulatory oocytes using a follicle culture model. Because isolated oocytes undergo spontaneous GVBD after removal from surrounding somatic cells without LH treatment, our studies utilizing the preovulatory follicle model without spontaneous GVBD of the oocyte are more likely to reflect the in vivo conditions. Recent study demonstrated oocyte growth was limited in the absence of KITL, and yet spontaneous GVBD which could be inhibited by KITL2 was observed in these oocytes. The spontaneous GVBD is regarded as premature resumption of meiosis that reflects oocyte degeneration, rather than the physiologic meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Their findings further supported our results. Our unpublished data further indicated that KITL treatment did not induce cumulus cell expansion in preovulatory follicles cultured with the serum-free medium. Mutant mice with defects in KITL or c-kit showed similar phenotypes including impairment of primordial germ cell survival, migration and proliferation, as well as defective follicle development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Because these mutant mice exhibit developmental arrest of follicles at primary stage, no female mice were available for investigating the roles of KITL/c-kit signaling in the preovulatory follicles. Thus, the roles of endogenous KITL in the oocyte maturation remain to be determined.</p><p>Some oocytes competent to complete nuclear maturation are unable to develop into blastocyst stage, which is indicative of deficient or defective cytoplasmic maturation of the oocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. During the maturation process, oocytes undergo profound cytoplasmic changes which are essential for normal fertilization and embryonic development. However, treatment of preovulatory oocytes with KITL did not improve the developmental capacity of mouse oocytes. Our data is consistent with previous findings demonstrating that the concentrations of KITL in the human follicular fluid did not associate with the fertilization rate and pregnant outcome in patients undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Thus, the processes of nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation of the oocyte are independently regulated and could be controlled by different paracrine factors.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that there are significant interactions between oocyte secreted factors and KITL[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Growth differentiation factor (GDF9) from oocyte has been shown to inhibit kitl expression in granulosa cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] while present study demonstrates the enhancement of nuclear maturation by KITL produced by granulosa cells. And recent studies indicated an important role of GDF9 in promoting oocyte developmental potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. These studies suggest that there are complex regulatory loops between oocytes and follicular somatic cells. Further study is needed to clarify the role of KITL and GDF9 interaction in oocyte nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, we demonstrated increases of Kitl expression following LH/hCG stimulation in preovulatory granulosa cells and the ability of KITL to promote the first polar body extrusion of preovulatory oocytes. It is becoming clear that this ligand signaling system is important for diverse ovarian processes including primodial germ cell endowment, primordial follicle activation, theca cell recruitment, the antrum formation, and oocyte growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The present demonstration of an augmenting role of KITL for the nuclear maturation of preovulatory oocytes underscores the importance of diverse paracrine systems for oocyte maturation. Understanding of these intercellular communication networks could lead to new approaches in the treatment of infertility, and facilitate future formulation of the optimal culture conditions for in vitro maturation and in vitro fertilization of oocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YY performed all experiments with following coauthors helps.
