Rpp29, a conserved protein subunit of human RNase P, can substitute for C5 protein in reconstitution assays of M1 RNA activity. To better understand the role of the former protein, we compare the mode of action of Rpp29 to that of the C5 protein in activation of M1 RNA. Enzyme kinetic analyses reveal that complexes of M1 RNA&#x02013;Rpp29 and M1 RNA&#x02013;C5 exhibit comparable binding affinities to precursor tRNA but different catalytic efficiencies. High concentrations of substrate impede the activity of the former complex. Rpp29 itself exhibits high affinity in substrate binding, which seems to reduce the catalytic efficiency of the reconstituted ribonucleoprotein. Rpp29 has a conserved C-terminal domain with an Sm-like fold that mediates interaction with M1 RNA and precursor tRNA and can activate M1 RNA. The results suggest that distinct protein folds in two unrelated protein cofactors can facilitate transition from RNA- to ribonucleoprotein-based catalysis by RNase P.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Biosynthesis of cellular RNA, e.g. mRNA, rRNA and tRNA, requires small nuclear and nucleolar ribonucleoproteins, some of which have a large number of protein subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). While main efforts are being made in elucidating the roles of the RNA moieties of these catalytic ribonucleoproteins in biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>), the precise functions of their protein components remain largely unknown. One of these catalytic ribonucleoproteins is ribonuclease P (RNase P), a ubiquitous tRNA processing endonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Highly purified human nuclear RNase P has a single species of RNA, H1 RNA, which is associated with at least 10 distinct protein subunits, Rpp14, Rpp20, Rpp21, Rpp25, Rpp29, Rpp30, Rpp38, Rpp40, hPop1 and hPop5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Reconstitution of the endonucleolytic activity of human RNase P reveals that H1 RNA and two conserved protein subunits, Rpp21 and Rpp29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), are sufficient for the removal of 5&#x02032; leader sequence from precursor tRNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). This finding raised the concept that binding and cleavage of precursor tRNA substrates by eukaryotic RNase P may need a few protein components. Reconstitution systems developed for active archaeal RNase P ribonucleoproteins support this concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).</p><p>The role of the subunit Rpp29 in RNA-based catalysis is highlighted by the ability of this protein to activate the M1 RNA enzyme of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNase P at low concentrations of magnesium ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Archaeal/eukaryal Rpp29 proteins are central components in the assembly and function of RNase P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Archaeal Rpp29 polypeptides are smaller in size, when compared with their eukaryal counterparts and have structural features found in bacterial and eukaryal proteins, as revealed from the determination of their NMR and crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). A prominent structural feature of <italic>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</italic> Rpp29 is a sheet of six antiparallel &#x003b2;-strands wrapped around a core of conserved hydrophobic amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). The <italic>Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus</italic> Rpp29 has a &#x003b2;-barrel core and unstructured N- and C-terminal domains containing highly conserved amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). The crystal structures of <italic>Pyrococcus horikoshii</italic> Rpp29 (Ph1771p) and <italic>A.fulgidus</italic> Rpp29 reveal that their &#x003b2;-barrel cores are similar to those of Sm proteins and their N- and C-termini form flexible helical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). These two archaeal Rpp29 proteins, which are structurally related to the bacterial transcription factors Hfq and NusG, as well as to the eukaryal Sm RNA-binding proteins, show similarity to the C-terminal domain of human Rpp29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>The comparison of the mode of action of Rpp29 to that of the C5 protein in activation of M1 RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) may provide new insights into the role of these cofactors in tRNA substrate recognition and RNA-based catalysis. The C5 protein has been shown to enhance the catalytic efficiency of M1 RNA and increase substrate versatility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Cysteine-substituted mutants of C5 proteins and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> RNase P proteins associated with their corresponding RNA subunits can be crosslinked to the 5&#x02032; leader sequence of precursor tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). These A- and B-type of bacterial RNase P proteins augment the magnesium ion affinity of enzyme-substrate intermediates by correctly positioning the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). The bacterial RNase P protein stabilizes the holoenzyme against electrostatic repulsion and increases the turnover rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), possibly by favoring contact of the holoenzyme with the substrate over the product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>).</p><p>The identity among the amino acid sequences of the A- and B-type proteins of bacterial RNase P is notably low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>), but they share a short stretch of basic sequence, the RNR motif, a central cleft and a few aromatic amino acid residues close to their N-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Nonetheless, both types of proteins can activate the other type of bacterial RNase P RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>), as well as archaeal RNase P RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Thus, common structural features and biochemical properties of these protein cofactors facilitate RNA-based catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). However, the C5 protein and Rpp29 do not share an apparent identity at their primary amino acid sequences and thus the molecular basis for the observed activation of M1 RNA by these two cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) is unclear.</p><p>We here address some properties of Rpp29 in activating M1 RNA and compare them to those of the C5 protein known to function in substrate recognition and catalysis. The results support the idea that activation of M1 RNA by these two evolutionarily unrelated protein cofactors is based on the use of distinct protein folds that perform parallel functions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Site-directed mutagenesis of Rpp29</title><p>QuickChange&#x000ae; site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, CA) was utilized to introduce substitutions of amino acids in Rpp29 using designed primers and pHTT7K/Rpp29 as template for PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), following the manufacturer's instructions.

In the case of M1 RNA&#x02013;C5 and M1 RNA&#x02013;Rpp29, the dependence of the reaction rates on substrate concentrations exhibited saturation kinetics, and therefore the results were fit to Michaelis&#x02013;Menten equation, producing values for the kinetic parameters <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>, <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>M1 RNA&#x02013;C5 had a <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value of 0.2 &#x000b5;M, which was &#x0223c;2-fold lower than the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value obtained for M1 RNA&#x02013;Rpp29 or M1 RNA&#x02013;Rpp29&#x00394;194-220 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

To examine this possibility, northwestern blot analysis was performed using full length, <sup>32</sup>P-labeled M1 RNA as a probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Rpp29 produced a binding signal with M1 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lane 4), while the subunits Rpp20, Rpp21 and Rpp30 failed to interact with this RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;3 and 7) or activate it (data not shown). Rpp29&#x00394;194-220 and Rpp29&#x00394;162-220 also produced binding signals with M1 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lanes 5 and 6). Similar results were obtained when a similar analysis was performed with a membrane that was blocked with an excess amount of unlabeled p<italic>SupS1</italic> before addition of labeled M1 RNA (data not shown). Notably, Rpp21 bound to precursor tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A</xref>) but not to M1 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that the putative tRNA-binding site in Rpp21 was not used for non-specific interaction with M1 RNA. Moreover, when a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled RNase MRP RNA was tested as control, both Rpp29 and Rpp20 produced binding signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Thus, we substituted Lys162 and His163 with two asparagine residues in Rpp29KH and replaced Lys179 with asparagine in another mutant, Rpp29K179N (Materials and Methods).

Thus, Rpp29 may augment the catalytic efficiency of M1 RNA by facilitating direct interaction with precursor tRNA.</p><p>The heterologous reconstitution of M1 RNA activity with Rpp29 as described in this study has several new enzymological and biological insights. First, heterologous reconstitution systems developed for bacterial RNase P ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) have produced novel findings related to the importance of the structure rather than the primary amino acid sequences of bacterial protein subunits in holoenzyme function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). The ability of Rpp29 to activate M1 RNA further emphasizes the dependence of this RNA catalyst on the structure of its interacting protein. Second, in contrast to the homologous reconstitution system of human mini-RNase P that involves at least three components, e.g. Rpp21, Rpp29 and H1 RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), which makes it difficult to elucidate the exact role and contribution of each subunit in substrate recognition and catalysis, the simple nature of the heterologous reconstitution system of M1 RNA and Rpp29 allows the examination of the role of this protein cofactor in substrate binding and catalysis. Third, M1 RNA is functional in mammalian cells as a targeting ribozyme in the presence of external guide sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>) and purified human RNase P protein preparations have been shown to activate M1 RNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>), thus strengthening the biological relevance of our study on activation of M1 RNA by Rpp29.</p><p>A major difference between the C5 protein and Rpp29 in activation of M1 RNA is that the latter protein cofactor can facilitate multiple turnover reactions of substrate cleavage as long as substrate concentration is &#x0003c;0.5 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), a value that is close to the calculated <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value of M1 RNA&#x02013;Rpp29 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, M1 RNA&#x02013;C5 remains active when substrate concentrations are high, well above the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value. Rpp29 itself has a relatively high binding affinity to precursor tRNA. Our gel shift assays reveal that the C5 protein does not bind to p<italic>SupS1</italic> under conditions that facilitate binding by Rpp29 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Lack of or weak interaction of the C5 protein alone with precursor tRNA may explain why high concentrations of substrate do not inhibit the activity of the holoenzyme. In contrast, C5 protein has been shown to exhibit a very high binding affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 0.4 nM) to its natural M1 RNA partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Protein folds and RNase P RNA-based catalysis</title><p>Rpp29 is conserved in Eucarya and Archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) and is composed of two major domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). The most conserved part of Rpp29 corresponds to its C-terminus, while the N-terminal part of Rpp29, which harbors nuclear/nucleolar localization domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>), is preserved among eukaryotic homologs. The C-terminal domain of Rpp29 promotes direct interactions with precursor tRNA and M1 RNA. A truncation mutant of Rpp29, Rpp29&#x00394;1-124, which has the C-terminal part that possesses an Sm-like fold, is sufficient for substrate binding and activation of M1 RNA. Such dual RNA-binding capabilities have also been proposed for the C5 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). The role of Rpp29 and C5 protein in substrate recognition and catalysis is different from those reported for other protein cofactors of RNA catalysts, such as the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> CBP2 and <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> CYT-18, which facilitate the tertiary folding of the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> mitochondrial bI5 group I intron RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>) or the LtrA protein that stabilizes the catalytically active structure of <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> Ll.LtrB group II intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>).</p><p>The 3D structures of human Rpp29 and C5 protein are not available.

These bacterial proteins share a homologous structure that bears several potential RNA-binding sites, e.g. a central cleft, a metal-binding loop and an RNR motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). The central cleft in the <italic>B.subtilis</italic> RNase P protein and the C5 protein probably mediates interaction with precursor tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). The predicted secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>) of the C-terminus of human Rpp29 reveals an array of six &#x003b2;-strands with &#x003b1;-helices at both sides typical of an Sm-like fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) that may interact with RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>).

In contrast, substitution of Lys179, which is found in the loop between the &#x003b2;4 and &#x003b2;5 strands of Rpp29 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) affects substrate binding. Lys179 in human Rpp29 corresponds to Lys58 in the <italic>A.fulgidus</italic> Rpp29 that is part of a three-way salt bridge proposed to have a role in protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Since substitution of Lys179 in Rpp29 alters the RNA binding properties of Rpp29, this conserved residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) may have a unique role in shaping or stabilizing the global structure of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Work is in progress to examine the effect of substitution of Lys179 to amino acids other than asparagine (this polar residue can be part of salt bridges in proteins) on activation of M1 RNA and human mini-RNase P (E. Sharin and N. Jarrous, unpublished data). In addition, since Rpp29 is also a core component of RNase MRP, substitution of Lys179 may also affect RNase MRP function in rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>).</p><p>The distinct structures of bacterial RNase P proteins and archaeal/eukaryal Rpp29 suggest that these ancient protein cofactors belong to unrelated protein families with analogous functions in RNase P RNA-based catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Nonetheless, these proteins are structurally and genetically linked to ribosomal proteins and translation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). Thus, archaeal Rpp29 proteins exhibit topological resemblance to the bacterial translational regulator Hfq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) and <italic>Haloarcula marismortui</italic> ribosomal protein L21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), both of which possess Sm-like folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). The protein subunit of <italic>B.subtilis</italic> RNase P shares common structural features with ribosomal protein S5 and the ribosomal translocase EF-G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Translation of bacterial RNase P proteins and the ribosomal protein L34 overlaps in bacteria while Rpp29 coding genes are embedded in ribosomal protein operons in archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). The genetic links and structural resemblance of these highly conserved basic proteins, probably derived from ancient RNA-binding peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>), suggest that they have emerged and evolved during transition of the ribosome and RNase P from RNA to RNP enzymes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Sidney Altman (Yale University) for providing us with recombinant C5 protein and anti-C5 protein antibodies.
