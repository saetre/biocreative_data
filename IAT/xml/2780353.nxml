The rate at which dietary sugars enter and exit the intestinal epithelium has a major effect on blood glucose concentration and homeostasis. Briefly, dietary carbohydrates are taken into the enterocytes by specific transporters and exit the cell through the basolateral GLUT2 transporter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Kellett1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Kellett2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. In pre-prandial state, glucose transport is an active process which involves the co-transport of sugar with sodium ions through the sodium-glucose transporter-1, SGLT-1. In prandial state, when higher concentrations of glucose or galactose are found in the intestinal lumen, apical GLUT2 becomes active providing the small intestine with an absorptive capacity to match dietary intake during meal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Kellett1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms involved in their entry and exit from intestinal epithelium to blood, is of great interest. In this combined <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches, we showed that intestinal GLUT2 and GLUT5 transporters are direct targets of luminal leptin detected in the intestinal lumen and originating from the stomach. Indeed, introduction of exogenous leptin into intestinal lumen resulted in an up-regulation of transepithelial transport of fructose, a concurrent potentiation of circulating levels of glucose, and an increase in fructose content in the liver. These effects were accompanied by increased circulating levels of triglycerides, suppression of Fiaf expression both in intestinal epithelium and the liver, and by induction of hepatic SREBP-1c transcription factor, targeting genes in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. These findings may have physiological implications. Thus, we demonstrated for the first time that oral load of fructose, but not galactose rapidly induces release of gastric leptin which enters the intestine at a concentration compatible with the activation of leptin receptors. Collectively, these data sustain that in the small intestine, a positive regulatory control loop exists between gut leptin and two transporters: the specific GLUT5 fructose transporter and the apical GLUT2 which is active in conditions of high concentrations of glucose/galactose and which has a minor participation in fructose transport. This regulatory loop appears to be connected to metabolic functions in the liver.</p><p>Firstly, we showed that mucosal leptin increases GLUT2 and GLUT5 transporter activity as well as insertion of GLUT2 and GLUT5 in the brush-border membrane (BBM). These changes were leptin-receptor specific since they were blocked by leptin antagonist and correlated with the phosphorylation/activation of PKC&#x003b2;II at the BBM. This activation of PKC&#x003b2;II enhanced the insertion of GLUT2/5 and reduced the insertion of the energy-dependent SGLT1 transporters into the brush-border membrane, consistent with previous data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Kellett2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Ducroc1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Helliwell1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. The findings have clear physiological implications: immediately after a meal, a high local concentration of sugars is generated at the surface of the brush-border by disaccharidases. The released gastric leptin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Bado1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> enters the lumen of the intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Guilmeau1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Guilmeau2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, where it may then up-regulate GLUT2/GLUT5 transporter activity to match dietary intake. The intracellular mechanisms of such a rapid regulation of absorption by luminal leptin involve the activation of AMPK&#x003b1; which is known to play a central role in regulating glucose uptake (<italic>review in</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Hardie1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>). In this context, we showed that luminally acting leptin phosphorylates/activates AMPK&#x003b1; in the intestine consistent with previous data reporting similar findings in other biological systems <italic>i.e</italic>. liver, hypothalamus, muscles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Viollet1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Jorgensen1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Janovska1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

We further elucidated a role of AMPK in the leptin regulation of intestinal hexoses transporters by using AMPK&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> KO mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Viollet1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. We found that deletion of the catalytic subunit &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>, which does not alter the architecture of the jejunum, potently lowered levels of GLUT2 and GLUT5 and elevated levels of SGLT1. This increase in SGLT1 levels correlated with an increase in its activity, as measured by glucose-induced <italic>Isc</italic> using the Ussing chamber (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007935.s002">fig.

Alternatively, the reduced expression of GLUT2/GLUT5 and the increased SGLT1 expression in AMPK&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> KO mice could reflect a differential regulation of these transporters by AMPK&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> as reported by Walker and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Walker1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> showing that activation of AMPK results in an up-regulation of GLUT2 and a concurrent down-regulation of SGLT-1.

However, we did not observe this effect in AMPK&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> KO jejunum, suggesting that leptin acting from the lumen of the intestinal epithelium requires the catalytic &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> subunit of AMPK for this inhibitory effect. Our data can be compared to previous findings showing that activation of AMPK in murine jejunum tissues, increases glucose uptake which can be attributed to an increased amount of GLUT2 in the BBM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Walker1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>On the other hand, <italic>in vivo</italic> luminal fructose increases GLUT2 and GLUT5 mRNA levels as reported earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Ferraris1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Cui2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> and this effect is potentiated by leptin given orally. This suggests that luminal leptin can replenish the pool of the transporters by inducing gene transcription. The <italic>in vivo</italic> dose of leptin was comparable to the doses detected in gastric juice (0.9 to 1.2 nmol/L) in response to fructose as well as the levels of leptin detected in intestinal juice (0.7 nmol/L).

Our demonstration that the actions of leptin require active jejunal leptin receptors, led us to propose a two-step mode of action for luminal leptin regulation of sugars transport, involving a rapid recruitment of GLUT2/GLUT5 to the BBM to deal with the inflow of dietary sugars during a meal, followed by transcription of the corresponding genes, allowing the reconstitution of the cytosolic pool of transporters. These data are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007935.s004">fig. S3</xref>.</p><p>Notably, the fructose-induced increase in GLUT5 mRNA levels markedly increased when mice fed with a HFD received chronically leptin given orally. This suggests that gut leptin might be a key molecule for the enterocyte in adapting the levels of carbohydrate transporters to the diet. This is in line with recent observations showing that, on an already potent obesity-inducing hypercaloric diet, fructose induces leptin-resistance leading to pronounced susceptibility to increased weight gain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Shapiro1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Teff1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>This leptin up-regulation of GLUT2/GLUT5 affects <italic>in vivo</italic> circulating levels of glucose and triglycerides. Indeed, oral leptin enhanced fructose-induced mild hyperglycaemia and the size of this effect is dependent on the amount of fructose absorbed. As a consequence of increased hyperglycaemia, plasma insulin levels increased to adapt glucose uptake by the different tissues. Moreover, all the changes occurring after oral leptin are not associated with changes in plasma leptin levels, indicating that the primary site of action of oral leptin is within the gut mucosa.</p><p>In addition to observing the increase in plasma glucose levels after an oral load of fructose, the majority of the absorbed fructose appears in the blood and liver, the main site of fructose metabolism. These findings were consistent with data from studies in rodents and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Chong1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the increased plasma glucose could originate from fructose metabolism in the liver and possibly from enterocytes. Fructose is metabolised mainly in the liver through two alternative pathways: the fructose 1-phosphate pathway, involving fructokinase, and/or the fructose 6-phosphate pathways. In the enterocyte, fructose is metabolised by fructokinase through the fructose 1-phosphate pathway. As for the liver and kidney, the small intestine expresses gluconeogenesis genes such as those encoding G6Pase and PEPCK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Rajas1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. The transcription of these gluconeogenic genes is tightly controlled in the liver by substrates and various hormones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Crosson1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we demonstrate a potentiation by oral leptin of fructose-induced mRNA levels of FK-, F1,6BPase- and G6Pase-encoding genes in the liver and the jejunum. The observed increase in these enzymes mRNA is causally linked to the amount of fructose absorbed; indeed oral leptin alone fails to affect the levels of these enzymes. Thus, as in the liver, glucose produced by the enterocyte may contribute partly to fructose-induced hyperglycemia consistent with a neoglucogenic status for the small intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Rajas2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The leptin stimulation of GLUT5 fructose transport is associated with the unexpected reduction of the levels of Fiaf mRNA in both the intestine and the liver. Fiaf is a gene which encodes a physiologically relevant circulating inhibitor of LPL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Kersten1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, an enzyme that promotes storage of triglycerides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Eckel1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. This reduction of intestinal and hepatic levels of Fiaf mRNA, is critically dependent upon the amount of absorbed fructose. Indeed, leptin alone given orally enhances Fiaf mRNA levels, implying that fructose is the primary signal controlling the levels of Fiaf mRNA. The suppression of Fiaf may increase LPL activity and thus activates storage of triglycerides in tissues such as the liver. Our data are reminiscent of those recently demonstrating an enterocyte-specific suppression of Fiaf by the gut microbiota leading to induction of <italic>de novo</italic> hepatic lipogenesis, probably through the increased conversion of dietary polysaccharides into monosaccharides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Backhed1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. The fact that leptin potentiates the fructose induction of SREBP-1c, a transcription factor targeting lipogenic genes in the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Foretz1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Foretz2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, strengthens this hypothesis. Interestingly, this leptin potentiation of fructose-induced SREBP-1c was associated with increased expression and activation of ACC-1, the key regulatory enzyme of fatty acid biosynthesis. The activation ACC-1 is expected to elevate the levels of malonyl-CoA in the liver. The concurrent increased expression of hepatic FAS which plays a central role in <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis, catalyzing reactions steps in the conversion of malonyl-CoA to palmitate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Obici1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Wakil1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, may also indicate increased levels of palmitate. The surprising capacity of leptin given orally to phosphorylate/inactivate ACC-1 in the liver argues for a beneficial effect on the liver. This effect of gut leptin is quite different from the results showing that intracerebroventricular injection of leptin activates hypothalamic ACC, up-regulates the levels of malonyl-CoA and concomitantly inhibits AMPK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Gao1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. We have no clear explanation for these discrepancies but undoubtedly they need to be clarified. The effects of leptin given orally on hepatic metabolic functions could be of great importance in terms of pharmacological manipulation of the expression of these key enzymes, but the mechanisms involved need to be elucidated. Actually, we cannot exclude that leptin given by oral route, could enter the liver in sufficient quantity to affect the hepatic expression of genes encoding key metabolic enzymes. Indeed, we demonstrated that oral fructose but not galactose, triggers a rapid and dramatic secretion of gastric leptin in gastric juice which is found at levels compatible with activation of leptin receptors in the intestinal lumen. These findings are of great interest in light with the recent data demonstrating that consuming fructose-sweetened, and not glucose sweetened, beverages increases <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis and increases visceral adiposity in overweight and obese adults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007935-Stanhope1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our data sustain the existence of a positive regulatory control loop between gut leptin and fructose, in which fructose triggers the release of gastric leptin which in turn up-regulates GLUT2/GLUT5 leading to increase fructose absorption and changes in some metabolic functions in the liver.

Fructose enters into the liver, induces SREBP-1c a transcription factor targeting genes in the lipogenic program.

id="s4h"><title>Oral Fructose Tolerance Test</title><p>Three sets of experiments were conducted with the 16-hour fasted mice. In the first set of experiments, we determined whether leptin could increase fructose absorption in conscious animals. To this end, mice were given an oral load of 2 g fructose per kg of body weight added with 0.1 &#x000b5;Ci radiolabelled &#x0005b;<sup>14</sup>C&#x0005d;-fructose without (control) or with 3 ng/g leptin. Before starting the oral fructose tolerance test (OFTT), blood samples were taken from the tail and blood glucose levels were determined (ACCU-CHEK; Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France). The bleeds were further taken at 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after administration. At 120 minutes, blood was collected, mice were sacrificed and segments of jejunum and the liver were removed. The radioactivity was counted and used to calculate the amount of fructose in these compartments. For jejunum and the liver, the data were expressed as moles of fructose per gram wet tissue.</p><p>The second set of experiments was designed to determine if the effects of leptin depend on the amount of ingested fructose. Mice were given an oral load of 1 g or 2 g unlabelled D-fructose per kg of body weight without (control) or with 3 ng/g leptin. Blood samples were taken and blood glucose levels were determined as mentioned above. These experiments were performed with 16 individual animals, each animal being its own control. The animals were allowed to recovery during 72 hours between two experiments.</p><p>The third set of experiments, fasted mice were divided into four groups and treated without or with fructose in the presence or the absence of 3 ng/g leptin. Fifteen minutes later, blood was drawn from the retro-orbital sinus with heparinised capillary Pasteur pipettes, centrifuged and the plasma was stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until determination of insulin levels by RIA.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Effects of Fructose on Luminal Leptin Contents from Stomach and the Intestine</title><p>18-hour fasted mice were treated by gavage with saline, fructose (1 g and 2 g/kg body weight), 6 g/kg galactose or with intraperitoneal injection of 10 ng/g CCK-8 as positive control. Fifteen minutes later, blood was drawn from the retro-orbital sinus, centrifuged and the plasma stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until RIA of leptin. Mice were sacrificed, their stomachs and their small intestines (from duodenum to ileum) were removed and then flushed each with 1 ml of PBS buffer containing 500 UI/ml aprotinin; the luminal contents were collected on ice, centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatants were used for a leptin determination by a RIA.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>All values are expressed as means&#x000b1;SEM.
