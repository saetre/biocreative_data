How <italic>fascin-1</italic> transcription is activated in carcinoma cells is largely unknown, although the hypothesis of regulation by &#x003b2;-catenin signaling has received attention. The question is important because of the clinical significance of fascin expression in human carcinomas.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Through comparative genomics we made an unbiased analysis of the DNA sequence of the <italic>fascin-1</italic> promoter region from six mammalian species. We identified two regions in which highly conserved motifs are concentrated. Luciferase promoter reporter assays for the human <italic>fascin-1</italic> promoter were carried out in fascin-positive and -negative human breast and colon carcinoma cells, and in human dermal fibroblasts that are constitutively fascin-positive. In all fascin-positive cells, the region &#x02212;219/&#x0002b;114 that contains multiple highly conserved motifs had strong transcriptional activity. The region &#x02212;2953/&#x02212;1582 appeared to contain repressor activity. By examining the effects of single or multiple point mutations of conserved motifs within the &#x02212;219/&#x0002b;114 region on transcriptional reporter activity, we identified for the first time that the conserved CREB and AhR binding motifs are major determinants of transcriptional activity in human colon carcinoma cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitations for CREB, AhR or &#x003b2;-catenin from extracts from fascin-positive or -negative human colon carcinoma cells identified that CREB and AhR specifically associate with the &#x02212;219/&#x0002b;114 region of the <italic>FSCN1</italic> promoter in fascin-positive colon carcinoma cells. An association of &#x003b2;-catenin was not specific to fascin-positive cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Upregulation of fascin-1 in aggressive human carcinomas appears to have a multi-factorial basis.

The mechanism by which <italic>fascin-1</italic> transcription is upregulated in carcinomas is not understood.

A 2.6 kb 5&#x02032; flanking region of mouse <italic>fascin-1</italic> is sufficient to drive promoter reporter activity in mature mouse dendritic cells but not in immature cells; similarly, a 3.1 kb 5&#x02032; flanking region of human <italic>fascin-1</italic> specifically confers induction of reporters in mature human dendritic cells and other non-transformed fascin-positive cells.

Grothey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005130-Grothey1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> identified multiple candidate T cell factor (TCF) binding sites in the (mouse) <italic>Fscn1</italic> promoter, but found no effect of either TCF or &#x003b2;-catenin over-expression on <italic>Fscn1</italic> promoter activity when tested in human MDA-MB-435 cells.

Because both of these studies focused on analysis of the mouse <italic>fascin-1</italic> promoter, it remains unclear whether <italic>FSCN1</italic> could be a direct target of &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF transcriptional regulation in human carcinomas. Understanding the mechanisms of <italic>FSCN1</italic> transcriptional regulation in human carcinoma cells is an important question because it may lead to novel prognostic tools for early identification of the most biologically aggressive carcinomas, and/or potential novel therapeutic strategies to reduce tumour metastasis through inhibition of fascin expression. Here, we first took the unbiased approach of identifying evolutionary conserved regions of the <italic>fascin-1</italic> promoter region in mammals by comparative genomics. We built on these data to analyse experimentally the <italic>cis</italic>-acting mechanisms of <italic>FSCN1</italic> transcriptional regulation in human colon and breast carcinoma cells.

For the rat and chimpanzee, a full sequence for the entire 5.5 kb region is not yet available, thus our detailed analysis focused on a 2 kb 5&#x02032; flanking region for which all six species could be fully aligned. The chicken (as an example of an avian) could not be included because this region of its genome is not yet sequenced completely.</p><p>To examine sequence conservation across the 2 kb 5&#x02032; flanking regions, a TCOFFEE multiple sequence alignment was prepared (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005130.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The alignment demonstrated that the three primate genome sequences are near identical throughout this region apart from scattered individual single nucleotide differences and some short additional sequences in the macaque. In contrast, the dog and rodent sequences contained multiple nucleotide insertions and /or deletions, resulting in multiple gap insertions throughout the alignment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005130.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Overall, the sequence conservation between the 5&#x02032; flanking regions of human and rodent <italic>fascin-1</italic> was much lower than between the primates (for example, the human and mouse sequences have 54.6&#x00025; identity over the 2 kb region, whereas human and macaque are 90.5&#x00025; identical). The most significant region of conservation across all six species was within a 200 bp region, 5&#x02032; to and including the translational start site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005130.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>For an independent second methodology, the six sequences were analysed by phylogenetic footprinting with the algorithm FootPrinter.

The central novel findings of our study are: a), the identification of two separate regions within the 5&#x02032; flanking region of mammalian <italic>fascin-1</italic> genes in which specific, highly conserved sequence motifs are concentrated; b), the identification of a combined action of the well-conserved CREB- and AhR-binding motifs in positive transcriptional regulation of <italic>FSCN1</italic>, and c), the identification that AhR and CREB transcription factors are specifically associated with the <italic>FSCN1</italic> promoter in fascin-positive human colon carcinoma cells.</p><p>The availability of multiple sequenced mammalian genomes has greatly increased possibilities for making broadly based, and therefore more accurate, identification of evolutionarily conserved features within the human genome. This is particularly important for analyses of candidate transcription factor binding sites, for which the core motifs are under 10 nucleotides long, and which tend to be over-predicted by motif identification algorithms. With the benefit of genomic sequences from six mammals for multiple sequence alignment and motif analysis, we definitively identified two separate major regions of very high sequence conservation situated within 2 kb upstream of the translational start codon of <italic>fascin-1</italic>.

We identified a commonality of regulatory mechanisms between fascin-positive breast and colon carcinoma cells and human fibroblasts that are constitutively fascin-positive. This implies that fascin up-regulation in carcinomas is likely to be mediated by aberrations in normal regulatory mechanism(s), rather than activation of a novel mechanism. We note that the basal low level of promoter reporter activity in SW1222 and T47D cells is in contrast to the complete absence of fascin protein in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005130-Jawhari1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005130-g006">Fig. 6A</xref> of this study).

However, no increase in fascin protein was detected in SW1222 cells treated with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine for up to 72 h (unpublished observation).

The combined mutation of both motifs inhibited promoter reporter activity most strongly. We substantiated the concept of a direct functional role for the CREB and AhR transcription factors by the following novel findings: 1) both proteins are physically associated with the &#x02212;219/&#x0002b;7 <italic>FSCN1</italic> promoter region in fascin-positive SW480 human colon carcinoma cells; 2), as confirmed by qRT-PCR, these associations are not detectable in fascin-negative SW1222 human colon carcinoma cells. It should be noted that the chromatin immunoprecipitation method does not identify the precise transcription factor binding site on the DNA; additional approaches such as EMSA or use of promoter decoys will be required to confirm this point. CREB binds as a dimer to DNA and then recruits either CBP or p300 as a co-activator of transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005130-Ross1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. CBP has been demonstrated to impact the levels of <italic>fascin-1</italic> transcript and protein in differentiating NT2 neuronal cells and is thus a plausible candidate for a co-activator of CREB on the <italic>FSCN1</italic> promoter in SW480 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005130-Megiorni1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Increased expression of CREB is correlated with high grade prostate carcinomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005130-Ghosh1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, however, there are limited data on the relationship between CREB expression and the progression and/or metastasis of colon carcinomas. Mechanisms of CREB activation are complex and involve cAMP-activated phosphorylation of CREB plus additional processes to generate signaling specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005130-Adams2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005130-Zhang1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, we consider it unlikely that there is a simple relationship between levels of CREB, pCREB, and tumour status. Interestingly, both CBP and p300 are frequently mutated in colon cancer cell lines with microsatellite instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005130-Ionov1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Microsatellite instability is most frequent in tumours of the proximal colon, which are the tumours that most frequently over-express fascin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005130-Hashimoto5">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005130-Puppa1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. We hypothesise that up-regulation of fascin transcription in colon carcinomas might take place in conjunction with altered regulation of the CREB complex. Further complexity is indicated by our finding that AhR binding to the &#x02212;219/&#x0002b;7 <italic>FSCN1</italic> promoter region also regulates promoter activity. AhR is best known for its roles in pathways of metabolism of environmental chemicals, such as dioxin, to toxic or carcinogenic intermediates. Roles of AhR in the regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell adhesion and migration are now emerging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005130-Barouki1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. These activities have been proposed to contribute to the progression of mammary tumours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005130-Schlezinger1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Ligand-independent AhR up-regulation has been documented in tumours and linked with promotion of cell proliferation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005130-Yang1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>). Similar to CREB, AhR functions in the context of transcriptional coactivators or corepressors: it will be of future interest to identify the upstream signaling mechanisms by which CREB and AhR binding to the <italic>FSCN1</italic> promoter are activated in carcinoma cells.</p><p>We also analysed the possible link between &#x003b2;-catenin signaling and <italic>FSCN1</italic> promoter activity. This pathway has been proposed for a number of years but, to date, has only been analysed with reference to the mouse <italic>fascin-1</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005130-Grothey1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005130-Vignjevic1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although multiple candidate TCF binding sites can be identified in the individual mouse or human <italic>fascin-1</italic> promoter sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005130-Grothey1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005130-Vignjevic1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>; our observations), phylogenomic analysis of conserved motifs demonstrates that, in fact, only one TCF site is conserved between primates and mice. This site is located at the proposed transcriptional start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005130-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, motif 9 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005130-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Experimentally, we found that an inactivating point mutation of this site altered &#x02212;219/&#x0002b;114 <italic>FSCN1</italic> promoter reporter activity in SW480 cells but did not affect promoter activity in COS-7 cells. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation for &#x003b2;-catenin carried out in both fascin-positive and negative- human colon carcinoma cells demonstrated that an association of &#x003b2;-catenin with the endogenous &#x02212;219/&#x0002b;114 promoter region did <italic>not</italic> correlate with fascin protein levels. The specificity of this result was confirmed by examination of a more distal region containing a TCF binding motif conserved between human, chimpanzee and dog, for which no specific association of &#x003b2;-catenin was detected in either cell type. Overall, these data do not support the hypothesis that &#x003b2;-catenin signaling specifically regulates fascin expression in human carcinoma cells. The role of &#x003b2;-catenin in constitutive association with the <italic>FSCN1</italic> promoter is unclear at this time. However, &#x003b2;-catenin has been demonstrated to participate in transcription factor complexes that include additional components, such as CBP/p300, that exhibit both transcriptional repressor and activation properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005130-Li1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>: we speculate that such an alternative complex may represent the context of &#x003b2;-catenin associated with the <italic>FSCN1</italic> promoter.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have identified that the conserved CREB and AhR binding motifs within the promoter region of the <italic>fascin-1</italic> gene are major and specific determinants of transcriptional activity, and that the association of these transcription factors with the corresponding <italic>FSCN1</italic> promoter region is specifically elevated in fascin-positive human colon carcinoma cells.
