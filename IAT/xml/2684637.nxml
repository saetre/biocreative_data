Since NKX2-5 transcription factor is one of the earliest genes expressed in the heart cells we hypothesized that &#x003b2;-catenin might be regulated by NKX2-5 in cardiac myocytes. Analysis of promoter regions identified candidate NKX2-5 binding elements (NKEs) in <italic>&#x003b2;-catenin</italic> and <italic>GATA4</italic> genes. To test if &#x003b2;-catenin and GATA4 are regulated by NKX2-5, endogenous NKX2-5 expression was knocked down by expressing antisense NKX2-5 RNA (XKN) in human fetal ventricular myocytes. This study shows that &#x003b2;-catenin and GATA4 transcription factors are regulated by NKE sequences in the promoter region of these genes. In addition, we confirm direct physical interactions between NKX2-5 and NKEs in the promoters of &#x003b2;-catenin and GATA4 as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and luciferase promoter assays. This study supports the essential role of NKX2-5 in maintaining the cardiac gene expression program and suggests direct regulation of &#x003b2;-catenin and GATA4 by NKX2-5 in human cardiomyocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Identification of NKX2-5 binding sites in the promoters of &#x003b2;-catenin and GATA4 genes</p><p>The genomic sequence surrounding the first exons of human <italic>&#x003b2;-catenin</italic> and <italic>GATA4</italic> genes were searched for NKX2-5-binding consensus sequence (NKE), TNAAGTG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005698-Chen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, using TFSEARCH.

Identification of genes downstream of Nkx2-5 is therefore crucial in understanding the transcriptional network that regulates cardiac myogenesis. Following identification of candidate NKEs in the promoter of <italic>GATA4</italic> and <italic>&#x003b2;-catenin</italic> genes; using EMSA and ChIP, we demonstrated that Nkx2-5 binds to the region surrounding identified sequences. Furthermore, gene reporter assay revealed that the regions encompassing NKEs were functional and that base change or deletion of the NKEs resulted in either reduction or complete loss of activation or repression of the promoter activity when Nkx2-5 was co-expressed in COS7 cells. The data presented here indicates that NKX2-5 negatively regulates &#x003b2;-catenin in cardiac myocytes. &#x003b2;-catenin activation is the hallmark of canonical Wnt pathway (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005698-Eisenberg1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>). Both Wnts and Wnt inhibitors are expressed in the developing heart suggesting a requirement for regulated Wnt signaling. At early stages of development in mouse embryos &#x003b2;-catenin directly regulates Islet1 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005698-Lin1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, a gene essential for the development of cardiac cells in the secondary heart field, and therefore, &#x003b2;-catenin is essential for development of cardiac cells that originate from the secondary heart field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005698-Qyang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In mouse embryonic stem cells Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin appears to have a biphasic role as it enhances cardiogenesis at early stages of differentiation while conversely inhibiting cardiogenesis at later stages of development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005698-Ueno1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The inhibitory function of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin in cardiogenesis is supported by several lines of evidence such as formation of multiple hearts in mice in which &#x003b2;-catenin is ablated in the endoderm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005698-Lickert1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, and the blockage of cardiogenesis when Wnt-3A or Wnt-8C are ectopically expressed in the precardiac mesoderm of chicken and xenopus embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005698-Marvin1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results add to these findings and suggest that &#x003b2;-catenin expression is repressed in cardiac myocytes at least at the gestational ages tested and that this transcriptional repression is mediated by Nkx2-5. Previous studies have suggested the presence of a transcriptional repressor domain at the carboxyl-terminus of Nkx2-5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005698-Chen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005698-Kasahara1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> that may mediate the repressor activity of Nkx2-5 on &#x003b2;-catenin gene expression shown in this study. Repression of genes such as connexins 40 and 43 in murine cardiomyocytes overexpressing Nkx2-5 has been shown in other studies but the molecular nature and the possible co-factors involved are not identified. Transcriptional repression has also been demonstrated for other cardiac-associated factors such as GATA4/FOG2 complex directly repressing Lhx9 gene in the heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005698-Smagulova1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, examination of &#x003b2;-catenin RNA level in Nkx2-5 heterozygous hearts (reduced Nkx2-5) revealed an increase in &#x003b2;-catenin RNA which was in agreement with our <italic>in vitro</italic> data. A recent study has shown that activation of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin downregulates Hdac1, a suppressor of Nkx2-5 and GATA4 in cardiomyocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005698-Liu1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, in Nkx2-5 heterozygous hearts, higher levels of &#x003b2;-catenin could increase Nkx2-5 and GATA4 via downregulation of Hdac1. It is note worthy that in Nkx2-5 heterozygous hearts the level of Nkx2-5 is not exactly half as compared to the wild type hearts. Further study is required to delineate the regulation of &#x003b2;-catenin in cardiac myocytes originated from primary (e.g. left ventricle) or secondary (e.g. right ventricle) heart fields and at different developmental stages.</p><p>Moreover, our study indicated the direct regulation of GATA4 by NKX2-5 in human fetal cardiac myocytes.

GATA4 RNA level in Nkx2-5<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> embryos, however, was unexpectedly upregulated. We reason that this upregulation represents a complex regulation of GATA4 transcription factor during development. Since GATA4 begins to express in cardiac progenitor cells prior to Nkx2-5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005698-Brewer1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, its expression may be controlled by unknown factors that are upregulated in the Nkx2-5 heterozygous hearts due to a compensatory mechanism, and therefore, higher expression of GATA4 in the Nkx2-5 heterozygous hearts may be essential to maintain Nkx2-5 above a threshold level necessary for the normal development of the heart.</p><p>Overall, our study proposes a model where Nkx2-5 negatively regulates &#x003b2;-catenin and positively regulates GATA4 in cardiomyocytes, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005698-g007">figure 7</xref>.
