Established amplification techniques rely on sophisticated instrumentation, such as temperature-regulating equipment or complex sample-handling procedures. While unproblematic for specialised laboratories, these requirements have hampered the uptake of nucleic acid analyses in point-of-use and field settings. The technology presented in this study, recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), overcomes the technical difficulties posed by current DNA amplification methods. It does not require thermal denaturation of template and operates at a low and constant temperature. In combination with a novel probe-based detection approach, RPA constitutes a significant advance in the development of portable and widely accessible nucleic acid&#x02013;based tests.</p><p>In RPA, the isothermal amplification of specific DNA fragments is achieved by the binding of opposing oligonucleotide primers to template DNA and their extension by a DNA polymerase ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040204-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Global melting of the template is not required for the primers to be directed to their complementary target sequences. Instead, RPA employs recombinase-primer complexes to scan double-stranded DNA and facilitate strand exchange at cognate sites &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040204-b001">1</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040204-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. The resulting structures are stabilised by single-stranded DNA binding proteins interacting with the displaced template strand, thus preventing the ejection of the primer by branch migration &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040204-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Recombinase disassembly leaves the 3&#x02032;-end of the oligonucleotide accessible to a strand displacing DNA polymerase, in this case the large fragment of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacillus subtilis</named-content> Pol I (Bsu, &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040204-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;), and primer extension ensues. Exponential amplification is accomplished by the cyclic repetition of this process. The key to RPA is the establishment of a dynamic reaction environment that balances the formation and disassembly of recombinase-primer filaments ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040204-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The recombinase we have employed, T4 uvsX, binds cooperatively to oligonucleotides in the presence of ATP. The resulting nucleoprotein complex actively hydrolyses ATP, and spontaneous recombinase disassembly in the ADP-bound state can lead to its replacement by T4 gp32, a single-stranded DNA binding protein necessary for the reaction. We found that a unique combination of T4 uvsY, a recombinase loading factor &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040204-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;, and a particular crowding agent (Carbowax20M) establishes favourable reaction conditions that support RPA (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">Protocol S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figures S1</xref> to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">S3</xref>). The proteins used in our approach are central components of in vivo processes required for cellular DNA synthesis, recombination, and repair and have been the subject of intensive research for a number of years &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040204-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition to facilitating DNA amplification in the RPA context, the dynamic reaction environment described here provides a system for the in vitro study of the recombination machinery and will aid the development of laboratory procedures that replace conventional hybridisation techniques. </p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><p>We applied the RPA process to a wide variety of targets in complex DNA templates. The versatility and specificity of the technology are exemplified by the amplification of three genetic markers, apolipoprotein B (apoB), sex-determining region Y (Sry), and porphobilinogen deaminase (PBDG), from complex human genomic DNA ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040204-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). While the negative controls did not produce a signal, clean amplification products of the correct identity ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg004">Figure S4</xref>) were generated in each template-containing sample. </p><p>The progression of RPA reactions can be monitored in real-time by the inclusion of a sensitive nucleic acid dye ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040204-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040204-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Here, primers for a locus in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. subtilis</named-content> genome have been used. The amplification of DNA proved to be exponential over a wide range of template concentrations and results were obtained in less than 30 min. The onset of amplification depends linearly on the logarithm of the starting number of template copies. Reactions carried out in the absence of template or at low template concentrations eventually generated a nonspecific signal, an effect brought about by a primer-dependent artefact ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040204-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, water control). </p><p>To devise a highly sensitive RPA detection system that is not affected by primer artefacts, we developed a probe-based detection method ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040204-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). The probe we use contains a tetrahydrofuran abasic&#x02013;site mimic (THF) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040204-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, flanked in close proximity by nucleotides modified with a fluorophore and a quencher. The fluorescence of the intact construct is low. A block at the 3&#x02032;-end prevents the oligonucleotide from acting as an amplification primer. Pairing of the probe to complementary DNA enables the recognition of the THF by the double-strand&#x02013;specific <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> endonuclease IV (Nfo) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040204-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. The need for formation of a stable DNA duplex acts as an additional specificity-proofreading step in the context of our detection approach. Subsequent cutting of the probe separates the fluorophore/quencher complex and leads to a measurable increase in fluorescence. The cleavage reaction generates a free 3&#x02032; OH-end on the 5&#x02032; remnant of the incised probe. This oligomer can then be elongated by Bsu polymerase, thus serving as an amplification primer. </p><p>To demonstrate the performance of combined RPA and probe/nuclease-based read-out, we designed primers and probes for the detection of the common hospital pathogen methicillin-resistant <named-content content-type="genus-species">Staphylococcus aureus</named-content> (MRSA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040204-g003">Figure 3</xref>B) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040204-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. The sensitivity and reproducibility of RPA were explored by the amplification of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome <italic>mec</italic> (SCC <italic>mec</italic>) integration locus of the isoform MRSAIII ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040204-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">Protocol S1</xref> for sequences). The onset of amplification at identical starting template quantities of ten, 100, 1,000, or 10,000 copies was virtually simultaneous, demonstrating the robustness of the technique. A plot of the time of beginning amplification against the logarithm of starting copy number reveals a linear relationship ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040204-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). At low template amounts (two copies), the amplification times are distributed over a wider period, with one reaction failing to generate a signal at all, and the correlation between onset of amplification and template concentration breaks down. However, product detection in samples with such low template concentrations supports the notion that RPA can essentially attain single template copy sensitivity. </p><p>The high sensitivity and specificity of RPA allow the design of a multiplex approach in which different amplicons are generated and detected in the same reaction. Three polymorphic alleles of the SCC <italic>mec</italic> integration region represent the vast majority of known MRSA genotypes (MRSAI through III; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040204-g005">Figure 5</xref>A) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040204-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. While they share the genomic locus <italic>orfX</italic>, they differ in the sequence of the SCC <italic>mec</italic>. The integrating elements of MRSAI and II are homologous to each other except for a 102&#x02013;base-pair insertion/deletion, while the MRSAIII SCC <italic>mec</italic> is highly divergent. A primer shared by all alleles was designed for the common region (orfX), whereas primers specific for MRSAI/II and MRSAIII target the different SCC <italic>mec</italic> variants (sccI/II and III, respectively). To ensure detection of all three isoforms, we designed two highly homologous probes (to account for polymorphisms) for the common region (SATamra1 and SATamra2). Fusing the target sequences for the primers sccIII and orfX to an unrelated DNA sequence created an internal control for the reaction. To verify the activity of each sample, the amplification of this construct was monitored simultaneously with that of the MRSA targets using another probe of appropriate sequence and bearing a different fluorophore/quencher pair (BSFlc). We employed this combination of primers and probes to detected ten genomic copies of the three MRSA types ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040204-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). By contrast, the closely related methicillin-sensitive <named-content content-type="genus-species">Staphylococcus aureus</named-content> (MSSA; 10 <sup>4</sup> copies) serving as a negative control did not generate a signal, despite being amplified by suitable primers (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg005">Figure S5</xref>). The internal control was concomitantly detected in all samples. </p><p>The combination of RPA and the described nuclease-sensitive fluorophore/quencher probes constitutes a DNA amplification/detection system that would require no other equipment than a simple handheld fluorometer, thus making quantitative DNA testing potentially accessible in a nonlaboratory point-of-care environment. We devised an even simpler detection approach by employing lateral-flow dipstick technology. This system is often used as a simple disposable diagnostic device. It employs pairs of specific antibodies to immobilise and detect entities containing two antigenic labels ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040204-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). Reaction mixtures (see below) are applied to a sample pad soaked in visible gold particles that are coupled to an antibody recognising one antigen. The complexes then travel in a buffer stream through the membrane and an additional, immobilised antibody captures the second antigen. If the antigens are conjoined in a DNA duplex, a coloured line appears at a defined location on the strip. A second line of immobilised antibodies captures the gold-conjugated antibody directly, whether conjoined to the other antigen or not, and serves as a flow control for the strip. In a variation of our probe detection system, we produced such dual antigen complexes by coupling biotin- and carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-bearing oligonucleotides in RPA amplicons ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040204-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). The 5&#x02032;-biotinylated primer and its opposing counterpart ensure the efficient amplification of a target for probe binding. The probe, including a 5&#x02032;-FAM label, an internal THF, and a 3&#x02032;-blocking group, is incised by Nfo upon binding, creating a 3&#x02032; OH substrate for elongation by Bsu. The extension of the probe remnant stabilises its interaction with the biotin-labeled opposing strand and produces an amplicon that contains both antigens, biotin and FAM. The THF/3&#x02032; block prevents the production of biotin/FAM-containing primer artefacts, as processing of bona fide duplexes by Nfo adds a critical proofreading step. We used a multiplex approach similar to the one employed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040204-g005">Figure 5</xref> to detect ten copies of each of the three MRSA isoforms and distinguish them from MSSA ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040204-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). As before, we designed two highly homologous probes (to account for polymorphisms) for the common region (Lfs1 and Lfs2). RPA reactions were followed by the application of the reaction mixtures to the sample pads of lateral-flow strips. Samples containing the MRSA template created biotin/FAM-amplicons and generated visible signals on the antibiotin detection line. In contrast, the MSSA-containing negative control failed to produce a conjoined complex and gave rise to the flow-control line only. </p><p>A number of research and clinical applications could benefit from employing RPA. Perhaps most obviously, the technology offers a significant breakthrough for the development of nonlaboratory devices. When integrated with handheld instruments or entirely equipment-free DNA detection systems, RPA will enable an easy-to-use testing system for a variety of pathogens as well as field kits for other applications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Proteins and DNA.</title><p>Coding sequences for uvsx, uvsy, gp32, Bsu, and Nfo were amplified from genomic DNA (DSMZ, Braunschweig Germany), fused to hexahistidine-tags (N-terminal for uvsY, Bsu, and Nfo, C-terminal for uvsX and gp32), and cloned into suitable expression vectors.

And 3,000 copies of target served as template in 30-&#x003bc;l reactions (per sample the equivalent of 10-&#x003bc;l reaction volume was loaded on the gel). The finding that a primer length of greater than 28 bases is required to support RPA is in good agreement with reports that investigated the ATP hydrolysis activity of uvsX-oligonucleotide filaments at different oligonucleotide sizes &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040204-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>(17 KB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.0040204.sg003.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sg004"><label>Figure S4</label><caption><title>Restriction Digest of RPA Products</title><p>Agarose gel electrophoresis of RPA reactions and their digestion products. Primers for the human loci apoB (primers apoB4, apoB300), Sry (primers sry3, sry4), and PBDG (primers pbdg5, pbdg6) were used. Reactions were performed at 37 &#x000b0;C for 60 min, and conditions used were 50 mM Tris (pH 7.9), 100 mM potassium acetate, 14 mM magnesium acetate, 2 mM DTT, 5&#x00025; Carbowax20M, 200 &#x003bc;M dNTPs, 3 mM ATP, 300 nM each primer, 50 mM phosphocreatine, 100 ng/&#x003bc;l creatine kinase, and 30 ng/&#x003bc;l Bsu. Recombinase protein concentrations were 900 ng/&#x003bc;l gp32, 120 ng/&#x003bc;l uxsX, and 30 ng/&#x003bc;l uvsY. And 1,000 copies of human genomic DNA served as template. Reactions were performed in 40-&#x003bc;l volumes and purified using GenElute Clean-Up kits (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, United States). Ten percent of each reaction (equivalent to 4-&#x003bc;l RPA reaction) was either loaded directly (uncut) or after digestion with XbaI (apoB and Sry), HaeIII (apoB), or SmaI (PBDG) on a 2&#x00025; agarose gel. The restriction pattern confirms the identity of the amplicons. Note that the amplicon generated by apoB4 and apoB300 includes an SNP covering the XbaI site. Since the template used is a combination of genomic DNA from several donors (Promega), the apoB RPA product consists of a mixture of fragments that either contain an XbaI site or are refractory to XbaI digestion.</p><p>(92 KB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.0040204.sg004.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sg005"><label>Figure S5</label><caption><title>Probe Signal of RPA Reactions Using the Primer Set orfX/MSSA and Probe SATamra2</title><p>(A) MSSA DNA at 10 <sup>4</sup> (black, reactions 1&#x02013;3), 10 <sup>3</sup> (red, 4&#x02013;6), 100 (yellow, 7&#x02013;9), ten (green, 10&#x02013;12), or two (purple, 13&#x02013;17) copies or MRSAI DNA at 10 <sup>4</sup> copies (gray, reactions 18&#x02013;20) or water (blue, 21&#x02013;23) served as template.
