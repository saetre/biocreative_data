Based on criteria that describe the time after infarction we were able to pinpoint that C4BP binding is a relatively early marker of tissue damage in myocardial infarction with a peak of binding between 12 hours and 5 days subsequent to AMI, the phase in which infiltration of neutrophilic granulocytes in the heart is the most extensive.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>C4BP, an important fluid-phase inhibitor of the classical and lectin pathway of complement activation binds to jeopardized cardiomyocytes early after AMI and co-localizes to other well known markers such as C3b.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>During the course of several cardiovascular events cell death occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Krijnen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The presence of dead cells not only impairs the function of tissues but also forms a rich source of inflammatory mediators and autoantigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Chen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Rock1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the major causes of mortality and morbidity in the western world. Arrhythmia, cardiac rupture and acute heart failure comprise the main events leading to mortality whereas chronic heart failure is the leading cause for morbidity. If the myocardium is deprived of perfusion for several hours, prolonged ischemia results in permanent loss of function through cell death by apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Krijnen2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Mocanu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In case reperfusion is achieved within this time frame than the extent of cell death is limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Farb1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. However, reperfusion as such is not just beneficial but may also have adverse effects. Cells suffer from this reperfusion, which may lead to irreversible injury, thought to occur via apoptosis and inflammation related necrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Saraste1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Complicated interactions, between ischemic or dead cardiomyocytes and inflammatory cells, cytokines, acute phase proteins and complement components result in the pathologies observed in AMI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Nijmeijer1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The involvement of the complement system in AMI has been concluded from both animal models and human studies where the affected areas in the heart stained positive for several complement components, including C1q, mannose-binding lectin, C3 and C5b-9. Based on these and other observations it was concluded that all three pathways of complement activation participate in the process. Although the complement system often contributes to the tissue damage it is not easy to discriminate this from the beneficial effects of complement in terms of waste disposal.</p><p>C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase protein in humans and it was reported to be (in part) responsible for the complement activation in AMI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Lagrand1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Wolbink1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. CRP constitutes a strong cardiovascular risk factor since its plasma levels in both healthy individuals and in patients correlate with occurrence of AMI and are also predictive for the progression of disease once AMI occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Hirschfield1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. CRP has been reported to activate the classical pathway of complement by binding C1q <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Jiang1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed CRP has been shown to be co-localized to these areas of the heart that are positive for complement deposits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Lagrand1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. CRP may bind to dead cardiocytes via lyso-phosphatidylcholine that is generated from phosphatidylcholine by phospholipase A<sub>2</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Krijnen2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. We have recently shown that cell death by itself carries the potential to activate the complement system, both in the presence or absence of CRP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Trouw1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The complement system has very powerful effects and is therefore kept under control by both membrane bound and soluble complement inhibitors. We have shown previously that one of these fluid-phase complement inhibitors, C4b-binding protein (C4BP) binds to dead cells and provides protection against excessive complement activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Trouw2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Webb2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Also by binding DNA on and released from dead cells it inhibits an inflammatory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Trouw2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. C4BP is present in serum mostly as a complex with anti-coagulant protein S (C4BP-PS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Blom1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> bound to a beta-chain that together with seven alpha-chains forms one C4BP molecule. Protein S has a high affinity for negatively charged phospholipids and is the module of the C4BP-PS complex that is responsible for most of the binding to apoptotic and necrotic cells. The alpha-chains contain the complement inhibitory capacity and present activated complement components C4b and C3b to factor I for degradation. These alpha-chains also contain the DNA binding site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Trouw2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In the current study we have investigated whether C4BP binds to compromised cardiomyocytes in relation to cardiovascular events. Here we describe that C4BP forms deposits in the heart in several cardiovascular diseases, but based on both the intensity of depositions and the frequency of positivity it is mostly observed in AMI. In AMI lesions it is correlated to areas also positive for C3b. Binding of C4BP to cardiomyocytes peaks, like C3b, between 12 hours and 5 days after the infarction, during the phase in which infiltration of neutrophilic granulocytes in the heart is the most extensive.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>Samples were obtained from patients who had died following cardiovascular events and were collected in line with the institutional guidelines of the VU Medical Center in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

The samples for the tissue arrays were selected based on detailed evaluation of the autopsy reports followed by clinical and histological confirmation. Aorta stenosis, a condition that results in pressure overload induced myocardial hypertrophy, was based on clinical and morphological data (confirmed at autopsy). The hypertrophy group was selected based on increased myocardial mass. This is a heterogeneous group with hypertrophy caused by several underlying conditions including arterial hypertension, ischemic heart disease and left sided valvular leaks with potential overlap between the conditions. We excluded hearts with suspected obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</p><p>In a separate study tissue samples were stained histochemically allowing correlation between positivity of C4BP and the stage of AMI as well as presence of C3b determined by immunohistochemistry.

For quantitative studies in AMI paraffin embedded tissue sections (4 &#x000b5;m thick) were mounted on microscope slides and deparaffinized for 10 minutes in xylene at room temperature and dehydrated through descending concentrations of ethanol. One set of sections was stained with hematoxylin and eosin using routine procedures. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation in 0.3&#x00025; (v/v) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in methanol for 30 minutes. Tissue sections were subjected to antigen retrieval by boiling in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6, for 10 minutes in a microwave oven. All antibodies and normal, pre-immune serum were diluted in PBS containing 1&#x00025; (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA). Tissue sections were pre-incubated for 10 minutes with normal swine serum, followed by incubation for 1 hour with C4BP antibodies. The antibodies were raised in rabbits against highly purified human C4BP-PS complex (kind gift from Prof. Dahlb&#x000e4;ck, Lund University, Sweden). The antibodies from rabbit serum were first purified using protein A and protein G columns (GE Healthcare) coupled in tandem followed by affinity purification using a column (Affi-gel 10, Biorad) with covalently coupled human C4BP-PS. After washing in PBS tissue sections were incubated for 30 minutes with a biotin-conjugated swine anti-rabbit secondary antibody (DAKO). After washing in PBS slides were incubated with streptavidin&#x02013;biotin complex (DAKO) for 1 hour. After the incubation with streptavidin&#x02013;biotin complex C4BP was visualized with 3,3&#x02032;-diaminobenzidine (0.1 mg/ml, 0.02&#x00025; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Staining for deposition of C3b was performed using mouse mAb C3-15 (kind gift from Prof Hack, The Netherlands) which recognizes the C3d fragment of C3b exactly as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Lagrand1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Collectively these data indicate that complement is activated on the affected heart tissue, including deposition of C4 and C3b up to the formation of the membrane attack complex and that C4BP, which is deposited strongly in the affected and weakly in the close unaffected area, could function as a protective factor by inhibiting excessive complement activation.</p><fig id="pone-0002886-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002886.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>C4, C3b and C9 are also present on the affected tissue.</title><p>Representative pictures of consecutive sections of heart tissue of an AMI sample stained for C4, C3b, C9 and C4BP or with secondary antibody only (PBS).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0002886.g004"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Cultured cardiomyocytes bind C4BP mainly following cell death</title><p>As a model for human cardiocytes we have used rat cardiomyocyte cell line H<sub>9</sub>C<sub>2</sub>.

C4BP was shown previously to bind to dead cells and provide protection against excessive complement activation and inflammation otherwise evoked by these cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Trouw1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Webb2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. C4BP as a complement inhibitor limits complement activation but does not provide a complete block <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Blom1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed this is what we also observed in the current study, C4BP co-localizes with C4, C3b and C9 in the damaged heart tissue, which indicates that in the presence of C4BP there is still complement activation, but it would have been much more extensive if C4BP was lacking as we have shown previously for other cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Trouw2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The observation that C4BP is found on the surrounding tissue in the absence of C3b may indicate that the levels of complement inhibition by C4BP are sufficient there to protect against complement activation but not in the larger infarct areas. To firmly establish the relative importance of C4BP in these lesions one would have to use animal models of AMI, using C4BP deficient animals.</p><p>Although the complement system contributes to the tissue damage it is not easy to discriminate this from the beneficial effects of complement in terms of waste disposal. Nonetheless, experiments using complement deficient animals and complement inhibiting drugs revealed reduced infarction size in the absence of complement activation indicating that complement does contribute to pathology (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Nijmeijer1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>). Complement activation can have several effects on the infarcted heart, e.g. lysis of cells by means of the membrane attack complex, release of C5a that attracts neutrophils but it can also influence the function of the myocardium itself. Several studies have found activated complement components on myocardium especially after sufficient time of infarct duration of more than 12 hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Lagrand1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Niessen1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Both C4BP and factor H have been reported to play a role in cardiovascular disease such as atherosclerosis. C4BP is present and inhibits classical pathway activity in atherosclerotic lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Oksjoki1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and in the necrotic areas of advanced atherosclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Trouw2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Factor H has also been located in atherosclerotic lesions and has been implicated as a protective factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Oksjoki2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. In the atherosclerotic plaques synthesis of complement factors is upregulated but not that of complement inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Yasojima1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> indicating that most likely the inhibitors are localized there from blood.</p><p>Both C3b and CRP have been observed in the same binding pattern as C4BP, with a cytoplasmic staining and cross-striation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Lagrand1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. This may indicate that these proteins are in fact located both on the outside and on the inside of these cells. For CRP it was reported that it does not stain nuclear elements and it seems that also C4BP staining does not reveal a staining for nuclear elements, which is interesting since both CRP and C4BP are reported to bind DNA. The binding of C4BP to dead cells in the heart tissue may be easily explained by the binding of the C4BP-PS complex to phosphatidylserine, as we reported before for other cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Trouw2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002886-Webb2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the binding of C4BP to seemingly healthy tissue surrounding the dead area is less clear, either these cells have undergone a certain extend of membrane reorganization or flip-flop that allows the binding of the C4BP-PS complex. Another possibility would be that hypoxic cells show increased binding of C4BP but we only observed a small increase in C4BP binding at high C4BP concentrations. However, it is clear that C4BP binding in these areas is not dependent on its ligands complement C4b and C3b since they are absent from these areas.</p><p>To our knowledge C4BP has not been used to treat or prevent pathology in the context of cardiovascular disease, whereas supra-normal levels of C4BP may provide a relatively safe approach. Clearly more studies are needed before such experimentation can be translated into a clinically useful approach.</p><p>In conclusion: in this study we provide evidence that fluid-phase complement inhibitor C4BP binds to compromised heart tissue. The deposition is strongest in AMI compared to aorta stenosis and ischemic heart disease and it takes place during the inflammatory phase of AMI. C4BP positivity extends beyond the area positive for C3b, which suggests that C4BP is a functional complement inhibitor in AMI and limits complement activation to the most affected tissue.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We greatly appreciate the excellent technical support of Ms. Elise Nilsson regarding immunohistology, Prof. Bj&#x000f6;rn Dahlb&#x000e4;ck (Lund University) for
