Visual signals are initiated by photoreceptors, modulated by horizontal, bipolar, and amacrine cells, and transmitted to the brain through the axons of ganglion cells. Retinal neurons, like other neurons in the central nervous system, are terminally differentiated and do not reenter the cell cycle for proliferation. Thus, degenerated retinal neurons are not automatically replaced. In the teleost retina, both progenitor/stem cells at the ciliary marginal zone and M&#x000fc;ller glia in the retina can give rise to new retinal cells in response to injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. Chick M&#x000fc;ller glia have also been shown to exhibit some properties of retinal stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. Nonetheless, such an inborn stem-cell-based regeneration mechanism seems elusive in the retina of higher vertebrates. As a result, attention in recent years has been directed toward inducing retinal neurogenesis through programming or reprogramming the differentiation of cells that can be propagated in large numbers in vitro, including embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells of the brain, retina, or bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>].</p><p>Unlike retinal neurons, retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells from many species, including human, can reenter the cell cycle. More importantly, their progeny are able to differentiate into cell types other than RPE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>], suggesting the possibility of RPE serving as retinal stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. The idea of using RPE cell cultures as a novel source of developing retinal neurons has been experimentally explored. Most of the published reports examined genes/factors that are involved in the production of photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>] or ganglion cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>].</p><p>A large number of studies have shown that <italic>ash1</italic>, a vertebrate homolog of the Drosophila proneural gene <italic>achaete</italic>-<italic>scute</italic>, exhibits proneural activity during the development of both the central and peripheral nervous systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>], where <italic>ash1</italic> promotes neurogenesis against gliogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. <italic>Ash1</italic> encodes a transcription factor of the basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix family. In the retina, expression of <italic>ash1</italic> is restricted to progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>]. In the mouse, <italic>ash1</italic> is required in the production of late-born neurons, including rod photoreceptors and bipolar cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. In <italic>ash1</italic>;<italic>ath3</italic> double knockouts, the production of bipolar cells is virtually abolished [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. However, misexpression of <italic>ash1</italic> or <italic>ath3</italic> alone does not promote bipolar cell genesis, but co-misexpression of <italic>ash1</italic>, <italic>ath3</italic>, and <italic>chx10</italic> increases bipolar cell number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. Transgenic expression of <italic>ash1</italic> in mouse RPE initiates retinal neurogenesis in the RPE cell layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>]. In the chick, the temporal and spatial pattern of <italic>ash1</italic> expression coincides with amacrine cell genesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>], and overexpression of <italic>ash1</italic> expands the amacrine population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>].</p><p>Making use of RPE cells&#x02019; plasticity and the suggested roles of <italic>ash1</italic> in the production of retinal progenitor cells and amacrine cells, we studied the possibility of coaxing cultured RPE cells with <italic>ash1</italic> into differentiating along retinal neural pathways. Our experiments demonstrate neural differentiation at the molecular, morphological, and physiologic levels in the otherwise non-neural RPE cell cultures infected with a retrovirus expressing <italic>ash1</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chick embryos</title><p>Fertilized, pathogen-free White Leghorn chicken eggs were purchased from Spafas (Preston, CT) and incubated in a Petersime egg incubator (Gettysburg, OH).

Next, cells were incubated with fluo-4 AM as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>] in 1&#x000a0;ml of bath solution for 15 min at room temperature. After a brief rinsing and then incubation with the bath solution for 30 min at room temperature, the culture dish was placed under an Olympus BX60 microscope with constant perfusion with the bath solution at a rate of 1&#x000a0;ml per minute at room temperature. Fluorescence images were captured sequentially without time interval with 400&#x000a0;ms-exposure for each image. Captured images were analyzed with WCFI <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uhnresearch.ca/facilities/wcif/download.php">ImageJ</ext-link> software. Briefly, a region of interest covering the soma of a cell was selected in stacked images. A region of the same shape and area was also selected from the background for background subtraction.

The cells were assayed for functional glutamate receptors. Glutamate is a common neurotransmitter in the retina, and its receptors are either ionotropic or metabotropic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r60">60</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r62">62</xref>]. Ionotropic receptors include NMDA and non-NMDA receptors, varying in their selective agonists. NMDA receptors are permeable to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and their activation results in an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r62">62</xref>]. By comparison, most of the metabotropic receptors cause a decrease in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration when they are activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r62">62</xref>].</p><p>The development of functional glutamate receptors was assayed by examining Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration before and after the administration of glutamate or NDMA along with glycine, which acts as a co-agonist of the NMDA receptor and potentiates the NMDA-triggered response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r63">63</xref>]. Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration was monitored using fluo-4 AM coupled with fluorescence microscopy. We found that reprogrammed cells, particularly those with neural morphologies, responded to the administration of NMDA and glycine by increasing their Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). Increases in fluorescence intensity were detected a few seconds after the application of the neurotransmitters, indicative of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through calcium channels upon receptor activation. Fluorescence intensity peaked usually within15 s, quickly declined, and eventually reached pre-activation level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). The response was similar to that observed with retinal cells in culture. When the changes in fluorescence intensity (as &#x00394;F/Fo) were plotted over time, the responses to the neurotransmitters by reprogrammed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B,C</xref>) resembling the responses by retinal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D</xref>) was evident. Notably, the degree of response by different cells varied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B,C</xref>), likely due to varied extents of neural differentiation and varied physiologic conditions. Additionally, approximately 20% of the 86 cells subjected to the analysis showed responses.

The first sign of <italic>ash1</italic>-induced changes in RPE progeny cells was the altered appearance of the culture, in which the presumptive RPE cells were unable to regain pigmentation, and clusters of neuron-like cells emerged in the otherwise cobblestone-like arrangement. <italic>Ash1</italic>-induced reprogramming was evidenced by the development of elaborate cellular processes. Fluorescence microscopy after labeling the cells with fluo-4 AM or with AAV-GFP DNA transfection illustrated that the reprogrammed cells formed multiple processes, which are typical of horizontal, amacrine, or ganglion cells, but not photoreceptors or bipolar cells.</p><p>Immunostaining and in situ hybridization analyses showed the expression of genes/markers that identify different types of retinal neurons. The most prevalently expressed marker was calretinin, suggesting that a major product of <italic>ash1</italic>-induced reprogramming might be cells that resembled amacrine, horizontal, as well as ganglion cells. Ganglion-like cells, nonetheless, were unlikely to be the major product, because of the relatively moderate number of RA4<sup>+</sup> cells. Photoreceptor-like cells were unlikely to be the major product either, because most of the reprogrammed cells exhibited multiple processes, and a relatively moderate number of cells were IRBP<sup>+</sup> and a very small number of cells were red opsin<sup>+</sup>. There were a large number of visinin<sup>+</sup> cells in the <italic>ash1</italic>-reprogrammed RPE cell culture. However, the majority of them coexpressed calretinin, which indicates that, like in the retina where developing amacrine cells express photoreceptor-specific genes visinin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56">56</xref>,] and RxR&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r64">64</xref>], those amacrine-like cells also transiently expressed visinin. The absence of expression of bipolar marker <italic>ath3</italic> and <italic>chx10</italic> does not necessarily preclude the presence of bipolar-like cells in the reprogrammed cultures, as not all of the cell type-specific markers observed with retinal neurons are expressed in reprogrammed cells under experimental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r65">65</xref>]. Additionally, even though there were tens of thousands of calretinin<sup>+</sup> cells in <italic>ash1</italic>-induced reprogramming, no AP2&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> cells were observed. The partial gene expression may reflect partial cell differentiation due to microenvironment or to a lack of other factors necessary for advancing neuronal differentiation to maturation. Nonetheless, the morphologies of the reprogrammed cells were less indicative of differentiation toward bipolar-like cells than toward other secondary neurons. Thus, the results from both molecular analysis and morphological examination favor the scenario of <italic>ash1</italic> reprogramming RPE progeny cells to differentiate toward amacrine-like cells as a major product, along with photoreceptor-like, ganglion-like, and possibly horizontal-like cells as accompanying products. This scenario is consistent with the observation that in the chick retina <italic>ash1</italic> increases the amacrine cell population (data not shown).</p><p>Reprogrammed cells, especially those with multiple processes, responded to exogenous glutamate and the administration of NMDA+glycine by transiently increasing their intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. Their fluorescence intensity increased in the cell body and in processes seconds after administration of the neurotransmitters, suggesting a fast calcium influx through calcium channels upon activation of their receptors. After reaching its peak, the fluorescence intensity decreased quickly and eventually returned to the basal level, a profile closely resembling the response profiles of retinal neurons. This suggests the presence of functional, ionotropic glutamate receptors in the reprogrammed cells. Together, the evidence of neural differentiation at the molecular, morphological, and physiologic levels indicates that <italic>ash1</italic> can reprogram RPE progeny cells to differentiate as cells that resemble certain neurons of the retina.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Dr. Stephen Hughes for retroviral vector RCAS (B/P) and shuttle vector Cla12Nco, and Dr. Steven McLoon for RA4 monoclonal antibody.
