The identity of oxidative stress&#x02013;inducible transcription factors and their role in propagating the death cascade are not well known. In an in vitro model of oxidative stress, the expression of the bZip transcription factor activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) was induced by glutathione depletion and localized to the promoter of a putative death gene in neurons. Germline deletion of ATF4 resulted in a profound reduction in oxidative stress&#x02013;induced gene expression and resistance to oxidative death. In neurons, ATF4 modulates an early, upstream event in the death pathway, as resistance to oxidative death by ATF4 deletion was associated with decreased consumption of the antioxidant glutathione. Forced expression of ATF4 was sufficient to promote cell death and loss of glutathione. In ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neurons, restoration of ATF4 protein expression reinstated sensitivity to oxidative death. In addition, ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice experienced significantly smaller infarcts and improved behavioral recovery as compared with wild-type mice subjected to the same reductions in blood flow in a rodent model of ischemic stroke. Collectively, these findings establish ATF4 as a redox-regulated, prodeath transcriptional activator in the nervous system that propagates death responses to oxidative stress in vitro and to stroke in vivo.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: ATF4, activating transcription factor 4; BHA, butylated hydroxyanisol; BSO, buthionine sulfoximine; DCF, 2&#x02032;,7&#x02032;-dichlorofluorescin; &#x003b3;-GCS, &#x003b3;-glutamylcysteine synthetase; HCA, homocysteate; MAP2, microtubule-associated protein 2; MCAo, middle cerebral artery occlusion; MOI, multiplicity of infection; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TRB3, tribbles homologue 3.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Free radicals and their reactive metabolites (reactive oxygen species [ROS]) exist in neuronal cells and tissues at low but measurable concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). These tolerable equilibrium concentrations are the result of a tightly controlled balance between the rates of production and clearance, the latter being mediated by a team of antioxidants including enzymes and nonenzymatic compounds such as the tripeptide glutathione.</p><p>Cells or tissues are in a stable oxidative state if the rates of ROS production and scavenging capacity remain within a homeostatic range. However, if this balance is disturbed, either by an increase in ROS concentrations or a decrease in antioxidant activities, the response may not be sufficient to keep the system at a level compatible with survival. In such cases, oxidants can modify cellular targets, leading to cell dysfunction or death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Indeed, oxidative stress has been implicated in virtually all of the major acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>).</p><p>In many cells, including cortical neurons, the expression of genes with antioxidative activity is precisely controlled by a synergistic network of redox-sensing signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Specifically, aberrant levels of oxidants can trigger the transcriptional induction of antioxidative enzymes and other adaptive pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). The cellular response to oxidative stress is tightly controlled by a family of stress-responsive transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Among these transcription factors, the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)/cAMP response element binding protein 2 may be a key player (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). ATF4 is expressed constitutively only at low concentrations but becomes rapidly induced under particular cell-stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). ATF4 binds to the promoter regions of an array of different target genes, including many involved in amino acid metabolism and redox control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). In fibroblasts, ATF4 coordinates the response to amino acid depletion, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and helps to balance redox homeostasis. Indeed, ATF4-deficient fibroblasts have been shown to be prone to death after a host of stresses, including oxidative stress and amino acid deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, amino acid deprivation has been previously reported to be neuroprotective in an in vitro model of oxidative stress&#x02013;induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). This model employs immature cortical neurons and takes advantage of the absence of glutamate receptors at this stage of development to avoid excitotoxicity. Instead, addition of glutamate analogues competitively inhibits uptake of cyst(e)ine, the rate-limiting precursor for the tripeptide glutathione. The resulting decline in glutathione concentration is a primary event that leads to neuronal cell death from oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), a process that displays many features of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). This glutathione depletion model facilitates the separation of biochemical events that mediate death from those that are a consequence of death, and it is highly relevant to pathological conditions because an increase in cellular ROS production is often observed in apoptotic processes triggered by diverse stimuli associated with disease states. In this work, we define a novel prodeath role for ATF4 in neurons in vitro in response to oxidative stress and in vivo in response to stroke, a condition linked to oxidative stress.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Amino acid depletion and thapsigargin treatment induce ATF4 and protect embryonic cortical neurons from oxidative stress&#x02013;induced cell death</title><p>Amino acid depletion via the arginine-degrading enzyme arginase is a well-characterized strategy for protecting neurons from oxidative stress&#x02013;induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Studies in nonneural cells have shown that amino acid deprivation activates cell-survival pathways by activating the bZip transcription factor ATF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). We initiated our studies with the hypothesis that arginase is a multipotent inhibitor of apoptotic neuronal cell death by activating ATF4 and its downstream gene targets. Because endoplasmic reticulum stress by thapsigargin is also associated with increased ATF4 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), we examined the corollary hypothesis that this agent could initiate tolerance to oxidative stress in primary cortical neurons. As predicted, arginase and thapsigargin led to nearly complete protection from neuronal cell death (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>) and to accumulation of ATF4 protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>).

Moreover, in ATF4<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> neurons, ATF4 induction by treatment with HCA was a result of induction at the translational level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>).

Higher nuclear ATF4 activity after oxidative stress was demonstrated by showing higher promoter activity of an ATF4 target gene, tribbles homologue 3 (TRB3), that has been recently associated with cell death. TRB3 mRNA is induced upon HCA treatment in an ATF4-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref>). To characterize ATF4 binding on the promoter of TRB3, we generated a 2-kb fragment of the mouse TRB3 promoter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 H</xref>).

Microarray analysis in that study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) showed that several ATF4-regulated genes in fibroblasts are involved in amino acid import, glutathione biosynthesis, antioxidant defense, and DNA repair. In contrast, in neurons, ATF4 has classically been thought to act mainly as a transcriptional repressor. In this context, ATF4 has been hypothesized to negatively influence survival by repressing expression of genes that are otherwise activated by prosurvival transcriptional activators such as cAMP response element binding protein. To begin to examine whether ATF4 functions primarily as a repressor or activator in neurons and to determine the extent to which these ATF4-regulated genes function similarly in fibroblasts and neurons, we performed a global analysis of gene expression using microarrays in ATF4<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). More specifically, we assessed (a) the physiological genomic effect of ATF4 knockout (comparing ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> with ATF4<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> neurons), and (b) the effect of ATF4 knockout on the response to oxidative stress (comparing ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> with ATF4<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> neurons after HCA treatment; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). At the chosen statistical threshold (5% false discovery rate), 136 probes were down-regulated in ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> versus ATF4<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> neurons, compared with 53 that were up-regulated, suggesting a role for ATF4 as a transcriptional activator. Functional gene ontology categories overrepresented in this list include mitochondrion, oxidoreductase activity, and amino acid metabolism. Several of the down-regulated genes have been shown to be positively regulated by ATF4, including the prodeath gene TRB3. Comparison of ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> versus ATF4<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> neurons after oxidative stress with HCA treatment suggested a fundamental role of ATF4 in modulating oxidative stress&#x02013;induced gene expression. In fact, 119 probes are dysregulated in response to oxidative stress in ATF4<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> neurons, whereas only 3 change in ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neurons. Collectively, these findings suggest that ATF4 is a major upstream regulator of oxidative stress&#x02013;induced changes in gene expression. Additionally, for most genes in embryonic cortical neurons, ATF4 functions as an activator and not a repressor.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Gene expression array analysis of ATF4<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neurons before and after treatment with HCA.</bold> (A) Heatmap with cluster dendrogram of the differentially expressed genes (log2 fold change vs. control) at a false discovery rate of 5%.

This model has been successfully used to describe signaling pathways that prevent cell death downstream of glutathione depletion. However, in fibroblasts, ATF4 has been described as a positive regulator of glutathione metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Therefore, we performed glutathione measurements to determine whether ATF4 permits cell death in response to HCA by direct influence of the neuronal glutathione metabolism or by acting downstream of glutathione depletion. In untreated neurons, glutathione concentrations in ATF4<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neurons did not differ (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). As anticipated, HCA treatment caused a progressive loss of glutathione in ATF4<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> neurons. However, ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neurons displayed a markedly slower decline in glutathione concentration. To rule out the possibility that an increased rate of glutathione synthesis is responsible for decreased sensitivity to cystine deprivation&#x02013;induced glutathione depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), we used buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) to directly inhibit the rate-limiting enzyme of glutathione synthesis, &#x003b3;-glutamylcysteine synthetase (&#x003b3;-GCS; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>). BSO resulted in cell death in ATF4<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> neurons, whereas ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neurons were essentially resistant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, C and D</xref>). As expected from these results, &#x003b3;-GCS expression did not differ between ATF4<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neurons at the protein level and did not appear in the gene array (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 E</xref>). Similar to HCA, BSO treatment led to a decline in the concentration of glutathione in ATF4<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> neurons, whereas ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neurons displayed a distinctly slower reduction of glutathione (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 F</xref>). These findings are consistent with the notion that the differences in reduction of glutathione after HCA or BSO is not attributable to changes in synthesis. To determine whether ATF4 directly regulates the neuronal glutathione content, we measured glutathione in neurons with forced expression of ATF4WT, ATF4&#x00394;RK, and GFP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 G</xref>). Consistent with the finding that forced expression of ATF4WT can reduce neuronal viability, we found that this viability reduction correlates with a reduction in the neuronal glutathione content. Because cell death attributable to glutathione depletion can be completely blocked by a whole host of classical antioxidants, we combined forced expression of ATF4WT with butylated hydroxyanisol (BHA) treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, H and I</xref>). BHA is a well characterized antioxidant known to block HCA-induced cell death in cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). In fact, in neurons overexpressing ATF4WT, BHA significantly increased neuronal viability and protected against the additional toxic effect of HCA treatment.

These studies have led to the somewhat surprising conclusion that oxidants can trigger neuronal death via highly regulated signaling pathways and subsequent activation of prodeath transcription factors, leading to the controlled demise known as apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). The current study adds to our understanding of the cellular transcription factors that regulate neuronal viability and function after oxidative stress in primary cortical neurons. Specifically, we show that the transcription factor ATF4 is induced by oxidative stress caused by depletion of the major antioxidant tripeptide, glutathione. We further demonstrate that transgenic deletion of ATF4 renders neurons resistant to neuronal cell death. Prevention of cell death by germline knockout of ATF4 is associated with a preservation of glutathione levels, the primary mediator of death in our oxidative stress model. Consistent with ATF4's role in regulating an early, upstream aspect of the oxidative neuronal death pathway, we found that ATF4 deficiency causes global down-regulation of gene expression and blocks the up-regulation of many genes that are induced by oxidative stress in WT neurons. Accordingly, forced expression of ATF4 was sufficient to promote cell death and loss of glutathione. In addition, we demonstrate that in ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neurons, restoration of ATF4 protein expression reinstated sensitivity to oxidative death. We establish the relevance of protection by ATF4 deficiency by demonstrating that the ATF4 homozygous knockout is capable of protecting the adult mouse brain from stroke-induced injury and disability. Indeed, we show that ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals recover more easily and maintain proper motor function more efficiently. Although known to be a stress-responsive protein, these results for the first time establish ATF4 as a redox-regulated protein that can function to lower the threshold for oxidative stress&#x02013;induced death in neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>ATF4 is a redox-regulated transcription factor</title><p>Classically, stress-mediated enhancement of ATF4 levels is known to occur via enhanced efficiency of translation of constant levels of ATF4 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Consistent with this model, we found an up-regulation of ATF4 mRNA translational efficiency after glutathione depletion. However, we also observed an increase in ATF4 mRNA levels after oxidative stress, thereby confirming a recent report describing a role for transcriptional regulation in ATF4 induction by cell stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). The distinct increase in ATF4 protein levels in the nucleus of neurons undergoing oxidative stress corresponded to an ATF4-dependent induction of a TRB3 promoter-luciferase reporter. Collectively, these observations argue that oxidative stress&#x02013;induced changes in ATF4 mRNA levels and translational efficiency lead to increased ATF4 activity in neurons. Because ATF4 overexpression is sufficient to induce death, limiting the amount of ATF4, at least under basal conditions, seems to be necessary for neuronal survival. Mechanisms that control and limit basal ATF4 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>) appear to be important determinants of neuronal fate. Although this low level of ATF4 appears to be sufficient to regulate a host of genes, its absence does not grossly influence neuronal morphology or basal survival.</p></sec><sec><title>ATF4 has a direct impact on glutathione metabolism</title><p>Several converging lines of inquiry demonstrate a central role for glutathione metabolism in degeneration and aging in the nervous system. Our findings confirm the primary role that glutathione can play in neuronal death. However, the mechanisms by which a global depletion of glutathione in neurons is transduced into apoptotic events remained elusive. The data presented in this study favor a model in which glutathione depletion causes an ATF4-dependent up-regulation of a coordinated set of genes that orchestrate the timely and irreversible demise of the cell. Part of the orchestrated sequence of events downstream of ATF4 activation includes the increased production of ROS and turnover of glutathione. Although our data clearly establish that ATF4 induction does not influence glutathione synthesis, we cannot determine whether the increased turnover of glutathione is primarily attributable to a change in a glutathione-degrading enzyme with a subsequent increase of ROS, or a secondary consequence of ATF4-mediated ROS production. Increased ROS production would be expected to decrease glutathione levels by enzyme-mediated consumption of the thiol tripeptide. Of note, many mitochondrial genes that could facilitate production of deleterious ROS during respiration are down-regulated in the ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neurons. Future studies will clarify whether ATF4 mediates death primarily by altering glutathione turnover or by dialing up the production of free radicals.</p></sec><sec><title>ATF4 induces global transcriptional changes</title><p>ATF4 was originally described as a transcriptional repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). However, our gene array data suggest that ATF4 acts at least in part as a transcriptional activator. This finding is in line with several more recent publications that describe the activating effect of ATF4 on several target genes, such as heme oxygenase 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), stanniocalcin 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>), osteocalcin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>), gadd153/CHOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>), and TRB3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). Some of these target genes have been shown to play an important role in cell death and cell survival in the brain. Pharmacological induction of heme oxygenase 1 was demonstrated to protect neurons from oxidative insults both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). Indeed, heme oxygenase 1 is induced in WT neurons by oxidative stress; however, it was down-regulated in ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neurons. Likewise, stanniocalcin 2 is up-regulated in response to oxidative stress in WT neurons but was down-regulated in ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neurons. In a recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>), stanniocalcin 2 was identified as an oxidative stress&#x02013;responsive gene with cytoprotective properties. A prodeath ATF4 target gene, TRB3, was strongly dependent on ATF4 and up-regulated in response to oxidative stress. TRB3's role in neuronal apoptosis was described first in a neuronal cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>) and has been recently confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The prodeath role of ATF4 might be context and cell type specific</title><p>The data presented in this work are in support of a strong prodeath role of ATF4. However, previous findings regarding the roles of ATF4 have yielded partly different results. ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> fibroblasts are impaired in expressing genes involved in amino acid import, glutathione biosynthesis, and resistance to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Therefore, ATF4 was proposed to play a key role in rendering the cell more resistant against the metabolic consequences of endoplasmic reticulum oxidation. Therefore, we initially hypothesized that ATF4 induction by endoplasmic reticulum stress or amino acid depletion is the key event in the protection against oxidative stress mediated by HCA treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The finding that ATF4 activation can be associated with protection from oxidative stress&#x02013;induced cell death, although it clearly acts as a prodeath transcription factor, points to a complex and context-specific role of ATF4 in the propagation of neuronal cell death. However, both endoplasmic reticulum stress or amino acid depletion initiate several different signaling events in addition to ATF4 induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). Which of these signaling events are capable of preventing the deleterious consequences of ATF4 activation requires further investigation. In general, the similarity of data obtained from fibroblasts and from cortical neurons is limited. However, despite the opposite effects on glutathione metabolism and cell survival, a comparison between the array data from fibroblasts with our gene expression data indicates a highly significant overlap. Even though the role of each of the many target genes of ATF4 warrant further investigation, the different metabolic demands of postmitotic neurons and actively dividing fibroblasts might help to explain the distinct role of ATF4 in distinct cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). Additionally, differently expressed dimerization partners of ATF4 might also significantly modify ATF4's function. Indeed, several different cancer cell lines show an elevated level of ATF4 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). Moreover, ATF4 is already known to have functions that are limited to a specific cell type such as osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). The precise characterization of these additional signaling events warrants further investigation, and might help to explain why and how these signaling events are capable of preventing the deleterious consequences of ATF4 induction.</p></sec><sec><title>ATF4 is a prodeath transcription factor in vivo</title><p>We have established that ATF4 also plays an important prodeath role in an in vivo model of stroke. However, the use of conventional ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals poses a risk of bias on the outcome in a complex paradigm such as stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>). Therefore, the results need to be interpreted with caution. We cannot rule out the possibility that ATF4 deficiency in all cell types of the brain and the body has an impact on stroke outcome. However, no overt difference was observed when comparing the brain morphology between WT and ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> brains, including the vascular system. In addition, the smaller infarct size in the ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice could not be attributed to changes in systemic physiological parameters, including body temperature, or changes in cerebral blood flow under basal conditions or after MCAo. However, an issue that was not addressed in this study is whether the ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice displayed an altered inflammatory response after ischemia that could explain the smaller infarct size. Although a higher propensity to infections or other immune-related alterations has not yet been observed in ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, we cannot rule out the possibility that an altered inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>) is one reason for the smaller infarct volume in the ATF4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. In summary, the strong correlation in the outcome between in vitro and in vivo studies lets us conclude that our results, even when reviewed carefully, suggest an important role for ATF4 in the induction of neuronal cell death. Thus, ATF4 might be an important target for therapeutic intervention against stroke and other neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Animals.</title><p>All animal procedures were performed according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Weill Medical College of Cornell University.
