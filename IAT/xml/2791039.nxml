The gradient of <italic>Eph-A6</italic> expression was high near the optic disc and low at the developing macula at fetal day (Fd) 55. At Fd 70 and 80, the gradient of <italic>Eph-A6</italic> expression was reversed, being higher temporal to the macula, and low at the disc. By Fd 110, when the fovea begins to form, a pattern of expression was established that persisted into the postnatal period, in which the highest levels of expression were detected at the developing fovea, and progressively lower levels of expression were detected at increasing distance from the fovea. Beginning at Fd 70, we also detected a gradient of <italic>Eph-A6</italic> expression running perpendicular to the retinal surface within the GCL of central retina that was high in the inner GCL and low in the outer GCL. This second pattern persisted into the neonatal period. We found the two ligands for <italic>Eph-A6</italic>, <italic>ephrin-A1</italic> and <italic>ephrin-A4</italic>, expressed by <italic>Pax2</italic>-immunoreactive astrocytes, in the optic nerve head and in the retina, by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.

The fovea is centrally placed in the less well defined &#x0201c;macula.&#x0201d; The macula is a region approximately 3&#x000a0;mm in diameter recognized clinically by its high concentration of yellow, xanthophyll pigments (hence, macula lutea) and a relative absence of large diameter retinal vessels. In this region, the neural retina is also highly specialized: the density of all neural elements is elevated; there is a peak spatial density of cone photoreceptors; there are no rods; and there is a prevalence of &#x0201c;midget&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;parvocellular&#x02019; circuitry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. Signals encoded by these circuits provide the brain with the detailed spatial and color information, characteristic of macular visual function. Absence of large retinal vessels from the macula is an adaptive advantage, since large vessels cause &#x0201c;shadowing&#x0201d; of the cone mosaic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>] and if present, would degrade the quality of the image that strikes the high density cone array.</p><p>Under normal circumstances the foveal region is never vascularized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>] and remains so throughout life. Despite this, the principal retinal angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is highly expressed at the macula during development of the retinal vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>], so it is a paradox that macular vessels are slow to develop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. These observations led us to the hypothesis that repellent guidance cues might inhibit the migration of endothelial cells, and astrocytes, into the macular region during development.</p><p>Three lines of evidence led us to investigate the expression patterns of Eph receptors and their ligands. First, Eph receptor signaling has an important role in retinal axon pathfinding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>] and retinal vessels follow trajectories similar to those taken by retinal axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Second, development of retinal vessels is dependent on Eph receptor signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. Third, in a microarray analysis of differential gene expression in the developing human macula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>], we found higher levels of expression of <italic>Eph-A6</italic> in the macula, confirmed by quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR. In the present study we aimed to identify the expression patterns of <italic>Eph-A6</italic> and its ligands in the developing macaque retina.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Specimens</title><p>We used histological sections of retinas from 10 macaques at fetal days (Fd) 55, 64, 70, 80, 110, 115, 120, 145, postnatal day (P) 5, and P 3 months. This developmental range straddles the period during which the perifoveal capillaries form and the foveal avascular area is defined, that is, between about Fd 90 and several days postnatal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. The sections were obtained by A.E. Hendrickson from the breeding colony of the Primate Center at Bogor Agricultural University, (Bogor, Indonesia), using protocols approved by the University of Washington (Seattle) Animal Care Committee and in compliance with guidelines of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology. Fetuses were delivered by aseptic caesarean section, euthanized by intraperitoneal overdose of barbiturate, and then enucleated. Eyes were immediately injected with methyl Carnoy&#x02019;s fixative, which contains a 6:3:1 ratio of methyl alcohol: acetic acid: chloroform. Specimens were then fixed whole by immersion for 1&#x02013;2 h, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. Sections were embedded in paraffin, and then 8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m slices were cut. Only sections passing through the optic disc and foveal region were used for quantitative analysis in this study.</p><p>For RNA, four human retinas aged between 17 and 20 weeks of gestation (WG) were obtained at surgery to terminate pregnancy, with informed maternal consent. Ethical approval was obtained from the Human Ethics Committees of the University of Sydney and The Australian National University. Gestational age was determined by ultrasound before surgery and confirmed by postmortem measurements of foot length. RNA was extracted from donor retinas 90&#x02013;120 min postmortem. A fifth human retina of 13 WG, the period immediately preceding appearance of vessels at the optic disc, was also obtained under similar circumstances for immunohistochemical analysis. This eye was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and processed in the same way as macaque eyes.</p></sec><sec><title>PCR and in situ hybridization</title><p>Consistent with a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>], we used RNA extracted from fetal human retinas for RT&#x02013;PCR, because it was not possible to obtain fresh macaque retinas for RNA extraction. Whole retinas were excised, homogenized, combined with Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and chloroform, then purified and isolated using RNAqueous-Micro RNA isolation kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). In some cases, we used a 5&#x000a0;mm trephine to obtain a biopsy of the developing macular region, and extracted RNA from the macular sample as well as from the remaining retina (&#x0201c;surround&#x0201d; sample). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed in a 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l reaction mixture using 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g RNA, 500 ng oligo (dT)<sub>18</sub> primer, and 200 U SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen).

They were rehydrated in graded ethanols (2&#x000d7;100%, 90%, 70%, and 50%) and rinsed in 0.9% NaCl then phosphate buffered saline (PBS), which contained 0.8% NaCl in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The sections were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF; #90245; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for 20 min, washed in PBS (2&#x000d7;5 min), then immersed in 50&#x000a0;mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, 5&#x000a0;mM EDTA (TE; pH 8.0) containing 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of Proteinase K (#3115828; Roche) for 7 min at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Following a rinse in PBS and re-fixation in NBF for 20 min, the sections were immersed in a solution containing 0.1 M triethanolamine (#T9534; pH 8.0; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 2.5% acetic anhydride (#A6404; Sigma) for 10 min. After a rinse in PBS then 0.9% NaCl, the slides were dehydrated in graded ethanols and allowed to air dry.</p><p>Prior to hybridization, coverslipped sections were incubated for at least 1 h at 55&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in prehybridization solution that comprised the following ingredients: 50% deionized formamide, 20% dextran sulfate (#0198; Amresco, Solon, OH), 500&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml polyadenylic acid potassium salt (#P9403; Sigma), 50&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml yeast t-RNA (#R8759; Sigma), 50&#x000a0;mM dithiothreitol (#D9779; Sigma); and a salt solution that contained 300&#x000a0;mM NaCl, 10&#x000a0;mM Tris base (#T6066; Sigma), 10&#x000a0;mM sodium phosphate (Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>; #S3264; Sigma), 5&#x000a0;mM NaEDTA, 0.2% Ficoll 400 (#F2637; Sigma), and 0.2% polyvinylpyrrolidone (#P5288; Sigma). For hybridization, each riboprobe was resuspended in hybridization solution at about 250 ng/ml. The coverslip and prehybridization solution was carefully removed after this incubation and the hybridization solution (prehybridization buffer containing 250 ng/ml riboprobe), heated to 55&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, was applied to the sections with a new coverslip. The riboprobes were allowed to hybridize to the tissue overnight at 55&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C after which the coverslips were removed and the sections rinsed in 4&#x000d7;&#x000a0;saline sodium citrate (SSC, pH 7.4), then washed in 2&#x000d7; SSC, 1&#x000d7;&#x000a0;SSC and two washes of 0.1&#x000d7; SSC for 2 h at the optimal post-hybridization wash temperature (60&#x02013;65&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C). A final wash of 0.1&#x000d7; SSC at room temperature for 10 min was also applied. The optimal post-hybridization wash temperature was that which produced the least amount of background labeling.

The sections were removed from the blocking solution and an anti-DIG-alkaline phosphatase antibody (#1093274 Roche) diluted to 1:1,000 was applied to the tissue and allowed to incubate for 30 min. The slides were subsequently rinsed in washing buffer (3&#x000d7;40 min) then placed for 5 min in a detection buffer that consisted of 100&#x000a0;mM Tris-HCl, 100&#x000a0;mM NaCl, 10&#x000a0;mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 8.0. Following hybridization to detect <italic>Eph-A6</italic> expression, riboprobes visualized by incubation for 5 min at room temperature in an HNPP fluorescent detection set (#1758888; Roche) using a Fast Red TR fluorescent substrate with a peak emission at 584 nm. The color reaction was stopped by washing in deionized water for 10 min. Riboprobes detecting ephrin-A expression were visualized by incubation in NBT/BCIP color substrate (#1681451; Roche) for 16 h at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. A similar detection buffer as that used before HNPP/Fast Red TR fluorescent color detection was used except the MgCl<sub>2</sub> was omitted. The color reaction was stopped by washing in deionized water for 10 min, then preserved by fixing in NBF for 4 h at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. All sections were mounted in glycerol, coverslipped, and sealed with fingernail polish. The sections were scanned immediately or stored at &#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and scanned within 24 h (Fast Red) or 48 h (NBT/BCIP) after completion of the color reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunolabeling</title><p>Double immunolabeling using antibodies to <italic>ephrin-A1</italic> and <italic>-A4</italic> with anti-paired box-2 (<italic>Pax2)</italic> was used to localize ephrin proteins in the retina. Nonimmune goat IgG was used as a control for ephrin immunoreactivity. A list of antibodies used and their dilutions is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>. Briefly, sections were dewaxed in xylene for 10 min and rehydrated in graded ethanols (2&#x000d7;100%, 90%, 70%, and 50%), then rinsed in deionized water followed by 0.3% Revealit-Ag (#AR1002; ImmunoSolution, Newcastle, Australia) in PBS (PBSR). The sections were then incubated in Revealit-Ag for 1 h at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for antigen retrieval and subsequently washed in PBSR for 5 min. Sections were blocked in 10% serum (diluted in PBSR) for 1 h at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. To avoid cross-reactivity, we applied primary antibodies raised in different species to the tissue consecutively.

To construct profiles showing <italic>Eph-A6</italic> expression across the full thickness of the retina, we inverted images so that the most intense labeling appears black.

A histogram displaying the range and frequency of pixel intensities throughout each sample location was obtained using ImageJ, and the mode intensity was identified. Because we aimed to obtain objective measures of <italic>brightness</italic> in the mRNA labeling intensity (a parameter of mRNA expression) to identify locations with the highest levels of <italic>Eph-A6</italic> expression, we discarded pixel values falling below the mode. We compiled images of the full thickness of the GCL at each of the five sample locations from successfully hybridized sections.

This approach did not alter the relative mean levels of brightness between samples, only the standard deviations of the means.

On the nasal side of the optic disc, vessels grow in a radial fashion toward the periphery, similar to the pattern of growth seen in rodent models. However, temporal to the optic disc the developing vessels avoid the macular region, which they skirt around in their trajectory toward the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>], and growth of vessels along the horizontal meridian, and in the vicinity of the fovea is very slow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. While the macula is developmentally the most advanced region of the neural retina, during the early phase of vascular outgrowth it remains avascular for a prolonged period, so that completion of the capillary plexus that surrounds the fovea is delayed into the neonatal period in humans and monkeys (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]). The factors responsible for the delayed development of the perifoveal capillaries have not been identified. The present results show gradients of mRNA expression for the axon guidance receptor <italic>Eph-A6</italic> in the GCL of macaque retina that coincide with key phases of retinal vascular development. We also find by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry the two ligands for <italic>Eph-A6</italic>, <italic>ephrin-A1</italic> and <italic>-A4</italic>, on <italic>Pax2</italic>-positive cells in the optic nerve head and nerve fiber layer consistent with the identification of astrocytes, which lead the developing vessels into the retina. These results implicate <italic>Eph-A6</italic> in vascular development in the primate macula.</p><p>We also detect high levels of <italic>Eph-A6</italic> expression in macular GC well into the postnatal period, after development of the retinal vasculature is completed. <italic>Eph-A6</italic> has been implicated in the prenatal guidance of axons to target nuclei during human development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>], and it has been suggested previously that these synaptic territories are &#x0201c;refined&#x0201d; postnatally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. We suggest that during postnatal refinement of synaptic territories, high levels of <italic>Eph-A6</italic> expression in macula may serve to &#x0201c;mark&#x0201d; GC that convey signals from the foveal region to the visual target nuclei.</p><sec><title>Eph receptor signaling</title><p>Eph tyrosine kinase receptors are divided into A and B classes according to the nature of the ephrin ligands they bind. Both classes of ligand-receptor pairs participate in chemoattractant and chemorepellent signaling, in either a forward direction&#x02013;i.e., downstream signaling in the receptor-bearing cell&#x02013;or in reverse, in which interactions with the receptor initiate changes upstream, in the ligand-bearing cell, directing cell movement, adhesion, and de-adhesion events. Repellent signaling along opposing gradients of ligands and receptors of both classes is the principal mechanism underpinning topographic mapping of the retina onto visual target nuclei, in a variety of species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>], including humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. For comprehensive reviews, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>].</p><p>Graded Eph-A expression has been described in many regions of the developing vertebrate central nervous system, including retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>], superior colliculus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>], dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>], and cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>]. These and other studies show that accurate mapping of projections onto sensory centers depends on complementary gradients of ligands and receptors, particularly Ephs and ephrins, along with other factors including coordinated firing of cohorts of projecting neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>]. In addition, Eph receptors and ephrins are implicated in angiogenesis and vascular remodeling. Eph-B signaling has a role in arteriovenous differentiation in vitro, and vascular development in the periphery in vivo. B-class ligands and receptors have been identified in the central nervous system and retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>], peripheral ganglia and nerves (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>]). <italic>Ephrin-B2</italic>, expressed by arterial endothelial cells, interacts with <italic>Eph-B4</italic>, expressed by venous endothelial cells, resulting in bidirectional signaling that inhibits VEGF- and angiopoietin-1-induced endothelial cell proliferation and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r55">55</xref>]. Different roles in vascular development have been identified for A-class ephrins and their receptors. <italic>Ephrin-A1</italic> is expressed at sites of vascular development during mouse embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56">56</xref>] and acts as a chemoattractant for endothelial cells in vitro following an inflammatory signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r57">57</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Significance of graded <italic>Eph-A6</italic> expression in primate retina</title><sec><title>A role in vascular patterning?</title><p>The most prominent gradient of <italic>Eph-A6</italic> expression occurs as a function of eccentricity from the developing fovea, such that peak <italic>Eph-A6</italic> expression occurs at the fovea (0 eccentricity), with a gradual decline in expression with increasing eccentricity, out to about 3&#x000a0;mm. A second gradient runs perpendicular to the retinal surface and is confined to the GCL of the foveal region and immediately adjacent retina (to about 1.5&#x000a0;mm eccentricity). These gradients begin to emerge at about Fd&#x000a0;80, after retinal vessels have emerged from the optic disc, and during the period when there is slow growth of retinal vessels along the horizontal meridian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>] and in the macular region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>].</p><p>Prior to Fd&#x000a0;80 our data suggest that expression patterns of <italic>Eph-A6</italic> are quite different. At Fd&#x000a0;55, when the foveal region has just begun to differentiate, <italic>Eph-A6</italic> expression is higher near the optic disc than at the incipient fovea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>), consistent with a previous study of human retina at a comparable stage of development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. High expression of <italic>Eph-A6</italic> at the disc would inhibit migration of ligand-bearing astrocytes into the retina, resulting in their accumulation in the optic nerve head as well as in Bergmeister's papilla, which is invested in astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r58">58</xref>] that express <italic>ephrin-A1</italic> and <italic>-A4</italic> (data not shown). At Fd&#x000a0;70 we find a relative drop in levels of <italic>Eph-A6</italic> expression at the optic disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). This corresponds with the earliest stages of retinal vessel formation in the macaque [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]; this relative decline in <italic>Eph-A6</italic> expression may be permissive to astrocytes entering the retina at this stage. However, because we have limited numbers of specimens in this early age range, these results require further clarification and confirmation.</p><p>Our most significant findings are from five animals, aged between Fd&#x000a0;110 and P5, during which period the foveal avascular region is defined, and the foveal depression forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r59">59</xref>]. During this phase we find a distinct peak of <italic>Eph-A6</italic> expression at the developing fovea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>), with expression falling to lower levels either side of the fovea. Early in this period (Fd&#x000a0;105&#x02013;120) the foveal avascular area is defined in the GCL, apparently by the migration of astrocytes being brought to a sudden halt on the edge of a &#x0201d;no-go&#x0201d; zone that defines the fovea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. Our present findings suggest that high levels of <italic>Eph-A6</italic> expression in the GCL of the developing foveal region may have roles in driving capillaries deep into the GCL, and defining the no-go zone, by repelling ligand-bearing astrocytes. Further, these high levels of <italic>Eph-A6</italic> expression may explain the previously documented egress of astrocytes from the foveal region in the prenatal phase of monkey retinal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r61">61</xref>].</p><p>A distinctive feature of the perifoveal capillaries is their position in relation to the laminae of the neural retina. Throughout most of the primate retina, the innermost layer of vessels is found at the GCL-NFL interface. In the macula the innermost layer of capillaries forms at the GCL-IPL interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>], rather than more superficially at the GCL-NFL interface as in the rest of the retina. There are no known cues to explain the deep positioning of macular capillaries in the GCL. We propose that the <italic>Eph-A6</italic> gradient identified in the present study, which runs perpendicular to the retinal surface in the macular region, may explain the deep positioning of the macular capillaries. That is, we suggest that the high level of <italic>Eph-A6</italic> in the innermost cells of the GCL repels the migrating astrocytes into the deeper layers, where levels of <italic>Eph-A6</italic> mRNA are much lower. While the present data provide a sound basis for modeling the cellular interactions between GC and astrocytes that help to define the foveal avascular area, further in vitro studies are needed to validate and strengthen these hypotheses.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>A role in mapping macular ganglion cell projections?</title><p>The Eph&#x02013;ephrin-A family has a key role in the mapping of GC projections onto the target visual nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>], and it has been argued that the pattern of expression of the Eph&#x02013;ephrin-A genes in the human retina may also contribute to the formation and maintenance of eye-specific projections to the laminae of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. Mapping of GC axons into broad territories in the visual targets takes place in macaques in the prenatal period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r62">62</xref>]. While relatively little data are available concerning the postnatal period of GC axon-projection refinement in primates, it appears that this period of plasticity, during which preservation of synaptic territory of macular and foveal GC would be a priority, lasts until several months postnatal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. The sustained, high levels of expression of <italic>Eph-A6</italic> by macular GC in the postnatal period, described here, indicates that expression of <italic>Eph-A6</italic> may mark the projection from central retina during the postnatal phase of synaptic remodeling in the target visual nuclei. Such a role would predict reciprocal gradients of expression in the visual targets of the ligands <italic>ephrin-A1</italic> and <italic>-A4</italic>. We aim to undertake these experiments in the near future. Consistent with this, a role for <italic>Eph-A6</italic> in the axon projection to visual cortex has also been proposed, with <italic>Eph-A6</italic> expression localized to the site of visual cortex development in the macaque brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r63">63</xref>] before the arrival of thalamocortical projections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r64">64</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present data implicates <italic>Eph-A6</italic> signaling in the development of retinal vessels prenatally, and suggests a role for <italic>Eph-A6</italic> in the preservation and maintenance of projections from macular and foveal GC, in the late prenatal and postnatal phase of development. In vitro analysis of interactions between <italic>ephrin-A1</italic> and &#x02013;<italic>A4</italic> expressing astrocytes and retinal fragments with high versus low levels of <italic>Eph-A6</italic> expression are required to fully characterize the effects of <italic>Eph-A6</italic> signaling on astrocyte migration. Further investigation of the postnatal expression profiles of Eph&#x02013;ephrin-As in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, and superior colliculus, will clarify the roles these factors play in the postnatal refinement of retinal projections in primates.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Dr. Anita Hendrickson for sourcing macaque tissues and reading the manuscript, Diyat Sajuthi for expert tissue preparation, and the staff at the Primate Centre, Bogor, Indonesia for their assistance.
