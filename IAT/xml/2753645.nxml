However, we showed here that PAR6, one kind of PAR protein, was localized in the nuclei of mouse oocytes that formed primordial follicles during the perinatal period, suggesting a new role of PAR protein. It is the first time we found that, in mouse fetal ovaries, PAR6 appeared in somatic cell cytoplasm and fell weak when somatic cells invaded germ cell cysts at 17.5 days post coitus (dpc). Meanwhile, the expression of PAR6 was observed in cysts, and became strong in the nuclei of some germ cells at 19.5 dpc and all primordial follicular oocytes at 3 day post parturition (dpp), and then obviously declined when the primordial follicles entered the folliculogenic growth phase. During the primordial follicle pool foundation, the number of PAR6 positive germ cells remained steady and was consistent with that of formed follicles at 3 dpp. There were no TUNEL (apoptosis examination) positive germ cells stained with PAR6 at any time studied. The number of follicles significantly declined when 15.5 dpc ovaries were treated with the anti-PAR6 antibody and PAR6 RNA interference. Carbenoxolone (CBX, a known blocker of gap junctions) inhibited the expression of PAR6 in germ cells and the formation of follicles. Our results suggest that PAR6 could be used as a potential marker of germ cells for the primordial follicle formation, and the expression of PAR6 by a gap junction-dependent process may contribute to the formation of primordial follicles and the maintenance of oocytes at the diplotene stage.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In mice, the establishment of the primordial follicle pool is a complex process that includes the formation of cysts through oogonia mitosis, the startup of initial meiosis, the breakdown of cysts, and the formation of primordial follicles when germ cells are arrested at the diplotene stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007372-Pepling1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. During this process, germ cells in fetal ovaries can develop to form primordial follicles or undergo apoptosis, which depends on molecular regulatory mechanism that remains elusive, for example, why can only a few oocytes cooperate with somatic cells to form primordial follicles, which kind of germ cells are selected to form the primordial follicles with ovarian somatic cells, why can not the oocytes finish their first meiosis and arrest at the diplotene stage, which factors control these?</p><p>PAR proteins play an important role in cell polarity of cells of many types. They are involved in the asymmetric distribution of cytoplasmic determinants and in the regulation of cytoskeleton positioning and asymmetric division. The core in PAR protein is a ternary complex of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), the PDZ-domain proteins PAR-3 and PAR-6. Two others are protein kinases called Par-1, and Par-5, which belong to the 14-3-3 family of phosphoserine-binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007372-Macara1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

The results demonstrated for the first time that PAR6 was expressed in the mouse fetal ovary with a spatio-temporal character (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007372-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). In most mouse strains, primordial germ cells arrive at the genital ridge at 10 dpc, embark on a special program of division to form cysts at 10.5 dpc, start meiosis at 13.5 dpc through the stages of leptotene and zygotene, and then enter the pachytene stage at 15.5 dpc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007372-Pepling2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

At 3 dpp, the number of follicles was the same as that of PAR6 positive germ cells since the germ cells in follicles showed positive staining, and others without follicular structures showed negative staining. Primordial follicle forming starts from the 17.5 dpc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007372-Byskov1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, and about one third of germ cells contribute to the establishment of the primordial folliclular pool by 3 or 4 dpp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007372-Pepling3">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007372-Rajah1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, which endow all the available follicles for reproduction of animals.

In our study, the PAR6 was strongly expressed in the nuclei of oocytes when the germ cells entered and were arrested at the diplotene stage to form primordial follicles, and kept for a long time until the primordial follicles were recruited into the population of growing follicles.

Unfortunately, the total number of germ cells also declined like the experiment of anti-PAR6 antibody culturing.

Therefore, the possibility of the reduction in total germ cell number in the anti-PAR6 antibody and shRNA groups was that the PAR6 negative germ cells cannot form primordial follicles and then died. As the RT-PCR and Western blot results showed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007372-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>), reducing PAR6 mRNA levels via plasmid-mediated delivery of shRNAs induced obvious decrease of Fig&#x003b1; gene level and PAR6 protein expression.

Inhibition of PAR6 by anti-PAR6 antibody, RNA interference, and CBX blocked the formation of primordial follicles. CBX also inhibited the expression of PAR6. These results indicate that the expression of PAR6 in female mouse germ cells may have new roles in contributing to the formation of primordial follicles and the maintenance of oocyte arrest at the diplotene stage. Maybe it could serve as a marker for the germ cells to be selected to form the primordial follicles. A thorough investigation of PAR6 will be useful to reveal the mechanism of primordial follicle formation and maintenance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Animal (Ethics Statement)</title><p>All experiments were conducted using Kunming white mice purchased from the Laboratory Animal Center of Institute of Genetics at Beijing.
