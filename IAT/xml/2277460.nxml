The structure of HslVU protease resembles that of the 26S proteasome, and the simultaneous presence of both proteases in one organism was deemed unlikely.

We characterized the HslVU homolog from <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, a eukaryotic protozoan parasite and the causative agent of human sleeping sickness. TbHslVU has ATP-dependent peptidase activity and, like its bacterial counterpart, has essential lysine and N-terminal threonines in the catalytic subunit. By epitope tagging, TbHslVU localizes to mitochondria and is associated with the mitochondrial genome, kinetoplast DNA (kDNA). RNAi of TbHslVU dramatically affects the kDNA by causing over-replication of the minicircle DNA. This leads to defects in kDNA segregation and, subsequently, to continuous network growth to an enormous size. Multiple discrete foci of nicked/gapped minicircles are formed on the periphery of kDNA disc, suggesting a failure in repairing the gaps in the minicircles for kDNA segregation. TbHslVU is a eubacterial protease identified in the mitochondria of a eukaryote. It has a novel function in regulating mitochondrial DNA replication that has never been observed in other organisms.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>ATP-dependent protein-hydrolyzing enzyme complexes are present in all living organisms, including the 26S proteasome in eukaryotes and the HslVU complex in bacteria.

In abnormally segregating kinetoplasts, the minicircles also filled most of the DAPI-stained network, whereas the maxicircle was segregated into two symmetrical clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000048-g007">Fig. 7c</xref>). Due to the excessive size of minicircle network, it turned into a thread between the segregated maxicircles.

We demonstrated that <italic>T. brucei</italic> expresses an enzymatically active ATP-dependent HslVU homolog that localizes to the mitochondrion. More importantly, we discovered that the function of TbHslVU is to control replication/segregation of kDNA, the trypanosome mitochondrial genome.</p><p>RNAi of TbHslVU in its early stages had two major effects. First, it caused an increase in cells with kinetoplasts undergoing abnormal segregation. Second, it caused the appearance of giant kinetoplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000048-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Kinetic studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000048-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>) showed that RNAi caused an initial increase in the abnormally segregating forms, followed by a decline. Then there was an increase in cells with enlarged kinetoplasts. The switchover from abnormally segregating forms to enlarged kinetoplasts occurred earlier by about 2 days when RNAi targeted TbHslV than when it targeted TbHslU1&#x0002b;2, presumably because RNAi is more effective in the former case (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000048-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The phenotype of HslVU knockdowns, due to over-replication of minicircles, has no mechanistic similarity to those of two other recently described RNAi cell lines that are also defective in segregation and that produce giant networks. In the case of p166 RNAi, these phenotypes develop because this protein is a component of the tripartite attachment complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000048-Zhao1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Regarding UMSBP, RNAi not only affects kDNA segregation but also nuclear division and separation of the basal bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000048-Milman1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It is possible that minicircle over-replication starts soon after induction of RNAi, resulting in a gradual increase in the size of the network. These large networks probably can segregate in the initial phase of RNAi, but because they are somewhat oversized, the segregation machinery may be unable to handle them properly. Thus they either undergo asymmetric division or produce some of the abnormal forms shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000048-g002">Figs 2C and 2D</xref>. The increase in cells undergoing abnormal kinetoplast segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000048-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>) is probably because abnormal segregation may take longer than usual and thus a larger fraction of the cells are involved with this process at any given time. We speculate that as kDNA over-replication continues, the segregation machinery is blocked, and the network just continues to grow without segregation. It would be theoretically possible that the cells with large kinetoplasts could undergo cytokinesis, generating one cell with a large kDNA and another without any kDNA at all, as is the case following RNAi of p166 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000048-Zhao1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. However, few cells without kDNA appear after RNAi of TbHslVU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000048-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). Therefore, as is occurring following RNAi of TbHslV for 5 to 6 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000048-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), cell division slows down and eventually stops.</p><p>There is considerable evidence to support this model. Measurement of total minicircles reveals a &#x0223c;20-fold increase during TbHslVU RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000048-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), whereas maxicircles increase only 2.8-fold. The minicircle increase is biphasic, with the increased rate occurring at about the time when the number of abnormally segregating forms is declining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000048-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). It is possible that once the network has become too large to segregate, it could spend a longer portion of the cell cycle undergoing replication, thus accounting for its accelerated growth in size. It is not surprising that the increased level of minicircles is accompanied by a corresponding increase in free minicircle replication intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000048-g005">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism by which minicircles over-replicate is not clear. It is thought that the gaps in minicircles are markers to distinguish those that have undergone replication from those that have not, thus ensuring that they replicate only once per generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000048-Liu1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. This highly organized system appears to have broken down in cells in which TbHslVU has been knocked down. Since about 95&#x00025; of the oversized kinetoplasts are TdT-positive, normal gap-repair mechanisms for network minicircles may have been overwhelmed by the accelerated rate of replication. Those that have their gaps repaired may be released from the network a second time, allowing the network to increase in size more than two-fold during one cell cycle.</p><p>The TdT labeling pattern of RNAi cells differ dramatically from those observed in kDNAs of other trypanosomatids. In <italic>Crithidia fasciculata,</italic> newly synthesized gapped minicircles are attached to the network adjacent to the antipodal sites, but then, due to rotation of the kinetoplast disk, they distribute around the network periphery; thus TdT labeling resembles a peripheral ring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000048-Liu3">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000048-PerezMorga1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. In <italic>T. brucei</italic>, minicircles also attach to the network adjacent to the antipodal sites. However, instead of rotating, the disk oscillates, distributing minicircles in a limited region along the network periphery. Occasionally, there is a larger displacement of the kinetoplast, a jump, that moves the minicircle attachment site to a new position on the periphery where it resumes oscillation. Thus, due to a combination of oscillations and jumps, the gapped minicircle progeny accumulate at the two ends of the kinetoplast, accounting for the polar TdT labeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000048-Liu3">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>There is a completely different pattern of gapped minicircle distribution in TbHslV RNAi cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000048-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). A predominant form has 3 to 6 dots of TdT label, mostly on the network periphery. This pattern implies that reattachment of gapped minicircles is not a random process and that there is still some order maintained in the replication of large networks. One possible explanation for the dot pattern is that the number of antipodal sites has increased so that each site is associated with a dot. During the kDNA replication cycle in normal cells, two new antipodal sites must assemble every generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000048-Johnson1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. In TbHslVU RNAi cells, the standard pair of antipodal sites may be unable to handle the 6-fold increase in free minicircle replication intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000048-g005">Fig. 5</xref>), thereby additional pairs of antipodal sites are formed for the task. Another possibility is that the RNAi cells have only two antipodal sites, as in the wild type, but when functioning on a large network, jumps dominate over oscillations. After attachment of gapped minicircles at one site, forming a dot of TdT-label, a jump moves it to another site. Thus, two antipodal sites are able to create multiple TdT-labeled dots. There is precedent for RNAi changing the mechanism of minicircle attachment. RNAi of SSE1 changed the TdT labeling pattern from being polar to a ring. This pattern apparently was not due to rotation of the kDNA disk but to increasing the amplitude of oscillation to nearly 180&#x000b0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000048-Liu3">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although we do not have enough information to speculate further on the detailed mechanism of minicircle over-replication, we can conjecture about the role of TbHslVU in controlling the process. In principle, it could degrade some or all kDNA replication proteins when replication was complete, thereby stopping kDNA synthesis. Alternatively, TbHslVU could degrade only one protein, a master positive regulator of minicircle replication. The regulator cannot be degraded in TbHslVU RNAi cells, thus allowing kDNA replication to continue out of control. Possible candidates for this master regulator are the universal minicircle sequence binding protein (UMSBP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000048-Onn1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> and p38 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000048-Liu4">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, both of which bind the minicircle replication origin and could be involved in triggering their replication.</p><p>Since the function of TbHslVU in regulating DNA replication in <italic>T. brucei</italic> mitochondria has never been observed in bacteria, this distinction raises the interesting question of how this function was acquired. As discussed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000048-Lukes2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, it is thought that an ancestor of <italic>T. brucei,</italic> like present-day <italic>Cryptobia helices,</italic> had a mitochondrion that contained non-catenated plasmids, which encoded guide RNAs and had other minicircle-like properties. The pathway of kDNA evolution, leading to the network structure found in trypanosomatid parasites, was probably driven by a need to improve the accuracy of segregation of the multiple minicircle sequences required to encode the guide RNA repertoire. But the development of the network structure required a much more complex replication scheme. One example of complexity is that kDNA networks replicate during a discrete phase of the cell cycle, in contrast to mitochondrial DNAs in higher eukaryotes that replicate randomly throughout the cell cycle. One mechanism for this aspect of kDNA replication control could have involved recruitment of the HslVU homolog that had initially been acquired from the bacterial endosymbiont that formed the mitochondrion. In this regard, it will be very interesting to study the function of the HslVU homologs in other non-kinetoplastid eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title><italic>T. brucei</italic> Cell Culture and RNA interference</title><p>The procyclic form of <italic>T. brucei</italic> strain 29-13 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000048-Wirtz1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref> was cultivated at 26&#x000b0;C in Cunningham's medium supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum and 15 &#x000b5;g/ml G418 and 50 &#x000b5;g/ml hygromycin B.</p><p>The N-terminal coding regions of TbHslV, TbHslU1 and TbHslU2 were each cloned into pZJM vector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000048-Wang3">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref> for RNAi.
