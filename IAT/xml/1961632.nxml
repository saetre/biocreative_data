In ARDS, inflammation develops in the lung, and fluid builds up in the alveoli (the air sacs resembling &#x0201c;bunches of grapes&#x0201d; at the ends of the network of tubes in the lung). This buildup of fluid prevents oxygen from being carried efficiently from air into the blood; the individual consequently experiences problems breathing and can develop further serious complications, which contribute significantly to the burden of illness among people in intensive care units. The death rate among individuals who do develop ARDS is very high, upward of 30&#x00025;. Normally, individuals with ARDS are given extra oxygen, and may need a machine to help them breathe; treatments also focus on addressing the underlying causes in each particular patient. However, currently there are very few specific treatments that address ARDS itself.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>The researchers here wanted to work toward new treatment options for individuals with ARDS. One possible approach involves cells known as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). These cells are typically found in the bone marrow and have a property shared by very few other cell types in the body; they are able to carry on dividing and renewing themselves, and can eventually develop into many other types of cell. The researchers already knew that MSCs could become incorporated into injured lungs in mice and develop there into the tissue layers lining the lung. Some interesting work had also been done on a protein called angiopoeitin 1 (ANGPT1), which seemed to play a role in protecting against inflammation in blood vessels. Therefore, there was a strong rationale for carrying out experiments in mice to see if MSCs engineered to produce the ANGPT1 protein might &#x0201c;rescue&#x0201d; lung injury in mice. These experiments would be an initial step toward developing possible new treatments for humans with ARDS.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers used a mouse model to mimic the human ARDS condition. This involved injecting the windpipe of experimental mice with lipopolysaccharide (a substance normally found on the outer surface of bacteria that brings about an immune reaction in the lung). After 30 minutes, the mice were then injected with either salt solution (as a control), the MSCs, or MSCs producing the ANGPT1 protein. The researchers then looked at markers of lung inflammation, the appearance of the lungs under a microscope, and whether the injected MSCs had become incorporated into the lung tissue.</p><p>The lipopolysaccharide brought about a large increase in the number of inflammatory cells in the lung fluid, which was reduced in the mice given MSCs. Furthermore, in mice given the MSCs producing ANGPT1 protein, the number of inflammatory cells was reduced to a level similar to that of mice that had not been given lipopolysaccharide. When the researchers looked at the appearance under the microscope of lungs from mice that had been given lipopolysaccharide, they saw signs of inflammation and fluid coming out into the lung air spaces. These signs were reduced among both mice treated with MSCs and those treated with MSCs producing ANGPT1. The researchers also measured the &#x0201c;leakiness&#x0201d; of the lung tissues in lipopolysaccharide-treated mice; MSCs seemed to reduce the leakiness to some extent, and the lungs of mice treated with MSCs producing ANGPT1 were no more leaky than those of mice that had never been injected with lipopolysaccharide. Finally, the MSCs were seen to be incorporated into lung tissue by three days after injection, but after that were lost from the lung.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>Previous research done by the same group had shown that fibroblasts producing ANGPT1 could prevent lung injury in rats later given lipopolysaccharide. The experiments reported here go a step further than this, and suggest that MSCs producing ANGPT1 can &#x0201c;rescue&#x0201d; the condition of mouse lungs that had already been given lipopolysaccharide. In addition, treatment with MSCs alone also produced beneficial effects. This opens up a possible new treatment strategy for ARDS in humans. However, it should be emphasized that the animal model used here is not a precise parallel of ARDS in humans, and that more research remains to be done before human studies of this sort could be considered.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040269">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040269</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Medline Plus entry on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000103.htm">acute respiratory distress syndrome</ext-link>, providing basic information about what ARDS is, its effects, and how it is currently managed</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ardsnet.org/">ARDS Network</ext-link> from the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health; the site provides frequently asked questions about ARDS as well as a list of clinical trials conducted by the network</p></list-item><list-item><p>Information about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stemcells.nih.gov/info/basics/basics1.asp">stem cells</ext-link> from the US National Institutes of Health, including information about the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stemcells.nih.gov/info/basics/basics6.asp">potential uses</ext-link> of stem cells</p></list-item><list-item><p>Wikipedia page about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal">mesenchymal stem cells</ext-link> (note: Wikipedia is an internet encyclopedia anyone can edit)</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Mei SHJ, McCarter SD, Deng Y, Parker CH, Liles WC, et al.

ARDS is a complex clinical syndrome that is initiated by injury to the lung, often in the setting of pneumonia or sepsis. Some of the early features of ARDS can be reproduced by administration of bacterial endotoxin (LPS), which acts via TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) to induce the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and up-regulate leukocyte adhesion molecules, resulting in EC activation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040269-b005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040269-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040269-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;.

Similarly, we have shown that fibroblasts transfected with <italic>ANGPT1</italic> were moderately effective in reducing ALI in rats when given one day prior to LPS, attenuating airspace inflammation by 60&#x00025; and reducing expression of endothelial-selective adhesion molecules &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040269-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;. However, in these studies gene transfer was performed prior to lung injury, and it is uncertain whether post-treatment strategies, which are more relevant for clinical therapy, would have been equally effective. Furthermore, the Witzenbichler study used intraperitoneal administration of endotoxin and systemic gene therapy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040269-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;, and it is not possible to differentiate local actions of ANGPT1 on lung inflammation from its actions in the peripheral circulation.</p><p>The observed therapeutic effect of MSCs alone in ALI was not entirely unexpected, since previous reports have suggested that MSCs can inhibit the activation of dendritic cells, T lymphocytes, and natural killer cells, reducing the secretion of inflammatory cytokines (i.e., TNF-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3;), increasing the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL10, IL4), and inducing a tolerant phenotype &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040269-b066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040269-b067">67</xref>&#x0005d;. The immunomodulatory effects of MSCs have been studied in a number of inflammatory states such as graft-versus-host disease &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040269-b068">68</xref>&#x0005d; and autoimmune encephalomyelitis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040269-b069">69</xref>&#x0005d;. It has also been suggested that the immunosuppressive activity of MSCs, together with their lack of expression of class II major histocompatibility complex antigens, may confer an &#x0201c;immune-privileged&#x0201d; state in the context of allogenic transplantation, which could greatly simplify their therapeutic use. Indeed, in early clinical trials, the use of cultured allogenic MSCs was shown to be well tolerated, and did not induce a detectable immune response when transplanted into an unrelated recipient &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040269-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040269-b070">70</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In the present study, there was an additional effect of ANGPT1 overexpressing MSCs compared with MSCs alone, not only on the extravasation of plasma proteins and inflammatory cells, but also on the levels of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the BAL fluid. Interestingly, this additive effect was not apparent when these mediators were measured in whole-lung homogenates. ANGPT1 acts on TEK receptors, which are largely restricted to the endothelium. Thus, it is likely that ANGPT1 would have a preferential effect on the vascular endothelium, reducing inflammatory cell trafficking and plasma protein exudation into the alveolar space, and possibly inhibiting EC apoptosis as well. In contrast, effects of LPS on the airway epithelium or resident alveolar macrophages may not be directly modulated by ANGPT1. However, it should be noted that MSCs alone resulted in a near complete reduction of tissue cytokine expression, with the exception of Cxcl2, which in fact was further reduced in the group receiving with pANGPT1-transfected MSCs. It is also of interest that near complete normalization of protein and inflammatory cell exudation into the alveolus after intratracheal LPS instillation was achieved with MSCs-pANGPT1 delivered to the pulmonary circulation, despite the fact that alveolar permeability is determined by the functional integrity of both the alveolar epithelium and the alveolar endothelium, which together constitute the alveolar&#x02013;capillary membrane barrier of the lung &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040269-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. It has been well documented that LPS-induced ALI is associated with up-regulation of adhesion molecules on the endothelial surface &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040269-b071">71</xref>&#x0005d;. Leukocyte adhesion to the activated endothelium is a critical determinant of the alveolar inflammatory response, leading to transmigration of inflammatory cells into the airspace and possible exacerbation of epithelial injury and increased pulmonary vascular leak &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040269-b071">71</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the synergistic effect of <italic>ANGPT1</italic> gene transfer may be attributed to its ability to reduce EC activation and thus block the amplification of lung injury that is dependent on the recruitment of leukocytes from the pulmonary circulation into the injured lung.</p><p>On a separate note, we were unable to detect a significant increase in human ANGPT1 proteins in the lung tissue, BAL fluid, or plasma (unpublished data) after injection of pANGPT1-transfected MSCs. We believe that this is due to the lack of specific antibodies to human ANGPT1 that can reliably detect the human <italic>ANGPT1</italic> transgene product above the &#x0201c;noise&#x0201d; of the endogenous mouse proteins. In a separate study in which mice were allowed to survive up to 2 wk, a 20&#x00025; mortality (up to 9 d) was observed in the LPS/saline group. No animals died in either the LPS/MSCs group or the LPS/MSCs-pANGPT1 group (unpublished data). We have also examined the effect of MSCs and MSCs-pANGPT1 at earlier time points (unpublished data). There was no difference in the total cell counts in BAL fluid in LPS-injured mice that received treatment with either MSCs or MSCs-pANGPT1, compared to the LPS/saline group (1 d after LPS injury). However, 2 d after LPS injury and treatment, there was a significant decrease in the total cell count in BAL fluid from mice that received MSCs and MSCs-pANGPT1 compared to controls, though the difference between those two groups was not significant. Preliminary data measuring the systemic level of IL1&#x003b2; suggested that plasma IL1&#x003b2; level peaked in LPS-injured mice (1 d after LPS) without treatment (LPS/saline mice), while most mice that had received treatment (LPS/MSCs or LPS/MSCs-pANGPT1) had lower or undetectable levels. Plasma IL1&#x003b2; rapidly declined in LPS-injured mice 2 d after injury. Mice that had received treatment (MSCs or MSCs-pANGPT1) had lower or undetectable levels.</p><p>We also examined whether the observed therapeutic effects depended on the retention of MSCs. A slightly higher proportion of cells were retained in injured lungs 15 minutes after LPS exposure; however, the difference between injured versus uninjured lung was not significant, and in both cases the majority of cells were lost from the lung by 3 d. Our results are in agreement with those of Beckett et al., who reported no significant improvement in lung engraftment of bone marrow-derived cells following endotoxin- or NO<sub>2</sub>-induced lung injury together with irradiation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040269-b072">72</xref>&#x0005d;. However, other studies have reported greater cell persistence after certain forms of injury &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040269-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040269-b073">73</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040269-b075">75</xref>&#x0005d;. Nonetheless, it is clear that the benefit seen in response to cell-based therapy in the LPS injury model did not require a high level of long-term persistence of transplanted MSCs. This observation is consistent with a number of reports of bone marrow cell therapy following myocardial infarction &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040269-b076">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040269-b077">77</xref>&#x0005d;, which point to an important role for paracrine actions of transplanted cells on neovascularization and tissue healing. However, the precise mechanism by which genetically engineered MSCs confer a therapeutic benefit in the model of ALI remains to be determined.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>It is important to recognize certain limitations of this study. First of all, the LPS-induced model of ALI cannot fully reproduce the complexity of clinical ALI/ARDS in human patients. Therefore, it will be necessary to reproduce these findings in more clinically relevant models, such as in animal models of sepsis and pneumonia. As well, cell therapy was given only 30 min after lung injury, and it will be important to define the therapeutic window of this intervention at later time points. Moreover, percentages of the retained cells in the lung after transplantation were fairly low, and future studies need to address the question of whether higher levels of MSCs incorporation would provide more therapeutic benefit in this and other models of ALI. A further limitation relates to the use syngeneic cells for cell therapy in the current study, which avoids the issue of host immune response. However, given the growing literature that these MSCs may be &#x0201c;immune-privileged,&#x0201d; it will be important in future work to explore whether the use of allogenic MSCs will have the same beneficial effects in this ALI model. The translation of these promising results into an effective new therapy for ARDS in patients will require, at the very least, that these limitations be addressed.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we have shown that bone marrow-derived MSCs reduced the severity of ALI when administered into the pulmonary circulation of the LPS-injured mouse lung, possibly by virtue of their well-characterized immunomodulatory actions. However, this effect was greatly potentiated when these cells were engineered to overexpress the vasculoprotective factor ANGPT1, a specific inhibitor of inflammation and permeability in ECs. Our data show, to our knowledge for the first time, the synergistic action of combined cell and gene therapy for ALI, and may provide a basis for the development of an innovative approach for the prevention and treatment of ARDS, which continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0040269-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Establishment of Optimal Conditions for Transfection of Murine MSCs</title><p>MSCs were transfected by nuclear-targeting electroporation with pFLAG (null transfection control using high efficiency protocol, solid bar) or pANGPT1 (high cell survival or high efficiency protocol; grey or diagonal stripes bar, respectively).
