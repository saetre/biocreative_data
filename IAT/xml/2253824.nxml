However recently it has become apparent that they also co-operate to chaperone a variety of proteins (clients) in multiple cellular pathways in cells which are not stressed. They often play a vital role in the cellular functioning of the client <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Young1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The precise result of the chaperone interaction seems to vary with the individual client proteins and examples of effects on structure, modification, protein interactions and localisation have all been reported ( reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Pearl1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>). HSP90 has also recently gained some prominence as a possible target for cancer therapy in several different types of tumour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Beliakoff1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and a number of phase 1 and 2 trials of anti-HSP90 drugs are currently under way.</p><p>The HSP90 co-chaperones are a group of diverse proteins which help HSP90/70 in their action. This group includes other heat shock proteins, TPR containing proteins, cyclophilins and others. The TPR domain is a 34 amino acid protein motif thought to be involved in protein:protein interactions. TPR motif containing proteins are widely distributed across multiple classes of proteins involved in a variety of cellular functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-DAndrea1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Smith1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> Those interacting with HSP90/70 usually contain 2&#x02013;3 copies of the motif and the TPR motifs in such proteins are more closely related to each other than to TPR domains from proteins with other cellular functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Odunuga1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. It is thought that the TPR motifs are important for direct interaction with the HSP90/70 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Scheufler1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> and precise mapping of the contact points has been achieved for at least one TPR co-chaperone (Hop-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Brinker1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>). Although the TPR domains provide a way of interacting with the heat shock proteins they do not seem to define a specific protein function. Therefore while some TPR co-chaperones have quite general HSP90/70 related functions (eg Hop-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Odunuga1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>), others have more specific roles associated with particular HSP90 clients or groups of clients (eg Chip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-McDonough1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> Bag-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Young1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> )</p><p>We have previously reported the identification of a protein from Drosophila (Dpit47) which shows properties consistent with it being a TPR co-chaperone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Crevel1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> This protein shows a tight and stoichiometric interaction with DmHsp90, it also shows a tight interaction with DmHsp70, although this is at substoichiometric levels. In addition to DmHsp90/70 interactions Dpit47 associates with a number of proteins which are involved in DNA replication-DNA polymerase alpha, DmCdc6 and DmOrc2/5 ( GC and SC unpublished). All three of these proteins are thought to have a catalytic role in the initiation of DNA replication. In addition cdc6 is also thought to be involved in controlling the co-ordination of DNA synthesis with cell cycle traversal of the G1/S and G2/M boundaries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Oehlmann1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-ClayFarrace1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Piatti1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Crevel2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> The interaction between Dpit47 and DNA polymerase alpha causes inhibition of polymerase activity. Based on these observations we have proposed that Dpit47 provides a link between DmHsp90 activity and DNA replication and therefore a possible role for DmHsp90 in some aspect of DNA replication.</p><p>The TTC4 gene was originally identified through its localisation in a genomic region linked to breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Su1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>)-although no mutations could be detected in the gene in this study. It has also been reported as a pseudogene with a breast cancer association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Hey1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently the gene has been reported to show a variety of mutations&#x02013;both deletions and point mutations in tissue samples from patients with melanoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Poetsch1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In the Poetsch study related mutations were also reported in three melanoma cell lines, although in a different study of melanoma cell lines no mutations were detectable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Irwin1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this paper we show that TTC4 is the human orthologue of the Drosophila Dpit47 protein. The two proteins are highly related in sequence, share a common cellular location, and show analogous interactions with both heat shock and the replication initiation protein CDC6. We show that loss of interaction with CDC6 occurs when some of the point mutations identified in melanoma samples are introduced into the TTC4 gene. This suggests a possible route through which TTC4 could affect the development of malignant melanoma. We also present evidence which suggests that TTC4 has a general role in the progression of cancers in addition to melanoma, since the levels of the protein are raised in a variety of tumour cell lines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification and cloning of the TTC4 gene</title><p>Identification of the TTC4 gene was carried out using the Blastp programme at the NCBI.

In each case several putative bipartite like NLS motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Robbins1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> can be seen in the sequence. The localisation for each protein is &#x02018;speckly&#x02019; suggesting compartmentalization&#x02013;although the nature of the compartment is unclear; 3) Both proteins are more abundant in proliferating tissue; 4) Both proteins show strong interactions with the HSP90 and HSP70 proteins. In addition the TTC4:HSP90 interaction needs the same conserved residues that have been seen to be involved in the HSP90 binding of other co chaperones: 5) Both proteins show interaction with the replication initiation protein CDC6. The above observations therefore lead us to suggest that, like Pit47 in Drosophila, TTC4 serves a function linking HSP90 activity and DNA replication in human cells. The role of heat shock proteins in eukaryotes has not been previously investigated although important roles for this class of proteins have been seen in both eukaryotic viruses (eg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Campbell1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Liu1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and prokaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Konieczny1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. We have seen two notable differences between the proteins. Firstly Dpit47 is upregulated in ovaries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Crevel1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> whereas TTC4 is not. The significance of this observation remains unclear. In addition the Drosophila protein interacts with the large subunit of the DNA polymerase alpha, however the analogous interaction was not seen for the human protein. This interaction may represent a difference between the two species. However even in Drosophila the CDC6 interaction is significantly stronger than the polymerase interaction, therefore we cannot rule out the possibility that the interaction exists in human cells but cannot be detected because of decreased affinity.</p><p>Data presented in this paper also suggests that TTC4 is involved in the development or progression of cancer. A role for TTC4 in melanoma had already been suggested, since mutations seen in the gene in patient-derived samples and cell lines, seemed to correlate with increased invasiveness). Our data suggests that in addition to structural changes in the protein, melanoma lines contain more TTC4 protein than melanocytes. Furthermore increases in TTC4 protein levels are also observed in a number of other tumour derived cell lines compared to normal cells and tissues. It is therefore possible to suggest that an increased level of TTC4 contributes to the development of a variety of different tumours. An increased level of Dpit47 has also been reported in brain tumours in flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Loop1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> A caveat to this argument is that since TTC4 is related to cell stress proteins, it is possible that the increased levels are a response to the abnormal state of the cells. Increases in other stress related proteins have been reported in tumour cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Franzen1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Although we cannot rule this out, we have seen that the levels of Dpit47 do not increase significantly in response to heat shock (GC and SC unpublished data). Despite the observed correlations between altered TTC4 behaviour and cancer progression we cannot yet define a precise role for the protein in this process. We do not know if the TTC4 protein observed by Western blot represents wild type protein, as TTC4 bearing point mutations similar to those reported for melanomas would not be distinguishable from wild type proteins on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We do not know the function of TTC4 in normal cells. Nor do we know at what stage during the development of the cell lines the amplification has taken place. Such information is necessary in order to propose a meaningful model for TTC4 action during tumour development.</p><p>Although the precise role for TTC4 in tumour development is not clear, it may be partly related to a loss of protein interactions. Two of the naturally occurring TTC4 point mutations cause the protein to lose its interaction with hCDC6. Only one of these amino acids is fully conserved in the Drosophila protein but we have observed (GC and SC unpublished results) that mutation of this amino acid in Pit47 destroys its interaction with the Drosophila CDC6. We cannot say that the loss of the interaction with CDC6 is the precise cause of the defect, since the region into which the mutations map is likely to be involved in interactions with a number of proteins. (For instance the same region of pit47 is needed for interaction with DNA polymerase (David Loebel and SC unpublished observation)). In addition interaction of TTC4 with other cellular proteins has also been reported (e.g. TFIIIh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Moir1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> and MSL/hampin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Dmitriev1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. However CDC6 is an attractive candidate for this effect. It has a well defined role in the initiation of DNA replication, where it is necessary for the formation of the pre-replication complex. It also has a less well understood role in stalling the progression of cells from the S to M phase of the cell cycle if DNA replication is not complete <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Oehlmann1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-ClayFarrace1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Piatti1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001737-Crevel2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.
