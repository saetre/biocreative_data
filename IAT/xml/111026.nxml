The WG disease appears as severe vasculitis in different organs (e.g. kidney, nose and lung). Little is known about the expression and distribution of PR-3 in the lung. We found that PR-3 is expressed in normal lung tissue and is upregulated in lung tissue of patients with WG. Interestingly, the parenchymal cells (pneumocytes type I and II) and macrophages, and not the neutrophils, express PR-3 most strongly and may contribute to lung damage in patients with WG via direct interaction with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antobodies (ANCA).

An increasing number of physiological and pathological properties of PR-3 have been reported. PR-3 has broad proteolytic activity and degrades a variety of extracellular matrix proteins, including fibronectin, type IV collagen and laminin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. PR-3 is identical to myeloblastin, which is a growth-promoting protein from myeloid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Via a nonproteolytic mechanism, PR-3 has potent antimicrobial activity both against bacteria and fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. PR-3 was recently shown to induce apoptosis in cultured human endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. PR-3 is also identical to the target antigen (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies with a cytoplasmic staining pattern [c-ANCA]) associated with some systemic vasculitides such as WG and microscopic polyarteritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It is not yet known whether antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are directly involved in the pathogenesis of WG or are merely an epiphenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>It has previously been thought that PR-3 expression was confined to the promyelocytic/myelocytic stage of hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, other cells are also capable of <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of PR-3 mRNA. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies revealed that PR-3 expression can be induced by cytokines in human endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The lung is the organ most frequently involved in WG, and in some cases it is the only organ affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

The following primers were used in this study: PR-3 'sense', 5'-ATC-GTGGGCGGGCACGAGGCG (at the beginning of exon 2, corresponding to bases +82 to +101 of the cDNA); and PR-3 'antisense', 5'-GCGGCCAGGGAACGAAAGTGCA (at the end of exon 4, corresponding to bases +553 to +582). The expected size of the fragment was 500 base pairs. The cDNA fragment was extracted and purified from a preparative gel using the Wizard PCR preps DNA purification system (Promega A 7170, CA, USA) and subcloned into the polylinker site of bluescript SK+ (Stratagene, CA, USA).</p><p>Antisense and sense RNA probes were transcribed by T3 and T7 RNA polymerase using a commercially available RNA transcription kit, according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer (Stratagene).

Double-staining with markers for granulocytes and macrophages revealed that the majority of the PR-3 mRNA-positive cells were different from these cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Only a few CD68-positive and CD15-positive cells also showed a signal for PR-3 mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In situ</italic> hybridization for PR-3 mRNA in lung tissue of WG patients</title><p>We studied lung tissue from five patients with histologically and clinically proven WG and lung involvement. We found a very pronounced PR-3 expression throughout the whole slide in all cases. In comparison with the normal lung tissue where the PR-3 expression was confined to just a few spots, the expression in WG tissue was nearly ubiquitous (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). We also observed a strong positive PR-3 mRNA signal at the sites of granulomas, inflammatory infiltration and vasculitis (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">3</xref>).</p><p>To obtain a semiquantitative estimation of PR-3 expression difference, we counted all cells positive for PR-3 mRNA. We found an approximately double to threefold PR-3 expression in WG tissues compared with normal lung tissue (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of PR-3 mRNA-positive cells in WG tissue</title><p>We found PR-3 mRNA expression mostly in pneumocytes type I and II. In comparison with normal tissue, however, there was a higher number of infiltrating, PR-3 expressing cells, different from pneumocytes.</p><p>Double-staining with different markers (CD20, CD3, CD15, and CD68) for inflammatory cells such as B cells, T cells, granulocytes and macrophages helped in the characterization of these cells. We detected B cells in some secondary lymphoid follicles and a few scattered in the tissue. T cells were virtually absent in the tissue. The B cells and T cells did not express PR-3 mRNA at all. Apart from some PR-3 mRNA expressing granulocytes, most of these infiltrating PR-3 mRNA expressing cells were macrophages (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">4</xref>). We found this kind of distribution of PR-3 mRNA expressing cells at sites of inflammatory infiltration, granulomas and vasculitis. At the site of vasculitis, we detected PR-3 mRNA-positive cells that were different from inflammatory cells. From their histopathological appearance, these cells could be endothelial cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of the PR-3 protein in normal lung and WG tissue</title><p>To visualize the PR-3 protein expression, we performed immunohistological experiments with a monoclonal antibody (WGM2) from mice, specific for PR-3.</p><p>We found the PR-3 protein in only a few cells in normal lung tissue. According to the strong PR-3 mRNA expression, we also found an increased PR-3 protein expression in WG tissue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The diagnosis and classification of WG and related vasculitides were advanced considerably by characterization of serum antibodies that react with PR-3 (c-ANCA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It is not yet known whether ANCA are directly involved in the pathogenesis of WG or are merely an epiphenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. One of the unresolved issues is the inability to explain the nonrandom, selected organ injury that defines the WG vasculitis and the concurrent, seemingly random, nature of injury within 'targeted' organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Little is known about the expression and distribution of PR-3 in the normal lung and in the lung tissue of patients with WG.</p><p>To contribute to this little-known issue, we examined the PR-3 expression in normal lung and lung tissue of WG patients, as the lung is the most frequent organ involved in WG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In normal lung tissue, mainly pneumocytes type I and type II and just a few granulocytes and macrophages express PR-3. We could detect the PR-3 mRNA expression in pneumocytes especially at sites with an increased number of infiltrating macrophages. Speculatively, these cells could be responsible for initiating PR-3 mRNA expression; probably through changing the microenvironmental cytokine levels. Cytokines like interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, secreted from macrophages, can induce PR-3 mRNA in nonhematopoietic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The different expression of PR-3 in pneumocytes could also be due to variations of transcription factors. One possible candidate gene could be PU.1, which regulates the PR-3 transcription in B cells and macrophages. The expression in other nonhematopoietic cells, in particular pneumocytes, has not been extensively investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although expressed in a very small amount in normal lung tissue, a question concerning the function of PR-3 in normal lung arose, since the occurrence of a proteolytic enzyme like PR-3 should not be favorable in this tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that PR-3 could also play a role in microbiologic defense, since the enzyme also has an antimicrobial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Further studies are clearly needed to elucidate the function of PR-3 in pneumocytes.</p><p>After we had proven that PR-3 mRNA is expressed in normal lung tissue, we questioned whether the expression pattern is different in the lung tissue of WG patients. The examined specimens of patients with WG showed strong PR-3 mRNA expression, with a double to threefold PR-3 mRNA increase compared with normal lung tissue. Similar to our findings in normal lung tissue, we could demonstrate in lung tissue of WG patients that PR-3 is mostly expressed in pneumocytes type I and type II. PR-3 expression was pronounced at sites of inflammatory infiltration, vasculitis and granulomas. In comparison with normal lung tissue, however, there was a higher number of infiltrating PR-3 expressing cells, which were not pneumocytes.</p><p>Apart from some PR-3 expressing granulocytes, most of the infiltrating PR-3 expressing cells were macrophages. One explanation for the occurrence of PR-3-positive macrophages in inflammatory tissue is the invasion of circulating monocytes to inflammatory sites. Just <italic>et al</italic>. showed an upregulation of PR-3 mRNA expression especially in circulating monocytes, but not in neutrophils, in patients with cystic fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We found PR-3 mRNA expression in and around vascular structures and vasculitic lesions, where most of the infiltrating cells were characterized as macrophages. However, a few cells seemed to be endothelial cells. This is in line with our recent findings of <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of PR-3 in endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. On the contrary, most endothelial cells (even at multiple sites of acute vasculitis with inflammatory cells, invading the vessel and the surrounding tissue), were negative for PR-3 mRNA. Recent studies on the kinetics and stability of PR-3 transcripts revealed PR-3 mRNA expression is only transiently upregulated in endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>The histological features within the WG specimens varied considerably with different inflammatory infiltrates and with or without granulomas. The only apparent issue the WG specimens have in common is the upregulation of PR-3 throughout the whole specimen. The upregulation of PR-3 in the lung of WG patients may therefore reflect the selected organ injury, whereas the histological heterogeneity may represent a multiplicity of concurrent immune responses to a unique disease precipitant like PR-3.</p><p>As it is most probable that pneumocytes, vascular endothelial cells and renal epithelial cells are no longer only innocent bystanders but active participants in inflammatory reactions of autoimmune vasculitides such as WG, it is very important to study the expression pattern of PR-3 in other organs or tissues that are involved in the manifestation pattern of WG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Schwarting <italic>et al</italic>. showed the <italic>in vitro</italic> expression of PR-3 mRNA in tubular epithelial cells and glomerular epithelial cells of the kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments in the kidney revealed a PR-3 expression in distal tubular epithelial cells and in the glomerulum. The PR-3 mRNA expressed by human glomerular epithelial cells correlates with crescent formation in patients with WG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>We thus envision that the upregulation of PR-3 in parenchymal lung tissue in patients with WG, probably through an altered cytokine pattern, can lead to PR-3/ ANCA-mediated lung damage. Further <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments and functional studies with pneumocytes will show whether the interaction of anti-PR-3 antibodies with pneumocytes will also activate signal transduction events or the expression of chemokines or adhesion molecules.</p><p>In conclusion, we report for the first time that PR-3 mRNA, the target antigen for c-ANCA, is expressed by normal lung parenchymal cells and is upregulated in lung tissue of WG patients. PR-3 mRNA may therefore contribute to lung damage in WG and other ANCA-associated diseases via direct interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANCA = antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies; APAAP = alkaline phosphatase&#x02013;antialkaline phosphatase; c-ANCA = antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies with a cytoplasmic staining pattern; PR-3 = proteinase-3; WG = Wegener's granulomatosis; RT-PCR = reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank Ms Huong Becker for excellent technical assistance and Dr E Csernok, Bad Bramstedt, for providing the monoclonal anti-PR-3 antibody WGM2.</p></sec></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>NV</given-names></name><name><surname>Wehner</surname><given-names>NG</given-names></name><name><surname>Marshall</surname><given-names>BC</given-names></name><name><surname>Gray</surname><given-names>WR</given-names></name><name><surname>Gray</surname><given-names>BH</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoidal</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Characterization of proteinase-3 (PR-3), a neutrophil serine proteinase.
