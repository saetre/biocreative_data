In this paper, we report the isolation and sequencing of the X. laevis TFIIIA gene. The gene is approximately 11 kb in length and consists of 9 coding segments separated by 8 introns. A sequence of 30 amino acid residues is known to repeat imperfectly 9 times in tandem within the TFIIIA protein, and Miller et al. (EMBO J. 4, 1609-1614, 1985) proposed that TFIIIA evolved by duplication of a primordial 30 amino acid residue unit. Our results from DNA sequence analysis support their proposal by showing that some of the exon-intron boundaries correspond closely to the repeating unit. We also found that the 5' flanking sequence of the TFIIIA gene contains a TATA box (TATATAA) at position -32 and a CAAT box (GCCAATCC) at position -96 and that the site of polyadenylation is 255 residues 3' of the stop codon. Finally, we have shown that the coding sequence of the TFIIIA gene is significantly polymorphic.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00274-0256.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2187"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00274-0257.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2188"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00274-0258.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2189"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00274-0259.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2190"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00274-0260.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2191"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00274-0261.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2192"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00274-0262.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2193"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00274-0263.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2194"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00274-0264.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2195"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00274-0265.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2196"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00274-0266.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2197"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00274-0267.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2198"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00274-0268.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2199"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00274-0269.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2200"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
