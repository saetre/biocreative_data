In this study, we investigated the expression, localization, and associated biological activity of the least-studied PIP4K isoform, PIP4K&#x003b3;. Quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization revealed that compared with PIP4K&#x003b1; and PIP4K&#x003b2;, PIP4K&#x003b3; is expressed at exceptionally high levels in the kidney, especially the cortex and outer medulla. A specific antibody was raised to PIP4K&#x003b3;, and immunohistochemistry with this and with antibodies to specific kidney cell markers showed a restricted expression, primarily distributed in epithelial cells in the thick ascending limb and in the intercalated cells of the collecting duct. In these cells, PIP4K&#x003b3; had a vesicular appearance, and transfection of kidney cell lines revealed a partial Golgi localization (primarily the matrix of the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi) with an additional presence in an unidentified vesicular compartment. In contrast to PIP4K&#x003b1;, bacterially expressed recombinant PIP4K&#x003b3; was completely inactive but did have the ability to associate with active PIP4K&#x003b1; in vitro.

Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PtdIns5P) is the most recent polyphosphoinositide to be found, first identified as the primary substrate for the type II PtdInsP kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>). Here these enzymes are referred to as PIP4Ks (consistent with their substrate specificity as PtdIns5P 4-kinases), although it should be noted that gene nomenclature still refers to them as <italic>PIP5K2</italic>s. As a minor component of cell polyphosphoinositides, it is suggested that PtdIns5P either provides a specific lipid pool for a (minor) localized production of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> or that it is a signaling molecule in its own right. Suggested functions include nuclear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>), insulin signaling, and protein kinase regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>) and phosphatase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>).</p><p>PtdIns5P can be synthesized from PtdIns by a PtdIns 5-kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>) or by dephosphorylation from PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> or PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>). The main route of PtdIns5P metabolism is via PIP4Ks, which are represented in vertebrates by three characterized isoforms, &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x003b3;. PIP4K&#x003b1; is found predominantly in the cytosol and can be recruited to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>). PIP4K&#x003b2; is localized to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>), where there is evidence that it regulates PtdIns5P levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>), probably in concert with type I PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> 4-phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>), although it has also been seen to associate with the cytosolic TNF receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>). As cellular PtdIns5P levels are modified in response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>), to bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>), to receptor-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>), and during cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>), the ability of the PIP4Ks to localize to specific compartments, or to shuttle between them, may be intrinsic to their function.</p><p>The third isoform, PIP4K&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>), has not yet been associated with a cellular function, either related to production of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> or to the attenuation of PtdIns5P. In the present study, we have extensively characterized the tissue distribution of all of the PIP4K isoforms and found an exceptionally high level of PIP4K&#x003b3; expression in the kidney. We have further investigated the localization within this organ of PIP4K&#x003b3;, using a specific antibody to this isoform, and found that it is remarkably confined to specific cell populations, where it is localized to vesicular structures. Transfection experiments with PIP4K&#x003b3; suggest that these may be derived from the Golgi apparatus. Our results suggest that PIP4K&#x003b3; may be involved in vesicle trafficking in specific kidney cells and that this would imply a specialized function for this enzyme.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>PIP4K cloning.</title><p><italic>PIP5K2</italic> genes were amplified from a whole human brain marathon-ready cDNA library (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA) using gene-specific primers (<italic>PIP5K2A</italic> forward: 5&#x02032;-ATGGCGACCCCCGGCAACCTAGGGTC-3&#x02032; and reverse: 5&#x02032;-TTACGTCAAGATGTGGCCAATAAAGTC-3&#x02032;; <italic>PIP5K2B</italic> forward: 5&#x02032;-ATGTCGTCCAACTGCACCAGCACCAC-3&#x02032; and reverse: 5&#x02032;-CTACGTCAGGATGTTGGACATAAAC-3&#x02032;; and <italic>PIP5K2C</italic> forward: 5&#x02032;-ATGGCGTCCTCCTCGGTCCCACCAG-3&#x02032; and reverse: 5&#x02032;-TTAGGCAAAGATGTTGGTAATAAAATC-3&#x02032;).

Spectral separation was also utilized to remove significant autofluorescence from the kidney tissue in immunofluorescence experiments (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). Analysis of whole kidney sections confirmed that PIP4K&#x003b3; was expressed throughout this organ (data not shown). Detailed examination of representative regions of the kidney at high resolution indicated that the positive signal was seen to be concentrated in the outer medulla (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>), confirming the results obtained for transcript expression (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>), with much less signal being observed in the cortical labyrinth. This signal was restricted to whole regions of specific tubules, which could be visualized using sequential confocal imaging at 2-&#x003bc;m intervals throughout a 20-&#x003bc;m cryosectioned tissue slice (data not shown). The PIP4K&#x003b3;-expressing tubules were present in both the cortical medullary rays and the inner and outer stripe of the outer medulla but were absent from the tubules of the inner medulla (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>).

The absence of PIP4K&#x003b3; in cortical tubules with a significant brush-border lumen lining (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>) or coincident with the water channel AQP1 (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>), a marker for the proximal convoluted tubule and thin descending limb of the loop of Henle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>), suggested that expression was restricted to the distal part of the nephron. PIP4K&#x003b3;-positive tubules also expressed Tamm-Horsfall protein in the outer medulla (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>D&#x02013;F</italic>), which suggested that PIP4K&#x003b3; is localized to cells in the thick ascending limb (TAL) of the loop of Henle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>). The presence of PIP4K&#x003b3;-positive tubules in the cortex and outer medulla (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>G</italic> and <italic>H</italic>), but not in the inner medulla (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>I</italic></xref>), and distinct from tubules expressing the collecting duct marker AQP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>), confirmed that PIP4K&#x003b3; was mainly expressed in TAL. Interestingly, isolated PIP4K&#x003b3;-positive cells were also localized to the collecting duct but were spatially differentiated from AQP2, which selectively stained principal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>). This suggested that PIP4K&#x003b3; was also localized to intercalated cells in cortical and medullary collecting ducts (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>J&#x02013;L</italic>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>PIP4K&#x003b3; has a distinct subcellular compartmentalization.</title><p>Tubule sections of medullary TAL showed a distinct concentration of PIP4K&#x003b3; around the lumen (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, <italic>A</italic>&#x02013;<italic>D</italic>). Analysis of a pool of cross-sectioned tubules with a diameter of 23&#x02013;25 &#x003bc;m gave an average fluorescence profile that indicated a sixfold increase of signal within 3 &#x003bc;m of the apical membrane of tubule cells, compared with the basolateral membrane (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>E</italic></xref>). Higher magnification of these cells suggested that PIP4K&#x003b3; might be present in a vesicular compartment (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>). To further investigate this compartmentalization, PIP4K&#x003b3; expression was studied in kidney-derived cell lines, but because endogenous levels of enzyme were not visible by immunocytochemistry in these cells, overexpressed protein levels were required for colocalization experiments. Cells expressing green fluorescent protein-tagged PIP4K&#x003b3; were stained with antibodies against different cellular markers (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). PIP4K&#x003b3; was not seen to associate with markers for defined vesicular compartments such as peroxisomes (catalase), endosomes (EEA1, mannose 6-phosphate receptor), or lysosomes (lgp110) or with markers for structural components such as tubulin or actin (data not shown). In our experiments, PIP4K&#x003b3; was also not seen to associate with endoplasmic reticulum markers &#x0005b;calreticulin (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref>) and BiP&#x0005d; in contrast with the suggested endoplasmic reticulum localization seen by Itoh et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>). PIP4K&#x003b3; did, however, show a partial colocalization with a number of Golgi apparatus markers (golgin160, TGN38, p115, and p58K), most notably the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi marker GM130 (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>). Golgi dispersal by treatment of cells with Brefeldin A still retained partial colocalization of GM130 with the PIP4K&#x003b3; signal (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>C</italic></xref>) but not with mannosidase II, a Golgi lumen protein, suggesting that the association was with the matrix component of this organelle (data not shown).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Lipid kinase activity of PIP4K&#x003b3;.</title><p>PIP4K, overexpressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells and purified by metal-affinity resin chromatography, was used as a source of enzyme for in vitro kinase assays.

Using immunoprecipitation experiments with recombinant protein, we were able to show that PIP4K&#x003b3; can associate with PIP4K&#x003b1; strongly enough to be selectively purified with a PIP4K&#x003b1;-specific antibody in vitro (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DICUSSION</title><p>In this study, we investigated the expression, localization and associated biological activity of PIP4K&#x003b3;. We discovered a unique and restricted localization for this PIP4K in kidney tissue and suggest that this has implications for the physiological function of this isoform.</p><p>We have shown that the comparative mRNA expression levels of all three isoforms are significant in brain, where they have a different spatial distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>). PIP4K&#x003b1; is the most active of the three isoforms in vitro but has a comparably low mRNA expression in most of the tissues that we tested and is the most abundant isoform in the spleen, probably reflecting its role in hematocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). The PIP4K&#x003b2; isoform mRNA is highly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle cells, consistent with initial observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>) and providing a link to insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). We have confirmed the original observation that PIP4K&#x003b3; is highly expressed in kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>) and also observe high mRNA expression levels in brain, heart, and testis compared with other tissues. Our detection of endogenous PIP4K&#x003b3; protein in tissues is consistent with these transcription levels, also suggesting that PIP4K&#x003b3; is abundant in the ovary and may be processed in heart tissue. The distribution of the PIP4Ks across a range of different tissues, and the observed differences in subcellular localization and intrinsic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>), would suggest that specialized functions could be attributed to each and hence to the role of PtdIns(5)P in these locations.</p><p>Peptide analysis of the sequence of PIP4K&#x003b3; predicts that this protein would not be targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum or plasma membrane due to the absence of a recognized signal peptide, which is consistent with our observation that PIP4K&#x003b3;, when overexpressed in cells, is partially colocalized to the structural component of the Golgi apparatus. Roles for PtdIns3P and PtdIns4P in membrane trafficking are established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>), but the recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>) of a Golgi-localized phospholipid-inositol phosphatase with a substrate preference for PtdIns5P presents the intriguing possibility that this phosphoinositide is also present in cellular vesicles. PIP4K&#x003b3; also has a role in actin remodeling during endocytic transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>), and PtdIns5P levels have been associated with this and with vesicle translocation to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>). PIP4K&#x003b3; could be recruited to the external surface of a specific microsomal compartment to modify the PtdIns5P signal or to synthesize PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>The restricted expression of PIP4K&#x003b3; within the kidney may be significant within the context of the specialized function of different regions of the nephron. Our experiments indicate that PIP4K&#x003b3; is present in cells constituting the TAL and is also restricted to intercalated cells in the collecting duct and appears to have a similar subcellular localization in these cell types as that recently observed for members of the Arf GTPase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>), which have known roles in membrane trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>). These regions are predominantly concerned with homeostasis by active ion transport and pH regulation and contain a large number of channels and transporters specific to these tasks (for reviews see Refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>). Phosphoinositide regulation of both the trafficking to the plasma membrane and the activity of various collecting duct-localized channels has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>), but a specific role for PIP4K&#x003b3; in this process has yet to be established.</p><p>PIP4K&#x003b3; has been shown to have PtdIns5P 4-kinase activity when immunoprecipitated from mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>), and the recombinant protein, purified from <italic>E. coli</italic>, is inactive, suggesting that a eukaryotic modification to PIP4K&#x003b3; is required for kinase activation. However, due to the ability of the PIP4Ks to dimerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>) in vivo, we also cannot rule out the possibility that the observed activity associated to PIP4K&#x003b3; is attributable to PIP4K heterodimers. This raises the possibility that PIP4K&#x003b3; is able to recruit PtdIns5P 4-kinase activity (in the form of PIP4K&#x003b1;) to specific compartments, based on the potential ability to act as a scaffolding protein.</p><p>The roles of PtdIns5P, PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and hence the PIP4Ks, in kidney function are unknown.
