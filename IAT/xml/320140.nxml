The gamma genes of these three chromosomes were cloned and the unusual 5' A gamma gene and one of the unusual 3' G gamma genes were partially sequenced. Both of these unusual genes differ from the genes normally found at their respective locations by a nucleotide substitution at the site of the single coding region difference between normal G gamma and A gamma genes. In both cases, the substitution is identical to the nucleotide found at that position in the normal neighboring gene. The unusual 3' G gamma gene also differs from normal A gamma genes at two other nucleotide positions, but both differences appear to be "private" or exclusive to this particular gene. These unusual fetal globin gene arrangements could have arisen from point mutations or from gene conversions of limited extent, the boundaries of which have been determined for all three chromosomes.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00336-0111-a" xlink:role="7027"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00336-0107.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7023"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00336-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7024"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00336-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7025"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00336-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7026"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00336-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7027"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00336-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7028"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00336-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7029"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00336-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7030"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00336-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7031"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00336-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7032"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00336-0117.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7033"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00336-0118.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7034"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
