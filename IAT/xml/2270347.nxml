Novel contributions have come from familial forms of PD caused by alterations in genes with apparently unrelated physiological functions. The gene coding for alpha-synuclein (&#x003b1;-syn) (PARK1) has been investigated as &#x003b1;-syn is located in Lewy bodies (LB), intraneuronal inclusions in the <italic>substantia nigra</italic> (SN) of PD patients. A-syn has neuroprotective chaperone-like and antioxidant functions and is involved in dopamine storage and release. DJ-1 (PARK7), another family-PD-linked gene causing an autosomal recessive form of the pathology, shows antioxidant and chaperone-like activities too.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>The present study addressed the question whether &#x003b1;-syn and DJ-1 interact functionally, with a view to finding some mechanism linking DJ-1 inactivation and &#x003b1;-syn aggregation and toxicity. We developed an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of &#x003b1;-syn toxicity in the human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-BE, influencing DJ-1 and &#x003b1;-syn intracellular concentrations by exogenous addition of the fusion proteins TAT-&#x003b1;-syn and TAT-DJ-1; DJ-1 was inactivated by the siRNA method. On a micromolar scale TAT-&#x003b1;-syn aggregated and triggered neurotoxicity, while on the nanomolar scale it was neuroprotective against oxidative stress (induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or 6-hydroxydopamine). TAT-DJ-1 increased the expression of HSP70, while DJ-1 silencing made SK-N-BE cells more susceptible to oxidative challenge, rendering TAT-&#x003b1;-syn neurotoxic at nanomolar scale, with the appearance of TAT-&#x003b1;-syn aggregates.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion/Significance</title><p>DJ-1 inactivation may thus promote &#x003b1;-syn aggregation and the related toxicity, and in this model HSP70 is involved in the antioxidant response and in the regulation of &#x003b1;-syn fibril formation.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative, multifactorial movement disorder affecting about 3&#x00025; of the population over 65 years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001884-DiMonte1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001884-Fahn1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Both proteins have been linked to familial early-onset forms of PD, but it is still not clear why pathogenic mutations in these two apparently unrelated molecules lead ultimately to the same clinical features.</p><p>DJ-1 role was investigated after increasing its intracellular expression level by exogenous addition of a TAT-fused recombinant protein, while its expression was downregulated by siRNA. These experiments outlined a major role of DJ-1 in the antioxidant response, as its overexpression correlated positively with a survival outcome. This protective function was not limited to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> challenge but was also clear against 6-OHDA, a neurotoxin whose noxious effect reproduces what happens in the dopamine-selective environment of PD neurodegeneration. Moreover, the antioxidant effect was specific, as neither a recombinant DJ-1 without the TAT fused-sequence (that was consequently unable to enter the cell) nor a siRNA negative control (that did not affect the level of DJ-1 mRNA) prevented the oxidative damage. Starting from these data, it is reasonable to conclude that one effect of DJ-1 inactivation by genetic alterations is to impair its prevention of oxidative stress, thus exposing dopaminergic neurons to exogenous or endogenous deleterious stimuli.</p><p>Zhou et al. suggested that DJ-1-mediated protective action against &#x003b1;-syn (A53T) overexpression ant toxicity involved HSP70 up-regulation, but this mechanism was not reported under oxidative stress conditions where a DJ-1-dependent increase of glutathione cellular levels was highlighted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001884-Zhou2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. We found an increase of HSP70 both at mRNA and protein level after DJ-1 overexpression obtained by adding TAT-DJ-1. This effect missed using TAT-GFP or TAT-&#x003b1;-syn(1-97) fusion proteins, suggesting that HSP70 increase was not solely due to a generic cell response to molecular crowding after TAT-mediated protein delivery. HSP70 upregulation might mediate also TAT-DJ-1 antioxidant action, even if in our experiments under oxidative stress condition we have not directly demonstrate this aspect. Moreover, our data do not rule out the possible involvement of other DJ-1-mediated antioxidant mechanisms, like glutathione increase.</p><p>We have already demonstrated an antioxidant function of TAT-administered &#x003b1;-syn in rat PC12 cells, where it prevented H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> oxidative damage by raising the HSP70 protein level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001884-Albani1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we have extended this protective property to 6-OHDA, providing evidence that &#x003b1;-syn is an important neuroprotective element whose deficiency due to aggregation may concur in triggering PD.</p><p>An important issue addressed by our experiments was the possible functional relationship between DJ-1 and &#x003b1;-syn, in order to verify whether they do indeed belong to the same antioxidant pathway. When we downregulated DJ-1 expression by siRNA, TAT-&#x003b1;-syn alone was no longer able to protect cells from the oxidative damage, suggesting that DJ-1 presence is needed for an efficient antioxidant response, probably as a consequence of its positive action on HSP70 expression. So, when DJ-1 is inactivated this condition is deleterious not only directly but also indirectly as it negatively affects a second cell-protective mechanism based on &#x003b1;-syn neuroprotective function.</p><p>A second, unexpected but relevant consequence of DJ-1 downregulation on TAT-&#x003b1;-syn was that in this situation TAT-&#x003b1;-syn was not only unable to counteract the oxidative challenge but it became toxic by itself even in the absence of oxidative stress and starting from nanomolar intracellular concentration that was usually protective. As &#x003b1;-syn toxicity is generally considered a consequence of its aggregation, we verified that when TAT-&#x003b1;-syn had deleterious properties an aggregation pattern was detectable. In fact, only in the presence of DJ-1 siRNA we were able to identify TAT-&#x003b1;-syn oligomeric aggregates by Western blotting. This DJ-1 effect on TAT-&#x003b1;-syn nanomolar toxicity was specific as it could not be reproduced by recombinant DJ-1 (a purified form of DJ-1 without the TAT sequence) or siRNA negative control and was reversed by addition of TAT-DJ-1 after DJ-1 silencing. Moreover, when DJ-1 was silenced, TAT-&#x003b1;-syn at nanomolar scale was unable to induce HSP70 upregulation, an aspect that might contribute to TAT-&#x003b1;-syn aggregation and toxicity. A clear molecular mechanism leading to TAT-&#x003b1;-syn aggregation in presence of DJ-1 silencing by siRNA is not evident by our experiments. We can rule out that TAT-&#x003b1;-syn toxicity was just a consequence of increased oxidative stress after DJ-1 downregulation as an increased oxidative insult was unable to trigger TAT-&#x003b1;-syn 0.5 &#x000b5;M toxicity, thus suggesting that DJ-1 directly modulated &#x003b1;-syn aggregation properties. However, considering our data reporting an increased monomeric TAT-&#x003b1;-syn availability inside cells in presence of DJ-1 siRNA, we can suggest that DJ-1 downregulation might negatively affect TAT-&#x003b1;-syn degradation pathway, with a consequent TAT-&#x003b1;-syn accumulation that can promote its self-aggregation. So, in the presence of a reduced amount of DJ-1 TAT-&#x003b1;-syn aggregation can start at a nanomolar scale that is normally protective and too low to trigger aggregation by itself.</p><p>The fact that in the same condition we were unable to detect any amyloid-like aggregates by thioflavin-T staining might depend on the extent of &#x003b1;-syn aggregation. In fact, the formation of &#x003b1;-syn immunoreactive bands was limited to molecular weights 40-50 KDa, with no higher-molecular-weight oligomers, suggesting that larger amyloid fibrils probably require a more concentrated TAT-&#x003b1;-syn starting substrate. In accordance with this interpretation, Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001884-Zhou2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> did find higher-molecular-weight &#x003b1;-syn &#x0005b;A53T&#x0005d; aggregates but after strong &#x003b1;-syn overexpression due to adenoviral infection. However, even without large &#x003b1;-syn amyloid aggregates cell toxicity was evident, in agreement with the hypothesis that the early step of &#x003b1;-syn fibril formation is responsible for its toxicity.</p><p>In relation to PD pathogenesis, an inactivating DJ-1 genetic alteration might first of all prevent its direct antioxidant action but it might be also important in promoting &#x003b1;-syn aggregation and the related toxicity, that is accelerated by a pro-oxidant environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001884-Zhou3">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In summary, as schematically depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001884-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>, DJ-1 and &#x003b1;-syn are both involved in the antioxidant response against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and 6-OHDA and HSP70 is a common downstream mediator of the antioxidant properties of these two proteins. A direct mechanistic relationship between &#x003b1;-syn, DJ-1 and HSP70 is not supported by our data. In fact, TAT-&#x003b1;-syn was able to increase HSP70 level in presence of DJ-1 but TAT-&#x003b1;-syn was unable to increase DJ-1 expression that could in turn promote HSP70 upregulation. A possible interpretation could be that DJ-1 and &#x003b1;-syn promote HSP70 upregulation but at different levels. In fact, TAT-DJ-1 addition increased HSP70 at mRNA and protein expression level, at difference from TAT-&#x003b1;-syn that was unable to modulate HSP70 mRNA, as we have previously demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001884-Albani1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. So, it might happen that TAT-&#x003b1;-syn increases HSP70 protein level by a chaperone-like stabilization mechanism or by an action that reduces HSP70 degradation over time. This might also explain why in absence of DJ-1 TAT-&#x003b1;-syn was unable to increase HSP70 at protein level. In fact, when DJ-1 was downregulated TAT-&#x003b1;-syn formed insoluble aggregates and in this aggregated form it is likely that it was unable to interact with HSP70 and stabilize it. More importantly, we showed that DJ-1 expression is relevant not only for the effect on HSP70 but also in controlling &#x003b1;-syn function which, when there are only small amounts of DJ-1, is shifted from a soluble, neuroprotective condition to an aggregated, neurotoxic context.</p><fig id="pone-0001884-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001884.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the neuroprotective network against oxidative stress mediated by alpha-synuclein (&#x003b1;-syn) and DJ-1.</title><p>Red arrows identify noxious molecular events, while green arrows trace pro-survival cellular mechanisms. The symbol &#x02299; stands for &#x0201c;antagonizes&#x0201d;. The free, soluble form of &#x003b1;-syn can be committed to aggregation and the related toxicity by DJ-1 downregulation (<italic>upper pathway</italic>), maybe through &#x003b1;-syn impaired degradation. In this situation, cell response to oxidative stress is impaired by DJ-1 deficiency, but also by &#x003b1;-syn aggregation-dependent indirect toxicity that prevents the protein neuroprotective role and stops &#x003b1;-syn-mediated HSP70 upregulation at protein level. In addition, &#x003b1;-syn aggregation has a direct toxic effect, probably pro-oxidant, that increases cell damage and triggers a positive feedback loop that promotes further &#x003b1;-syn aggregation. In non-aggregating conditions (<italic>lower pathway</italic>), in the presence of oxidative stress &#x003b1;-syn promotes cell survival and HSP70 up-regulation (Albani et al., 2004 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001884-Albani1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>). In this situation, wild type DJ-1 contributes to keep &#x003b1;-syn in the soluble form.
