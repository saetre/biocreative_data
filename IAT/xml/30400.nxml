Both proteins act together with sequence-specific transcription factors to modify chromatin structure of target genes via their intrinsic acetyltransferase activity directed towards core histones and some transcription factors. So far, p300-related proteins have been described in animals ranging from <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> to humans. In this report, we describe p300&#x0002f;CBP-like polypeptides in the plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Interestingly, homology between animal and plant p300&#x0002f;CBP is largely restricted to a C-terminal segment, about 600 amino acids in length, which encompasses acetyltransferase and E1A-binding domains. We have examined whether this conservation in sequence is paralleled by a conservation in function. The same amino acid residues critical for acetyltransferase activity in human p300 are also critical for the function of one of the plant orthologs. Remarkably, plant proteins bind to the adenovirus E1A protein in a manner recapitulating the binding specificity of mammalian p300&#x0002f;CBP. The striking conservation of an extended segment of p300&#x0002f;CBP suggests that it may constitute a functional entity fulfilling functions that may be essential for all metazoan organisms.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x98398c0.0x8b98640" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank accession no.

Since specific E1A mutants unable to bind p300 have lost the ability to stimulate growth and perturb cell differentiation, p300 has been linked to these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c3">3</xref>). CBP, in turn, has been identified as a coactivator for the cAMP-responsive transcription factor CREB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c4">4</xref>).</p><p> p300 and CBP are endowed with acetyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c6">6</xref>) and interact, in distinct complexes, with numerous transcription factors through several evolutionarily conserved domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c10">10</xref>). In this way, acetyltransferase activity is thought to be recruited to specific promoters and enhancers where acetylation of neighboring nucleosomal histones facilitates access of other components required for transcription. In general, a positive correlation exists between the histone acetylation state of a gene and its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c14">14</xref>). However, in some cases, acetylation can also be associated with repressed chromatin. Acetylation of lysine 12 of histone H4 is specifically found in transcriptionally silenced chromatin in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c15">15</xref>).</p><p> Although histone acetylation is a common feature of eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c18">18</xref>), p300&#x0002f;CBP-related proteins so far appear to be restricted to multicellular organisms (higher eukaryotes) and cannot be found in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c19">19</xref>). This observation suggests that p300&#x0002f;CBP function in pathways specific to metazoan organisms such as cell-to-cell communication in organ development and morphogenesis. This view is supported by the phenotype of mice and flies carrying mutations in their p300 and CBP genes. Mice lacking either p300 or CBP die <italic>in utero</italic> between days 8.5 and 11.5 of gestation and invariably exhibit an open neural tube and frequently heart defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c21">21</xref>). In flies, only one p300&#x0002f;CBP-like gene has been described and mutations in it lead to embryonic lethality. <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos harboring a hypomorphic dCBP allele display a twisted form and show altered expression of genes required for multiple developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c23">23</xref>).</p><p> In this report, we describe plant (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>) orthologs of p300 and CBP that were named <underline>p</underline>300&#x0002f;<underline>C</underline>BP <underline>a</underline>cetyl<underline>t</underline>ransferase-related protein 1&#x02013;4 (PCAT1&#x02013;4). These plant proteins show a striking conservation in sequence of a region encompassing cysteine&#x0002f;histidine-rich domain 2 and 3 (C&#x0002f;H 2 and 3) in human p300&#x0002f;CBP, but they lack bromo- or CREB-binding (KIX) domains. In histone acetyltransferase (HAT) assays, PCAT2 but not PCAT1 is active. Surprisingly, despite the evolutionary distance to their human counterparts, PCAT1 and 2 bind to the adenovirus E1A protein with a specificity that matches that of human p300&#x0002f;CBP. Based on this remarkable conservation, we propose that acetyltransferase (AT) and E1A binding domains form a unit that likely fulfills essential functions in all metazoan organisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>GenBank accession numbers</title><p>h<italic>p300</italic> complete coding sequence, accession no.

Closer inspection showed that sequence similarities are mainly clustered in a 600 amino acid segment encompassing C&#x0002f;H 2 and 3 regions of mammalian p300&#x0002f;CBP. This region harbors AT and E1A-binding domains. Based on this remarkable conservation, the plant proteins were named <underline>p</underline>300&#x0002f;<underline>C</underline>BP <underline>a</underline>cetyl<underline>t</underline>ransferase-related protein 1&#x02013;4 (PCAT1&#x02013;4).

It will be demonstrated below that at least PCAT2 indeed possesses acetyltransferase activity. Outside this segment, no significant homologies are present, with the exception of a stretch of about 60 amino acids near the N-terminus of PCAT2, 3 and 4 exhibiting homology to the first cysteine&#x0002f;histidine-rich region of p300&#x0002f;CBP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke172f1">1</xref>C). Interestingly, none of the PCAT proteins contains a bromodomain and a CREB-binding (KIX) region, both of which are highly conserved among animal p300&#x0002f;CBP proteins. Instead, PCAT1 harbors 11 copies of a repetitive motif that does not display sequence similarity to any other motif.</p><p> Since PCAT1 and 2 protein sequences were derived from hypothetical transcripts assembled by computer from genomic DNA fragments sequenced in the course of the <italic>A.thaliana</italic> genome sequencing project, we wanted to ascertain that mRNAs with the structure of the predicted transcripts indeed existed. A northern blot of total RNA isolated from seedlings, stem, rosette and flowers probed with a PCAT2 fragment showed two hybridizing transcripts of ~5.5 and 7.3 kb (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke172f2">2</xref>A). Both mRNAs are of sufficient length to harbor the complete PCAT2 protein-coding region (4.7 kb). The two transcripts may represent alternatively spliced forms of the PCAT2 mRNA or the larger transcript could be a precursor transcript to the smaller one. To assay for expression of the other PCAT transcripts, selected fragments of all four PCAT mRNAs were individually amplified by RT&#x02013;PCR approach. PCR products were cloned and sequenced. In both PCAT1 and 2 genes, some exons turned out to be incorrectly predicted based on the genomic sequence (see GenBank accession no AF323954 for PCAT2 and Materials and Methods for PCAT1). Similar to their mammalian orthologs, all four PCAT mRNAs are expressed in early stages of development (seedlings) and in the three major tissues (rosette, stem and flowers) of adult <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke172f2">2</xref>B). As a negative control, yeast RNA was amplified with each PCAT primer pair (lane labeled control) and the ubiquitously expressed cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GapC) mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c37">37</xref>) was amplified as a positive control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke172f2">2</xref>B, bottom panel).</p><p> We next examined whether the region of PCAT1 and 2 homologous to the AT domain of hp300&#x0002f;CBP would also be enzymatically active. For this purpose, the AT domain of the two plant proteins was cloned and expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> as a GST fusion protein. For a comparison of relative activity, the AT domain of human p300 was expressed in parallel. Standard HAT assays were performed using core histones as substrate.

The AT domain of PCAT1 was also inactive when produced in a plant environment by <italic>in vitro</italic> translation in a wheat germ extract.

We conclude that at least PCAT2 is a bona fide HAT.</p><p> To assess the relevance of the sequence similarity between the AT domains of human p300 and PCAT2 in closer detail, amino acid residues conserved between plant and human proteins were mutated to alanine residues at three different locations within the AT domains. The residues mutated (FPY in hp300, FAY in AthPCAT2; WY and ML in each hp300 and AthPCAT2, respectively) are indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke172f1">1</xref>B by asterisks at the top of the alignment. Wild-type and mutant AT domains were again expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> as GST-fusion proteins and a HAT assay was performed. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke172f4">4</xref>A demonstrates that mutation of FPY or WY residues abolished AT activity of both human p300 (lanes 3 and 4) and plant PCAT2 (lanes 7 and 8). By contrast, mutation of the residues ML did not affect enzymatic activity of the human p300 AT domain and reduced activity of the plant AT domain by a factor of three. Expression levels of the various GST&#x02013;AT fusion proteins are shown at the bottom of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke172f4">4</xref>A. The result of our mutagenesis suggests that some of the conserved residues are essential for enzymatic activity of both human and plant proteins and emphasizes the significance of the observed sequence similarity.</p><p> The AT domain of CBP has been reported to activate transcription in mammalian cells when fused to the GAL4&#x02013;DBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c27">27</xref>). In these experiments, activation of transcription was correlated with the enzymatic activity of the AT domain. To examine whether the PCAT2 AT domain is also able to stimulate transcription in a manner dependent on AT activity in mammalian cells, we cloned the wild-type and WY-mutated PCAT2 AT domain in-frame to the GAL4&#x02013;DBD. Human U2OS cells were transiently transfected with a GAL4-dependent reporter plasmid and GAL4&#x02013;AT expression plasmids. GAL4&#x02013;CBP AT strongly activated transcription in a manner dependent on acetyltransferase activity since GAL4&#x02013;CBP AT (WY) was inactive (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke172f4">4</xref>B). In comparison, GAL4&#x02013;PCAT2 AT also activated transcription in an acetyltransferase-dependent manner, but less efficiently than the CBP AT domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke172f4">4</xref>B). Considering the results of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke172f4">4</xref>A and B together, the enzymatic activity of the AT domains measured <italic>in vitro</italic> correlates quite well with the transcriptional activity of these domains measured <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p> We next focused on the C&#x0002f;H3 region. Close inspection of the alignment of the C&#x0002f;H3 region revealed that this region is somewhat shorter than previously thought, based on sequence alignments of animal p300&#x0002f;CBP proteins. Some of the cysteine and histidine residues in the N-terminal part of the human p300 C&#x0002f;H3 domain are not conserved in the plant PCAT proteins, suggesting that the core of the C&#x0002f;H3 domain actually begins at hp300 residue 1659.</p><p> The C&#x0002f;H3 region has previously been characterized as a high-affinity binding site for the adenoviral E1A oncoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c38">38</xref>). To test whether the plant C&#x0002f;H3 region has the ability to interact in a manner similar to human p300 with E1A, we produced the C&#x0002f;H3 domain of human p300 and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> PCAT1 and 2 as GST fusion proteins. The purified fusion proteins were incubated with extracts prepared from U2OS cells infected with adenoviruses expressing different E1A versions (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke172f5">5</xref>A for the structure of the expressed E1A proteins). The wild-type virus expresses wild-type 12S E1A, dl312 does not express any E1A due to a deletion including the E1A gene, dl1101 expresses a mutant form of E1A lacking amino acids 4&#x02013;25 (constituting part of the p300 binding site) and dl1107 expresses E1A carrying a mutation in CR2 of E1A (constituting part of the RB protein family binding site). Remarkably, both plant GST&#x02013;PCAT&#x02013;C&#x0002f;H3 fusion proteins recapitulated the binding specificity of human p300 in that they bound to wild-type and dl1107 mutant E1A protein but not to the dl1101 mutant E1A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke172f5">5</xref>B and C, compare lanes 1&#x02013;4 with lanes 9&#x02013;12). These results provide evidence for the existence of a remarkably conserved protein binding surface in the C&#x0002f;H3 domain of human and plant p300&#x0002f;CBP-related proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>So far, p300 and CBP-related proteins have been described in animals but not in plants. This paper closes a gap by characterizing in part plant proteins sharing several of the sequence motifs and functional properties of animal p300&#x0002f;CBP. Remarkably, our analysis points to a highly conserved core segment, encompassing C&#x0002f;H2 and C&#x0002f;H3 domains, which is present in all known p300&#x0002f;CBP proteins. Since unicellular eukaryotes such as the yeast <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> do not contain p300&#x0002f;CBP-related proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c19">19</xref>), we propose that this core segment of p300&#x0002f;CBP fulfills essential functions in the context of processes unique to higher eukaryotes (metazoans) such as cell differentiation and organ development. Such a view is compatible with previous results demonstrating the importance of p300&#x0002f;CBP for animal development. Flies carrying a P element insertion in dCBP, the only known p300&#x0002f;CBP-related protein in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, die at the earliest stages of embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c23">23</xref>) and mice lacking either p300 or CBP die around mid-gestation exhibiting a severe developmental retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c21">21</xref>).</p><p> Interestingly, similar to mice and humans, more than one p300&#x0002f;CBP-like protein exists in the plant <italic>A.thaliana</italic>. While writing this manuscript, another two gene products sharing high sequence similarity with PCAT1 and 2 appeared in the database. These two proteins are referred to as PCAT3 and 4 and are more similar to PCAT2 than PCAT1 (see also Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke172f1">1</xref>). Considering the structural differences, especially between PCAT1 and 2, it is conceivable that the <italic>in vivo</italic> roles of the four AthPCAT proteins may not be entirely overlapping. PCAT2, 3 and 4 are most similar to human p300&#x0002f;CBP in that they possess all three regions rich in cysteine- and histidine residues, including a C&#x0002f;H1 domain (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke172f1">1</xref>C), while PCAT1 only harbors the segment including C&#x0002f;H2 and C&#x0002f;H3 and lacks a C&#x0002f;H1 domain. Also, on a functional level, PCAT2 appears to be more similar than PCAT1 to human p300&#x0002f;CBP in that it exhibits readily detectable HAT activity. This similarity is further underscored by the results of our substitution mutations of amino acid residues conserved between the AT domain of human p300&#x0002f;CBP and plant PCAT2. Both mutations abolishing enzymatic activity of the human protein also eliminate activity of the plant protein.</p><p> Unexpectedly, despite a comparable level of homology (~34&#x00025; identity) between human p300 and plant PCAT1 and 2 AT domains, we were unable to detect any HAT activity associated with PCAT1 in several different <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. This negative result does not rule out that PCAT1 <italic>in vivo</italic> also exhibits acetyltransferase activity. For example, the recombinant PCAT1 fragment produced in <italic>E.coli</italic> or in wheat germ extracts may lack some modifications essential for its enzymatic activity. Alternatively, since our assays used histones as substrate, these proteins may not be the physiologically relevant <italic>in vivo</italic> substrate for PCAT1. Finally, it is possible that the AT domain harbors an important function other than acetyltransferase activity, which could explain sequence conservation.</p><p> In contrast to AT activity, both PCAT 1 and 2 were capable to interact in a specific manner via their C&#x0002f;H3 domain with the adenovirus E1A protein. This result suggests a remarkable conservation in metazoans of aspects of sequence, and maybe also structure, of the C&#x0002f;H3 domain. In mammals, many different factors are known to bind to the C&#x0002f;H3 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c9">9</xref>). Some of the reported C&#x0002f;H3 interacting proteins exhibit enzymatic activity by themselves, such as the acetyltransferase PCAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c39">39</xref>), which also exists in plants, and the protein kinase RSK-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c40">40</xref>). It is likely that cellular proteins conserved between animals and plants exist that bind to the C&#x0002f;H3 domain and exert essential functions.</p><p> The striking conservation of the C&#x0002f;H2 and C&#x0002f;H3 domains, including the intervening sequence, suggests that this segment may represent a functionally linked entity. The C&#x0002f;H3 region of this functional unit, as reported in a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c41">41</xref>), appears to be a critical element, significantly affecting the enzymatic activity of the neighboring core AT region under certain circumstances.</p><p> Remarkably, bromo and CREB binding (KIX) domains appear to be dispensable for the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> p300&#x0002f;CBP orthologs. In addition, human p300 and CBP possess C-terminal to the C&#x0002f;H3 domain, an extended glutamine-rich C-terminus harboring the binding site for another group of acetyltransferases known as SRC-1 or ACTR. This extended C-terminus is completely absent in all four PCAT proteins. The bromodomain has been shown to interact specifically with acetylated lysine and it has been suggested that such an interaction may facilitate binding of proteins containing bromodomains to transcriptionally active chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c42">42</xref>). It is intriguing that AthPCAT proteins can fulfill their functions without a bromodomain. We also note that other <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proteins such as AthGCN5 do contain a bromodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c43">43</xref>). The most well defined interaction partner for the KIX domain is the transcription factor CREB, which also appears to exist in at least some plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c44">44</xref>). Of potential interest is the occurrence of the short repeat motifs in PCAT1, which might substitute for one of the above mentioned motifs.</p><p> Since the first description of HAT activity in plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c45">45</xref>), multiple HATs have been characterized in plants, mostly in maize, and the majority belong to the category of cytoplasmatic HATs. However, members of the nuclear type of HATs have also been identified in plants, such as the above mentioned <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GCN5 or the HATs involved in the embryo germination of <italic>Zea mays</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke172c48">48</xref>). This report shows that apart from the animal kingdom, the plant kingdom also expresses large proteins with several of the key features of animal p300&#x0002f;CBP proteins. It thus appears that p300&#x0002f;CBP-related proteins are common to all multicellular organisms, where they may be involved in functions specific to metazoans such as cell and organ differentiation processes, which require an intricate ability to coordinate cell-to-cell communications.</p></sec><sec><title>NOTE ADDED IN PROOF</title><p>The sequence of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> genome has recently been completed &#x0005b;The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (2000) Analysis of the genome sequence of the flowering plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. <italic>Nature</italic>, <bold>408</bold>, 796&#x02013;815&#x0005d;.
