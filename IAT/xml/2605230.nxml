We now show that CD21-cre&#x02013;mediated deletion of the <italic>Xrcc4</italic> NHEJ gene in p53-deficient peripheral B cells leads to recurrent surface Ig-negative B lymphomas (&#x0201c;CXP lymphomas&#x0201d;). Remarkably, CXP lymphomas arise from peripheral B cells that had attempted both receptor editing (secondary V[D]J recombination of Ig&#x003ba; and Ig&#x003bb; light chain genes) and <italic>IgH</italic> CSR subsequent to <italic>Xrcc4</italic> deletion. Correspondingly, CXP tumors frequently harbored a CSR-based reciprocal chromosomal translocation that fused <italic>IgH</italic> to <italic>c-myc</italic>, as well as large chromosomal deletions or translocations involving <italic>Ig&#x003ba;</italic> or <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic>, with the latter fusing <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> to oncogenes or to <italic>IgH</italic>.

V(D)J recombination is initiated by the RAG1/2 endonuclease, which introduces DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) between V, D, and J segments and flanking recombination signal sequences (RSs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Subsequently, cleaved coding segments are joined to form V(D)J exons and RSs are joined to form RS joins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Both coding and RS joining are performed by classical nonhomologous end-joining (C-NHEJ), which is a major general DSB repair pathway in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Xrcc4 and DNA Ligase IV (Lig4) form a complex that is required for V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). In their absence, coding or RS ends are joined at low frequency, usually with substantial sequence deletion from one or both partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). In mice, <italic>Xrcc4</italic> inactivation results in severe combined immune deficiency owing to inability to complete V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>).</p><p>In progenitor B (pro&#x02013;B) cells in the mouse BM, productive assembly of variable region exons within the IgH locus (<italic>Igh</italic>) on chromosome 12 leads to production of IgH &#x003bc; chains that signal differentiation to the precursor B (pre&#x02013;B) cell stage in which IgL variable region exons are assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Mice, like humans, have two IgL families, termed Ig&#x003ba; and Ig&#x003bb;, which are encoded by <italic>Ig&#x003ba;</italic> and <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> loci that, respectively, lie on chromosomes 6 and 16. Ig&#x003ba; and Ig&#x003bb; expression is &#x0201c;isotype&#x0201d; excluded, such that a given B cell usually expresses either Ig&#x003ba; or Ig&#x003bb;, but not both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). In mice, &#x0223c;95% of mature B lymphocytes are Ig&#x003ba;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, with the remainder being Ig&#x003bb;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. In that context, <italic>Ig&#x003ba;</italic> assembly usually precedes that of <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Thus, most Ig&#x003ba;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells contain <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> in germline configuration, with <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> rearrangements occurring in cells in which both <italic>Ig&#x003ba;</italic> alleles are rearranged out-of-frame or that harbor deletions of the J&#x003ba; segments, &#x003ba; enhancer, and/or C&#x003ba; exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Such deletions usually occur via rearrangement of V&#x003ba;s or an RS heptamer in the J&#x003ba;-C&#x003ba; intron (IRS) to a bona fide RS 25 kb downstream of C&#x003ba; (3&#x02032;RS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Recent analyses suggest that <italic>Ig&#x003ba;</italic> deletions via 3&#x02032;RS rearrangements may play a role in progression to <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>).</p><p>Expression of complete Ig (IgH/IgL) leads to IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B lymphocytes, which ultimately down-regulate RAG expression to enforce allelic exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). However, newly generated BM IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B lymphocytes that express autoreactive B cell receptors can maintain RAG expression and continue to rearrange <italic>IgL</italic> loci to generate new IgL chains in a tolerance process termed &#x0201c;receptor editing&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Receptor editing can replace rearranged <italic>Ig&#x003ba;</italic> loci with secondary productive <italic>Ig&#x003ba;</italic> rearrangements, as well as with nonfunctional <italic>Ig&#x003ba;</italic> rearrangements or <italic>Ig&#x003ba;</italic> deletions that may lead to <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Thus, Ig&#x003bb;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells can be generated developmentally from pre&#x02013;B cells with two nonproductive <italic>Ig&#x003ba;</italic> rearrangements or via receptor editing from immature Ig&#x003ba;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells. Receptor editing is initiated in immature BM B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Yet, several studies suggested <italic>IgL</italic> gene rearrangement, sometimes called &#x0201c;revision,&#x0201d; in mouse and human peripheral B cells, including germinal center B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). However, many peripheral mouse RAG<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B lineage cells are pro&#x02013; or pre&#x02013;B cells that migrate to the periphery after immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), and knock-in reporter studies suggested that although RAG genes are expressed in B cells that have just migrated from the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), they are not reinduced in peripheral B cells once expression is terminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>).</p><p>After antigen stimulation, mature IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> peripheral B cells can undergo IgH class switch recombination (CSR), a recombination/deletion process in which the IgH &#x003bc; constant region exons (C&#x003bc;) are deleted and replaced by one of several sets of downstream C<sub>H</sub> exons (e.g., C&#x003b3;, C&#x003b5;, and C&#x003b1;; referred to as C<sub>H</sub> genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), leading to switching from IgM to another Ig class (e.g., IgG, IgE, or IgA). The activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) initiates CSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>) by deaminating cytidines in switch (S) regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>), which are 1&#x02013;10-kb repetitive sequences located 5&#x02032; of each C<sub>H</sub> gene. AID-generated lesions within the donor S&#x003bc; and a downstream acceptor S region are processed into DSBs, which are end-joined to complete CSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). In contrast to V(D)J recombination, substantial CSR occurs in the absence of Xrcc4 or Lig4 (C-NHEJ) via an alternative end-joining (A-EJ) pathway strongly biased to use microhomology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). However, CSR is significantly impaired in Xrcc4-deficient B cells owing to failure to join broken S regions because up to 20% of Xrcc4-deficient B cells activated for CSR in vitro have <italic>IgH</italic> chromosomal breaks, with a substantial portion participating in chromosomal translocations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>).</p><p>Inactivation of <italic>Xrcc4</italic> in mice results in impaired cellular proliferation and ionizing radiation sensitivity. Xrcc4 deficiency also results in extensive apoptosis of newly generated neurons and late embryonic death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), both of which can be rescued by deficiency for the p53 tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). In this context, p53 monitors the G1 cell cycle checkpoint, signaling apoptosis of certain cell types, such as neurons and progenitor lymphocytes, which harbor persistent DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). However, as p53 deficiency does not rescue defective NHEJ associated with Xrcc4 deficiency, Xrcc4/p53&#x02013;double-deficient mice are still immunodeficient and inevitably succumb to pro&#x02013;B cell lymphomas that harbor RAG-dependent complex translocations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). These translocations usually join <italic>IgH</italic> on chromosome 12 to a region downstream of <italic>c-myc</italic> on chromosome 15, resulting in dicentric 12;15 translocations and <italic>c-myc</italic> amplification via breakage&#x02013;fusion&#x02013;bridge cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Such complex translocations are rare in human peripheral B cell lymphomas, which more frequently harbor reciprocal translocations that fuse <italic>IgH</italic>, or less frequently <italic>IgL</italic> loci, just upstream of <italic>c-myc</italic>, leading to ectopic <italic>c-myc</italic> activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we have asked whether inactivation of C-NHEJ in WT or p53-deficient peripheral B cells leads to peripheral B cell lymphoma with CSR or V(D)J recombination-associated <italic>IgH</italic> or <italic>IgL</italic> locus translocations.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Inactivation of <italic>Xrcc4</italic> in p53-deficient peripheral B cells leads to novel B cell lymphomas</title><p>We previously inactivated <italic>Xrcc4</italic> specifically in transitional stage peripheral B cells by generating mice that harbored one copy of a loxP-flanked (floxed) <italic>Xrcc4</italic> allele (<italic>X<sup>c</sup></italic>) and one copy of an <italic>Xrcc4</italic>-null allele (<italic>X</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) plus a transgene that drives Cre recombinase expression via a <italic>CD21</italic> promoter (termed <italic>CX<sup>c/&#x02013;</sup></italic> mice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). CD21 proteins are expressed during B cell development at the time when immature transitional B cells differentiate into mature long-lived peripheral B cells, including marginal zone B cells, follicular B cells, B1a (CD5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), and B1b cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). CD21cre mediates efficient Cre recombination in mature, but not immature, transitional B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Thus, <italic>CX<sup>c/&#x02013;</sup></italic> mice have normal IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> splenic B cell numbers as <italic>Xrcc4</italic> is not deleted during early B cell developmental stages where V(D)J recombination occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Remarkably, <italic>CX<sup>c/&#x02013;</sup></italic> mice have a normal life span and are not cancer-prone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), despite high levels of general and <italic>IgH</italic>-specific genomic instability in ex vivo &#x003b1;CD40/IL-4&#x02013;stimulated peripheral <italic>CX<sup>c/&#x02013;</sup></italic> B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Analogous to what we previously found for B lymphoid and neuronal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), lack of <italic>CX<sup>c/&#x02013;</sup></italic> B cell transformation may reflect p53-dependent elimination of cells harboring DSBs and other types of genomic instability.

In addition, all had clonal <italic>IgH</italic> and <italic>Ig&#x003ba;</italic> rearrangements and many had clonal <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> rearrangements, even though they usually lacked expression of IgH and IgL proteins (Table S1; see below). RNA expression analyses indicated that <italic>CXP</italic> lymphomas lacked expression of &#x003bb;5 and Vpre&#x02013;B, two diagnostic early B cell markers, but did show very low-level RAG expression (Fig. S1, B and C, and not depicted). We also analyzed six additional Xrcc4/p53-deficient B lymphomas derived from <italic>CX<sup>c/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice in which the p53 gene was also floxed (<italic>CX<sup>c/&#x02212;</sup>P<sup>c/c</sup>)</italic> and found that the majority had a phenotype similar to <italic>CX<sup>c/&#x02212;</sup>P<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> lymphomas (Fig. S2 and Table S2).

As expected, we found little or no evidence of <italic>Xrcc4</italic> deletion in sorted BM B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IgM<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells or in sorted HSA<sup>high</sup>CD21<sup>low</sup> peripheral immature B cells, but essentially complete <italic>Xrcc4</italic> deletion in purified HSA<sup>low</sup>CD21<sup>high</sup> mature splenic B cells (Fig. S3). By PCR, we occasionally observed very low levels of a product corresponding to <italic>Xrcc4</italic> deletion in BM and immature B cell samples, which theoretically may reflect very low-level deletion in earlier B cell stages, but which also may simply reflect recirculating peripheral B cells in the BM and/or low-level contamination of the sorted populations (unpublished data). Along with the appearance of these B lineage tumors being dependent on <italic>Xrcc4</italic> deletion via <italic>CD21cre</italic> expression at transitional B cell stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref> and Fig. S3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>), these phenotypic characterizations indicate that CXP lymphomas, despite lack of surface Ig expression, derive from peripheral B cells.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>IgH</italic>, <italic>Ig&#x003ba;</italic>, and <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> rearrangements in CXP tumors</title><p>Recurrent sIg<sup>&#x02212;</sup> peripheral lymphomas have not been observed previously. To elucidate the basis for this striking phenotype, we first assayed for expression of IgH chains via Western blotting of tumor extracts. Most analyzed CXP B lymphomas lacked readily detectable IgH chain expression, although CXP62 expressed cytoplasmic &#x003b3; chains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). Both normal and C-NHEJ&#x02013;deficient pro&#x02013;B lines display rearrangements of both J<sub>H</sub> alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Assays of CXP tumor DNA for J<sub>H</sub> rearrangements via Southern blotting revealed that all primary CXP tumors showed J<sub>H</sub> rearrangements, along with varying degrees of a germline J<sub>H</sub> band (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). However, the germline band usually occurred in low levels and was often further reduced in passaged tumors (unpublished data), indicating derivation from non&#x02013;B lineage cells within the tumor. Despite lack of detectable IgH expression, molecular cloning demonstrated that CXP tumors contained structurally normal in-frame or out-of-frame V(D)J rearrangements, indicating that they occurred before <italic>Xrcc4</italic> inactivation (see the following section). Finally, most CXP tumors had rearrangements in or around <italic>IgH</italic> S regions. At least five out of eight CXP tumors had clonal S&#x003bc;/C&#x003bc; rearrangements; three had one or more clonal S&#x003b1; rearrangements of which one was molecularly cloned (from CXP68) and found to be an S&#x003b3;2a to S&#x003b1; rearrangement; one CXP tumor had an S&#x003b3;2b rearrangement; and another had a clonal S&#x003b3;3 rearrangement in addition to the S&#x003b3;2a to S&#x003b1; rearrangement (Table S1 and Fig. S4, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082271/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082271/DC1</ext-link>).

Although there was a variable level of a germline-sized J&#x003ba; band, the level was far below that expected for a single germline allele and roughly correlated with that of contaminating nonlymphoid DNA as judged by the J<sub>H</sub> Southern blot (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Southern blotting revealed that CXP tumors also lacked both copies of the C&#x003ba; exons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). We tested for downstream RS rearrangement in CXP tumors via Southern blotting and found rearrangement and/or deletion of the 3&#x02032;RS sequences in all analyzed tumors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref> and Fig. S5 A). As normal 3&#x02032;RS rearrangements do not result in deletions larger than a few nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>), we tested the hypothesis that 3&#x02032;RS rearrangements in CXP lymphomas had occurred after <italic>Xrcc4</italic> inactivation by cloning and sequencing rearrangements. Of three RS rearrangements isolated, two had apparent V&#x003ba; and 3&#x02032;RS region junctions accompanied by large deletions (30&#x02013;80 bp into V&#x003ba; and 26&#x02013;43 bp beyond 3&#x02032;RS sequence), whereas the other had a normal V&#x003ba; to 3&#x02032;RS join (Fig. S5 B). In addition, Southern blotting with a 3&#x02032;RS probe showed CXP163 had an aberrant RS rearrangement with a large deletion (&#x0003e;4 kb) downstream of the 3&#x02032;RS sequence (Fig. S5 C). Southern blotting also showed that a significant proportion of CX<sup>c/</sup><italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic>P<sup>c/c</sup> B lymphomas (four out of six; Fig. S2) and CXPR B lymphomas (five out of eight; not depicted) had deleted one or both <italic>Ig&#x003ba;</italic> alleles.

Therefore, we assayed CXP lymphoma DNA by Southern blotting with probes to detect V&#x003bb;J&#x003bb; rearrangements within both Ig&#x003bb; clusters (Fig. S5 D). These analyses demonstrated that at least six out of nine assayed CXP or CX<sup>c/</sup><italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic>P<sup>c/c</sup> B cell lymphomas had clear-cut <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> rearrangements, with CXP62, 162, and 163 showing rearrangements of both alleles (Fig. S5, A and D). Southern blotting analyses also showed that several analyzed CXPR B lymphomas had <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> rearrangements (unpublished data). To elucidate the nature of the <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> rearrangements in CXP tumors, we performed PCR using V&#x003bb;1/V&#x003bb;2- and J&#x003bb;1/J&#x003bb;2-specific primers to isolate six different rearrangements involving one or the other J&#x003bb; cluster (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref> and Fig. S5 E). Nearly all isolated <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> rearrangements involved joining of sequences in or upstream of a V&#x003bb; to sequences in or downstream of a J&#x003bb;, with the majority of breakpoints leading to deletions larger than the few basepair deletions observed from one or both segments in normal V&#x003bb;J&#x003bb; joins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref> and Fig. S5 E) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). As PCR only allows isolation of junctions within the primer boundaries, we cloned several <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> rearrangements from genomic phage libraries generated from CXP163 and CXP162 DNA and identified a deletional rearrangement that went &#x0223c;2.8-kb and &#x0223c;800-bp, respectively, beyond the V&#x003bb;1 and J&#x003bb;1 segments, as well as aberrantly deleted RS rearrangements (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref> and Fig. S5 E). Overall, the observed pattern of <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> rearrangements in CXP lymphomas, namely large deletions from the participating segments on one or both sides of the join, is fully consistent with the types of junctions previously characterized for attempted V(D)J recombination of endogenous loci in C-NHEJ&#x02013;deficient progenitor B or T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>).

Finally, the t(15;12) CXP68 junction linked sequences near I&#x003b3;3 to sequences 1.4-kb upstream of <italic>c-myc</italic> exon 1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>), again, likely resulting from attempted CSR to S&#x003b3;3. Four of these five cloned junctions contained junctional microhomology suggestive of A-EJ (Fig. S6 D). Overall, CXP <italic>IgH</italic>/<italic>c-myc</italic> translocations are remarkably similar to those of human sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma that fuse <italic>IgH</italic> S regions upstream of <italic>c-myc</italic>.</p><p>Because of the location of the characterized translocation junctions downstream of the <italic>IgH</italic> J<sub>H</sub> region, we considered the possibility that many CXP tumors were sIg<sup>&#x02212;</sup> because they separated a productive V<sub>H</sub>(D)J<sub>H</sub> exon from the C<sub>H</sub> region. In this context, two out of three analyzed CXP tumors with <italic>IgH/c-myc</italic> translocations (CXP68 and CXP153) contained an in-frame (productive) V<sub>H</sub>(D)J<sub>H</sub> rearrangement fused to the <italic>c-myc</italic> locus on Chr15; whereas the other (CXP163) involved a translocated nonproductive V<sub>H</sub>(D)J<sub>H</sub> rearrangement (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A&#x02013;C</xref>).

In this context, &#x003b1;CD40 plus IL-4&#x02013;activated splenic CXP B cells had at most a very modest increase in <italic>IgH</italic> breaks compared with activated Xrcc4-deficient peripheral B cells (28 &#x000b1; 13% versus 17 &#x000b1; 7% of metaphases containing <italic>IgH</italic> breaks). Yet, <italic>CD21cre</italic> deletion of <italic>Xrcc4</italic> in p53-deficient peripheral B cells, or deletion of both genes in peripheral B cells, recurrently led to sIg<sup>&#x02212;</sup> B lymphomas that harbor activated <italic>myc</italic>, likely reflecting the critical role of p53 in eliminating B cells with activated <italic>c-myc</italic> expression and/or eliminating B cells with high genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). CXP B lymphomas are remarkable in several ways. First, most CXP lymphomas arise from B cells that have attempted <italic>IgH</italic> CSR and a majority appear to arise from B cells that have undergone receptor editing, with both processes occurring after <italic>Xrcc4</italic> inactivation by CD21Cre. Second, many CXP tumors harbored two separate, clonal translocations that, respectively, involved <italic>IgH</italic> and <italic>IgL</italic> loci. Occurrence of clonal <italic>IgH</italic> and <italic>IgL</italic> translocations in the same tumor may reflect dual CSR and editing activities of B cells from which they arose. In this context, some CXP lymphomas had clonal translocations that fused <italic>IgH</italic> and <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic>, clearly indicating simultaneous presence of breaks in both loci in tumor progenitors. As outlined below, these unusual features of CXP tumors have novel implications for B cell developmental processes and for oncogenic translocation mechanisms.</p><p>Germline Xrcc4 plus p53 deficiency in mice leads to pro&#x02013;B lymphomas with RAG-dependent translocations that fuse J<sub>H</sub> sequences to sequences far downstream of c-<italic>myc,</italic> resulting in dicentric chromosomes and <italic>c</italic>-<italic>myc</italic> activation via breakage-fusion-bridge amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Thus, it is remarkable that inactivation of same two genes in mature B cells recurrently leads to ectopic activation of a single copy <italic>c-myc</italic> gene by fusion of <italic>IgH</italic> into its upstream region, analogous to similar <italic>IgH</italic>/<italic>c-myc</italic> translocations in human Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). In pristane- or IL-6&#x02013;induced mouse plasmacytomas, similar <italic>IgH</italic>/<italic>c-myc</italic> translocations occur and are initiated by AID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). In this context, CXP lymphoma <italic>IgH</italic>/<italic>c-myc</italic> translocations occur in and around <italic>IgH</italic> S regions and downstream of normal V<sub>H</sub>(D)J<sub>H</sub> exons, indicating their likely selection from the abundant pool of <italic>IgH</italic> translocations that result from aberrant CSR in activated Xrcc4-deficient peripheral B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). As the intronic IgH enhancer is generally absent from CXP <italic>IgH/c-myc</italic> translocations, long-range 3&#x02032; IgH regulatory region activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>), or that of unknown <italic>IgH</italic> regulatory elements, may ectopically activate <italic>c-myc</italic>. The recurrent differences in <italic>IgH/c-myc</italic> translocations in Xrcc4/p53-deficient pro&#x02013;B versus CXP peripheral B cell tumors might reflect RAG versus AID-dependent DSB initiation in <italic>IgH</italic> and/or <italic>c-myc</italic>, other differential stage-specific mechanisms that lead to DSBs in and around <italic>c-myc</italic>, stage-specific differences in nuclear localization of <italic>IgH</italic> and <italic>c-myc</italic> loci, or mechanisms that differentially activate <italic>c-myc</italic> after translocation, including stage-specific IgH enhancer activities. As both Xrcc4/p53-deficient pro&#x02013;B and CXP peripheral B cell lymphomas frequently have <italic>IgH/c-myc</italic> junctions that appear to be mediated by A-EJ, repair pathway choice is not likely to be a major factor in generating a particular form of translocation. Given the uniform and recurrent <italic>IgH/c-myc</italic> translocations, the CXP B lymphoma system should allow putative roles of cis elements and other factors to be tested.</p><p>CXP lymphomas also frequently harbor chromosome 16 translocations that involve aberrant V(D)J recombination of <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> after <italic>Xrcc4</italic> deletion. At least one CXP <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> translocation was oncogenic. CXP62 had reciprocal t(15;16) and t(16;15) translocations, the latter of which fused the downstream portion of <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> to sequences just upstream of <italic>c-myc</italic>, resulting in ectopic <italic>c-myc</italic> activation, reminiscent of <italic>Ig&#x003bb;/c-myc</italic> translocations observed in certain human B lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). Characterization of additional CXP <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> translocations may lead to identification of additional oncogenes. Notably, we also observe loss of all or part of one copy of chromosome 6 with some large deletions extending from the vicinity of <italic>Ig&#x003ba;</italic>. The latter findings suggest that rearrangements of <italic>Ig&#x003ba;</italic>, likely in association with aberrant editing, may also lead to translocations or chromosome loss. In the latter context, unrepaired DSBs can lead to chromosome loss in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). The frequent loss of all or a large portion of chromosome 6 in CXP tumors is striking and suggests a potential role in etiology of these tumors, perhaps by deletion of a tumor suppressor sequence.</p><p>More than 95% of mouse peripheral B cells express Ig&#x003ba; and, correspondingly, have V&#x003ba;J&#x003ba; joins on one or both <italic>Ig&#x003ba;</italic> alleles and <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> in germline configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). A small percentage of mouse B cells express Ig&#x003bb;, and these have <italic>Ig&#x003ba;</italic> alleles that are nonproductively rearranged or deleted by 3&#x02032;RS or related rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). Notably, Ig&#x003bb;-expressing mouse B cells frequently arise via receptor editing, often in the context of <italic>Ig&#x003ba;</italic> deletion via 3&#x02032;RS rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Thus, it is striking that CXP lymphomas frequently had clonal <italic>Ig&#x003ba;</italic> deletions via aberrant V&#x003ba; to 3&#x02032;RS rearrangements and aberrant V&#x003bb; to J&#x003bb; rearrangements, with both types of rearrangements occurring subsequent to <italic>CD21cre</italic> expression. Based on these findings, we speculate that a common CXP tumor progenitor derives from an Ig&#x003ba;-expressing B cell that attempted receptor editing subsequent to <italic>Xrcc4</italic> deletion. Attempted editing in the absence of Xrcc4 would lead to aberrant rearrangement/deletion of <italic>Ig&#x003ba;</italic> and progression to <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> rearrangement, which also would be aberrant. Thus, editing Xrcc4-deficient B cells would lose IgL expression caused by inability to undergo productive IgL editing.</p><p>As a working model, we suggest that aberrant receptor editing in CXP tumor progenitors generates an initial transforming event and/or activates aberrant CSR through loss of parts of chromosome 6 or translocations of <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic>. Aberrant CSR in the absence of Xrcc4 would lead to a high level of <italic>IgH</italic> translocations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>), including <italic>IgH/c-myc</italic> translocations that would complete the transformation process. In the case of the CXP tumor that harbors an <italic>Ig&#x003bb;/c-myc</italic> instead of an <italic>IgH/c-myc</italic> translocation, the former may have been sufficient to fully transform the cells. This scenario provides a potential role for chromosome 6 losses, and also could explain why all CXP <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> translocations are not clearly oncogenic, why some CXP <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> translocations have <italic>IgH</italic> as a partner, and why CXP <italic>IgH</italic> translocations can involve either productive or nonproductive <italic>IgH</italic> alleles.</p><p>Receptor editing is generally thought to occur in immature B cells in the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>); yet a substantial fraction of CXP tumor progenitors appear to have both breaks associated with attempted editing of the <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> locus and breaks associated with attempted <italic>IgH</italic> CSR. In this regard, BM immature B cells in quasimonoclonal (QM) mice can express both AID and RAG1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>), although other studies of developing B cells in WT mice concluded that AID is not expressed in BM B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). QM mice harbor a productive IgH knock-in V(D)J allele and a homozygous gene-targeted deletion of both J&#x003ba; alleles and, thus, only have Ig&#x003bb;-producing B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). The striking similarities between immature QM B cells and proposed CXP tumor progenitors suggest a potential relationship. In this regard, CXP tumor progenitors might derive from an undetected, low-level population of CD21cre-expressing BM immature B cells that delete <italic>Xrcc4</italic> and undergo aberrant editing and CSR before migration to the periphery. However, we note that CXP tumors arise in the periphery, have features of peripheral B cells, and harbor clonal <italic>Ig&#x003ba;</italic> and <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> rearrangements, as well as <italic>IgH</italic> CSR-associated rearrangements that occurred subsequent to CD21cre expression. Conceivably, the <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> breaks that lead to translocations found in CXP tumor progenitors might reflect RAG-initiated breaks in BM developing B cells that persist because of p53 deficiency, as observed for RAG-initiated <italic>IgH</italic> breaks in ATM-deficient or 53BP1/p53&#x02013;double-deficient pro&#x02013;B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>). However, we also observed dual <italic>IgH</italic> and Ig&#x003bb; translocations in a CX<sup>c/&#x02212;</sup>P<sup>c/c</sup> tumor in which both <italic>p53</italic> and <italic>Xrcc4</italic> were deleted peripherally. Therefore, we must consider the alternative possibility that CXP tumors arise from peripheral B cells driven into editing. Such cells might also participate in extrafollicular responses in which CSR occurs with limited SHM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>), a possibility consistent with most CXP tumor IgH variable region exons lacking SHM.</p><p>Transitional B cell populations express very low levels of RAG upon arrival in the periphery, with RAG expression being essentially undetectable in more mature splenic B cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Thus, if the RAG breaks in CXP tumor progenitors, indeed, are generated in the periphery, it remains to be determined in what cell type they occur and how apparently low-level RAG expression could generate them. Given that CXP progenitors nearly all arise from cells that harbor <italic>IgH/c-myc</italic> translocations, it is quite striking that CXP tumors do not arise from sIg<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells simply in the context of aberrant CSR. Indeed, the recurrent occurrence of sIg<sup>&#x02212;</sup> lymphomas with aberrant <italic>Ig&#x003ba;</italic> and <italic>Ig&#x003bb;</italic> rearrangements and translocations indicates that inability to productively complete receptor editing confers a major predisposition to transformation of peripheral CXP B cells. Perhaps editing CXP B cells represent a larger fraction of the CD21-expressing B cell pool than anticipated or are enriched in certain locations. For example, receptor editing might especially contribute to antibody diversification in B cells of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (e.g., mesenteric lymph nodes), where the CXP tumors appear to arise most frequently and in which lymphocytes are chronically activated and driven into immune responses by products of the gut microflora.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p><italic>CD21cre</italic>/<italic>Xrcc4</italic><sup>c/&#x02212;</sup> mice were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>) and crossed into p53 germline-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>) or mice carrying conditional p53 alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>).
