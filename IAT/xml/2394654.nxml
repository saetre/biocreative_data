In this study we show that PECAM-1 influences steady state hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) progenitor numbers in the peripheral blood but not the bone marrow compartment. PECAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have higher levels of HSC progenitors in the blood compared to their littermate controls. We show that PECAM-1 is required on both progenitors and bone marrow vascular cells in order for efficient transition between the blood and bone marrow to occur. We have identified key roles for PECAM-1 in both the regulation of HSC migration to the chemokine CXCL12, as well as maintaining levels of the matrix degrading enzyme MMP-9 in the bone marrow vascular niche. Using intravital microscopy and adoptive transfer of either wild type (WT) or PECAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow precursors, we demonstrate that the increase in HSC progenitors in the blood is due in part to a reduced ability to migrate from blood to the bone marrow vascular niche.

Although PECAM-1, expressed on blood and vascular cells has been shown to play an important role in regulating the movement of leucocyte subsets into peripheral tissues, it has remained unclear whether PECAM-1 plays a similar role in regulating progenitor cell migration across the bone marrow vasculature. In this study we describe a novel role for PECAM-1 in regulating progenitor cell numbers in the peripheral blood and show that part of the mechanism by which this occurs is via the effect on CXCL12 dependent HSC migration as well as an increase in MMP-9 expression upon deletion of PECAM-1 on bone marrow vascular cells.</p><p>Our data demonstrates that loss of PECAM-1 does not affect the homeostatic balance of HSCs in the bone marrow, resulting in equivalent numbers of both KSL and total mature cells of all lineages.

We have however noted that the bone marrow of PECAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice contains increased levels of MMP-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002338-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), a proteolytic enzyme which is known to inactivate CXCL12 through cleavage of its NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal signal sequence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002338-McQuibban1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus the increase in HSC mobilisation in the resting state of the PECAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> could be explained by deactivation of exogenous CXCL12 by the excess MMP-9 present in the bone marrow, or protease cleavage of other retention factors such as SCF, resulting in increased mobilization from the bone marrow under steady state conditions.</p><p>Using intra vital microscopy we have found that PECAM-1 is involved in the migration of bone marrow progenitors from the blood to the bone marrow. We observed an increase in the number of cells binding to the lumen of smaller sinusoidal vessels in the skull when PECAM-1 is deleted from either the endothelium or adoptively transferred cells. These vessels have been previously demonstrated to be physiologically similar to the bone marrow vasculature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002338-Mazo1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, and suggests that the PECAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse has a general defect in the ability of cells to interact with both the peripheral and bone marrow vasculature <italic>in-vivo</italic>. This observation provides an alternative explanation as to the increase in HSC numbers in the peripheral blood, as these cells may have a reduced ability to traffic into the bone marrow or other tissues, resulting in an accumulation in the peripheral blood. Unfortunately our intravital studies are limited to using whole bone marrow isolates, as it was not feasible to look at the trafficking of purified HSCs using this technique due to the small numbers of cells that can be isolated and enriched from the bone marrow.</p><p>In the vascular niche, CXCL12 can induce transmigration of HSCs across endothelium, in a P- and E-selectin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002338-Katayama1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> dependant process. Integrins are also important as induced deletion of either CD29 (&#x003b2;1 integrin), CD49d (VLA-4) or ligands such as VCAM-1 results in increased numbers of progenitor cells in the circulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002338-Papayannopoulou1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. The PECAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> phenotype resembles elements of these deletion studies which also have increased number of circulating progenitor cells, suggesting that alternative adhesion molecules can compensate in the absence of PECAM-1 expression. We have not observed any significant differences between PECAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT cells in their ability to adhere or roll on selectin coated surfaces <italic>in vitro</italic> (data not shown). However, as reported in many other studies, challenged PECAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice demonstrate an inflammatory response which is more aggressive and prolonged<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002338-Graesser1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002338-Wong1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results suggest that part of these differences may occur because of the defect in HSC migration between the blood and BM compartments,</p><p>It is likely that the reduced ability of PECAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> HSCs to migrate to CXCL12 is due to loss of an intrinsic signalling pathway mediated by the cytoplasmic domain of PECAM-1. The PECAM-1 cytoplasmic domain contains two conserved ITIM domains, and studies have demonstrated that PECAM-1 can have both inhibitory and activatory effects in various cell types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002338-Newman2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been postulated that PECAM-1 can act as a &#x0201c;relay post&#x0201d; for modulating other surface receptors through sequestration of cytoplasmic signalling molecules such as catenins, SHP-1 and SHP-2, Src family kinases and STATs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002338-Sagawa1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002338-Ilan2">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. PECAM-1 activation can modulate integrin function in leucocytes, by selectively activating the small GTPase Rap1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002338-Reedquist1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>, which may be important for PECAM-1 mediated increase in cell migration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002338-Luu1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002338-Rainger1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. The exact signalling pathway utilised by PECAM-1 is yet to be fully described in any cell type studied, including HSCs. However, signalling intermediates known to be activated by PECAM-1, such as Rap1, have already been reported to modulate integrin function in HSCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002338-Yang1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our study has revealed a novel role for PECAM-1 in the biology of HSCs in the bone marrow and their ability to respond to a CXCL12 gradient, which we propose results in an increased number of progenitor cells in the peripheral circulation. Using in-vivo imaging, we have observed a reduced ability of cells to migrate across bone marrow vascular endothelium upon PECAM-1 deletion. We could find no significant difference in numbers of HSCs or cells derived from them in the bone marrow suggesting that loss of PECAM-1 does not affect hematopoietic homeostatic mechanisms in the bone marrow compartment in the resting state. We have however found higher levels of MMP-9 in the bone marrow of PECAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice suggesting that the vascular niche in the bone marrow is abnormal in PECAM-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. These findings further support a role for PECAM-1 in modulating cellular migration and adhesion and extend the vascular compartments regulated by PECAM-1 to include the bone marrow vasculature niche.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dr Rudi Manz for his assistance in preparing bone marrow sections, and Dr Paloma Garcia and Miss Mary Clarke for their advice and
