R1 replication is abolished in extracts deficient in the DnaA protein. This deficiency is efficiently complemented by purified preparations of the DnaA protein. The in vitro replication of plasmid R1 is also abolished in DnaC deficient extracts and by a 10 bp deletion (nucleotides 1463-1472) within the minimal origin region. These data indicate the requirement of the DnaA, DnaB, DnaC, DnaG and SSB replication proteins of the host, as well as of specific oriR1 sequences for the RepA dependent replication of plasmid R1. The implications of these results for the initiation of R1 replication are discussed.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00281-0183-a" xlink:role="4874"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00281-0174.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4865"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00281-0175.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4866"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00281-0176.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4867"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00281-0177.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4868"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00281-0178.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4869"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00281-0179.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4870"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00281-0180.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4871"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00281-0181.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4872"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00281-0182.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4873"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00281-0183.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4874"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00281-0184.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4875"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00281-0185.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4876"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00281-0186.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4877"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00281-0187.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4878"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00281-0188.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4879"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
