The <italic>Drosophila</italic> SU(VAR)3-9 protein and related proteins of other organisms have been associated with gene repression and heterochromatinization. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> there are 10 <italic>SUVH</italic> and 5 <italic>SUVR</italic> genes encoding proteins similar to SU(VAR)3-9, and 4 SUVH proteins have been shown to control heterochromatic silencing by its HMTase activity and by directing DNA methylation. The SUVR proteins differ from the SUVH proteins in their domain structure, and we show that the closely related SUVR1, SUVR2 and SUVR4 proteins contain a novel domain at their N-terminus, and a SUVR specific region preceding the SET domain. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fusions of these SUVR proteins preferably localize to the nucleolus, suggesting involvement in regulation of rRNA expression, in contrast to other SET-domain proteins studied so far. A novel HMTase specificity was demonstrated for SUVR4, in that monomethylated histone H3K9 is its preferred substrate <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The organization of DNA into higher order chromatin structure is crucial for the correct temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression in most eukaryotic organisms. Chromatin is a dynamic DNA&#x02013;protein structure that can exist as either transcriptionally permissive euchromatin or repressive heterochromatin. The difference between the two states is partly due to different combinations of covalent post-translational modifications of the histones, including phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, ADP ribosylation and methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). These modifications, constituting the so called histone code, may be interdependent, and create binding sites for chromatin-associated effector proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>) facilitating or restricting transcription.</p><p>Two of the best studied protein families responsible for histone-tail modifications are the histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and the histone deacetylases (HDACs) that function in multiprotein complexes. The HATs promote gene activation by interaction with transcriptional activators and acetylation of the conserved lysine (K) residues on the histone tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), while the HDACs perform transcriptional repression by deacetylation at sites targeted by transcriptional repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Lysine residues may also be modified by methylation, which can stimulate or repress transcription depending on the position of the methylated residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). In general, methylation of histone H3K9, H3K27 and H4K20 in combination with histone hypoacetylation and DNA methylation, is associated with heterochromatin and gene silencing. Euchromatin on the other hand, contains elevated levels of histone H3 lysine methylation at positions 4, 36 and 79 as well as hyperacetylation of histone H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>).</p><p>The ability to methylate lysine residues on the histone tails resides in proteins containing the evolutionarily conserved 130 amino acid SET domain named after the three <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins <underline>S</underline>UPPRESSOR OF VARIEGATION 3-9 [SU(VAR)3-9], <underline>E</underline>NHANCER OF ZESTE [E(Z)] and <underline>T</underline>RITHORAX (TRX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). In the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> genome there are at least 29 actively transcribed genes encoding SET-domain proteins, that can be divided into four major evolutionarily conserved classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). The diversity of these proteins suggests that they exert specific functions during <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> development. For example, MEDEA (MEA) is a Polycomb group protein homologous to E(Z) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), which in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> regulates seed development after fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). The ATX1 protein, a homologue to TRX, positively regulates the expression of several flower homeotic genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and <italic>in vitro</italic> results suggest that the protein is a histone H3K4 methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). The protein product of the <italic>ASHH2</italic> gene (At1g77300), similar to <italic>Drosophila ASH1</italic>, is involved in control of flowering time and may act as an H3K4 and/or H3K36 HMTase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).</p><p>The two SU(VAR)3-9 homologues KRYPTONITE (KYP)/SUVH4 and SUVH2 have been studied in more detail and both have been shown to control heterochromatic H3K9 dimethylation and to function <italic>in vivo</italic> as heterochromatin-specific H3K9 HMTases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). The most severe effects of this histone methylation mark were found in <italic>suvh2</italic> null mutants, and a dosage dependent effect of SUVH2 on heterochromatic gene silencing has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Two other SUVH proteins, SUVH5 and SUVH6, also show <italic>in vitro</italic> H3K9 HMTase activity and together with SUVH4 these HMTases control non-CpG DNA methylation and gene silencing at heterochromatic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Therefore, all data available strongly suggest that proteins belonging to the SU(VAR)3-9 group of SET-domain proteins are involved in multiple controls of heterochromatic H3K9 methylation and gene silencing in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><p>In addition to nine active <italic>SUVH</italic> genes, there are five <italic>SU(VAR)3-9</italic> related <italic>SUVR</italic> genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The encoded proteins have a SET domain with pre- and post-SET domains most similar to the SU(VAR)3-9 group, but are lacking the YDG domain of the SUVH proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) that appears to be involved in directing DNA methylation to target sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). To elucidate whether SUVR proteins differ in function from SUVH proteins we have focused the present work on SUVR1, SUVR2 and SUVR4 that constitute a subgroup amongst the SUVR proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). We present their particular domain structure and splice variants. In contrast to other SET-domain proteins these SUVR proteins were mainly found localized in the nucleolus or nuclear bodies, and we have identified a short amino acid sequence that can direct proteins to the nucleolus. The recombinant SUVR4 protein, but not SUVR1 and SUVR2, has HMTase activity with specificity for monomethylated H3K9 <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bioinformatics</title><p>Database searches were performed using BLASTP, TBLASTN and PSI-BLAST against the nr and est databases at GenBank, or the est database at TIGR.

The localization was documented in roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) as visualization of the GFP signal was better in cells without chlorophyll.</p><p>Plants expressing the SUVR1a-GFP splice variant showed a strong GFP signal in the nucleolus and a very weak signal in the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In DAPI-stained nuclei, the nucleolus appears as a black hole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left, arrow). FISH, performed with a probe against the 18S rDNA repeats, was used as a control to confirm the specific localization to the nucleolus. This clearly demonstrated that the SUVR1a-GFP protein (green) associated with the nucleolus and did not overlap with the heterochromatic nucleolus organizing regions (NOR) detected by the 18S rDNA probe (red) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, insert). In plants transformed with the SUVR1b-GFP construct, strong GFP expression was in contrast detected in the nucleoplasm, and the protein was excluded from the nucleolus and the densely DAPI-stained heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The differences in subnuclear localization between the two splice variants indicate that SUVR1 distribution is regulated by alternative splicing.</p><p>SUVR2a-GFP expression was mainly seen in subdomains associated with or within the nucleolus, and a weaker signal was present in the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Additionally, a variable number of nuclear bodies of unequal size were observed in SUVR2a-GFP expressing cells, suggesting specific association with subnuclear regions. Notably, these nuclear bodies showed weaker DAPI staining than the rest of the nucleoplasm, and did not overlap with the DAPI-stained chromocenters.</p><p>Like SUVR1a-GFP, SUVR4a-GFP displayed a very specific localization, with uniform expression in the whole nucleolus in most of the nuclei investigated and much weaker expression in the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, in some nucleoli the GFP signal was not covering the whole nucleolus, but seen as a smaller spot inside the nucleolus (data not shown), while for other nuclei the signal was an intermediate of the two preceding situations. In these nuclei, GFP was observed in the whole nucleolus, with a stronger signal in a spot at the edge of the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>A short amino acid sequence from SUVR1 can function as a nucleolus localization signal</title><p>Putative NLS were predicted to be present in both the SUVR1 and SUVR4 proteins by the PredictNLS server. The SUVR4a protein has a potential NLS with 21 residues at the C-terminus, while the SUVR1a sequence contains two putative NLS, a 17 amino acid long motif in position 16 (NLS1), and a short signal (NLS2) with 7 residues in position 66 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The SUVR1b splice variant contains only NLS2. The difference in subnuclear localization between SUVR1a and SUVR1b suggested that the longer N-terminal fragment (58 residues) of SUVR1a containing NLS1 was responsible for the nucleolar targeting. Interestingly, NLS1 with flanking residues has 37% sequence identity to the predicted NLS motif of the SUVR4 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), which also has nucleolar localization.</p><p>To test whether these NLS motifs with associated residues were involved in targeting SUVR1a and SUVR4a to the nucleolus, 35S::GFP-fusion constructs were made containing, (i) the first 176 amino acids of SUVR1 including both NLS1 and NLS2 (pK7WGF2-S1-295), (ii) the first 40 amino acids of SUVR1 including NLS1 (pK7WGF2-S1-187), (iii) the last 27 amino acids of SUVR4 including the NLS (pK7WGF2-S4-NLS) and (iv) SUVR4 without the terminal NLS (pK7WGF2-S4-1535) (cfr. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Roots from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants transformed with these constructs were inspected for subcellular and subnuclear localization of the GFP signal. GFP was not found in the cytoplasm for any of the constructs. The 176 amino acid fragment (data not shown) and also the 40 amino acid fragment of SUVR1a could direct GFP to the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), confirming that the difference in subnuclear localization between the SUVR1a and SUVR1b proteins was due to sequences in the unique N-terminus of the SUVR1a splice variant. NLS2, on the other hand, is not involved in nucleolar targeting. The SUVR4 27 amino acid peptide did also direct GFP to the nucleolus, but the GFP signal was in addition seen in the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In the nucleolus a stronger signal was usually present in a distinct spot, as also seen in some nuclei expressing the SUVR4a-GFP fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The signal from GFP-SUVR4 devoid of the terminal NLS was also found localized in such spots, however also in distinct spots in the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Thus, this NLS plays a role in the subnuclear localization of SUVR4, although other parts of the SUVR protein seem to be needed to accomplish a wild-type subnuclear localization pattern.</p></sec><sec><title>SUVR1, SUVR2 and SUVR4 contain a new conserved plant specific protein domain</title><p>We have previously reported that the SUVR subgroup contains no other domains than the SET domain and the associated cysteine-rich regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), but the increased number of sequenced genomes and est sequences warranted a renewed search. We used an N-terminal sequence of SUVR4a extending to the first amino acid in the pre-SET domain (119 amino acids) in BLASTP, TBLASTN and PSI-BLAST searches against nr and est databases of GenBank. Protein sequences or translated est sequences that showed significant sequence similarity to the SUVR4 sequence were aligned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). A conserved region (residues 21&#x02013;77 in SUVR4) was identified, and named the WIYLD domain based on conserved residues. This domain, which according to PHDsec and JPRED secondary structure prediction consists of three alpha helices, was only found in plant sequences, and so far only in proteins that possess a SET domain or are without other known domains. The latter situation could, however, be due to the fact that most of the sequences found to contain this domain were translations of partial CDS.</p><p>Putative homologues of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SUVR1, 2 and 4 proteins were identified in rice, tomato and wheat (Supplementary Figure 1). The SUVR proteins belong to the SU(VAR)3-9 subgroup of SET-domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), but alignment of these proteins to other proteins in this subgroup revealed a number of SUVR specific characteristics. The SET domains with their pre- and post-SET domains, and SET-I region (amino acid 319&#x02013;349 in the SUVR4a sequence) were highly conserved within the SUVR group (Supplementary Figure 1), but differ from other SET domain proteins at sites known to be of functional importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). The pre-SET domains are extended with a small insertion that contains three additional conserved cysteine residues (SUVR pre-SET, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and Supplementary Figure 1). The SUVR group has the aa DAN instead of the common aa PNL or PNV just C-terminal to the catalytic core (NHRC), and a tryptophan (W) in the motif ELx[FYW]DY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, arrowhead and Supplementary Figure 1, arrow). The domain composition, the SUVR specific pre-SET domain and particularities of the SUVR SET domain, substantiate that SUVR1, SUVR2 and SUVR4 are members of a particular subgroup of SET-domain proteins, which seems to be plant specific.</p></sec><sec><title>SUVR4 shows enzymatic specificity for H3K9 <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Since the SET domains of SUVR1, SUVR2 and SUVR4 proteins show high sequence similarity with the SET domains of known HMTases (Supplementary Figure 1) we tested whether these proteins had HMTase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. The SUVR1 and SUVR2 C-terminal fragments encompassing the pre-SET, SET and post-SET region (SACSET constructs, see Materials and Methods) did not methylate calf thymus histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The full-length GST-SUVR4a protein was, however, able to methylate calf thymus histone H3, but no methylation was seen when using recombinant full-length H3 as substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The same results were seen for a 374 amino acid C-terminal fragment (data not shown).</p><p>These results indicated that posttranslational modification of H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>) was necessary for SUVR4 activity. In an initial approach, variously methylated histone H3 peptides were tested as substrates. As expected, the SUVR4 protein, showed very low HMTase activity against the unmethylated H3 1&#x02013;20 peptide, again suggesting that unmethylated histone H3 is a poor substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). SUVR4 was also unable to methylate H3 1&#x02013;20 peptides monomethylated at K4 (data not shown) or dimethylated at K9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, the H3 1&#x02013;20 peptide monomethylated at K9 was significantly methylated by SUVR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Using antibodies against dimethylated H3K9 on methylated peptide products from the HMTase assay, it was evident that monomethylated histone H3K9 became dimethylated at this position when incubated with active SUVR4 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). SUVR4 was also able to methylate histone H3 peptides of variable size when monomethylated at K9, but not when monomethylated at K4 or dimethylated on K9 (data not shown). The smallest peptide methylated, residues 5&#x02013;11 mono-methylated at K9, contains only the lysine in position 9. Together these data demonstrate that SUVR4 specifically methylates histone H3 position K9, and has a substrate preference for monomethylated H3K9. This was supported by the lack of SUVR4 HMTase activity when using a histone H3 peptide (residues 23&#x02013;34) monomethylated at K27 as a substrate (Supplementary Figure 2A).</p><p>As the fourth residue of the ELx[FYW]DY motif has been shown to determine product specificity, i.e. the number methyl groups added to the acceptor lysine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), the tryptophan (W405) of SUVR4 was mutated into phenylalanine and tyrosine. GST-fusion proteins with these mutant versions of SUVR4 (S4W405F and S4W405Y) were used in the HMTase assay against recombinant H3 and methylated H3 peptides. However, none of these modified proteins showed any HMTase activity (Supplementary Figure 2B), demonstrating that the tryptophan residue is absolutely necessary for the HMTase activity of SUVR4 <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Some proteins require certain histone tail modifications to bind histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). To investigate whether posttranslational modifications were required for targeting and binding of SUVR4, a pull-down experiment was performed. In this <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assay the GST-SUVR4 full-length protein was able to bind recombinant histone H3 which is devoid of posttranslational modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In addition, we tested binding to calf thymus histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and by using antibodies against dimethylated histone H3K9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) we could show that SUVR4 also bound histone H3 with this modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), although dimethylated H3K9 is not a substrate for SUVR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). A 374 amino acid C-terminal SUVR4 fragment lacking the WIYLD domain pulled down calf thymus histone H3 equally well as the full-length GST-SUVR4 protein (data not shown). In conclusion, these pull-down experiments demonstrate that SUVR4 binds histone H3 irrespective of the methylation status of lysine 9.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>The SUVR proteins are plant-specific SET-domain proteins</title><p>Based on domain composition and sequence alignments of the SET domains, we have earlier classified the SUVR1, SUVR2 and SUVR4 proteins as SU(VAR)3-9 related proteins most similar to the human G9a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Later this small sub-group has been referred to as class V-6 SET-domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). SUVR1, SUVR2 and SUVR4 diverge from the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SUVH members of the SU(VAR)3-9 class both in the SET domain itself and in the pre-SET region (Supplementary Figure 1). The importance of the SET flanking regions for enzyme activity has been demonstrated for other SET-domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). The SUVR pre-SET adds three invariant cysteines to the triangular zinc-binding cluster of nine invariant cysteines found in the pre-SET of the rest of the SU(VAR)3-9 group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Thus, the SUVR pre-SET may confer a new type of binding, or be involved in substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Notably, the variable SET-I region of the SET domain also contains SUVR-specific conserved motifs (Supplementary Figure 1).</p><p>These SUVR-specific pre-SET and SET-I regions were only found in plant proteins (Supplementary Figure 1), as was also the case for the novel N-terminal WIYLD domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Secondary structure prediction indicates that this domain consists of three alpha helices with four conserved Leu/Ile residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that it may be involved in dimerization, as is the case for the N-terminal region of SU(VAR)3-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). SUVR4 histone H3 binding is independent of the WIYLD domain, and the nucleolar localization of the SUVR1a splice variant, lacking this domain, excludes a major role for this domain in nucleolar localization. However, structural similarity to the RuvA C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>) (Rein Aasland, personal communication), may point to a role in binding of DNA. The YDG domain of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SUVH2 protein appears to be involved in directing DNA methylation to target sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Similarly, the WIYLD domain may be involved in directing proteins to their targets, or conversely be directed to its targets through interactions with the WIYLD domain. The plant dialect of chromatin modulation differ from other phyla in several aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>), and the SUVR proteins may play a role in some of these processes.</p></sec><sec><title>The subnuclear localization of SUVR proteins may be regulated by alternative splicing</title><p>All the SUVR-GFP fusion proteins were exclusively localized to the nucleus, with no expression in the cytoplasm. SUVR1a and SUVR4a were almost exclusively found within the nucleolus, and only a weak GFP signal was detectable in the nucleoplasm, while SUVR2a was associated with the nucleolus and other subnuclear regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A&#x02013;E</xref>). When expressed in the nucleoplasm, however, the SUVR-GFP signals were excluded from densely DAPI stained heterochromatin and localized to euchromatin. Altogether, the subnuclear localization to the nucleolus and weakly DAPI-stained subdomains suggest that the SUVR proteins are associated with rDNA and/or euchromatin. This is in contrast to many SU(VAR)3-9 class proteins that function as heterochromatic stabilizers at the chromocenters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>).</p><p>The primary function of the nucleolus is rDNA transcription, pre-rRNA processing and modification, and ribosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). Moreover, the activity and availability of proteins involved in cell-cycle progression may be regulated by sequestration in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). The SUVH genes of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, with the exception of SUVH4, are intronless, suggesting that they have evolved via retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). In contrast, the SUVR genes all have introns and alternative splicing results in formation of protein isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">C</xref>) that may regulate subnuclear spatial distribution. We have demonstrated that the extended N-terminus in SUVR1a compared to SUVR1b is responsible for localization of GFP-fusion proteins to the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), and that 40 amino acid of this terminus encompassing the 17 amino acid NLS1 is sufficient for the nucleolar targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The SUVR4 C-terminus containing a predicted NLS similar to NLS1 of SUVR1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), could also direct GFP to the nucleolus, although the GFP signal was also seen in the rest of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Interestingly, the GFP signal of the SUVR4 NLS and the full-length SUVR4 was sometimes seen in a spot within or close to the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and G</xref>). The nature of these spots as well as the subnuclear foci in the nucleoplasm observed for SUVR2 remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec><title>The SUVR4 protein methylates histone H3 with preference for monomethylated K9</title><p>Alignment of the SET-domain sequences [Supplementary Figure 1 and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>)] show that the SUVR proteins are most closely related to G9a, SUVH2, SUVH6 and SUVH4 of the known HMTases. These proteins methylate H3K9 and H3K27, H3K9 and H4K20 or H3K9, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). We were not able to identify any <italic>in vitro</italic> HMTase activity for SUVR1 and SUVR2. This may reflect the need for a cofactor or for a particular molecular context of a presumptive target histone peptide, as demonstrated for the mammalian EED-EZH2 complex. H3K27 methylation by this complex requires a minimum of three components including EZH2, EED and SUZ12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Therefore, we cannot exclude that the SUVR1 and SUVR2 proteins may function as HMTases <italic>in vivo</italic> at the nucleolar/euchromatic sites specified by our GFP data.</p><p>We have, however, demonstrated that at least SUVR4 acts on H3K9. <italic>In vitro</italic> SUVR4 has a novel specificity, in that it acts as an efficient dimethyltransferase specifically adding the second methyl group to monomethylated H3K9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>), but not to monomethylated H3K27 (Supplementary Figure 2A). Only very weak HMTase activity was seen when unmethylated H3 protein or tail peptides were used as substrates. Other known HMTases, e.g. SUVH4, SUVH5 and SUVH6, are in contrast very efficient monomethyltransferases but moderately efficient dimethyltransferases <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). These proteins have a tyrosine (Y) in position 4 of SET motif IV (ELx[FYW]DY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), while the SUVR proteins have a tryptophan (W) (arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) like the SETDB1/ESET protein, which is a di/tri HMTase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). The DIM-5 of <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> and human G9a that have phenylalanine (F) in this position can add three methyl groups to unmethylated H3K9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). However, conversion of the SUVR4 tryptophan to either tyrosine or phenylalanine both resulted in total loss of HMTase activity. In contrast, conversions from phenylalanine to tyrosine or vice versa in other SET-domain proteins only change the product specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Possibly, other particularities in the SUVR4 SET domain, for instance the amino acid DAN instead of PLN close to the important NH[RSH]C motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) may impose a 3D conformation that is incompatible with substrate binding or methyl transfer when the W is exchanged with Y or F.</p><p>SUVR4 was able to bind both core and recombinant histone H3 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) indicating that the binding to the histone substrate itself is independent of posttranslational modifications. The monomethylation at H3K9 thus seems to be important for the methyltransferase activity of SUVR4, but not for substrate binding. Thus, binding to histone H3 and HMTase activity may be separate functions of the same protein. If SUVR4 HMTase activity is dependent on a monomethylated histone H3 at position K9 <italic>in vivo</italic>, this suggests that SUVR4 is reliant on the cooperative action of another monomethyltransferase. Several examples of interdependency of posttranslational modifications have been reported [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>)]. Furthermore, recent data shows that the DNA-methylating activity of CMT3 is regulated by the combined activity of three HMTases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p><p>All available data for the SUVH proteins show that these HMTases associate with heterochromatin and are involved in heterochromatic gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). In contrast, the localization of the SUVR proteins to the nucleolus or non-condensed nuclear bodies suggests that these proteins are not involved in heterochromatic gene silencing. This is also suggested by the close sequence similarity of the SUVR proteins to the G9a HMTase, which function as a repressor in euchromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). Similarly, the SUVR proteins may function as regulators in euchromatin or in the nucleolus. Although the rDNA is mainly decondensed in the nucleolus, untranscribed foci of condensed rDNA may also be found inside the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). Based on the specific dimethylation of H3K9 <italic>in vitro,</italic> which is a marker of repressive chromatin domains, we suggest that SUVR4 may function as a repressor of rDNA gene clusters in the decondensed part of the nucleolus, and possibly act to regulate rDNA expression together with HDACs also present in this compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkl687_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkl687_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkl687_2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Rein Aasland for useful comments on the bioinformatics work, Thomas Jenuwein for the &#x003b1;-dimethyl-H3K9 antibody and the methylated H3 peptides.
