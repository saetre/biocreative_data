It has been reported that dopamine reduction can affect female receptivity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and leave male-female courtship behavior unaffected. Here, we used genetic and pharmacological approaches to decrease the dopamine level in dopaminergic cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and investigated the consequence of this manipulation on male homosexual courtship behavior. We find that reduction of dopamine level can induce <italic>Drosophila</italic> male-male courtship behavior, and that this behavior is mainly due to the increased male attractiveness or decreased aversiveness towards other males, but not to their enhanced propensity to court other males. Chemical signal input probably plays a crucial role in the male-male courtship induced by the courtees with reduction of dopamine. Our finding provides insight into the relationship between the dopamine reduction and male-male courtship behavior, and hints dopamine level is important for controlling <italic>Drosophila</italic> courtship behavior.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Courtship behavior is fundamental to the propagation of animal species and their adaptation to circumstances.

To test the efficiency of <italic>ple<sup>ts1</sup></italic> mutation, we measured the DA content in the <italic>ple<sup>ts1</sup></italic> males raised at 25&#x000b0;C (18.7&#x000b1;2 ng/mg mass, s.e.m.

Wild-type males were raised at 25&#x000b0;C and fed with AMPT, a drug that tends to reduce DA synthesis. Wild-type males fed with AMPT elicited a strong CI of control males whereas no reciprocal interaction was noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004574-g001">Fig. 1B,C</xref>). This effect is similar to that observed in <italic>ple<sup>ts1</sup></italic> males raised at 31&#x000b0;C. Wild-type males simultaneously fed with AMPT and L-DOPA elicited no CI of untreated sibling males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004574-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Taken together, these genetic and pharmacological experiments indicate that DA reduction enhanced male attractiveness &#x02014; but did not change their courtship &#x02014; to other males.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> male courtship and mate discrimination depend mostly on the perception of visual, pheromonal and acoustic signals exchanged by partner flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004574-Greenspan1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. To assess the involvement of these signals in the attractiveness shown by males with reduced DA level, several experiments were designed to eliminate the effect of each type of signal. We measured the CI induced by males under different sensory deprived condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004574-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). To eliminate the visual signals, wild-type males (used as courters) were tested with intact <italic>ple<sup>ts1</sup></italic> mutant males raised at 31&#x000b0;C under red light where they are virtually blind <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004574-Robertson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. They were also surgically ablated both their antennae and maxillary palps (NAM) to reduce their perception of pheromones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004574-Robertson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> and of acoustic signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004574-Eberl1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In another experiment, the <italic>ple<sup>ts1</sup></italic> mutant males raised at 31&#x000b0;C were washed with hexane to rinse out the pheromones to remove the effects of these olfactory and gustatory inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004574-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Wild-type males either olfactory/auditory- or visually-deprived showed significantly reduced CI to intact <italic>ple<sup>ts1</sup></italic> mutant males raised at 31&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004574-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The deprivation of olfactory/auditory inputs had (i) a more dramatic effect on CI than the visual input deprivation, and (ii) the same effect as the two deprivations simultaneously applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004574-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The fact that <italic>ple<sup>ts1</sup></italic> males washed with hexane completely lost their attractiveness to wild-type males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004574-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>) indicates that cuticular chemicals are the critical sensory signals used by male flies with decreased DA level to stimulate the courtship of wild-type males.

This suggested that the decreased ratio of 7T/7P in <italic>ple<sup>ts1</sup></italic> males raised at 31&#x000b0;C was probably not the reason for their attractiveness. Further experiments proved that the lower ratio of 7T/7P was not responsible for the male attractiveness induced by DA reduction, because that: (i) the <italic>ple<sup>ts1</sup></italic> males raised on L-DOPA-supplemented food at 31&#x000b0;C showed significantly lower ratio of 7T/7P than that of <italic>ple<sup>ts1</sup></italic> males raised on unsupplemented food 31&#x000b0;C, but their attractiveness was obviously reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004574-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>; p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.01, Student's t-test); (ii) The ratio of 7T/7P in the wild-type males with low level of DA produced by pharmacological method was not statistically different as compared with the sibling males raised on unsupplemented food or on L-DOPA&#x00026;AMPT-supplemented food at 25&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004574-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>; Student's t-test), but these male flies still showed obvious attractiveness. Particularly, no correlation was found with the ratio of the two principal cuticular pheromones: 7-T and 7-P, nor with either the percentage or the absolute amount of any other minor secondary compounds between 23 carbons and 29 carbons detected on their cuticle with a GC-MS device (not shown). Therefore, our data showed no obvious causal relationship between the intensity of their homosexual attractiveness produced by DA reduction and the variation of their pheromones we tested.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study reveals that reduced DA level in males highly increased their attractiveness to wild-type males, but had no effect on their propensity to court other males, and the enhanced male attractiveness was mainly attributed to the change of chemical signals.

The pigmentation of bodies was lighter in <italic>ple<sup>ts1</sup></italic> males raised at the restrictive temperature (31&#x000b0;C) than in males raised at the permissive temperature (25&#x000b0;C; data not shown) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004574-Wright1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004574-Pendleton1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that visual cues might be also involved in the increased attractiveness of <italic>ple<sup>ts1</sup></italic> mutant males. Furthermore, the decrease of rejection efforts led by reduction of DA level is another possibility for the male-male courtship induced by males with low level of DA.</p><p>Although the male attractiveness induced by DA reduction did not depend on the high temperature, which was proved by our pharmacological assay, the data showed that temperature itself could also enhance male attractiveness for other males (CI<sub>wild-type31&#x000b0;C</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;12.94&#x000b1;2.4 s.e.m.; CI<sub>wild-type25&#x000b0;C</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3.80&#x000b1;2.2 s.e.m.; p&#x0003c;0.001, Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test). Then, is the male attractiveness induced by high temperature related to low level of DA? To test this question, we measured the DA content of wild-type males raised at 31&#x000b0;C (19.0&#x000b1;2 ng/mg mass, s.e.m. N&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6) and 25&#x000b0;C (16.8&#x000b1;3 ng/mg mass, s.e.m. N&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6) respectively. Our data showed that there was no significant difference between the DA level of wild-type males raised at 31&#x000b0;C and at 25&#x000b0;C, which indicates that the male attractiveness induced by high temperature is unrelated to the reduction of DA level.</p><p>Interestingly, increased DA levels in males can also induce male-male courtship, which is due to the change of the sexual propensity of courters but not the change of the attractiveness of courtees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004574-Liu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Either high level or low level of DA can induce male-male courtship behavior, while the mechanism is different. Variations of DA level affect different yet complementary aspects of courtship behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic> males, which indicates that DA system plays an important role in regulating <italic>Drosophila</italic> male courtship behavior.</p><p>Our study provides new insight on the regulation of male attractiveness. The next goal will be to precisely identify the cuticular pheromones affected in the DA-depleted male flies. One challenge will be to understand the biological basis of the reciprocal effect induced by DA variation (increase/decrease) on the modulation of sensory communication and whether this novel finding can be generalized to other animals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly culture and surgery</title><p>The wild-type strain used was <italic>Canton S</italic>.
