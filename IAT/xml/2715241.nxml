To learn about competition and cooperation between these two repair pathways, we analyzed the physical and functional interaction between MutL and Vsr using biophysical and biochemical methods. Analytical ultracentrifugation reveals a nucleotide-dependent interaction between Vsr and the N-terminal domain of MutL. Using chemical crosslinking, we mapped the interaction site of MutL for Vsr to a region between the N-terminal domains similar to that described before for the interaction between MutL and the strand discrimination endonuclease MutH of the MMR system. Competition between MutH and Vsr for binding to MutL resulted in inhibition of the mismatch-provoked MutS- and MutL-dependent activation of MutH, which explains the mutagenic effect of Vsr overexpression. Cooperation between MMR and VSP repair was demonstrated by the stimulation of the Vsr endonuclease in a MutS-, MutL- and ATP-hydrolysis-dependent manner, in agreement with the enhancement of VSP repair by MutS and MutL <italic>in vivo</italic>. These data suggest a mobile MutS&#x02013;MutL complex in MMR signalling, that leaves the DNA mismatch prior to, or at the time of, activation of downstream effector molecules such as Vsr or MutH.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Genome stability requires continual repair of DNA damage and mismatches prior to replication. Most mismatches that result from DNA polymerase errors during replication are the target of the post-replicative DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system. Base damage can also generate mismatches, e.g. oxidation of G results in 8-oxoG:A mismatches after replication, which are recognized by either MMR or MutY/OGG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), or methylation of G which results in O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine:C mismatches that are the target of MMR or 6-<italic>O</italic>-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferases (MGMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In addition to replication errors, T:G mismatches can arise via deamination of 5-methylcytosine which is used by many organisms as a chemical tag that allows the distinguishing of foreign DNA from organism or viruses lacking this modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). T:G mismatches can also be repaired by specialized enzymes such as the ubiquitous T:G DNA glycosylases or the very-short patch (VSP) repair system found in many bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic> post-replicative MMR is initiated by MutS recognizing the mismatch. MutS recruits MutL to form a ternary complex that coordinates subsequent repair steps. This complex activates the latent endonuclease MutH, which nicks the erroneous DNA daughter strand at hemimethylated GATC-sites that can up to 1000 bp from the mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The nicked strand is removed in a MutSL-dependent manner by action of UvrD helicase, single-strand-binding protein (SSB) and one of several exonucleases. Repair is completed by the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme and DNA ligase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). T:G mismatches are targeted by the VSP repair system when they occur within 5&#x02032;-CTWGG/CCWGG (W is A or T) sequences, which arise from deamination of 5&#x02032;-C<sup>5me</sup>CWGG/CCWGG, methyl group addition resulting from the action of the <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA cytosine methyltransferase (Dcm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Thus while the principal biological function of VSP repair is to prevent <sup>5me</sup>C to T mutations, its overall effect on the bacterial genomes is to maintain Dcm sites.</p><p>Several experimental observations have led to the conclusion that VSP repair has evolved a well-nuanced relationship with the general MMR proteins. Strains without a vsr gene are completely deficient in VSP repair, and hence, have a high frequency of C&#x02192;T mutations at 5-methylcytosines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). VSP repair is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), but not eliminated, in cells which are unable to produce MutS or MutL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>). Overexpression of Vsr leads to a mutator phenotype in <italic>E. coli</italic> which can be attenuated by simultaneous overexpression of MutL or MutH but not MutS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The two repair pathways seem to be separated in time, MMR being active mainly in the exponential phase whereas VSP repair operates in the stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Levels of MutS and MutH are down regulated as <italic>E. coli</italic> cells enter stationary phase whereas the amount of MutL does not alter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Finally, a physical and functional interaction and between MutL and Vsr has been demonstrated using bacterial- and yeast-two hybrid analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), and the observed stimulation of Vsr DNA binding and DNA cleavage by MutL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). A mutant Vsr protein lacking the N-terminal 14 amino acids (Vsr-&#x00394;14) has diminished endonuclease and VSP repair activity, but interacts with MutL as strongly as the wild type in a bacterial two-hybrid assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). However, the endonuclease activation of Vsr-&#x00394;14 by MutL was eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Recently, based on <italic>in vivo</italic> data, it has been suggested that MMR MutS and MutL collaborate with Vsr endonuclease in the repair of O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine by methyltransferases, i.e. Ada and Ogt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). However, little biochemical data is available that directly demonstrates competition or synergism between Vsr and the MMR-protein MutS <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Here we present a detailed biochemical and biophysical analysis of the physical and functional interaction between MutL and Vsr. For the first time we have investigated the functional interaction between MutS, MutL and Vsr in an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay using a long circular DNA substrate containing a T:G mismatch in the sequence context of the Vsr recognition sequence (see above). Our data suggest that the activation of MutH and Vsr by MutL follow a similar mechanism involving a mobile MutS&#x02013;MutL complex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, plasmids, enzymes and reagents</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> K12 strains CC106 (P90C [<italic>ara</italic>&#x00394;[<italic>lac</italic>-<italic>pro</italic>XIII] [F&#x02019;<italic>lacIZ proAB</italic><sup>+</sup>]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), TX2929 (CC106 <italic>mutS201</italic>::Tn<italic>5</italic>;Km<sup>r</sup>) and the pET-15b (Novagen) derived plasmids pTX412 and pTX418 containing the <italic>mutS</italic> and <italic>mutL</italic> genes, respectively, under control of the T7 promoter were kindly provided by Dr M.

However, it is not clear whether this interaction requires nucleotide binding by MutL, as observed for the interaction between MutL and MutH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). To answer this question the interactions between MutL and Vsr were assessed in an AUC sedimentation velocity experiment. Vsr distributed in the AUC cell mainly as a species with sedimentation coefficients of 1.9 S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) which is in good agreement with the sedimentation coefficient of 1.93 S calculated from the crystal structure for a Vsr monomer with HYDROPRO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>); a second minor species of 2.9 S was observed, however, the identity of this species could not be assigned (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp380/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> for additional information). The addition of AMPPNP, a non-hydrolysable analogue of ATP to Vsr had minimal effect on the distribution of the species: Vsr remained basically a monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) although the distribution became broader. MutL&#x02013;NTD was a single species with the peak centred around 3.1 S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) indicative of a monomeric form. The addition of 5 mM AMPPNP resulted in the formation of second species with sedimentation coefficient of 5.2 S indicative of the formation of the MutL&#x02013;NTD dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). In the absence of nucleotide, Vsr and MutL&#x02013;NTD did not form any significant amount of complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E). However, in the presence of AMPPNP an additional species with sedimentation coefficient of about 6.1 S was observed concomitant with the disappearance of the MutL&#x02013;NTD dimer.

To this end, we modified a series of single-cysteine MutL variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) with benzophenone-4-maleimide (BPM), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A) and subsequently tested the benzophenone-modified proteins for photocrosslinking to Vsr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Only MutL-314 was able to form a photocrosslink with Vsr in an ATP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B); this was verified by in-gel tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry analysis (data not shown). Interestingly, MutL-314 had been shown before to form a photocrosslink to MutH suggesting that the binding sites of MutL for MutH and Vsr are overlapping or in close proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Next we tested, whether MutL&#x02013;NTD is also sufficient to allow the formation of the photocrosslink with Vsr. To this end, MutL-314 was cleaved with thrombin which removes the N-terminal His-tag and cleaves the protein between Pro-364 and Arg-375 resulting in an N-terminal (MutL&#x02013;NTD-314) and a C-terminal (MutL&#x02013;CTD) fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).

Chemical modification experiments using PEG-5000 maleimide indicated that one to two cysteine residues can be modified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Notably, the variant Vsr-C139S, in which the surface exposed cysteine residue was exchanged to serine, displayed a significantly reduced but still observable labelling. This variant retained endonuclease activity and its ability to inhibit the MutL mediated mismatch-provoked activation of MutH, similar to wild type Vsr (data not shown), indicating that the mutation has not impaired the interaction with either DNA or MutL. In order to test whether any cysteine residue of Vsr is in close proximity to MutL, we attempted to crosslink benzophenone-modified Vsr and Vsr-C139S to full-length MutL and MutL&#x02013;NTD. In contrast to the photocrosslinking, the benzophenone-modified MutL&#x02013;NTD to Vsr, benzophenone-modified Vsr/Vsr-C139S did not form a photocrosslink with MutL&#x02013;NTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, lane 2). Crosslinked complexes to full-length MutL were observed with Vsr but not with Vsr-C139S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, lanes 4 and 8) suggesting that Cys-139 is involved in the photocrosslinking reaction to MutL. Following photocrosslinking of benzophenone-modified Vsr to a full-length MutL variant, labelled with a fluorophore at residue 297 in the NTD, limited proteolysis demonstrated that the photocrosslink is formed to residues of NTD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp380/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>). The absence of the photocrosslink with MutL&#x02013;NTD may be due to subtle structural changes in the orientation of Vsr bound to MutL in the absence of the MutL&#x02013;CTD thereby preventing the photocrosslink formation. Taken together our data support the idea that in complex with MutL the surface exposed Cys-139 of Vsr is in proximity to residues of the NTD of MutL. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Photocrosslinking of Vsr to MutL.

We tested Vsr for crosslinking to selected single-cysteine variants of MutL in the presence of AMPPNP using the long-range homobifunctional crosslinker MTS-11-MTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Variant MutL-327 formed a crosslink with both Vsr and the truncated form (Vsr-&#x00394;N), indicating that the loss of N-terminal amino acids did not influence the interaction between MutL and Vsr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lane 3). A quantitative analysis of the crosslinking yields revealed that MutL-327 formed significantly more crosslinked products to Vsr than any other MutL variant tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Similar to the physical interaction analysis and the photocrosslinking experiments, chemical crosslinking was dependent on the presence of nucleotide (ATP, AMPPNP or ADP) and was not observed in the absence of nucleotide (data not shown). These results suggest that one or more cysteine residues clustering in two regions of Vsr, are in close proximity to residue 327 of MutL. Since Cys-139 was important for the formation of a photocrosslinked product from benzophenone-modified Vsr to MutL, we asked whether this residue is also important for chemical crosslinking. In contrast to the photocrosslinking reaction, chemical crosslinking was still possible between MutL-327 and Vsr-C139S indicating that Cys-139 is not essential for formation of the chemical crosslink (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lane 5). We concluded that one of the exposed residues from the zinc-binding site is involved in the chemical crosslink reaction. This assumption is supported by the fact that similar results were obtained with the double mutant Vsr-C59S/C139S and that chemical crosslinking between MutL-327 and either Vsr or Vsr-C139S was strongly impaired upon addition of 100 &#x000b5;M ZnCl<sub>2</sub> (data not shown). <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Thiol&#x02013;thiol crosslinking: (<bold>A</bold>) The homobifunctional crosslinker MTS-11-MTS was used to crosslink MutL-327 in its AMPPNP form to Vsr or Vsr-C139S, respectively.

We asked whether the physical interaction between Vsr and MutL is sufficient to explain the inhibitory effect on MMR <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here, we tested the influence of Vsr on the initial steps in DNA MMR, i.e. the mismatch-provoked activation of the MutH endonuclease by MutS and MutL. To this end, we tested the cleavage of a linear DNA substrate containing a single unmethylated GATC site and a T:G mismatch in a sequence context not related to the Vsr-recognition sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). Upon incubation with MutH (200 nM), MutL (1 &#x000b5;M) and MutS (400 nM), this DNA substrate is nicked twice in both unmethylated DNA strands resulting in two linear products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). Under the conditions used, the DNA cleavage rate by MutH was &#x0003e;20-fold lower in the absence of MutS, MutL, or the T:G mismatch (data not shown). Addition of about 200 nM levels of Vsr inhibited the reaction by 50% and Vsr in excess over MutL almost completely abolished DNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). Similar results were obtained using a circular heteroduplex DNA containing a single T:G mismatch and a hemimethylated GATC-site (data not shown). Next we tested the accessibility of the GATC site in the presence of MutS, MutL and Vsr by monitoring the DNA cleavage at the GGATCC site by BamHI. No inhibitory effect on BamHI cleavage by Vsr was observed, ruling out blocking of the GATC-site by non-specific DNA binding of Vsr (data not shown). Using a different circular heteroduplex DNA substrate with a BamHI-site only 4 bp away from the T:G mismatch binding of MutS is blocking the action of BamHI whereas Vsr is not, indicating that Vsr is not strongly binding to this mismatch. However, Vsr is inhibiting the mismatch-provoked activation of MutH on this substrate similar as for the linear heteroduplex DNA shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp380/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>). Finally, we tested the inhibitory action of Vsr on the MutS and mismatch-independent activation of MutH by MutL that is observed only at low ionic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Under the conditions used, the rate of DNA cleavage by MutH (500 nM) is 0.24 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Upon addition of 2 &#x000b5;M Vsr this rate decreased almost 10-fold to 0.03 min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> (data not shown). In conclusion, a competition between Vsr and MutS for mismatch binding is not necessary for the interference by Vsr of MutH mediated DNA cleavage, which is a consequence of competition between Vsr and MutH for binding to MutL. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Inhibition of mismatch-provoked MutS/MutL-dependent activation of MutH by Vsr: (<bold>A</bold>) Scheme for double nicking of a T:G mismatch DNA containing a single unmethylated GATC-site (484 bp) by MutH resulting in two cleavage products (209 and 275 bp).

Therefore, we analyzed the role of MutS and ATP hydrolysis on the activity of Vsr using a covalently closed circular DNA substrate containing a single T:G mismatch in the recognition sequence of Vsr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). Our analysis demonstrates that the endonuclease activity of Vsr is greatly stimulated in the presence of MutS, MutL and ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). Under the experimental conditions containing near physiological salt concentrations (125 mM KCl) neither MutL nor MutS alone were able to stimulate the Vsr endonuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, lanes 3 and 4). Moreover, the stimulation was dependent on the presence of ATP which cannot be substituted by ADP (compare lanes 6 and 8). In the absence of Vsr, no cleavage was observed with MutS, MutL and ATP (lane 10). Furthermore, DNA substrates without a mismatch or a mismatch in a different sequence context were not cleaved by Vsr indicating the observed DNA nicking was specific for Vsr (data not shown). AUC and crosslinking revealed that the interaction of Vsr and MutL required nucleotide binding but not hydrolysis. Therefore, we asked whether the MutS-dependent stimulation of Vsr requires the ATPase activity of MutL. To this end the ATP-binding proficient but ATPase impaired variant MutL-E29A was tested for its ability to stimulate the Vsr endonuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>) (24). In contrast to the results obtained with wild-type MutL little or no stimulation of DNA nicking by Vsr was observed with this variant suggesting that ATP-binding and ATP-hydrolysis are required for a functional interaction between MutL and Vsr under physiological salt concentrations. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Stimulation of the Vsr endonuclease activity requires MutS, MutL and ATP-hydrolysis: (<bold>A</bold>) A covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA containing a T:G mismatch (shown in bold) was generated as described in Materials and Methods.

The repair of T:G mismatches by the MMR and the VSP systems falls into this category. MMR is inhibited by excess Vsr, reflecting a physical and functional interaction between MutL and Vsr, as shown by several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22">20&#x02013;22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data, using sedimentation velocity analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), clearly show the formation of a protein&#x02013;protein complex between MutL and Vsr, supporting the <italic>in vivo</italic> observations. Indeed, using photochemical and chemical crosslinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) we could map the interaction site of MutL for Vsr to a site overlapping with the binding site for MutH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). This finding supports a model of competition for a common binding site on MutL between the MMR MMR proteins MutH and the VSP protein Vsr, explaining the inhibitory effect of Vsr overexpression on MMR <italic>in vivo</italic>, which is reversed by overproduction of either MutL or MutH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Indeed, we could demonstrate that Vsr does not influence initial steps in DNA MMR, i.e. ternary complex formation between DNA, MutS and MutL (data not shown). However, Vsr efficiently inhibits the mismatch-provoked MutS and MutL-dependent activation of MutH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp380/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>), suggesting that the mutagenic effect of Vsr arises as a direct consequence of competition between MutH and Vsr for binding to MutL, postulated before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). As expected, MutH inhibited the activation of Vsr by MutS and MutL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp380/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>).</p><p>The stimulatory effect of both MutS and MutL on VSP repair has been puzzling, especially since structural analysis of the MutS-DNA and Vsr-DNA complexes clearly revealed that MutS and Vsr cannot be bound simultaneously to the same DNA mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). In the present study we demonstrated that the physical interaction between MutL and Vsr is important but not sufficient for an enhancement of Vsr activity under physiological ionic strength. Our analysis revealed that both MutL and MutS are necessary and sufficient for the stimulation of Vsr endonuclease and that this functional interaction requires ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), similar to the mismatch-provoked activation of MutH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Whereas the physical interaction between MutL and Vsr could be observed in the absence of ATP-hydrolysis and with the N-terminal domain of MutL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), the functional interaction, resulting in activation of Vsr, requires ATP-hydrolysis, as the ATPase deficient MutL-E29A has almost completely lost its stimulatory ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Similarly, MutL-E29A is not able to support the mismatch-provoked activation of MutH at physiological ionic strength (125 mM KCl). Our conclusions are at odds with experiments conducted at low ionic strength (20 mM NaCl), suggesting a role for ATP-hydrolysis by MutL only for steps after DNA incision by MutH and loading of DNA helicase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). However, the conclusions are fully consistent with data reporting the inability of MutS to further increase the MutH activation by MutL-E29A at higher ionic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Notably, at lower salt concentration (e.g. 50 mM KCl) MutL-E29A is able to activate MutH in a MutS independent manner as similarly described for MutL wild type (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>).</p><p>Several conclusions can be drawn from the present study. MutL shares a common or overlapping interaction site for two of its effector proteins, MutH and Vsr. The interaction site for MutH is located between the N- and C-terminal domains reminiscent to the position of the client binding site of Hsp90 which shares structural homology to MutL in the ATPase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Although binding of the effector proteins (Vsr or MutH) to the MutL-NTD is dependent on nucleotide binding but not hydrolysis, this is not true for the functional interaction. At physiological ionic strength, the activation of Vsr and also MutH (data not shown) in a mismatch and MutS-dependent manner requires ATP-hydrolysis by MutL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Finally, since mismatch binding by MutS and Vsr is mutually exclusive, only models involving a mobile rather a stationary MutS that does not remain bound at the mismatch are consistent with the observed MutS&#x02013;MutL-dependent activation of Vsr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Similarly, MMR has been reported to be efficient even if the mismatch and the GATC-site are separated by only 4 bp, a distance which is too short to allow simultaneous binding of MutS at the mismatch and MutH at the GATC-site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>).</p><p>We envision at least two possible ways that MutS and MutL could allow access of Vsr to the T/G mismatch, or MutH to adjacent GATC sites. One possibility is that MutS and MutL leave the site of the mismatch before the arrival of the effector proteins, as has been proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). The only way to explain the stimulatory effect of the MutS&#x02013;MutL complex is to postulate that it changes the conformation of the DNA to make it easier to bind. Our data show that Vsr and MutL interact, which makes this scenario unlikely. The other possibility is that MutS and MutL act as damage sensors, recruiting any one of a number of effectors to the site. The resulting ATP-dependent interactions between sensor(s) and effector(s) both displace the sensors and activate the effectors. Such a model is supported by recent <italic>in vivo</italic> studies showing that MutL recruits the Vsr and MutH endonucleases in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). If the recruited protein is able to mediate repair, the MutS&#x02013;MutL complex would dissociate. If the recruited protein is unable to mediate repair, the MutS&#x02013;MutL complex would remain, allowing subsequent recruitment of another effector. Such a model would account for the fact that MutS and MutL enhance Vsr activity, but are not required for VSP repair.</p><p>The inhibitory effect of Vsr on MMR explains why regulation of Vsr expression is required for proper MMR function (and vice versa for MutH in stationary phase although). Indeed, MutH is inhibiting the activation of Vsr by MutS and MutL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp380/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>). However, beside this, it is possible that Vsr is kept low in growing cells not because it interferes with MMR but because it can stimulate CTAGG-to-CCAGG mutations, as shown before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).</p><p>The question of when and how Vsr or MutH enter and leave the repair pathway needs to be addressed before the mechanistic details of competition and cooperation between various proteins interacting with MutL can be understood. The observed similarities between the stimulation of Vsr and MutH by MutS and MutL offers new routes for future in-depth analysis of the activation of effector proteins in the MMR pathways in a comparative manner. Only one Vsr homolog from another organism has been analyzed but not in the context of MMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Since homologs of a Vsr endonuclease are present in 198 bacterial species [REFSEQ 01-23-09 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>)] from across the bacterial kingdom in contrast to MutH homologs that are almost exclusively found in &#x003b3;-proteobacteria (currently 130 in REFSEQ), it will be important to understand whether the observed physical and functional interaction between Vsr and MutL in <italic>E. coli</italic> is a general DNA repair pathway used also in other bacteria. The functional assay involving the activation of Vsr by MutS and MutL described in the present study might be exploited for the mechanistic analysis of DNA MMR pathways in bacterial systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp380/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp380_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkp380_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>German Science Foundation [FR1495/3-2 and GRK1384 to PF], UK BBSRC [13/E19804 to BAC, PhD studentship to SLE] and the Canadian Institutes for Health Research [to C.C.].
