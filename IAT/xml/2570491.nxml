The responsible gene, <italic>BHD</italic>, has been identified by positional cloning and thought to be a novel tumor suppressor gene. <italic>BHD</italic> mutations cause many types of diseases including renal cell carcinomas, fibrofolliculomas, spontaneous pneumothorax, lung cysts, and colonic polyps/cancers. By combining Gateway Technology with the <italic>Ksp-Cre</italic> gene knockout system, we have developed a kidney-specific <italic>BHD</italic> knockout mouse model. <italic>BHD<sup>flox/flox</sup>/Ksp-Cre</italic> mice developed enlarged kidneys characterized by polycystic kidneys, hyperplasia, and cystic renal cell carcinoma. The affected <italic>BHD<sup>flox/flox</sup>/Ksp-Cre</italic> mice died of renal failure at approximate three weeks of age, having blood urea nitrogen levels over tenfold higher than those of <italic>BHD <sup>flox/&#x0002b;</sup>/Ksp-Cre</italic> and wild-type littermate controls. We further demonstrated that these phenotypes were caused by inactivation of <italic>BHD</italic> and subsequent activation of the mTOR pathway. Application of rapamycin, which inhibits mTOR activity, to the affected mice led to extended survival and inhibited further progression of cystogenesis. These results provide a correlation of kidney-targeted gene inactivation with renal carcinoma, and they suggest that the <italic>BHD</italic> product FLCN, functioning as a cyst and tumor suppressor, like other hamartoma syndrome&#x02013;related proteins such as PTEN, LKB1, and TSC1/2, is a component of the mTOR pathway, constituting a novel FLCN-mTOR signaling branch that regulates cell growth/proliferation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Birt&#x02013;Hogg&#x02013;Dub&#x000e9; (BHD) syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disease characterized by fibrofolliculomas (follicular hamartomas), renal cell carcinomas, spontaneous pneumothorax, and lung cysts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003581-Birt1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

These findings imply that FLCN, like PTEN, may also be a pivotal tumor suppressor gene and a potential player in mTOR pathway. Over the last few years, interest in FLCN has grown significantly. A few model organisms have been used to explore the physiological role of FLCN. However, these studies presented discrepant results, which leave the function of FLCN elusive. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the Bhd homologue was linked to JAK-STAT and Dpp pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003581-Singh1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although natural mutants could be used for experimental models, the possibilities of homozygous embryonic lethality and additional unknown genetic changes often impede further analysis of the phenotypes and the physiological role of the gene. The genetically engineered conditional knockout mouse model can bypass this barrier and provide a &#x0201c;cleaner&#x0201d; and more versatile system for functional studies of <italic>BHD</italic> gene protein FLCN. While it might be a suppressor of mouse cystogenesis demonstrated by a recent study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003581-Baba2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>BHD</italic> is expected to be a potential tumor suppressor gene whose mutations have led to renal tumors and other diseases in BHD patients.

The occurrence of cystic RCC in the general population is 4 to 10&#x00025;, or 1 to 2&#x00025; of all renal tumors. The cystic RCC does not present as a solid mass, but rather as a unilocular or multilocular cystic mass that is composed of cancer cells growing in the form of cysts that are distinct from regular cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003581-g003"><bold>Figures 3I,J</bold></xref><bold> and </bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003581.s002"><bold>S1</bold></xref>). While some of the tumor cells lined the septa, the others protruded into the cystic lumen. Most of the tumor cells were larger than the regular cystic cells. Binucleated cystic RCC cells were also observed. Many cystic spaces are filled with hemorrhage or proteinaceous fluid. No solid tumors were observed in any of the affected mice, which may be attributed to their short lifespan; three weeks might not be sufficient for solid tumor development.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Deficiency of FLCN and subsequent activation of mTOR contributed to renal cysts and RCCs</title><p>To elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of the cystogenesis and carcinogenesis related to inactivation of the <italic>BHD</italic> gene, we investigated the possible relevance of <italic>BHD</italic> to the mTOR signaling pathway for the following reasons: 1) our microarray analysis revealed that ectopic expression of the <italic>BHD</italic> gene product, FLCN, led to down-regulation of the AKT- related mTOR pathway signature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003581.s003"><bold>Figure S2</bold></xref>); 2) <italic>BHD</italic>, <italic>PTEN</italic>, <italic>LKB1</italic>, and <italic>TSC1/2</italic> are all hamartoma syndrome&#x02013;related genes, and the roles of PTEN, LKB1, and TSC1/2 in the mTOR pathway have been well-established; and 3) <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments indicated that FLCN interacted with AMPK, a member of the mTOR pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003581-Baba1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. All these clues implied that <italic>BHD</italic> gene may play an important role in suppression of cystogenesis and tumorigenesis and that its inactivation could lead to the formation of renal cysts and RCC through the mTOR pathway.</p><p>Before investigating the correlation of FLCN with mTOR pathway, we first examined the distribution of FLCN in normal mouse kidney and polycystic kidney. To do this, we designed and developed a human BHD monoclonal antibody that is compatible with immunohistochemical analysis in the mouse. While FLCN was predominantly expressed in the normal proximal tubules and collecting ducts in the cortex, obvious expression was rarely observed in the kidney distal tubules of mice at age of 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003581-g003"><bold>Figure 3K&#x02013;N</bold></xref>). In the polycystic kidney, FLCN was only detected in relatively normal tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003581-g003"><bold>Figure 3C&#x02013;F</bold></xref>), which are mainly proximal tubules. A small number of proximal tubules were also enlarged due to moderate expression of Ksp-Cre recombinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003581-g003"><bold>Figure 3F</bold></xref>, arrow), which is different from the previous report where the proximal tubules are not involved. All the enlarged tubules were FLCN-negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003581-g003"><bold>Figure 3C,D</bold></xref>), indicating a correlation of the formation of cysts with inactivation of the <italic>BHD</italic> gene.</p><p>We then explored whether the inactivation of <italic>BHD</italic> resulted in the activation of mTOR in affected cysts and RCCs. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that mTOR was activated through phosphorylation in cysts and cystic RCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003581-g004"><bold>Figure 4A&#x02013;C</bold></xref>), which stained FLCN-negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003581-g004"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>). We further examined the phosphorylation status of the downstream target S6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003581-g004"><bold>Figure 4D</bold></xref>). Phosphorylated S6 has been observed in some cysts and in cystic RCC. Although FLCN was reported to be a possible downstream effector of mTOR in an <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003581-Baba1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, our data revealed that deficiency of FLCN activated mTOR pathway <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting mTOR might a downstream target of FLCN. To further elucidate the correlation of FLCN and mTOR, we applied the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin to affected mice to see whether we could inhibit or reverse the development of cysts. Rapamycin treatment significantly extended the survival period of <italic>BHD<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>/<italic>Ksp-Cre</italic> mice and inhibited the development of cysts relative to control mice; some mice survived more than 50 days. However, once the rapamycin treatment was stopped, cysts redeveloped rapidly and the mice died within 10 days. This result indicated that rapamycin can inhibit cystic cell growth, but cannot reverse the cystic kidney phenotype. We also tested a few other members of the mTOR pathway (e.g. AKT) through IHC; no significant changes were observed or inconsistent results were obtained following inactivation of <italic>BHD</italic>, implying a novel FLCN-mTOR pathway branch may exists. In addition, FLCN might be related to other signaling pathways. Obviously, the precise <italic>in vivo</italic> mode of action of FLCN merits more investigation.</p><fig id="pone-0003581-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003581.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>mTOR signaling pathway was activated in the cystic cells, cystic RCC cells.</title><p>(A) Cystic RCC was stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E).

By developing and subsequently analyzing the conditional BHD knockout mouse model, we demonstrate that the deletion of <italic>BHD</italic> in the mouse kidney leads to cystic renal cell carcinoma (cystic RCC) in addition to polycystic kidney and hyperplasia. The cystic RCC was only observed in the older affected mice (&#x02265;20 days old).

It is entirely possible that if the cysts had not caused kidney failure at age of three weeks, progression of these cystic RCC to solid tumors would have occurred. In addition, inactivation of <italic>BHD</italic> gene in the kidney causes a large proportion of tubules to form cysts. Once cystogenesis starts, fast-growing cysts become dominant and lead to highly cystic kidneys, kidney failure, and early death. Thus, lack of appropriate microenvironment might be another reason that the malignant/pre-malignant cells failed to form solid renal tumors, which is a more complicated and slower process.</p><p>Our results further demonstrated that deficiency of <italic>BHD</italic> product FLCN led to activation of mTOR pathway in cystic cells, supporting the recent report and consolidating that FLCN is involved in mTOR pathway and mTOR may be downstream target of FLCN<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003581-Baba2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.
