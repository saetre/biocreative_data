The senescence response in mammalian cells can be elicited by DNA-damaging agents. In the present study we report that the DNA-damaging agent N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) is able to induce senescence in the HCT-116 colon cancer cell line.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Cells treated with lower concentrations of MNNG (0&#x02013;25 microM) for 50 h showed a dose-dependent increase in G<sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest and apoptosis; however, cells treated with higher concentrations of MNNG (50&#x02013;100 microM) showed a senescence-like G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>phase arrest which was confirmed by increased expression of &#x003b2;-galactosidase, a senescence induced marker. The G<sub>2/</sub>M phase arrest and apoptosis were found to be associated with increased levels of p53 protein, but the senescence-like G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>phase arrest was dissociated with p53 protein levels, since the p53 protein levels decreased in senescence-like arrested cells. We further, determined whether the decreased level of p53 was a transcriptional or a translational phenomenon. The results revealed that the decreased level of p53 protein in senescence-like arrested cells was a transcriptional phenomenon since <italic>p53 </italic>mRNA levels simultaneously decreased after treatment with higher concentrations of MNNG. We also examined the effect of MNNG treatment on other cell cycle-related proteins such as p21, p27, cyclin B1, Cdc2, c-Myc and max. The expression levels of these proteins were increased in cells treated with lower concentrations of MNNG, which supported the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest. However, cells treated with higher concentrations of MNNG showed decreased levels of these proteins, and hence, may not play a role in cell cycle arrest. We then examined a possible association of the expression of APC protein and telomeric DNA signals with cellular senescence in MNNG-treated cells. We found that protein and mRNA levels of <italic>APC </italic>were drastically reduced in cells treated with higher concentrations of MNNG. The loss of <italic>APC </italic>expression might lead to chromosomal instability as well as microtubular disorganization through its dissociation with tubulin.

It was initially described in cultures of human fibroblast cells that lost the ability to divide indefinitely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The proliferative life-span of normal human cells is limited by the replicative or cellular senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The major feature of senescent phenotype includes an irreversible arrest of cell division, resistance to apoptotic cell death, specific changes in cellular functions, and senescent associated secretion of a variety of molecules such as proteases, cytokines and growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Phenotypically, similar processes can be achieved by accelerating senescence using various DNA-damaging agents such as &#x003b3;-radiations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], oncogenic stimulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and genetic or pharmacological manipulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It is evident from the literature that the loss of tumor suppressor function is one of the major causes of transformation and immortalization of normal cells. Inactivation of tumor suppressor gene <italic>p53 </italic>or Adenomatous polyposis coli (<italic>APC</italic>) are among the most common causes of colon cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Very often, the defective expressions of tumor suppressor genes with cancer development are linked with genetic instability. In colorectal cancer, genetic instability occurs in two forms &#x02013; microsatelite instability (MSI) and chromosomal instability (CIN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In MSI instability, there is a defect in mismatch repair machinery that consequently results in the instability of repetitive DNA sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In CIN, tumors exhibit a defect in chromosomal segregation, which results in variation of chromosome numbers among individual cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Recently, mutations in the <italic>APC </italic>gene have been linked with CIN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Mutations in the <italic>APC </italic>gene produce truncated proteins. Many of the somatic mutations in the <italic>APC </italic>gene are located in the central region of the gene which is called as mutation cluster region (MCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Cellular levels of APC are critical for maintaining cytoskeletal integrity, cellular adhesion, and Wnt signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. APC also binds and stabilizes microtubules in vivo and in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and clusters at the ends of microtubules near the plasma membrane of interphase cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Another important aspect of <italic>APC </italic>is its transcriptional activation by p53 in response to DNA-damaging agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The activation of p53 by DNA-damaging agents induces cell cycle arrest, apoptotic cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], or senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The role of p53 in cell cycle arrest in G<sub>1 </sub>phase is mediated by transcriptional activation of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21(Waf-1/Cip1), whereas in apoptosis it is mediated by transcriptional activation of mediators including <underline>p</underline>53 <underline>u</underline>pregulated <underline>m</underline>odulator of <underline>a</underline>poptosis (PUMA) and <underline>p</underline>53-<underline>i</underline>nduced <underline>g</underline>ene <underline>3</underline> (PIG3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. p53 also plays a role in cell cycle arrest in G<sub>2 </sub>phase by transcriptionally activating the expression of <italic>14-3-3&#x003c3; </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Biochemical and functional analysis of <italic>p53 </italic>has also demonstrated its participation in the regulation of DNA damage-induced senescence and DNA repair, which can suppress tumorogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. During cellular senescence, the length of telomeric DNA also decreases, possibly due to the absence of telomerase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Senescent cells remain viable indefinitely and express specific phenotype markers, such as senescence-associated &#x003b2;-galactosidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In the present study, we investigated whether DNA-damaging agent MNNG can induce senescence-like cell cycle arrest in colon cancer cells. Data is presented to determine whether in these cells the expression levels of p53, APC, &#x003b1;-tubulin and telomeric DNA are associated with senescence-like cell cycle arrest.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>G<sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest, apoptosis, and senescence in HCT-116 cells treated with different concentrations of MNNG</title><p>Cellular senescence is a process of irreversible arrest of cell division that can be induced by DNA-damaging agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. DNA-damaging agents can also activate p53-dependent and -independent pathways leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Since HCT-116 cells contain a wild-type <italic>p53 </italic>and <italic>p21 </italic>genes, their role in G<sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest and apoptosis is highly likely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>In order to asses the effect of DNA-damaging agent MNNG on cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of HCT-116 cells, we treated the synchronized cells with varying concentrations of MNNG (0 to 100 &#x003bc;M) for 50 h. Cells were harvested and analyzed for their distribution into different phases of cell cycle by FACS analysis. We found an increased G<sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest in cells treated with lower concentrations of MNNG (0&#x02013;25 &#x003bc;M), which dropped to the control level in cells treated with higher concentrations of MNNG (50 and 100 &#x003bc;M) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The number of cells in the G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>phase decreased in a dose-dependent manner as concentrations of MNNG treatment increased to 25 &#x003bc;M, but beyond this concentration of MNNG treatment, an increased G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>phase arrest in HCT-116 cells was evident. Interestingly, at 100 &#x003bc;M of MNNG treatment, the HCT-116 cells showed a major change in their cell cycle arrest profile in which the G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>phase arrest was significantly increased, and the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest was decreased as compared to control cells. Furthermore, the sub-G<sub>1 </sub>cells, which represent the apoptotic cells, increasingly accumulated until 50 &#x003bc;M of MNNG treatment and then drastically decreased to the control level at 100 &#x003bc;M of MNNG treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These results suggest that HCT-116 cells exhibit a dual response, i.e., a G<sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest and apoptosis and G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>phase arrest, respectively, after treatment with lower or higher concentrations of MNNG.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Cell cycle analysis in HCT-116 cells treated with MNNG. </bold>HCT-116 cells were treated with different concentrations of MNNG for 50 h.

The increased p53 protein level was seen and correlated with G<sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest and apoptosis in HCT-116 cells treated with lower concentrations of MNNG. However, at higher concentrations of MNNG treatment, a drastically reduced level of p53 protein was observed. Since an increased level of p53 protein is often associated with senescence, the decreased level of p53 protein and increased level of senescence in HCT-116 cells treated with higher concentrations of MNNG suggests that the role of p53 is probably not involved in MNNG-induced senescence-like growth arrest in HCT-116 cells. We further tested whether the decrease in the p53 protein level at 100 &#x003bc;M MNNG treatment was a transcriptional or a post-translational phenomenon. We carried out the Northern blot analysis for <italic>p53 </italic>mRNA levels in HCT-116 cells treated with different concentrations of MNNG. Results showed an increased level of <italic>p53 </italic>mRNA up to 10 &#x003bc;M MNNG treatment. However, at higher concentrations of MNNG treatment, a reduced level of <italic>p53 </italic>mRNA level was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The decreased level of <italic>p53 </italic>mRNA at 25 &#x003bc;M or higher concentrations of MNNG treatment did not correlate with the increased level of p53 protein. These results suggest that the treatment of HCT-116 cells with 0&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;M MNNG is a transcriptional phenomenon, while the treatment with 25&#x02013;50 &#x003bc;M MNNG is a post-translational protein stabilization effect of p53. However, treatment with 100 &#x003bc;M MNNG caused a very low level of both <italic>p53 </italic>mRNA and protein. We expected a post-translational stabilization of p53 at 100 &#x003bc;M MNNG treatment, as it was found after lower concentrations of MNNG treatment, but this was not the case. It appears that both transcription-mediated down-regulation of <italic>p53 </italic>gene expression and de-stabilization of p53 protein are playing a role to exhibit reduced levels of p53 protein at 100 &#x003bc;M MNNG treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold><italic>p53 </italic>mRNA and protein levels in HCT-116 cells treated with MNNG. </bold>HCT-116 cells were treated with different concentrations of MNNG (0&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;M) for 15 h, and total RNA was isolated for Northern blot analysis as described in Materials and Methods.

In these experiments, we analyzed the protein levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27 in MNNG-treated HCT-116 cells. Our results showed that the protein levels of p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27 were increased up to 25 &#x003bc;M MNNG treatment and then decreased after higher concentrations of MNNG treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Since Cdc2 and cyclin B1 are associated with G<sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], we also determined their protein levels in HCT-116 cells treated with MNNG. The result showed an increased Cdc2 and cyclin B1 levels in cells treated with up to 25 &#x003bc;M MNNG and then decreased after higher concentrations of MNNG treatment as compared to control cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The increased Cdc2/cyclin B1 levels correlated with G<sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest in HCT-116 cells treated with lower concentrations of MNNG. However, in senescence-like arrested cells it appeared that Cdc2/cyclin B1 does not play any role, since the expression of these proteins was drastically decreased in these cells. We next determined whether the c-Myc and Max protein levels were altered after MNNG treatment. c-Myc transcription factor heterodimerizes with Max and regulates the expression of genes involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. It also regulates cell cycle progression and expression of other genes, which control cellular senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].

On the other hand, the Max protein level increased at higher concentrations of MNNG treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

Based upon these findings, we suspected that the loss of APC in HCT-116 cells treated with higher concentrations of MNNG may lead to microtubule disorganization. For these experiments, the HCT-116 cells were grown on cover slips and treated with different concentrations of MNNG for 50 h. Cells were fixed and analyzed for APC and microtubule structural protein, &#x003b1;-tubulin, organization in HCT-116 cells by immunohistochemistry. After treatment with MNNG, cells were also examined for their morphological changes followed by immunostaining. Morphological observations suggested that cells were still viable, but their growth was drastically reduced at higher concentrations of MNNG treatment as compared to untreated cells. Immunostaining showed a reduced level of APC protein in HCT-116 cells treated with 100 &#x003bc;M MNNG. The analysis of &#x003b1;-tubulin after immunostaining also showed a loss of structural integrity of cells treated with 100 &#x003bc;M MNNG. A disrupted association of &#x003b1;-tubulin and APC can be seen in the cells treated at this concentration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, see merged staining). These results indicate that the structural organization of APC and &#x003b1;-tubulin proteins is disrupted in MNNG-induced senescence-like G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>phase arrested HCT-116 cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Immunohistochemical analysis of APC and &#x003b1;-tubulin proteins in HCT-116 cells after treatment with MNNG. </bold>Cells were grown in 0.5% FBS containing medium on cover slips and treated with different concentrations of MNNG for 50 h.

The exact relationship between DNA damage-induced telomere loss and cellular senescence has not been clearly defined. In the present study, we examined whether senescence-like G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>phase arrest of HCT-116 cells after treatment with higher concentrations of MNNG was associated with the loss of telomeric DNA. HCT-116 cells were treated with 50 and 100 &#x003bc;M MNNG for 50 h and processed for Q-FISH analysis.

Previously, it has been shown that the primary effect of the loss of expression of the <italic>APC </italic>gene in polyps is the accumulation and stabilization of &#x003b2;-catenin protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The stabilized &#x003b2;-catenin then translocates to the nucleus and binds to T-cell factor (Tcf)/lymphoid enhancer factor (Lef), a nuclear transcription factor, and induces target genes such as <italic>cyclin D1 </italic>and the oncogene <italic>c-myc </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In the present study, we determined the involvement of the APC protein in DNA damage-induced senescence-like G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>phase arrest of HCT-116 cells. Our results showed that the treatment of HCT-116 cells with lower concentrations of MNNG (0&#x02013;50 &#x003bc;M) for 50 h resulted in a dose-dependent increase of the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest and apoptosis. The G<sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest and apoptosis was associated with an increased level of cellular p53 protein, which was consistent with previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The p53 responds to DNA damage by activating transcription-dependent and -independent pathways leading to cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis and preventing proliferation of cells with damaged genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The increased or stabilized level of p53 and p21(Waf-1/Cip1) has been suggested to play a critical role in the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], which is consistent with our previous studies in HCT-116 cells treated with lower concentrations of MNNG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. However, HCT-116 cells treated with higher concentrations of MNNG showed a senescence-like G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>phase arrest but did not show any increase in p53 protein level. These results suggest that the p53-mediated pathway was not involved in the senescence-like G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>phase arrest of HCT-116 cells. It has been suggested that increased transcriptional activity of p53 protein also plays an important role in the senescence-like G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>phase arrest via transactivation of <italic>p21(Waf-1/Cip1) </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Since p21(Waf-1/Cip1) protein level was decreased in HCT-116 cells treated with higher concentrations of MNNG, our findings further suggest that the p53/p21(Waf-1/cip1) pathway is not involved in senescence-like G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>phase arrest of HCT-116 cells. Further, we found that other cell cycle related proteins such as p27, cdc2, Cyclin B1, c-Myc and Max were also not involved in senescence-like G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>phase arrest in HCT-116 cells; although, their role in senescence-like G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>arrest have been shown in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The difference in these and previous studies could have been due to differences in cell type and DNA damaging agents.</p><p>Once we determined that the p53/p21(Waf-1/Cip1) pathway was not involved in MNNG-induced senescence-like G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>phase arrest of HCT-116 cells, then we looked at other parameters which are suggested to be associated with chromosomal abnormalities and likely with senescence. For this part of the study, we determined the expression level of APC, &#x003b1;-tubulin, and telomeric DNA. The loss of APC protein can cause chromosomal instability (CIN) and microtubule disorganization that can lead to aneuploidy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The aneuploid cells can choose cell death, senescence, or cell survival pathways, depending upon the genetic pressure exerted upon these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. In the present study, we found that cells exhibiting senescence-like G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>phase arrest after treatment with higher concentrations of MNNG showed a drastically reduced level of APC and &#x003b1;-tubulin proteins, which suggest their role in MNNG-induced chromosomal instability and perhaps senescence-like G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>phase arrest of HCT-116 cells. This statement needs to be further verified by using the APC overexpression system to block DNA damage-induced senescence in these cells. In fact, the association of APC with microtubules plays an important role in chromosomal segregation in which the APC is specifically detected at the kinetochores, and the binding of APC at kinetochores requires intact microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Next, we examined whether the loss of MNNG-induced telomeric DNA was also associated with senescence-like G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>phase arrest of HCT-116 cells. In previous studies, a DNA damage checkpoint response in telomere-initiated senescence has been described in human diploid fibroblast (HDF) cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Although we have not determined the activity of checkpoint responsive CHK1 and CHK2 kinase activities, the MNNG-induced level of telomeric DNA was significantly decreased in HCT-116 cells. In earlier studies, we have shown that HCT-116 cells treated with lower concentrations of MNNG showed a dose-dependent loss of telomeric DNA in a p53-independent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In these studies, the loss in the amount of telomeric DNA at 50 &#x003bc;M MNNG treatment was approximately two-fold. However, in the present study, the loss in the amount of telomeric DNA at 100 &#x003bc;M MNNG treatment was more than two-fold. From these results, it appears that approximately two-fold loss of telomeric DNA favors G<sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest and apoptosis, and more than two-fold loss of telomeric DNA after treatment with MNNG is linked with senescence-like growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results suggest that MNNG-induced senescence-like growth arrest of HCT-116 cells is associated with decreased levels of APC, &#x003b1;-tubulin, and telomeric DNA.
