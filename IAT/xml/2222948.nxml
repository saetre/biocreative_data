The macula is the central region of the retina, the tissue at the back of the eye that converts light into electrical messages and sends them to the brain. In the commonest form of AMD&#x02014;&#x0201c;dry&#x0201d; AMD&#x02014;the light-sensitive cells in the macula gradually die. In &#x0201c;wet&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;neovascular&#x0201d; AMD (one in 10 cases of AMD, but responsible for 90&#x00025; of severe AMD-related blindness), abnormal blood vessels grow below the macula. Fluid leaking out of these vessels dislodges and damages the macula, after which loss of vision occurs rapidly. Both forms of AMD destroy the sharp central vision that is needed for reading and driving, leaving only dim, blurred images or a black hole at the center of vision. Neither form can be cured but with wet AMD the loss of vision can sometimes be slowed or halted if caught early by destroying the new blood vessels with laser surgery or a technique called photodynamic therapy or by blocking their formation by injecting special drugs into the eye.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>No-one knows what causes AMD but factors that increase a person's risk of developing the disease include increasing age, smoking, being white, and a family history of AMD. Recently, researchers have identified several &#x0201c;polymorphisms&#x0201d; (inherited DNA sequence variations that are common within populations) that are associated with AMD. These polymorphisms are in the complement factor H gene (the scientific symbol for this gene is <italic>CFH</italic>) and in a gene region called <italic>LOC387715/HTRA1.</italic> It would be useful to be able to use these risk factors to identify those people at the highest risk of developing neovascular AMD before the disease damages their vision. In this study, the researchers have investigated the association between AMD and polymorphisms in <italic>CFH</italic> and <italic>LOC387715/HTRA1</italic> in more depth. They have then used this new information to build a model of AMD risk that should allow physicians to identify individuals at high risk of developing neovascular AMD.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers catalogued polymorphisms in <italic>CFH</italic> and <italic>LOC387715/HTRA1</italic> in several hundred people with and without neovascular AMD. From these data, they identified three haplotypes (sets of polymorphisms that are inherited as a unit; everyone inherits two copies of each haplotype, one from each parent) in <italic>CFH</italic> that were more common in people with AMD than in those without and two that were associated with a decreased risk of developing AMD. In <italic>LOC387715/HTRA1</italic> they identified one particularly detrimental haplotype. Compared to people without this haplotype, people with one copy of the deleterious haplotype were three times as likely to develop neovascular AMD; people with two copies were thirty times as likely to develop AMD. Smoking history also had a large effect on susceptibility to AMD. The researchers then developed a simple AMD risk scoring system based on <italic>CFH</italic> and <italic>LOC387715/HTRA1</italic>haplotypes and smoking status. From this, they calculated that people with the lowest risk scores have a minimal risk of developing AMD whereas about 15&#x00025; of people with the highest risk scores are likely to develop AMD.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings indicate that it is possible to predict an individual's risk of developing AMD in old age by examining a small number of haplotypes and asking about their smoking status. The model developed by the researchers needs to be validated in other groups of people and may have to be modified if other gene variants that affect the risk of AMD are identified. For now, the results of this research provide physicians with a way to identify those individuals at the highest genetic risk of developing AMD so that they can step up their efforts to persuade these people to avoid smoking. In the future, when effective long-term treatments for AMD become available, the scoring system could also help doctors decide which of their elderly patients should be monitored most intensively for the early signs of AMD so that they can be treated before their vision is irreversibly damaged.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040355">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040355</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>MedlinePlus provides links to information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/maculardegeneration.html">macular degeneration</ext-link> and an <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001000.htm">encyclopedia page on macular degeneration</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Pages on the US National Institutes of Health <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nihseniorhealth.gov/agerelatedmaculardegeneration/toc.html">NIH SeniorHealth</ext-link> site provides text and speech information about AMD</p></list-item><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nei.nih.gov/health/maculardegen/armd_facts.asp">US National Eye Institute</ext-link> and the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/publicwebsite/public_rnib003635.hcsp">UK Royal National Institute of Blind People</ext-link> also provide information about AMD</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Hughes AE, Orr N, Patterson C, Esfandiary H, Hogg R, et al.

To avoid collinearity problems the lowest risk haplotype was omitted from the model so that odds ratios (ORs) were measured relative to homozygote carriers of this haplotype. An exception to this approach was made for analysis of the <italic>LOC387715</italic> and <italic>LOC387715/HTRA1</italic> region where increased risk of AMD was confined to one haplotype, with a much higher risk in homozygote carriers than predicted by the multiplicative model. For our final risk analysis, the number of copies carried of this detrimental haplotype were coded 0, 1, or 2. Tests for deviation from the multiplicative genetic model and for interactions between genetic risk factors and smoking were obtained using likelihood ratio Chi-squared tests. The fitted logistic model produced ORs that were converted to predicted probabilities of AMD for each possible combination of <italic>CFH</italic> and <italic>LOC387715/HTRA1</italic> haplotypes and smoking status.

We developed a risk model for disease based on comprehensive haplotyping of the genes followed by analysis using logistic regression that also included smoking status. Our model is the first that we know of to take account of haplotypes within the <italic>CFH</italic> and <italic>LOC387715/HTRA1</italic> regions, and allows early identification of those at high risk of developing neovascular AMD in old age. AMD was not inevitable for those in the highest-risk categories, hence exposure to a trigger may be necessary for development of disease.</p><p>AMD is one of the most common multifactorial diseases of the elderly. For several years, genes have been thought to play a role in susceptibility. The model generally applied to such complex disorders has been of multiple genes each contributing a small effect to overall risk, in conjunction with environmental factors. This model has been further complicated by the possibility of genes acting with either dominant or negative effects, of gene&#x02013;gene or gene&#x02013;environment interactions, and of genetic heterogeneity in which mutations in different genes may have a major influence in different individuals. As is often the case in clinical genetics, a much more straightforward pattern emerges when the possibilities are investigated and some ruled out. Credit must be given to the firm scientific base provided by well-designed linkage studies of families with more than one affected patient from which AMD susceptibility loci have been identified. Although individual studies often identified linkages that have not been confirmed, meta-analyses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040355-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d; clearly revealed the regions of Chromosomes 1 and 10 (from which the <italic>CFH</italic> gene cluster and <italic>LOC387715/PLEKHA1/HTRA1</italic> have recently emerged) as major susceptibility loci for all forms of AMD. It is increasingly likely that the genetic component of AMD should be viewed as oligogenic rather than polygenic.</p><p>The <italic>CFH</italic> gene cluster comprises five related genes that are all expressed. These genes share a very high level of homology arising from gene duplication, and care must be taken in typing and identifying polymorphic variants at the C-terminal region of CFH and in the <italic>CFH</italic>-related genes. We chose to score risk on the basis of five haplotypes of the most central block, which was in strong LD with the adjacent haplotype blocks in <italic>CFH</italic>, <italic>CFHR3</italic>, and <italic>CFHR1</italic>. Our earlier studies showed strong association between AMD and markers extending across this region &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040355-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Any coding variants or polymorphisms regulating splicing or expression of these genes may affect risk, and may be based within different haplotype blocks. We also typed Y402H and I62V, but analysis of these common coding polymorphisms did not confer additional information affecting AMD risk. Other studies have limited their analysis to the effect of Y402H, which has been regarded as the main determinant of disease, but this analysis gives an incomplete and inaccurate representation of the region. Only haplotype analysis can assess the effect of combinations of all the coding variants in <italic>CFH</italic> that may contribute to AMD susceptibility. The C allele of rs1061170, which types histidine at codon 402 within the first haplotype block, is associated with a haplotype conferring high risk of AMD, and is coupled with our haplotypes 1 and 2 in the second haplotype block. It is also in complete LD with several other SNPs, one of which has the potential to create a novel splice site and to introduce a new exon containing a premature stop codon. This variant would be expected to result in nonsense-mediated decay of the transcript and reduced CFH levels. Despite being associated with the T allele of rs1061170, haplotype 3 is only marginally less severe in risk than haplotype 1. Haplotypes 4 and 5 are relatively protective. We previously identified a deletion of 85 kb encompassing <italic>CFHR1</italic> and <italic>CFHR3</italic>, which plausibly confers the protective effect of haplotype 5 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040355-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. The coding variant most strongly associated with haplotype 4 may be the A allele of rs800292, which encodes I62, though this represents a conservative amino acid change. Further work is needed to clarify the molecular bases of the haplotypic effects.</p><p>Much interest surrounds the identity of the AMD susceptibility locus on Chromosome 10. Very strong data focus on the protein encoded by the hypothetical gene <italic>LOC387715</italic>, with the alanine-to-serine polymorphism detected by rs10490924 as the most probable causative variant &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040355-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Alternatives are either <italic>PLEKHA1</italic> or <italic>HTRA1</italic>, which flank the locus; <italic>HTRA1</italic>, which encodes a serine protease, is the more attractive on functional grounds. Another possibility is that the putative exons of <italic>LOC387715</italic> or additional open reading frames in the <italic>HTRA1</italic> promoter region may be included in alternative transcripts of <italic>HTRA1</italic>. The <italic>LOC387715</italic> transcript is exceedingly rare, but has been reported to be present at very low levels in the retina &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040355-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. The markers we typed for this locus identified all common haplotypes of a block that encompassed <italic>LOC387715</italic> to the <italic>HTRA1</italic> promoter. In contrast to the <italic>CFH</italic> gene cluster, the effect of the <italic>LOC387715/HTRA1</italic> region on AMD susceptibility appeared to be mediated through a single detrimental haplotype, with all others being generally protective. In addition to carrying the rare coding variant of rs10490924, the detrimental haplotype was also very strongly associated with several variants in the untranslated region of <italic>LOC387715</italic> and in the promoter of <italic>HTRA1</italic>, and we cannot at present discriminate between the relative merits of variation in <italic>LOC387715</italic> or the <italic>HTRA1</italic> promoter as effectors of AMD susceptibility at this locus.</p><p>Further genetic or environmental factors, or their interactions, may be found to affect AMD risk. These factors should be assessed for effect using a regression model that includes all proven genetic and environmental factors, rather than in isolation. Initial reports are prone to inflation to some extent by type 1 error. Conflicting data have been reported about a possible interaction between <italic>LOC387715</italic> and smoking &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040355-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040355-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;.

Although smoking status is of less importance than the two main genetic factors, it is a relatively straightforward risk to target in individuals with high genetic load. Our data show that if none of our population had smoked, there would have been an overall reduction of 33&#x00025; in AMD today. Our current and ex-smokers lost vision at an earlier age, so it is probable that our calculations underestimate the benefit to the population from nonsmoking. We did not assess the importance of smoking on earlier stages of AMD; however, delaying either onset of disease or advancement to the blinding end-stage by 5&#x02013;10 y would have a major impact on prevalence of blindness. It is now possible to identify those at high genetic risk for whom smoking is particularly unwise. In the past, smokers have been prepared to ignore greatly increased risks of lung cancer and other smoking-related diseases, but attitudes to smoking are changing. Relatives of AMD patients are more likely to carry an excess of <italic>LOC387715/HTRA1</italic> and <italic>CFH</italic>-related genetic risk factors. Those who are shown to be at high risk, with relatives who have lost their vision, may be more prepared to heed advice to refrain from smoking than the general population.</p><p>Gene therapy to repair genetic defects is still in the experimental phase and is largely unproven. Of great promise are methods aimed at gene silencing by degradation of RNA using short interfering double-stranded RNA molecules. Deletion of <italic>CFHR1</italic> and <italic>CFHR3</italic> from the <italic>CFH</italic>-related gene cluster is strongly protective against AMD, hence these genes make excellent targets for silencing in future studies aimed at reducing the burden of disease.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>We assessed the genetic factors and smoking history, which are generally accepted as conferring high population-attributable risk for AMD. The model we developed to estimate risk of neovascular AMD best fits our data, and it is important that it should be validated in independent datasets of similar phenotypes. It is possible that rare variants in other genes may be found to be highly influential in a small proportion of the population, and may cause AMD in a few individuals predicted to be at low risk using our present model.
