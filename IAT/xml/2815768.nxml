The mammalian Sir2 family member SIRT6 has been proposed to have analogous functions, because SIRT6-deficiency leads to shortened life span and an aging-like degenerative phenotype in mice, and SIRT6 knockout cells exhibit genomic instability and DNA damage hypersensitivity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these defects are not fully understood. Here, we show that SIRT6 forms a macromolecular complex with the DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair factor DNA-PK (DNA-dependent protein kinase) and promotes DNA DSB repair. In response to DSBs, SIRT6 associates dynamically with chromatin and is necessary for an acute decrease in global cellular acetylation levels on histone H3 Lysine 9. Moreover, SIRT6 is required for mobilization of the DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) to chromatin in response to DNA damage and stabilizes DNA-PKcs at chromatin adjacent to an induced site-specific DSB. Abrogation of these SIRT6 activities leads to impaired resolution of DSBs. Together, these findings elucidate a mechanism whereby regulation of dynamic interaction of a DNA repair factor with chromatin impacts on the efficiency of repair, and establish a link between chromatin regulation, DNA repair, and a mammalian Sir2 factor.</bold></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Sir2</kwd><kwd>SIRT6</kwd><kwd>genomic stability</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Silent Information Regulator-2 gene (Sir2) encodes an NAD-dependent histone deacetylase that links regulation of chromatin, genomic stability, and life span in S. cerevisiae. By promoting chromatin silencing, Sir2 inhibits transcription at several genetic loci and represses recombination at ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Yeast with mutations in Sir2 have increased genomic instability in the context of rDNA recombination, which in turn shortens replicative life span - a marker of reproductive aging in this organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Conversely, extracopies of Sir2 that suppress rDNA recombination increase replicative life span [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. These effects of Sir2 suggest paradigms in which genes that promote genome stabilization through chromatin modulation may be important contributors to regulation of organismal life span, aging, and age-related pathology. </p><p>Consistent with a conserved role for Sir2 factors in life span regulation, increased activity of Sir2 proteins in the multicellular organisms C. elegans and D. melanogaster also increases life span [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. However, these Sir2 factors may operate through mechanisms that are independent of genome stabilization, and their physiologic molecular substrates are still unclear. In mammals, there are seven Sir2 family members, SIRT1-SIRT7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. The SIRTs have been of great interest as candidate regulators of mammalian life span and aging-related processes. In this context, several mammalian SIRTs have functions that impact on aging-associated molecular pathways and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. However, initial studies of mammalian SIRTs linked these enzymes to biochemical targets and cellular functions that are distinct from those of S. cerevisiae Sir2. For example, mammalian SIRT1 was first reported to deacetylate the p53 tumor suppressor protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]; only later was SIRT1 shown to have a physiologic role in histone deacetylation, chromatin regulation, and most recently, genome stabilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Other mammalian SIRTs (SIRT2-SIRT5) are reported to have cytoplasmic or mitochondrial substrates (though recent work suggests that sub-cellular shuttling might allow these enzymes to target histones as well) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. In addition, several studies had not detected histone deacetylase activity for the other nuclear SIRT proteins, SIRT6 and SIRT7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Thus, until recently, the extent to which the functional link of yeast Sir2 to chromatin and genome maintenance is evolutionarily conserved in mammals has been unclear. </p><p>The generation of mice deficient for the mammalian SIRT6 gene revealed a potential role for SIRT6 in linking regulation of life span, chromatin, and genomic stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. In this context, SIRT6 deficiency in mice leads to dramatically shortened life span and acute degenerative phenotypes that overlap with pathologies of premature aging. Moreover, SIRT6 knockout mouse cells have genomic instability and DNA damage hypersensitivity. In biochemical fractionation assays, SIRT6 protein associates preferentially with a chromatin-enriched cellular fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Together, these observations suggested that SIRT6 might couple chromatin regulation with DNA repair. However, a physiologic role for SIRT6 in such a process has not yet been demonstrated. </p><p>We recently discovered a molecular function for SIRT6 at chromatin. We showed that SIRT6 deacetylates a specific histone residue, lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9), in the context of chromatin at telomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. SIRT6 thereby stabilizes the association with telomeres of the protein WRN, a DNA metabolic factor that is mutated in the human progeria Werner Syndrome. In this context, depletion of SIRT6 in human cells leads to telomere dysfunction and genomic instability with end-to-end chromosomal fusions. We also identified a second physiologic context for SIRT6 function as a histone H3K9 deacetylase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Specifically, SIRT6 is recruited to the promoters of genes that have been activated by the NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factor, deacetylates H3K9 at these promoters to attenuate gene expression, and thereby limits NF-&#x003ba;B signaling. Notably, hyperactive NF-&#x003ba;B signaling contributes significantly to the degenerative phenotypes and early death of SIRT6-deficient mice, because in an NF-&#x003ba;B-haploinsufficient genetic background, SIRT6-deficient mice have milder phenotypes and live much longer than mice with SIRT6-deficiency alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Thus, chromatin regulation by SIRT6 is important for proper telomere function and regulation of gene expression programs, and both these mechanisms of action may impact on genomic stability and aging. </p><p>Here, we report findings that further expand the known functions of SIRT6 and show that SIRT6 is required for efficient DNA DSB repair in the context of chromatin. Biochemical analyses show that SIRT6 associates dynamically with chromatin in response to DNA damage, and stabilizes the DNA DSB repair factor, DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), at DSBs. We suggest that the modulation of DSB repair by SIRT6 in response to chronic DNA damage over life may contribute to the effects of SIRT6 on physiologic and pathologic processes in mammalian aging. </p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>SIRT6 interacts with the DNA DSB repair factor DNA-PK </title><p>To identify new molecular pathways of SIRT6 function, we employed a biochemical approach to identify SIRT6-interacting factors. HeLa cell nuclear extracts were size-fractionated by gel filtration, and the presence of SIRT6 in individual fractions assessed by Western analysis. Rather than fractionating at the expected size of a SIRT6 molecule (~40 KD), SIRT6 was detected in multiple peaks corresponding to large protein complexes ranging up to ~700 KD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). These data suggested that SIRT6 is a component of multiple large macromolecular complexes. To purify such complexes and identify their components, we expressed epitope (Flag)-tagged SIRT6 protein in 293T cells, and carried out affinity-purification of Flag-SIRT6 complexes. Coomassie stain of the Flag-immunoprecipititates (IPs) revealed several protein bands specific to the IP from the Flag-SIRT6-expressing cells compared to negative control cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). SIRT6-specific bands were excised, and subjected to mass spectrometry. This analysis identified DNA-PKcs, Ku80, and Ku70, which together comprise the DNA-PK holoenzyme, a central regulator of DNA DSB repair in mammalian cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. </p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SIRT6 interacts with the DNA-PK DSB repair factor.</title><p> (<bold>A</bold>) Endogenous SIRT6 protein associates with large molecular weight complexes.

Notably, the interaction of SIRT6 with DNA-PKcs was resistant to ethidium bromide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>), which disrupts DNA- dependent interactions. In contrast, the association of Ku70 and Ku80 with SIRT6 was DNA-dependent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>), similar to their interaction with DNA-PKcs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. These data suggest that SIRT6 interacts with the DNA-PK holoenzyme complex via the DNA-PKcs catalytic subunit. Thus, we focused our analysis on the SIRT6-DNA-PKcs interaction. Using SIRT6-specific antibodies, we immunoprecipitated endogenous SIRT6 protein from 293T cells, and DNA-PKcs was specifically detected in these IPs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e</xref>). Thus, our data indicate that SIRT6 and DNA-PKcs interact physically under physiologic conditions in cells. </p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>Mobilization of SIRT6 to chromatin in response to DNA damage </title><p>In addition to the DNA-PK proteins, the purified SIRT6 complex also contained four low molecular weight bands with migration patterns characteristic of the core nucleosomal histones (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Western analysis of several different Flag-SIRT IPs confirmed that histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 are specifically associated with Flag-SIRT6 (data not shown). The observation that levels of the four core histones are similar in the SIRT6 IP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>) suggested that the SIRT6-histone interactions could occur in the structural context of intact nucleosome particles. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed binding of purified, recombinant SIRT6 protein to purified mononucleosomes using an in vitro nucleosome binding assay. SIRT6 protein bound efficiently to mononucleosomes, as manifested by a significant shift of the nucleosomes when fractionated on a non-denaturing gel; for comparison, SIRT1 did not show significant nucleosome binding in this assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Together, these data provide evidence for a direct SIRT6 interaction with nucleosomes, the basic unit of chromatin. </p><p>The observation that SIRT6 interacts with a core DSB repair factor and with nucleosomes suggested that SIRT6 might modulate DNA DSB repair in the context of chromatin. To investigate this possibility, we first asked whether the association of SIRT6 with chromatin might be dynamic and modulated by DNA damage. Previously, biochemical fractionation experiments showed that a majority of SIRT6 protein in cells is detected in an insoluble nuclear fraction enriched for chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. To make it possible to detect potential changes in the strength of the SIRT6 interaction with chromatin, we used a more stringent chromatin fractionation protocol, under which, in the absence of DNA damage, only a minor portion of SIRT6 is associated with the purified chromatin fraction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>, c) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Upon exposure of cells to DNA damage, using the radiomimetic DNA DSB agent neocarzinostatin (NCS), this assay revealed a dramatic shift of SIRT6 protein into the chromatin-bound fraction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). We conclude that DNA damage triggers increased association of SIRT6 with chromatin under physiologic conditions in cells. </p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>DNA damage stabilizes SIRT6 interaction with chromatin.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Gel shift showing SIRT6, but not SIRT1, binding to purified native nucleosomes in vitro.

Therefore, we stably knocked down SIRT6 expression in cells by retroviral transduction of SIRT6-specific short-hairpin RNAs (shRNA) or negative control vector (pSR). Two independent SIRT6 shRNAs (S6KD1 and S6KD2) resulted in significant knock-down (KD) of SIRT6 expression in multiple cell lines, as previously described (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. We then confirmed that SIRT6 KD cells are hypersensitive to DNA damage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>), demonstrating that the knockdown efficiency is sufficient to elicit known effects of SIRT6 inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Next, Western analysis was performed to compare levels of global H3K9 acetylation in SIRT6 KD or control pSR cells, under base-line conditions, or upon exposure to DNA DSB agents. No difference in global H3K9Ac levels was observed in the absence of DNA damage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>), consistent with our previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. However, when cells were treated with NCS or another DSB agent, bleomycin, H3K9Ac was substantially higher in SIRT6 KD cells compared to pSR cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). Interestingly, this effect corresponded to a DNA damage-dependent decrease in H3K9Ac in pSR cells, rather than a damage-dependent increase in H3K9Ac in the S6KD cells. We also examined effects on H3K9Ac of over-expressing SIRT6 in the context of DNA damage. SIRT6 over-expression led to a greater reduction in H3K9Ac levels than NCS treatment, and addition of NCS did not further decrease global H3K9Ac levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>). Together, our observations suggest that H3K9 is acutely deacetylated following treatment of cells with DNA damage, and SIRT6 is required for this process. </p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>SIRT6 is required for global deacetylation of H3K9 in response to DNA damage.</title><p><bold>(a)</bold> Western analysis of SIRT6 expression levels in the indicated cell lines stably expressing two different SIRT6 shRNAs (S6KD1 and S6KD2) or empty vector control (pSR). <bold>(b)</bold> SIRT6 knock-down leads to hypersensitivity to &#x003b3;-irradiation (IR).

To test whether SIRT6 might function in this context, the levels of chromatin-associated DNA-PKcs following exposure of SIRT6 KD and control cells to NCS were compared. Consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], in the SIRT6-proficient pSR cells, DNA DSB generation was accompanied by an increase in the levels of DNA-PKcs at chromatin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>, compare lane 6 to lane 3). In contrast, no change in DNA-PKcs levels at chromatin was observed in SIRT6 KD cells in response to DNA damage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>, lanes 9 and 12). Similar results were observed in SIRT6 KD cells generated with the other SIRT6 shRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>); thus, the changes in DNA-PKcs mobilization cannot be attributed to off-target shRNA effects. Moreover, reconstitution of SIRT6 KD cells with wild-type SIRT6 protein (S6WT) restored DNA damage-dependent mobilization of DNA-PKcs to chromatin, whereas reconstitution with a catalytically inactive SIRT6 (S6HY) mutant protein did not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>, d). We conclude that functional SIRT6 protein is required for efficient stabilization of DNA-PKcs at chromatin in response to DNA damage. </p></sec><sec id="s2_5"><title>Dynamic association of SIRT6 and DNA-PKcs with chromatin flanking DNA DSBs </title><p>To study the dynamic movements of both SIRT6 and DNA-PK in the context of chromosomal DNA DSBs, we set up a recently described system to monitor molecular events that occur at chromatin adjacent to defined, endogenous DNA DSB target sites in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. This system makes use of the eukaryotic homing endonuclease I-PpoI, which has ~300 target sites in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. To generate DSBs at these sites, we transduced human cell lines with a retroviral cassette containing an inducible system to express I-PpoI enzyme. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was then performed with SIRT6-specific antibodies, and the presence of chromatin near (182 bp) a specific DSB was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. This analysis revealed that I-PpoI expression leads to a ~4-fold increase in mobilization of SIRT6 protein to chromatin adjacent to the DSB site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). This increase in signal was abrogated in SIRT6 KD cells, confirming the specificity of the assay. </p><p>Next, we asked whether SIRT6 influences the recruitment of DNA-PKcs to the chromosomal DSBs. Similar to SIRT6, DNA-PKcs was significantly increased (&#x0003e;5-fold) at sequences adjacent to the DSB following I-PpoI expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). Notably, depletion of SIRT6 in the SIRT6 KD cells dramatically reduced the mobilization of DNA-PKcs to the DSBs. These results were confirmed with an independent site-specific break system, using the I-SceI endonuclease (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. I-SceI has no endogenous target sites in human cells; therefore, we generated cells harboring stably integrated I-SceI target sites by retroviral transduction, and then expressed the I-SceI enzyme. DNA DSB induction by I-SceI led to a ~5-fold increase in DNA-PKcs levels at sequences close to (~60-200 bp) the I-SceI target sequence, but not farther away (~1600-1670 bp) from the DSB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>). Again, this recruitment of DNA-PKcs was not observed in SIRT6 KD cells. </p><p>To determine whether increasing SIRT6 levels can further drive DNA-PKcs to DSBs, we also carried out the site-specific DSB analysis following retroviral over-expression of wild-type or catalytically inactive SIRT6 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref>). Over-expression of wild-type SIRT6 further increased DNA-PKcs at the DSB by ~3 fold. In contrast, the mutant SIRT6-HY protein reduced the DNA-PKcs signal, suggesting a possible dominant-negative effect. Together, our results demonstrate that SIRT6 is necessary and sufficient to promote efficient recruitment of DNA-PKcs to chromatin flanking site-specific DSBs. </p></sec><sec id="s2_6"><title>SIRT6 is required for efficient DNA DSB repair </title><p>The above observations suggested that SIRT6 might influence the efficiency of DNA DSB repair. To test this possibility, we used comet assays to compare levels of DNA damage in single-cells, at base-line conditions or upon exposure to DSB agents (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). In this assay, cells were embedded in agarose plugs, and subjected to electrophoresis. Intact genomic DNA shows very poor mobility under these conditions; DNA DSBs increase the migration of the DNA, generating "comets" of DNA detected by SYBR Green staining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>). The relative size of the comet "tail moment" was used to assess levels of DSBs in individual cells, and these values were plotted on a histogram for &#x0003e;100 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). In the absence of NCS, the distribution of tail moments for SIRT6 KD and control cells were similar (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>, top). In both cell types, NCS treatment led to a shift in tail moment distribution, with more cells showing larger amounts of DNA damage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>, bottom). However, this NCS-dependent increase in tail moment distribution was significantly greater for SIRT6 KD cells compared to control pSR cells. This difference is reflected in an increased population Mean Tail Moment in NCS-treated SIRT6 KD cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>). Together, these data provide evidence that SIRT6 KD leads to impaired resolution of DNA DSBs and increased accumulation of broken DNA. </p><p>To validate that the impaired chromatin mobilization of DNA-PKcs and increased DNA breaks observed in SIRT6 KD cells is specific to depletion of SIRT6, and to determine the role of SIRT6 enzymatic activity in this process, we used the S6KD cells reconstituted with the wild-type or catalytically inactive SIRT6 proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>). Complementation with wild-type SIRT6 protein in SIRT6 KD cells reduced the levels of NCS-dependent DSBs to levels observed in control cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d</xref>). In contrast, the mutant SIRT6 protein was impaired in its ability to reverse the DNA DSB accumulation observed in SIRT6 KD cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d</xref>). </p><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>SIRT6 stabilizes DNA-PKcs at chromatin in response to DNA damage.</title><p><bold>(a)</bold> SIRT6 is required for efficient mobilization of DNA-PKcs to chromatin in response to the DNA DSB agent NCS.

Following DSB induction by expression of each endonuclease, PCR amplification of DNA was carried out using primers flanking the break sites. Comparison of the levels of PCR products was then used to quantify the relative efficiency with which the DSBs are resolved in SIRT6 KD or control cells. In these assays, SIRT6 KD led to a ~4-fold decrease in the fraction of intact DNA present when assayed following I-SceI expression, and an even greater decrease using the I-PpoI system (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6e</xref>). In contrast, SIRT6 depletion from nuclear extracts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a</xref>) had no effect on DSB repair in an in vitro cell-free assay, in which the DNA is free and not bound within chromatin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7b</xref>). Thus, SIRT6 is important for the resolution of DNA DSBs, but only in the physiologic context of chromatin. Together, these observations support a model in which SIRT6 impacts on DNA repair by modulating the association of DNA-PKcs at chromatin. </p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous work suggested that SIRT6 contributes in some way to DNA repair, because SIRT6-deficient mouse cells are hypersensitive to DNA damage and show increased genomic instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]; however, until now, direct evidence for SIRT6 function in DNA repair pathways has not been described. In this study, we have now linked SIRT6 to DNA DSB repair, and show that SIRT6 modulates the levels of the DNA-PKcs DSB repair factor at chromatin surrounding DNA breaks. It is possible that SIRT6 may also influence the chromatin association of other DNA repair factors. For example, the spectrum of DNA damage agents to which SIRT6-deficient mouse cells are sensitive suggested a role for SIRT6 in Base Excision Repair (BER). Thus, it will be interesting to investigate whether association of BER factors with chromatin at damaged DNA is regulated by SIRT6. </p><p>Our findings in this study are somewhat unexpected, because previous results in SIRT6-deficient mice did not detect overt defects in Non-homologous End-joining (NHEJ), the specific DNA DSB repair pathway in which DNA-PK functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. For example, SIRT6-deficient mice have normal lymphocyte development and V(D)J recombination, a process of programmed DNA recombination of immunoglobulin genes that depends on NHEJ activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. We suggest that in the context of V(D)J recombination, the requirement for SIRT6 may be overridden by the action of lymphocyte-specific recombination factors, such as the RAG proteins, which are present at the sites of DSBs at V(D)J recombination substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Repair of chromosomal DNA DSBs also appeared grossly normal in SIRT6-deficient mouse cells; it is possible that the assays for DNA DSBs used in our new study (comet assays for DNA damage in single cells and site-specific DSB repair assays) provide better sensitivity than the previously used assay (pulsed field gel electrophoresis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. It is also possible that differences between the mouse study and our new findings in human cells may be due to compensatory mechanisms in the mouse knockouts. Regardless, our study highlights the usefulness of complementing genetic studies in mice with biochemical analyses of human cell lines. </p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Dynamic association of SIRT6 and DNA-PKcs with chromatin flanking site-specific DNA DSBs.</title><p><bold>(a)</bold> SIRT6 occupancy at chromatin flanking DSBs induced by I-PpoI.

For example, SIRT6 could be targeted to DSBs first and then recruit DNA-PKcs; DNA-PKcs could bind DSBs first and then recruit SIRT6; or the two proteins might associate with chromatin at DSBs cooperatively as a result of their protein-protein interaction. The fact that SIRT6 is recruited to site-specific DSBs suggests a model in which it deacetylates H3K9 at chromatin surrounding the DSBs. However, we were unable to detect reproducible effects of SIRT6 on H3K9Ac at DSBs using the site-specific DSB systems. One possibility is that there is a tightly regulated acetylation/deacetylation cycle of H3K9 that occurs acutely in response to DNA damage, and effects of SIRT6 on this process could be beyond the resolution of our current assays. SIRT6 might also impact on DNA damage-dependent H3K9Ac levels indirectly, for example, by altering the kinetics of cell-cycle dependent </p><fig id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>SIRT6 is not required for DNA double-strand break rejoining in a cell-free system.</title><p><bold>(a)</bold> Western analysis showing immunodepletion of SIRT6 from HeLa cell nuclear extracts (NE) with anti-SIRT6 antibodies.

Future studies of SIRT6 biology in these contexts should allow us to distinguish among these models. </p><sec id="s3_1"><title>Perspective </title><p>In eukaryotic cells, genomic DNA is packaged in the higher order structure of chromatin, and regulation of chromatin plays a fundamental role in diverse epigenetic programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Such programs, in turn, can impact on aging-related molecular processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. In this context, mammalian SIRT proteins that regulate histone deacetylation at chromatin can contribute to aging and life span regulation. We recently showed that SIRT6 regulates both telomere function and aging-associated gene expression programs via site-specific deacetylation of H3K9 at chromatin, and loss of these activities in SIRT6-deficient cells contributes to premature senescence of human cells or a degenerative phenotype reminiscent of premature aging in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Increasing evidence suggests that chromatin dynamics also play critical roles in the surveillance, detection, and repair of DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. The human genome is continually exposed to environmental and metabolic sources of DNA damage, the accumulation of which is proposed to contribute to genomic instability, aging, and age-related pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Thus, chromatin regulatory factors that function in this context may be important aging modulators. Recent work by Oberdoerffer et al showed that SIRT1 promotes repair of DSBs, and proposed that SIRT1 provides an example of how DNA damage-dependent redistribution of a chromatin modifying factor (the "RCM" response) may contribute to epigenetic changes that influence aging phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Our findings regarding SIRT6 provide a second example of a mammalian SIRT functioning in DNA repair, and highlight the critical role of mammalian SIRT factors in linking chromatin regulation, DNA repair, and aging. </p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p><underline>Antibodies and constructs. </underline> SIRT6 antibodies were previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].
