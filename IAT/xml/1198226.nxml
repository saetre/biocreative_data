In birds and mammals, the otic placode invaginates and pinches off to form the pear-shaped otic vesicle, or otocyst. The inner ear's sensory epithelia originate from the ventromedial region of the otocyst, an area that can be defined by the expression of several markers, such as BEN (bursal epithelium and neurons)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], lunatic fringe and cSerrate-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], islet-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and bone morphogentic proteins (BMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The distinctive temporal and spatial expression patterns of BMP4 in almost all developing chicken inner ear sensory epithelia has led to the suggestion that this protein may play an important role in the induction of inner ear sensory organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Because homozygous BMP4 knockout mice die between E6.5 and E9.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], a period before the inner ear has formed, it is difficult to analyze the role of BMP4 in the genesis of inner ear sensory organs. As a consequence, other model systems, such as the chicken embryo, have been used to study possible roles of BMP4 in the inner ear. For example, noggin, an antagonist of BMPs, has been employed to interfere with BMP signaling during chicken inner ear development resulting in defects in semicircular canal formation and otic capsule malformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Although malformed or missing cristae were observed in these experiments, the hair cells developed normally. Thus these results did not clarify why BMP4 is robustly expressed in sensory epithelia primordia thereby neither confirming nor refuting the hypothesis that BMP signaling is involved in the genesis of inner ear sensory organs. A possible explanation for the previously observed lack of sensory epithelia defects after <italic>in ovo </italic>application of BMP4 antagonists is that the antagonists did not penetrate far enough to reach sufficiently high concentrations in the developing sensory epithelia to block BMP signaling effectively. To address this issue, we exploited a serum-free floating otocyst culture system, which allowed us to quantitatively analyze progenitor cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell differentiation in the developing otocyst with loss of function and gain of function experiments. Our experiments revealed that BMP4 signaling is involved in generation of sensory epithelia by negatively regulating inner ear progenitor cell proliferation through downregulation of the homeodomain transcription factor Pax-2. Subsequently, BMP4 signaling promotes hair cell differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Exogenous BMP4 leads to increase in hair cell numbers and blockade of BMP signaling inhibits hair cell generation</title><p>Maintenance of the developing avian inner ear <italic>in vitro </italic>in an environment with largely reduced extrinsic influences can be facilitated by removal of periotic mesenchyme, which otherwise could serve as source for various signaling molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. As much as possible, we assured removal of the mesenchymal tissue surrounding the otocyst by mild enzymatic treatment with trypsin and careful dissection.

Blocking of BMP signaling with either noggin or soluble BMP receptor 1a or 1b proteins dramatically reduced hair cell numbers after seven days in culture (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C, E</xref>). The effect of noggin on hair cell generation was dosage-dependant and could be rescued by adding exogenous BMP4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D, E</xref>).

We found that proliferation was significantly reduced in otocysts treated with BMP4 whereas apoptosis was increased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B</xref>). BMP4-induced apoptosis almost exclusively occurred in areas that we identified as neuronal using the strong islet-1 immunostaining of cochleovestibular neuron nuclei (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C&#x02013;D</xref>). Islet-1 is expressed in the developing inner ear in neurons as well as in the nascent sensory epithelia; neuronal islet-1 staining can easily be distinguished from islet-1-positive developing sensory epithelia by a more round shape of stained neuronal nuclei and higher intensity when compared to epithelial staining (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]). The paired-box transcription factor Pax-2 is expressed in developing sensory epithelia and is down-regulated in cochleovestibular ganglion cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and accordingly, neuronal domains in cultured otocysts lack Pax-2-expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C&#x02013;D</xref>).

However, because homozygous BMP4 knockout mice do not live beyond the ninth day of embryonic development it is not feasible to analyze BMP4 function during murine otogenesis.</p><p>To circumvent this problem, we used a serum-free floating culture technique, which allowed us to quantitatively test the function of BMP4 on avian inner ear sensory epithelium formation in a controlled environment. This culture regimen enabled us to quantitatively analyze the generation of inner ear cell types by using cell-specific markers. We found that the number of hair cells that formed in otocysts cultured for 7 days is considerably lower than the number of hair cells that can be found in a chicken ear at the 10<sup>th </sup>day of embryonic development (E10; equivalent to E3 plus 7 days <italic>in vitro</italic>). Nevertheless, we argue that the chicken inner ear at E10 is also substantially larger than the 7-day cultured otocyst, which makes it difficult to assess whether a ratio of ~1.6% hair cells of the total cell number in a floating otocyst is comparable to the ratio of hair cells <italic>versus </italic>total inner ear cell number at E10. Nevertheless, we suggest that that the effects we observed <italic>in vitro </italic>are at least partially representative of the hair cell populations found in the various hair cell-bearing organs of the developing chicken ear. To the best of our ability, we removed periotic mesenchyme from the E3 otocysts. Specimens with obvious mesenchymal contribution were not scored in this study. Nevertheless, we did not observe a noticeable difference in the number of hair cells and neurons detectable in otocysts with clear mesenchymal contribution, which is an indication that the periotic mesenchyme appears to exert little influence on the otocyst after stage 16 (E3).</p><p>Loss of BMP signaling by application of noggin or a combination of dominant-negative BMP receptors markedly reduced the number of hair cells in the developing otocyst, which strongly supports the hypothesis that BMP signaling is required for hair cell generation. Nevertheless, even at the highest concentrations of noggin or dominant-negative BMP receptors, no complete blockade of hair cell generation was achieved. We suspect that the nature of BMP signaling in the developing sensory epithelia does not allow complete blockade with application of soluble inhibitors. BMP4 is a secreted protein that binds to cell surface receptors to activate the Smad signaling pathway (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]). Secreted BMP4 acts on neighboring cells in a paracrine manner as well as in autocrine fashion on the cells that produce the factor if these cells have appropriate BMP receptors. We hypothesize that extracellular BMP inhibitors cannot completely interfere with autocrine signaling, resulting in an incomplete blockade of BMP signaling in otocyst cells that express both BMP4 and BMP receptors.</p><p>Interference with BMP signaling in the inner ear <italic>in vivo </italic>by application of noggin or noggin-producing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] led to inhibition or malformation of semicircular canals accompanied by occasional deformation of ampullae. No effects on sensory epithelium formation and hair cells were reported; however, these studies did not explicitly quantify the number of hair cells. Alternatively, we hypothesize that dorso-lateral transplantation of beads soaked with noggin or of noggin-producing cells into the periotic mesenchyme apparently did not suffice to reach sufficient concentrations of the inhibitor over the course of several days in the ventro-medial region of the otocyst, where the sensory epithelia originate. Using a serum-free floating culture environment allowed us to control the concentration of BMP4 or BMP signaling inhibitors more precisely than previous <italic>in ovo </italic>experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>BMP4 promotes hair cell differentiation</title><p>Three mechanisms could account for increase of the number of hair cells by exogenous BMP4: 1) promotion of sensory epithelial progenitor cell proliferation, 2) prevention of progenitor cell apoptosis, or 3) promotion of progenitor cell differentiation to hair cells. Our results suggest that BMP4 inhibits otocyst cell proliferation, but affects apoptosis only in the neuronal domain of cultured otocycts, implying that a plausible mechanism of BMP4's effect on increasing the number of hair cells is to promote sensory epithelium progenitor cells to differentiate.</p><p>Another line of evidence for BMP4's effect on sensory epithelium progenitor cells arises from our loss-of-function analysis with noggin. Here we found that noggin-treatment did not affect the number of Pax-2-positive cells, whereas the number of hair cells was considerably reduced. This result implies that Pax-2-positive progenitors fail to differentiate into sensory epithelium when BMP signaling is blocked.</p><p>Our observations that BMP4-treatment leads to increased hair cell generation and to reduction of otocysts cell proliferation, suggests a dual, concentration-dependant, action of BMP4: at concentrations of 3&#x02013;5 ng/ml BMP4 augments cell differentiation. In fact, we did not find a significant inhibition of cell proliferation with BMP4 concentrations below 10 ng/ml (data not shown). At higher BMP4 concentrations (10&#x02013;20 ng/ml), cell proliferation is sufficiently reduced to offset the BMP4 effect on hair cell differentiation. The result of the concentration-dependant dual effects of BMP4 is manifested in a bell-shaped dose-dependency of hair cell numbers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>).</p><p>The effects of BMP4 on otocyst cell proliferation and apoptosis that we report here differ from, but do not contradict, results obtained by <italic>in vivo </italic>administration of noggin to the developing chicken inner ear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In these experiments, cell proliferation decreased and apoptosis increased after noggin-secreting beads or cells were transplanted into the mesenchyme adjacent to the otocysts. We argue that these previous analyses and our experimental protocol are not easily comparable as many factors could account for the observed differences. For example, interactions of noggin with potential signals in the periotic mesenchyme might produce different effects on inner ear tissue when compared with mesenchyme-free otocyst cultures. Another possible explanation is that our analysis included all otocyst-derived cells, whereas previous studies focused on the parts of the developing inner ear surrounding the noggin-secreting grafts.</p><p>The effect of BMP4 on promoting differentiation of sensory epithelium progenitor cells is consistent with its temporal and spatial expression in the inner ear sensory organ development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. BMP4 mRNA is expressed in all sensory organ primordia before the hair cells and supporting cells are developed. At this crucial period of sensory organ formation, the progenitor cells downregulate Pax-2, leave the cell cycle, and initiate differentiation into hair cells and supporting cells; Pax-2 expression subsequently persists in hair cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These events appear to be correlated with the presence of BMP4 in sensory patches, supporting a possible role for BMP4 in controlling proliferation and specifying differentiation in the inner ear's sensory epithelia.</p><p>Additional clues about the potential targets of BMP4 in the developing inner ear could arise from analysis of expression of BMP receptors and components of the BMP signaling pathways. Beside a comprehensive study in the developing zebrafish ear and lateral line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], only one study has addressed in the developing chicken inner ear expression of BMP receptors and Smad proteins, the intracellular transducers of BMP signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Although the latter study was focused on the role of BMP signaling during development of semicircular canals, it should be noted that the expression of BMP receptors in the developing chicken inner ear is probably not restricted to sensory patches or the Pax-2-positive domain. A more widespread expression of BMP receptors could potentially be the reason for the substantial downregulation of Pax-2 protein that we observed in free-floating otocycts in response to BMP4 treatment. At least in the developing zebrafish inner ear several BMP receptors are expressed widely, some of them ubiquitously, at all developmental stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>BMP4 is a crucial control factor of proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in the developing inner ear</title><p>At early stages of inner ear development, all cells of the otic placode and the otic pit express the transcriptional regulator Pax-2. Subsequently and noticeably evident at embryonic day three, Pax-2-expression gets more localized to the medio-ventral part of the otic vesicle, the region where the sensory epithelia originate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. At this time of development, cell proliferation mostly occurs in the Pax-2 expression domain and apoptosis happens outside of the Pax-2 positive domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We show that the numbers of Pax-2-positive cells as well as proliferating cells are markedly reduced when exogenous BMP4 is added to cultured otocysts. Coinciding with decreasing numbers of Pax-2-positive cells, we also detected substantial downregulation of the expression of Pax-2 protein. In the developing sensory patches, we were able to visualize that BMP4 mRNA is detectable in the incipient sensory patches just at the time when islet-1 expression becomes evident. The onset of islet-1 expression in sensory patches coincides with early differentiation of sensory epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In parallel, Pax-2 protein is markedly downregulated in these patches, implying that BMP4 also causes downregulation of Pax-2, cessation of proliferation, and upregulation of markers for early differentiating sensory epithelium <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our results indicate that BMP signaling is involved in the generation of inner ear sensory patches and hair cells. We also found evidence that BMP4 can affect cell proliferation and apoptosis in different cell populations of the developing inner ear. We therefore conclude that correct control of BMP signaling in all areas of the developing otocyst is central to obtaining an accurate balance of cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell differentiation needed for correct morphogenesis of the inner ear's sensory organs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chicken embryos</title><p>Fertilized chicken eggs of the white leghorn strain (Charles River SPAFAS) were stored at 14&#x000b0;C until embryonic development was initiated by placing them onto rocking platforms into a humidified incubator maintained at 38&#x000b0;C.

The otocysts were rapidly transferred into 10 mL of serum-free culture medium in Petri dishes (non-tissue culture treated). Culture medium was mixed from equal parts of high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F12 medium supplemented with N2 and B27 (Media and supplements were from Invitrogen/GIBCO/BRL, Carlsbad, CA). BMP4, noggin, and soluble BMPR1a and BMPR1b were obtained from R&#x00026;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). BMP signaling antagonists were continuously supplemented throughout the culture period.

The floating otocysts were maintained in a humidified incubator in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere at 37&#x000b0;C. For quantitative analysis, cultured otocysts were harvested on the seventh day in culture, fixed overnight with paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS), cryoprotected for 48 h in sucrose (30% in PBS), embedded in TissueTek (EMS) and serially sectioned (16 &#x003bc;m thick) with a cryostat (CM3050, Leica).</p></sec><sec><title>5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling</title><p>BrdU (Sigma) was added (3 &#x003bc;g/ml) at specific time points for an exposure period of 8 h, after which the otocycts were harvested and processed for cryosectioning.
