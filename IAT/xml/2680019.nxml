Recent independent studies have shown interaction of DLC1 with members of the tensin focal adhesion protein family in a Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain-dependent mechanism. DLC1 and tensins interact and co-localize to punctate structures at focal adhesions. However, the mechanisms underlying the interaction between DLC1 and various tensins remain controversial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We used a co-immunoprecipitation assay to identify a previously undocumented binding site at 375&#x02013;385 of DLC1 that predominantly interacted with the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of tensin2. DLC1-tensin2 interaction is completely abolished in a DLC1 mutant lacking this novel PTB binding site (DLC1&#x00394;PTB). However, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation, neither the focal adhesion localization nor the interaction with tensin1 and C-terminal tensin-like (cten) were affected. Interestingly, the functional significance of this novel site was exhibited by the partial reduction of the RhoGAP activity, which, in turn, attenuated the growth-suppressive activity of DLC1 upon its removal from DLC1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>This study has provided new evidence that DLC1 also interacts with tensin2 in a PTB domain-dependent manner. In addition to properly localizing focal adhesions and preserving RhoGAP activity, DLC1 interaction with tensin2 through this novel focal adhesion binding site contributes to the growth-suppressive activity of DLC1.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The small, monomeric G-protein Rho has been classically defined as a key biological regulator of the actin cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005572-Ridley1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005572-Nobes2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Accumulating evidence suggests that DLC1 interacts with multiple tensins. In general, DLC1 utilizes an SH2 binding motif involving the residue Y442 to interact with the SH2 domain of tensin1 and C-terminal tensin-like (cten). Mutation at Y442 caused DLC1 to lose its focal adhesion localization and tumor suppressive activity. This observation implies that tensin binding is a key regulatory event in the subcellular localization and the tumor suppressive function of DLC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005572-Liao1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005572-Qian1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

This new site was well conserved in DLC families. We also provide the first evidence for tensin2 interaction as a common characteristic of DLC1 and DLC2. Apart from the binding mechanism, we also demonstrated the functional significance of this novel binding site in regulating the tumor suppressive activity of DLC1.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The tensin2 PTB domain was required for DLC1 interaction</title><p>We demonstrated that the C-terminus tensin2 fragment, including the SH2 and PTB domains (SH2-PTB in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005572-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), was sufficient to bind DLC1 <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005572-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. To evaluate the importance of individual domains in DLC1 interaction, we prepared several tensin2 deletion mutants including tensin2 &#x00394;SH2&#x00394;PTB, &#x00394;SH2, and &#x00394;PTB and tested their binding affinity towards DLC1 <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005572-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. Tensin2 &#x00394;SH2&#x00394;PTB consistently showed a complete loss of DLC1 binding.

We next checked the conservation of these residues in binding to the tensin2 SH2 domain. Interestingly, we found that DLC1 Y442F and S440A mutants showed only a partial reduction in tensin2 binding. To test whether Y442 and S440 mediate the interaction with the tensin2 SH2 domain, we checked the binding affinity between DLC1 and tensin2 R1165A, an SH2 domain mutant with impaired recognition and binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated targets. We found that mutation at R1165A in tensin2 resulted in a drop in tensin2-DLC1 binding. Similar binding affinity toward R1165A was observed among DLC1 wild-type, Y442F and S440A.

First, although the SH2 and PTB domains in tensin proteins have a high sequence homology, differences in their sequences may result in different binding mechanisms for DLC1 and other tensin family members. Second, different binding assays were used by different groups to study the mechanism of binding between tensin and DLC1. For instance, yeast-based binding and GST pull-down assays were used by Liao et al. and Qian et al., respectively, while <italic>in vivo</italic> co-immunoprecipitation was employed in our present study. Third, C-terminus fragments of tensin that contained either one or both of the SH2 and PTB domains were used in mapping the DLC1 binding site in the studies by Liao et al. and Qian et al. This experimental design presumed that the N-terminus region of the tensin protein neither was involved in binding nor contributed to the normal protein folding of the C-terminus region.</p><p>In the present study, we provide the first evidence that specific removal of the SH2 and PTB domains in tensin2 affects DLC1 binding to different extents <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005572-g001"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>.

However, this motif was not found in our mapped region in DLC1, implying that the mode of PTB-mediated interaction is a probably atypical.

In addition, we found that the PTB domain was necessary for the focal adhesion localization of tensin2 (data not shown). Thus, in addition to acting as the physical binding site for DLC1, the PTB domain may also be important for bringing tensin2 in close proximity to DLC1 at focal adhesions and facilitating their interaction. Collectively, these results suggest that DLC1 utilizes region 375&#x02013;385 in mediating tensin2 binding, while it utilizes Y442 and S440 residues for focal adhesion targeting <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005572-g006"><bold>Fig. 6</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>.</p><fig id="pone-0005572-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005572.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Proposed model of the focal adhesion targeting and tensin2 interaction of DLC1.</title><p>DLC1 was targeted to the focal adhesions and required residues Y442 and S440.

Possible compensation by other tensins may explain why DLC1&#x00394;PTB can be localized to focal adhesions in the absence of tensin2 interactions. In addition, we found that DLC1&#x00394;PTB showed a partial reduction in RhoGAP activity, which resulted in a partial reduction in growth suppression <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005572-g005"><bold>Figs. 5B and 5C</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>.</p><p>A limitation in our present study is the use of ectopically expressed tensin2. Detection of endogenous tensin2 was not possible, as the tensin2 antibody was not available in our laboratory. Interaction between endogenous DLC1 and tensin2 must be examined to reflect their binding in the actual biological context. On the other hand, we performed preliminary quantitative real time PCR analysis to determine the mRNA expression levels of DLC1 and tensin2 in human HCC tissues. Our unpublished data showed that underexpression of both DLC1 and tensin2 was correlated with shorter overall survival when compared with those who had normal expression of either or both genes, supporting the possible functional association of DLC1-tensin2 with hepatocarcinogenesis.</p><p>Altogether, we have identified a novel tensin2 PTB binding site in DLC1 and demonstrated its involvement in tensin2 interactions. Although the removal of the PTB binding site did not affect the focal adhesion localization, it partially reduced the RhoGAP activity of DLC1, which attenuated its growth suppressive function. It would be interesting to uncover how DLC1 may control the activity of other focal adhesion molecules.
