Binding of ATP to Kir6.2 leads to inhibition of channel activity. Because there are four subunits and thus four ATP-binding sites, four binding events are possible. ATP binds to both the open and closed states of the channel and produces a decrease in the mean open time, a reduction in the mean burst duration, and an increase in the frequency and duration of the interburst closed states. Here, we investigate the mechanism of interaction of ATP with the open state of the channel by analyzing the single-channel kinetics of concatenated Kir6.2 tetramers containing from zero to four mutated Kir6.2 subunits that possess an impaired ATP-binding site. We show that the ATP-dependent decrease in the mean burst duration is well described by a Monod-Wyman-Changeux model in which channel closing is produced by all four subunits acting in a single concerted step. The data are inconsistent with a Hodgkin-Huxley model (four independent steps) or a dimer model (two independent dimers). When the channel is open, ATP binds to a single ATP-binding site with a dissociation constant of 300 &#x003bc;M.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: BR, burst ratio; D, dimer; HH, Hodgkin-Huxley; MWC, Monod-Wyman-Changeux; WT, wild type.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>ATP-sensitive potassium (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels couple cell metabolism to transmembrane potassium fluxes in many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashcroft, 2005</xref>).

In pancreatic &#x003b2; cells, for example, closure of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in response to glucose metabolism depolarizes the plasma membrane, thereby triggering calcium influx and insulin release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashcroft et al., 1984</xref>). Accordingly, gain-of-function mutations in the genes encoding the &#x003b2;-cell K<sub>ATP</sub> channel cause neonatal diabetes and loss-of-function mutations cause the converse disorder, congenital hyperinsulinism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashcroft, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hattersley and Ashcroft, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The K<sub>ATP</sub> channel is an octameric complex of two types of membrane-protein subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Inagaki et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sakura et al., 1995</xref>). Kir6.2, a member of inwardly rectifying potassium channel family, forms a central tetrameric pore. Each Kir6.2 subunit associates with a regulatory protein, the sulphonylurea receptor (SUR1), in 4:4 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clement et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mikhailov et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Metabolism is believed to regulate K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity primarily via changes in the concentrations of intracellular adenine nucleotides. Channel inhibition is produced by binding of ATP to Kir6.2 in a Mg-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tucker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gribble et al., 1998</xref>). Conversely, occupancy of the nucleotide-binding domains of SUR1 by MgADP stimulates channel activity, a circumstance that can be achieved either by direct binding of MgADP or by binding and subsequent hydrolysis of MgATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nichols et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tucker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gribble et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zingman et al., 2001</xref>). Identification of the molecular mechanism by which the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel is gated by ATP and MgATP/MgADP is therefore crucial for understanding how cell metabolism is linked to channel activity and thereby to the plasma membrane potential. This paper focuses on the mechanism of inhibition by ATP. This can be studied in isolation from nucleotide interactions with SUR1 by using Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-free solutions.</p><p>The K<sub>ATP</sub> channel is spontaneously active in the absence of ATP: we refer to this as intrinsic gating (sometimes it is also referred to as ligand-independent gating). The single-channel kinetics are characterized by bursts of short openings and closings separated by long, nonconducting interburst intervals. Addition of ATP causes a marked reduction in burst duration and pronounced prolongation of the long closed states. ATP therefore interacts with all these states.</p><p>Analysis of ATP inhibition of macroscopic currents does not enable the interaction of ATP with the different states of the channel to be distinguished. It also cannot be reliably used to determine the stoichiometry of ATP inhibition, as many different models can be easily fit to the ATP concentration&#x02013;response relationship. Although single-channel analysis overcomes some of these problems, analysis of the interaction of ATP with the long closed states of the channel remains a difficulty because there are multiple intrinsic long closed states whose distribution varies between individual channels; and because ATP-dependent stabilization of the closed states is otherwise too complex to model adequately at present. In this paper, we therefore focus on the interaction of ATP with the channel open state.</p><p>Several previous single-channel studies have examined the interaction of ATP with the channel open state and have concluded that ATP destabilizes the channel open state and thus promotes channel closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gillis et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nichols et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drain et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Trapp et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan and Makielski, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2002</xref>). They have also shown that there is very little effect of ATP on the short closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alekseev et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Trapp et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2002</xref>), indicating that the reduction in the burst duration is primarily due to the interaction of ATP with the channel open state. Consequently, the burst duration can be used to analyze how ATP interacts with the open state.</p><p>Single-channel analysis in several previous studies made the assumption that channel closure resulted from interaction of one ATP molecule with the open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Trapp et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2002</xref>). However, since each Kir6.2 subunit possesses an inhibitory ATP-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Markworth et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antcliff et al., 2005</xref>) and the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel has four Kir6.2 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clement et al., 1997</xref>), up to four ATP molecules could bind to the open state. The relationship between the number of ATP molecules bound and pore closure is unclear. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al. (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Selivanov et al. (2004)</xref> assumed a kinetic model with four independent binding sites for ATP; despite the assumption of independence, the best fit of ATP dose&#x02013;response curves required that more than one (at least two out of four) binding sites had to be occupied to induce channel closure.</p><p>In this paper, we describe a method for analyzing the single-channel kinetics of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels containing different numbers of wild-type subunits and subunits with a mutated ATP-binding site. We use this method to determine the mechanism by which ATP interacts with the open state and thereby facilitates the closure of the channel pore. We conclude that the data can be described well by the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Molecular Biology</title><p>Concatenated Kir6.2 tetramers were engineered by stepwise addition of monomeric subunits, using the compatibility of BglII and BamHI restriction endonuclease sites. Wild-type Kir6.2 monomers were produced by standard PCR techniques. The Kir6.2&#x00394;C monomer had a C-terminal deletion of 36 amino acids (&#x00394;C36) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tucker et al., 1997</xref>), a BamHI site at the 5&#x02032; end, and a BglII site at the 3&#x02032; end. For the first (N-terminal) Kir6.2 subunit, a Kozak ribosome binding sequence was engineered at the 5&#x02032; end, and for the final (C-terminal) subunit, a stop codon was inserted at the 3&#x02032; end. Glycine residues were also engineered into the subunits to extend the linker region between subunits: two glycines before the 3&#x02032; restriction site in the first subunit; two glycines after the 5&#x02032; restriction site and two glycines before the 3&#x02032; restriction site in the central subunits; two glycines after the 5&#x02032; restriction site in the final subunit. This results in an intersubunit linker of GGRSGG. All tetramers were constructed using the cloning vector pGEMT-Easy, before being subcloned into pBF vector for cRNA production.</p><p>To construct the Kir6.2 tetramer, the first subunit was inserted into pGEMT-Easy using the 5&#x02032;-A overhangs, according to the vector protocol (Promega). For each subsequent subunit addition, the construct was cut with BglII, and the subunit, cut with BamHI and BglII, was ligated in to the BglII-cut construct. If the subunit is inserted in the correct orientation, the 5&#x02032; BamHI site is lost in the ligation process, leaving a 3&#x02032; BglII site, thus allowing addition of the next subunit in the same way. Mutant K185E subunits were produced by standard site-directed mutagenesis and inserted into the tetramer at the desired points by the same technique. A similar approach was taken by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al.

All experiments were done at room temperature (20&#x02013;22&#x000b0;C). The pipette solution contained (in mM) 140 KCl, 1.2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.6 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with KOH). The internal (bath) solution contained (in mM) 107 KCl, 1 K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 with KOH) and K<sub>2</sub>ATP as indicated. Before and after application of ATP, the patch was exposed to ATP-free (control) solution for 1 min.

To assess the accuracy of the mean BR obtained by Magleby and Pallotta's method, BR was also determined by an independent method, described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fang et al. (2006)</xref>. There was no significant difference between the mean BRs obtained by these two methods (see online supplemental material, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200709874/DC1">http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200709874/DC1</ext-link>).</p><p>The mean burst duration in ATP-free solution (&#x003c4;<sub>B</sub>(0)) was taken as an average of that measured before and after application of ATP. In this paper, we calculate the mean burst duration as follows: first we measured the mean burst duration in three to five single-channel patches, and then we calculated the average of these mean burst durations.</p><p>The value of the mean burst duration obtained by averaging all burst events can be distorted by a &#x0201c;missed events&#x0201d; error, which results from missing very short solitary openings (as these also contribute to the burst pdf; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shelley and Colquhoun, 2005</xref>). In this study, however, such errors will be small. Both homomeric and heteromeric K<sub>ATP</sub> channels exhibited quasi-monoexponential distributions of open times over the range of ATP concentrations of up to 5 mM. A similar result for homomeric wild-type K<sub>ATP</sub> channels was previously obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al. (2002)</xref>. The mean open time ranged from 0.4 to 2 ms, which is well above the limit of detectability in our system. Thus the number of very brief openings that go undetected is likely to be very small compared with the total number of bursts. The largest error can be expected for unconnected wild-type channels, for which the reduction in open time by ATP is largest (Fig. S13 C). However, the value of K<sub>O</sub> (or <italic>m</italic>) obtained from fitting the mean burst durations of these channels (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="fd11">Eq. 11</xref>) was similar to that obtained (independently) from fitting the mean open time (which was corrected for missed events with Eq. S3 as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies et al., 1992</xref>) using Eq. S4 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>).

Thus three types of models could describe the gating of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), in which the &#x0201c;gating unit&#x0201d; has one, two, or four ATP-binding sites and each K<sub>ATP</sub> channel tetramer has four (4GU<sub>1</sub>), two (2GU<sub>2</sub>), or one (GU<sub>4</sub>) gating unit, respectively (the subscript in each term refers to the number of ATP-binding sites within the gating unit). In all models, the gating units are considered to alternate between &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; (open) and &#x0201c;inactive&#x0201d; (closed) conformations. We further assume that transition of any one gating unit to its &#x0201c;inactive&#x0201d; conformation (strongly promoted by ATP binding to that unit) closes the pore. This terminates the burst and facilitates entry into the long closed states.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Three types of models for K<sub>ATP</sub> channel gating. Schematic representation of the different types of models. (A) Four independent gating units (4GU<sub>1</sub>), each formed by one Kir6.2 subunit. (B) One gating unit formed by all four Kir6.2 subunits (GU<sub>4</sub>). (C) Two independent gating units, each formed by two Kir6.2 subunits (2GU<sub>2</sub>)<sub>.</sub> In each case, the transitions between open and closed states are shown for a single gating unit. Each Kir6.2 subunit can be either in an &#x0201c;open&#x0201d; (circle) or &#x0201c;closed&#x0201d; (square) conformation. It is assumed that ATP binds independently to all subunits and A indicates the presence of bound ATP. <italic>K<sub>O</sub></italic> and <italic>K<sub>C</sub></italic> are the binding constants to the open and closed states, respectively. <italic>E<sub>O</sub></italic> is the equilibrium gating constant in the absence of ATP. The term <italic>t</italic> indicates the change in the equilibrium gating constant due to bound ATP. It is assumed that ATP binding has an additive effect on the energy of the gating unit in both open and closed conformations.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jgp1320131f02"></graphic></fig><p>First, it is possible that each cytosolic domain of the Kir6.2 tetramer operates independently so that the channel may be considered to have four gating units (4GU<sub>1</sub>). Thus, ATP binding to a single Kir6.2 subunit promotes channel closure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). In the simplest case, each Kir6.2 subunit behaves independently: i.e., ATP binds independently to the cytosolic domain of each Kir6.2 subunit, producing a conformational change that is independent of the ligand-binding state of all other subunits, and leads to closure of the channel pore. The channel will be closed as long as one gating unit is in the &#x0201c;closed&#x0201d; conformation; all four gating units must be in &#x0201c;open&#x0201d; conformation for the channel to be open. This mechanism is similar to that originally described by Hodgkin and Huxley for gating of voltage-dependent channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952</xref>). It has also been proposed previously for K<sub>ATP</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Enkvetchakul et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>However, studies of the intrinsic burst duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Drain et al., 2004</xref>) and intrinsic interburst intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fang et al., 2006</xref>) are inconsistent with this idea. Instead the data suggest that the four cytosolic domains of the channel may not function independently but operate together as a single gating unit (GU<sub>4</sub>). In this case, we will assume that ATP binds to each subunit independently and makes an additive contribution to the free energy of the open or closed states (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). This is known as the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Monod et al., 1965</xref>).</p><p>Finally, molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel may operate as a dimer of dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haider et al., 2005a</xref>). In this case, the channel would have two gating units formed by two opposing (or adjacent) Kir6.2 subunits (2GU<sub>2</sub>). In the simplest case, binding of ATP to all four sites is independent; the effects of binding of two ATP molecules to one gating unit are additive; and the movements of the two gating units are independent. The channel will be closed as long as one gating unit (i.e., one dimer) is in the closed conformation; both dimers must be in the open conformation for the channel to be open. We refer to this as the dimer model.</p><p>For all models, the effects of ATP binding on the free energy of the open state are additive. However, binding of a single ATP will have the greatest effect in the case of the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model, and the least effect in the case of the MWC model.</p><p>To determine which model most closely describes the effect of ATP on the open state of the channel, it is necessary to have an ATP-dependent parameter that can be reliably determined from the experiment, and whose ATP dependence differs between the three models described above. Previous single-channel studies have characterized the ATP dependence of the mean open time and the mean burst duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Trapp et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan and Makielski, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2002</xref>). Of these two parameters, the mean burst duration shows a dramatically greater dependence on ATP than the mean open time (e.g., 0.6 mM ATP reduces the former &#x0223c;32-fold and the latter &#x0223c;2.5-fold; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2002</xref>). We therefore used the mean burst duration and its dependence on ATP as a probe to determine which kinetic model best describes ATP-dependent closure of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel.</p><p>The gating of the &#x003b2;-cell K<sub>ATP</sub> channel can be well described by a kinetic scheme with a single open state (O), one intraburst closed state (C<sub>S</sub>), and several interburst closed states (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alekseev et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Trapp et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Enkvetchakul et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fang et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, we use a simplified kinetic scheme with a single interburst closed state (C<sub>F</sub>), as our analysis is not concerned with transitions between interburst closed states:<disp-formula id="sc1"><label>(SCHEME 1)</label><inline-graphic xlink:href="jgp1320131sc1.jpg"/></disp-formula>where <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> are the rate constants for transitions between the intraburst states O and C<sub>F</sub>, and <italic>c</italic> and <italic>d</italic> are the rate constants for transitions between the open state and interburst closed state C<sub>S</sub>.</p><p>In principle, all three states can bind ATP, producing the corresponding ATP-bound states O<sub>A</sub>, C<sub>FA</sub>, and C<sub>SA</sub>. Several earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gillis et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Trapp et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan and Makielski, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2002</xref>) assumed that interaction of ATP with the channel open state leads directly to K<sub>ATP</sub> channel closure (i.e., that occupancy of the open state O<sub>A</sub> was essentially zero). However, studies on mutant channels clearly showed that ATP-bound open states can contribute significantly to channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Enkvetchakul et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, a realistic kinetic scheme should also include three ATP-bound states, as shown below (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Colquhoun, 1998</xref>):<disp-formula id="sc2"><label>(SCHEME 2)</label><inline-graphic xlink:href="jgp1320131sc2.jpg"/></disp-formula>where <italic>K<sub>O</sub></italic> is the equilibrium binding constant for ATP binding to intraburst states (O, C<sub>F</sub>) and <italic>K<sub>C</sub></italic> is the equilibrium binding constant for ATP binding to the interburst long closed states (C<sub>S</sub>). Because the effect of ATP on intraburst closed states is very small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alekseev et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Trapp et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2002</xref>), for simplicity, we assume that intraburst transitions (i.e., rate constants <italic>a, b</italic>) are unaffected by the nucleotide; we also assume they are the same for all three models shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. In contrast, ATP substantially affects the rates of transitions between open and interburst closed states. Thus the rate constants governing transitions between the ATP-bound open state O<sub>A</sub> and ATP-bound interburst closed state C<sub>SA</sub> must include proportionality coefficients (<italic>m, n</italic>) that describe how much the rate of closure, or opening, respectively, is altered when ATP is bound (i.e., <italic>c&#x0002a;m</italic>, <italic>d&#x0002a;n</italic>).</p><p>The right side of the <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="sc2">Scheme 2</xref> corresponds to the allosteric cycle for binding of one ATP molecule in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, where <italic>E<sub>O</sub> (&#x0003d;c/d)</italic> is the equilibrium gating constant for transitions between states O and C<sub>S</sub> and <italic>t (&#x0003d;m/n)</italic> is the transduction coefficient for the effect of ATP binding on this reaction.

Full details are given in the online supplementary material (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200709874/DC1">http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200709874/DC1</ext-link>); here we summarize only the major results.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects on Open States</title><p>The values of <italic>K<sub>O</sub></italic> and <italic>m</italic> obtained from the best fit of the BR data for separated 4WT channels with the MWC model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="fd11">Eq. 11</xref>) were <italic>K<sub>O,WT</sub></italic> &#x0003d; 3.25 mM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> &#x0003d; 308 &#x003bc;M) and <italic>m<sub>WT</sub> &#x0003d;</italic> 2.7 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). These values are very similar to those for the connected 4WT channel (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> &#x0003d; 320 &#x003bc;M, <italic>m<sub>WT</sub></italic> &#x0003d; 2.8). Thus we conclude that the linkers introduced between Kir6.2 subunits in connected tetramers do not substantially alter ATP binding to the open state (<italic>K<sub>O</sub></italic>) or the transduction parameter <italic>m</italic>.</p><p>Similar values for <italic>K<sub>O</sub></italic> and <italic>m</italic> were also obtained from fitting the ATP dependence of the mean open times obtained for both connected and unconnected 4WT K<sub>ATP</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>; Fig. S13 C). These results provide further support for the idea that ATP reduces the burst duration via interaction with the open state of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2002</xref>). They also confirm that ATP exerts only a mild effect on the intraburst transitions (thus validating the use of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="sc2">Scheme 2</xref>) and indicate that errors associated with the methods employed for measuring burst durations and open times were small.</p><p>To examine the properties of unconnected K<sub>ATP</sub> channels containing various numbers of mutant subunits, we analyzed single-channel records from patches pulled from oocytes injected with different ratios of wild-type and mutant Kir6.2 mRNAs (Fig. S12 A). In single-channel patches, it was possible to identify channels with kinetic signatures that resembled those observed for connected tetramers with different numbers of WT and M subunits. The BR-ATP relationship for these channels was similar to that of the corresponding connected tetramers (Fig. S12 B). We therefore conclude that in unconnected mixed WT:M tetramers, as in their connected counterparts, ATP binding to Kir6.2 is also likely to be independent.</p><p>The intrinsic <italic>P<sub>O</sub></italic> of connected 4WT K<sub>ATP</sub> channels was &#x0223c;2.3-fold higher than that of unconnected 4WT channels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). The mean burst duration was also increased (approximately sixfold, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Calculation of the intrinsic rate constants <italic>a, b</italic>, and <italic>c</italic> from data obtained in the absence of ATP indicated that these effects are caused by a decrease in the rate constant <italic>c</italic> in the connected tetramer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Such a shift in the gating equilibrium toward the open state is expected to indirectly reduce the ATP sensitivity of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Trapp et al., 1998</xref>). As anticipated, connected 4WT tetramers had a slightly reduced ATP sensitivity: the <italic>IC<sub>50</sub></italic> increased from 8.4 to 14.5 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). This small increase in <italic>IC<sub>50</sub></italic> can be fully accounted for by the sixfold increase in the mean burst duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Trapp et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results indicate that connected tetramers provide a good model for studying the interaction of ATP with the open state of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel. Although the increase in intrinsic <italic>P<sub>O</sub></italic> altered the ATP sensitivity, it also substantially stabilized channel activity in excised patches, making it particularly suitable for analysis of single-channel kinetics.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects on Interburst Closed States</title><p>The high intrinsic <italic>P<sub>O</sub></italic> of concatenated tetramers implies that in comparison with unconnected tetramers, the interaction of ATP with the interburst closed states of the channel will be substantially reduced. It would therefore be expected that concatenated tetramers would be less inhibited by ATP than unconnected tetramers at nucleotide concentrations where ATP binding saturates (i.e., in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="fd15">Eq. 15</xref> for the MWC model, reduced <italic>E</italic><sub>0</sub> values would increase <italic>p<sub>i</sub></italic>). Interestingly, we observed the opposite effect; at 10 mM ATP, the fraction of current that remained unblocked was 1.7 &#x000b1; 0.7&#x0002a;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6) and 1.0 &#x000b1; 0.6&#x0002a;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6) for connected and unconnected K<sub>ATP</sub> channels composed of four wild-type subunits. Thus, in addition to increasing the stability of the open state, linking Kir6.2 subunits also enhanced the efficiency of K<sub>ATP</sub> channel inhibition by ATP. Since ATP-dependent closure from the open state in connected tetramers is not substantially altered, this effect must involve the stabilization of long closed states of the channel by the nucleotide. Thus, the effect of ATP on the interburst duration of connected tetramers does not quantitatively match that of the unconnected channel.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this paper, we show that the ATP dependence of the mean burst duration of connected tetramers can be used to determine the mechanism by which ATP induces closing of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel. Although experimentally laborious, this method can be easily extended for other types of ligand-gated multimeric ion channels.</p><p>We considered the possibility that the subunits within a concatenated tetramer do not assemble into the same tetrameric channel, as previously suggested for connected dimers of Shaker K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCormack et al., 1992</xref>). However, this did not seem to be the case. Each of the different tetrameric channels we constructed had very different single-channel properties. Expression of a single tetrameric species gave rise to single channels with similar properties; we never observed channels with properties corresponding to more than one type of channel. It is possible that the presence of SUR1, which surrounds the Kir6.2 tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mikhailov et al., 2005</xref>), may act as a chaperone, or simply as a physical obstruction, and prevent aberrant associations between subunits from two different concatenated tetramers.</p><sec><title>Effects of ATP on the Open State</title><p>We show (for the first time) that the decrease in the burst and open time duration of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel produced by ATP saturates at high ATP concentration. This is indicative of the existence of ATP bound-open states in the wild-type channel. Analysis of burst and open times can be thus expanded to include effects of all four ATP molecules on channel closure. In contrast, previous studies considered the effect of only one ATP molecule on channel closure because they assumed a linear relationship between 1/&#x003c4;<sub>O</sub> and [ATP] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Our results demonstrate that the ATP-dependent decrease in mean open and burst durations can be described by the MWC mechanism. Together with the data obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Drain et al. (2004)</xref>, it can thus be concluded that Kir6.2 subunits (either liganded or unliganded) exert an additive effect on the energy of the open state of the channel. Furthermore, our results show that when the channel is open, ATP binds to a single ATP-binding site with a <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of &#x0223c;300 &#x003bc;M (as the channel has four ATP-binding sites, the overall <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> for binding to the open state is &#x0223c;75 &#x003bc;M). This means that in the intact cell, where ATP ranges from 1 to 10 mM, an open channel will have ATP bound to Kir6.2 for most of the time.</p><p>The MWC model is inherently easier to reconcile with the structure of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel than are the other two models tested. Let us consider that each gating unit represents the cytosolic domain of a single Kir6.2 subunit. In the HH model, the cytosolic domain of an individual Kir6.2 subunit undergoes a conformational change on ATP binding that does not influence other subunits. In the MWC model, the four cytosolic domains function as a single unit, and ATP binding to a single subunit produces a global conformational change in all four cytosolic domains that leads to pore closure. This seems reasonable, given that residues in two adjacent subunits contribute to a single ATP-binding site in a molecular model of Kir6.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antcliff et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Since we restricted our analysis to the mean burst durations, it is possible that more complex concerted models than the MWC model will be required to describe the ATP-dependent closing reaction fully. However, our data suggest that any such model will also have to be concerted. Furthermore, in order to produce the exponential dependence of burst duration on the number of wild-type subunits (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), it should also satisfy the criterion that ATP binding at one subunit is independent of other subunits.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of K185E Mutation on ATP Binding</title><p>Residue K185 plays crucial a key role in ATP binding to Kir6.2. Mutation of K185 has a marked effect on ATP block of channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reimann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">John et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ribalet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2007</xref>), and binding of labeled ATP to Kir6.2 is reduced when K185 is mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tanabe et al., 2000</xref>). Molecular dynamic simulations of ATP binding to a homology model of Kir6.2 suggest that the strongest interaction of ATP with Kir6.2 is via the side chain of K185 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haider et al., 2005b</xref>). Our results show that the K185E mutation does not alter the affinity of ATP binding to the open state but instead impairs the conformational change induced on ATP binding that leads to channel closure. The affinity of ATP binding to the closed state of the channel is also impaired. Taken together, the data are consistent with a model in which residue 185 may not be accessible to ATP in the open state, but where the closure of the channel leads to a conformational change that facilitates entry of ATP into its binding site, thereby providing access to residue 185. The lack of effect of replacing lysine with glutamate on ATP binding to the open state also raises the possibility that residue 185 does not interact directly with ATP as implied by molecular modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antcliff et al., 2005</xref>), or that it only interacts in the closed state.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results demonstrate that it is important to consider the interaction of ATP with the open state of the channel for both a qualitative and a quantitative understanding of ATP inhibition. We have previously used this interaction to quantify a gating defect caused by the C166S mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Trapp et al. 1998</xref>). In this study, we show how the ATP-dependent closing rate can be also used to measure ATP binding and to quantify the mechanism by which ATP binding is transduced into channel closure. The latter is of particular interest as this mechanism is poorly understood. The fact that the ATP dependence of the mean open and burst durations can be described by a simple MWC model is useful for the analysis of the molecular mechanism of K<sub>ATP</sub> channel mutations, such as those that cause neonatal diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashcroft, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hattersley and Ashcroft, 2005</xref>). In the future, it will be necessary to develop more complex kinetic models in order to describe the gating of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels more completely.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Material Index</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jgp.200709874_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jgp.200709874_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Chris Miller (Brandeis University, Waltham, MA) for constructive criticism and advice on an earlier version of the manuscript.
