Rad9 has been found to interact with several other proteins outside the context of the 9-1-1 complex with no obvious checkpoint functions. During our studies on the 9-1-1 complex, we found that Rad9 immunoprecipitates contained a 240 kDa protein that was identified as carbamoyl phosphate synthetase&#x0002f;aspartate transcarbamoylase&#x0002f;dihydroorotase (CAD), a multienzymatic protein required for the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides and cell growth.

The rate-limiting step in <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis is catalyzed by the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II (CPSase) domain of CAD. We find that Rad9 binds to the CPSase domain, and, moreover, this binding results in a 2-fold stimulation of the CPSase activity of CAD. Similar results were also obtained with an N-terminal Rad9 fragment. These findings suggest that Rad9 may play a role in ribonucleotide biosynthesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The human Rad9, Rad1 and Hus1 proteins make a proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-like heterotrimeric complex that has a ring structure and is thought to play a PCNA-like role as a DNA clamp specific for the DNA damage checkpoint response [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c1">1</xref>)]. It has been found that the checkpoint-specific Rad17-replication factor C (RFC) specifically binds to the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 (9-1-1) complex and clamps it around a DNA duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c5">5</xref>). Although the precise mechanism by which the Rad17-RFC&#x0002f;9-1-1 complex clamp-loader&#x0002f;checkpoint-clamp senses damage and initiates cell cycle arrest is not known, significant progress has been made in understanding the role of this complex.</p><p>Investigations into how the 9-1-1 complex may transduce a signal to downstream proteins in the checkpoint response have revealed that subunits of the complex, in particular Rad9, interact with a number of other cellular proteins with no obvious role in cell cycle arrest and have raised the possibility that these proteins might individually participate in other cellular functions as well. For example, Rad9 has recently been shown to bind to the androgen receptor and modulate its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c6">6</xref>). Rad9 also binds to the kinases c-Abl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c7">7</xref>) and PKC&#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c8">8</xref>), which in turn regulate the binding of Rad9 to the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, suggesting that Rad9 may play a role in the apoptotic response to genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c9">9</xref>).</p><p>In the course of our studies on the function of the 9-1-1 complex, we found that when Rad9 was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography from extracts of transiently transfected human cells, the purified Rad9 preparation contained a protein of 240 kDa as a major contaminant. Mass spectrometric analysis was used to identify this protein as carbamoyl phosphate synthetase&#x0002f;aspartate transcarbamoylase&#x0002f;dihydroorotase (CAD), a multienzymatic protein that catalyzes the first three steps in <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c10">10</xref>). The rate-limiting step in this pyrimidine synthesis pathway is catalyzed by the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II (CPSase) of CAD, which is also the site of feedback inhibition by uridine nucleotides and activation by the allosteric ligand phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c11">11</xref>). CPSase activity is increased in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c13">13</xref>) and is regulated by the protein kinase A and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in a growth- and cell-cycle-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c17">17</xref>). We find that Rad9 binds to the CPSase domain and that this binding results in a 2-fold stimulation of the CPSase activity of CAD. This is the first documented report of a protein&#x02013;protein interaction with CAD regulating its CPSase activity. We find that CAD interacts with free Rad9, but not Rad9 within the 9-1-1 checkpoint complex. These findings suggest that Rad9 may have an additional role to its checkpoint function in ribonucleotide biosynthesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Antisera that recognize various antigens were obtained as follows: rabbit anti-His<sub>6</sub> (H-15) and rabbit anti-hRad9 (M-389) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-Flag from Sigma (St Louis, MO).</p></sec><sec><title>Transfections and immunoprecipitations</title><p>Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U of penicillin and streptomycin per milliliter and were transfected with pcDNA3-FlaghRad9, pcDNA3-His<sub>6</sub>FlagCAD, pcDNA3-His<sub>6</sub>- FlagCPSII or pcDNA3-HA-hRad9 plasmids using the calcium phosphate transfection method as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c18">18</xref>).

Briefly, all of the reaction components except the cold and <sup>14</sup>C-labeled sodium bicarbonate (the initiation solution) were added to tubes on ice.

The preparation also contained two bands &#x0223c;30 kDa consistent with the sizes of Rad1 and Hus1, which were at levels stoichiometrically similar to the 240 kDa band when analyzed by coomassie staining (data not shown). None of these bands were seen in immunoaffinity-purified extracts from control cells transfected with the vector alone. Mass spectroscopic analysis of Rad9-copurifying bands revealed that the 240 kDa protein is CAD and the 110 kDa protein is the heat-shock protein hsp110. As heat-shock proteins often copurify with ectopically expressed proteins, we concentrated our efforts on characterizing CAD, the major protein that copurifies with Rad9.</p></sec><sec><title>Mapping of CAD and Rad9 domains required for binding</title><p>The human CAD protein catalyzes three separate reactions with three distinct structural domains, CPSase, aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) and dihydroorotase (DHOase) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh789f2">2</xref>A). Similarly, human Rad9 has an N-terminal PCNA-like domain and a C-terminal extension which is heavily phosphorylated and is thought to play a role as an effector in checkpoint signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c22">22</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh789f2">2</xref>B). To gain insight into the potential physiological significance of the CAD&#x02013;Rad9 interaction, we mapped the interacting regions on both proteins by deletion analysis. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh789f3">3</xref>, both full-length CAD and the CPSase domain of CAD were co-expressed with Rad9 in 293T cells and the CAD and CPSase immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted for Rad9. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh789f3">3</xref> (right panel), Rad9 bound equally well to the full-length CAD and to the CPSase domain alone. To perform reciprocal experiments, insect cells were infected with baculoviruses expressing CAD together with regions of Rad9. The Rad9 fragments were immunoprecipitated and the precipitates were analyzed for CAD by immunoblotting. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh789f4">4</xref>, the N-terminal and the middle third, but not the C-terminal third of Rad9 bound to CAD. The strongest binding was observed with the N-terminal two-thirds of the protein. Interestingly, the C-terminal two-thirds bound CAD with less affinity than the middle third alone, suggesting that the C-terminal tail may negatively regulate the Rad9&#x02013;CAD interaction. While the quantitative aspects of the data regarding the binding strength has certain limitations, this data unambiguously show that the PCNA-like domain of Rad9 binds to CAD whereas the C-terminal domain, which encompasses the major Rad9 phosphorylation sites and presumably acts as an effector in checkpoint signaling, does not.</p></sec><sec><title>CAD binds to free Rad9 but not to Rad9 within the 9-1-1 complex</title><p>To investigate whether CAD may participate in Rad17-RFC&#x0002f;9-1-1 complex-mediated signal transduction, we tested the binding of CAD to the other members of the 9-1-1 complex, Rad1 and Hus1, as well as to the ternary 9-1-1 complex by co-infection of insect cells with combinations of baculoviruses that express these proteins. The tagged 9-1-1 proteins were immunoprecipitated and the immunoprecipitates were tested for the other 9-1-1 proteins and for CAD. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh789f5">5</xref> shows that Rad9 expressed in insect cells, such as Rad9 expressed in mammalian cells, binds CAD, but Rad1 and Hus1 do not (lane 1 versus lane 2). Most significantly, when Rad9 is co-immunoprecipitated as part of the 9-1-1 complex by using a Hus1 affinity tag, the immunoprecipitate does not contain any detectable CAD (lane 3). This was somewhat expected because Rad9 interacts with Rad1 and Hus1 through its PCNA-like domain suggesting that this domain is apparently blocked from binding to CAD within the 9-1-1 complex. These findings suggested that the Rad9&#x02013;CAD interaction may have a role in cellular physiology other than DNA damage checkpoint signaling.</p></sec><sec><title>Modulation of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase activity</title><p>Since currently there is no specific assay for Rad9 activity, we tested for the possible modulation of CAD activity by Rad9 in the following series of experiments. Initially, we found that the immunoaffinity-purified Rad9&#x02013;CAD complex exhibited higher CPSase activity than CAD alone (data not shown). To further examine the effect of Rad9 on CAD activity, we examined whether purified proteins could be combined to recapitulate this regulation. However, when combined <italic>in vitro</italic>, the two proteins did not form a stable complex, and we observed no change in the CPSase activity of CAD (data not shown). We reasoned that the two proteins may have to be co-expressed to form a complex, and therefore we expressed CAD alone and CAD plus Rad9 in insect cells and purified these recombinant proteins using the His<sub>6</sub> tag on CAD for affinity purification. We obtained the protein preparations shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh789f6">6</xref>. The CAD protein levels obtained under the two conditions were quite similar, and the amount of CAD activity was normalized to the amount of CAD protein in each sample as determined by quantitative western analysis.</p><p>CPSase synthesizes carbamoyl phosphate from ATP, bicarbonate and glutamine, and is the first enzymatic step in pyrimidine biosynthesis. CPSase is allosterically activated by PRPP and inhibited by UTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c10">10</xref>). We tested the effect of Rad9 on CPSase activity in the presence of saturating amounts of PRPP with varying ATP concentrations. We observed that the <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> of CAD was increased 2-fold by Rad9 both in the presence or absence of PRPP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh789f7">7</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh789tb1">1</xref>). Kinetic analysis of CAD&#x0002f;Rad9 complexes revealed that Rad9 did not significantly change the apparent affinity for ATP (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) in the presence or absence of PRPP. Likewise, a fragment of Rad9 lacking the C-terminal phosphorylation sites (fragment C in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh789f4">4</xref>) had a similar effect on the CPSase activity of CAD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh789f7">7</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh789tb1">1</xref>). Thus, it appears that Rad9 regulates the rate-limiting step of ribonucleotide biosynthesis by increasing the <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> of the CPSase activity.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Transcriptional induction of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is one of the best-characterized transcriptional response reactions to DNA damage and has been observed in organisms ranging from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c23">23</xref>). The upregulation of RNR activity by either transcriptional or post-transcriptional means increases the dNTP pools, and it has been shown that an increase in dNTP levels following DNA damage increases cellular survival in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c24">24</xref>). Since rNTP pools are typically 100-fold higher than the dNTP pools, it has generally been assumed that changes in rNTP levels would not affect the dNTP pool and hence the survival and mutation rate. This assumption, however, has not been experimentally tested. Furthermore, RNA synthesis which would be affected by rNTP levels might contribute to cellular recovery from genotoxic stress. Such an outcome of a Rad9&#x02013;CAD interaction would place this interaction within the general DNA damage response network. However, it is also plausible that the Rad9&#x02013;CAD interaction is operational under physiological conditions to maintain cellular homeostasis and that this function is not related to the checkpoint function of Rad9 which occurs within the context of the 9-1-1 complex. Indeed, Rad9 has been found to associate with a number of proteins with diverse functions some of which are not related the DNA damage checkpoint response. Additionally, <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine biosynthesis is not only important in dividing cells for the production of new nucleic acids, but also for UDP&#x02013;sugars and CDP&#x02013;lipids, which are used for diverse cellular functions [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c17">17</xref>)]. Therefore, the Rad9-induced increase in CAD activity could be important in many different areas of cell physiology.</p><p>We currently do not know the cellular location of the CAD&#x02013;Rad9 interaction. While CAD is mainly cytoplasmic, some studies have provided evidence for a fraction of CAD being in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c26">26</xref>). Under normal cellular conditions, Rad9 is part of the nuclear 9-1-1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c28">28</xref>). However, Rad9 does appear to have an independent cytoplasmic function during apoptosis. It has been demonstrated that during apoptosis Rad9 is cleaved by caspase-3 and the N-terminal portion of Rad9 translocates to the cytosol where it interacts with Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c29">29</xref>). Since CAD does not associate with the 9-1-1 complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh789f5">5</xref>), and all detectable nuclear Rad9 is in this complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c27">27</xref>), it is likely that the CAD&#x02013;Rad9 interaction takes place in the cytoplasm. We could not detect the Rad9&#x02013;CAD interaction by immunoprecipitating endogenous Rad9 presumably because the interaction is weak relative to the 9-1-1 interaction and therefore is detectable only when Rad9 is overproduced.</p><p>CAD is a unique biosynthetic enzyme with three distinct enzymatic activities. The CPSase enzyme domain catalyzes the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from glutamine, bicarbonate and two molecules of ATP. The ATCase region catalyzes the synthesis of carbamoyl aspartate from aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate. Finally, the formation of dihydroorotate is catalyzed by the DHOase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c11">11</xref>). The assay used in these studies to measure CPSase activity is a coupled enzyme assay which measures the incorporation of [<sup>14</sup>C] into the acid-stable chemical carbamoyl aspartate, which, as mentioned above, is catalyzed by the enzymatic activities of both the CPS II and ATC domains. However, since the CPSase activity is rate limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c30">30</xref>), the observed changes in enzymatic activity are most likely due to changes in the CPSase activity of CAD.</p><p>The CPSase activity of CAD is highly regulated. As mentioned previously, it is allosterically activated by PRPP and inhibited by the product of pyrimidine-nucleotide synthesis, uridine 5&#x02032;-triphosphate (UTP). Moreover, phosphorylation can affect the allosteric regulation by PRPP and UTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c31">31</xref>). An additional level of regulation of CPSase activity is by protein degradation induced by caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c19">19</xref>). The findings reported in this study add a previously unknown mode of CPSase activity regulation. Our data reveal the first documented report that a protein&#x02013;protein interaction with CAD can regulate CPSase activity. Although allosteric regulators (i.e. PRPP and UTP) decrease the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for a CPSase substrate (ATP), our data suggests that Rad9 increases the <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> of CPSase rather than changing the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for ATP. Rad9 binding was also observed to increase the maximum velocity of CPSase activity in the presence of PRPP, but did not affect the percentage activation by PRPP. We investigated the affect of Rad9 on UTP-induced inhibition of CPSase activity. Rad9 did not significantly decrease the inhibitory action of UTP, but this result varied between CAD protein preparations preventing us from making a conclusion from this data (data not shown).</p><p>The mechanism by which Rad9 increases CPSase activity is not known. Rad9 binding could increase the affinity of other CPS II substrates such as glutamine or bicarbonate. Another plausible hypothesis is that Rad9 increases the glutaminase activity of CPS II, thereby increasing the overall <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> without affecting the affinity for ATP. However, this appears unlikely since experiments using ammonia as the nitrogen donor, thereby bypassing the need for the glutaminase activity, have shown that Rad9 still induced a 2-fold increase in CPSase activity (data not shown). Alternatively, Rad9 binding may induce a conformational shift that affects the oligomeric (activated) form of the enzyme. Active CAD has been shown to be a hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c32">32</xref>), and Rad9 may increase CAD activity by increasing the amount of enzyme in the hexameric form. Dissociation of CAD to monomers did not affect the CPSase activity, but significantly reduced the <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> of ATCase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c32">32</xref>). It is therefore possible that Rad9 could be increasing CAD activity by stabilizing the oligomeric form of this enzyme and thereby increasing the <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> of ATCase. However, this seems unlikely since the CPSase activity of CAD is the rate-limiting step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh789c30">30</xref>), and an increase in the ATCase rate would not be expected to increase the overall rate of our coupled enzyme reaction.</p><p>In summary, we find that the checkpoint protein Rad9 specifically interacts with the CPSase domain of CAD and increases its <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> by at least a factor of two. The high specificity of the Rad9&#x02013;CAD interaction strongly suggests that it is of significance to normal cellular homeostasis. Further work is needed to determine the potential role of this interaction in regulating DNA damage checkpoints, ribonucleotide pools or RNA and DNA synthesis.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh789f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Copurification of CAD with Rad9.
