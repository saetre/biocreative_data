Besides other models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], the "clock-and-wavefront" model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] is able to explain somite formation. This model proposes the existence of a cellular clock that interacts with a slowly progressing wave (wavefront) moving along the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) from anterior to posterior. Genes of the <italic>h/E(spl)/hey</italic> family have been identified in chicken and mouse that show a cycling expression pattern, namely <italic>c-hairy1, c-hairy2, c-hey2, mhes1</italic> and <italic>mhes7</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These bHLH proteins are thought to obey the proposed molecular clock.</p><p>Analysis of the family of <italic>h/E(spl)</italic>-related genes in zebrafish has yielded 9 <italic>her</italic>-genes so far (<italic>her1-6</italic>: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], <italic>her7</italic> and <italic>her8</italic> unpublished own work, accession numbers: AF240772, AY007990, <italic>her9</italic>: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]) and one member of the <italic>hey</italic> class, called <italic>gridlock</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. <italic>her1</italic>, <italic>her4</italic>, <italic>her6</italic> and <italic>her7</italic> are thought to play a role in somite formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. <italic>her4</italic> and <italic>her6</italic> are expressed in the developing nervous system and in the anterior PSM of zebrafish embryos but they do not cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The <italic>her1</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and the <italic>her7</italic> gene (unpublished) are both cyclically expressed in the PSM during somitogenesis. Both genes are only distantly related to the cycling <italic>c-hairy</italic> type genes from higher vertebrates. In zebrafish, <italic>her9</italic>, the apparent orthologue of the cycling genes from chicken and mouse does not show any expression at all in the PSM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Therefore, it has been suggested that the zebrafish <italic>her1</italic> gene is the functional homologue to the cycling <italic>c-hairy</italic> type genes and thus an element of the molecular clock. Alternatively, more than two <italic>c-hairy</italic> type genes (<italic>her6</italic> and <italic>her9</italic>) exist in zebrafish. Since whole genome sequence information for zebrafish is still missing, we chose to exploit the publicly available draft sequence of the <italic>Fugu</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] to identify all the H/E(spl)/Hey-related proteins of this organism. The evolutionary divergence time of both fish species is about 180 myr compared to 430 myr to tetrapods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Hence, the emerging picture might give us a clearer view on the situation of the <italic>h/E(spl)/hey</italic>-related gene family in zebrafish than from comparison to higher vertebrates. Due to a remarkable conservation of exon-intron structure of the <italic>h/E(spl)</italic>-related genes from insects up to man, it is possible to annotate the proteins of this family on the level of genomic sequence for <italic>Fugu rubripes</italic>. Since the automatically performed annotation was not able to correctly predict the protein sequences (the N- and/or C-termini often were missing), it became necessary for comparative analysis to re-compile the sequences on the basis of an exon-intron dataset of known <italic>h/E(spl)</italic> genes.</p><p>It has been shown, that the pufferfish <italic>Fugu rubripes</italic> possesses a very small genome with a size of only 400 Mb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Compared to zebrafish or man the genome size in pufferfish is 4 to 8 times reduced. This reduction refers mostly to the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, while <italic>Fugu</italic> seems to possess a similar gene set with the same structure than mammalian organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Comparison of promoter sequences from homologous genes in both fish species should facilitate the identification of candidate transcription factor binding sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>In the genome of <italic>Fugu rubripes</italic> significantly more <italic>h/E(spl)/hey</italic>-related genes were identified than in <italic>Danio rerio</italic> are currently known</title><p>Screening of the genomic sequence database of <italic>Fugu rubripes</italic> with the so far known zebrafish "Hairy and Enhancer of split"-related (Her) proteins by the TBLASTN program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] revealed 20 <italic>h/E(spl)/hey</italic>-related genes in <italic>Fugu</italic> (table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">additional file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">additional file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">additional file 3</xref>. A BLASTN search with the compiled genes against the available cDNA database <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/pub/fugu/fugu_cdna.zip"/> gave no matches, indicating that the dataset (3142 entries) is too small. All assembled sequences showed conserved exon-intron boundaries and no unexpected stop-codons, suggesting that the genes are functional. In general, the <italic>Fugu</italic> proteins were named according to their overall similarity to the zebrafish Her proteins. To reveal the relationships within the bHLH proteins of <italic>Fugu rubripes</italic> the sequences were aligned (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and a corresponding tree was calculated (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The <italic>Fugu</italic> proteins could be clearly divided into the three classes Enhancer of split type (3 members, fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>: orange box), Hey type (5 members, fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>: light red box) and Hairy type (12 members, fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>: bluegreen, light green, dark green and violet boxes).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Sequence alignment of H/E(spl)/Hey-related proteins from <italic>Fugu rubripes</italic></bold> Conservation levels: 100% identical residues are indicated in black, 80% or more conserved residues are marked in dark grey, 60% or more conserved residues are marked in lighter grey and less than 60% conserved residues are indicated in very light grey.

However, FrHer2 (T002603/1) does not cluster with the other 2 Enhancer of split type proteins in the tree.</p><p>Five <italic>Fugu</italic> proteins were classified as Hey (4) or Hey-related (1) compared to only one currently known zebrafish member of that class, called Gridlock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Homologues for each of the <italic>hey</italic> or <italic>hey</italic>-related genes in <italic>Fugu</italic> have already been isolated in higher vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] or were previously annotated in the genbank database (accession number: XM_068025 for "bHLH protein similar to <italic>hhesr1</italic>/<italic>hey1</italic>"). The C-terminal consensus sequence of the Hey proteins is KP<bold>YRPW</bold>GTE(I<sup>Hey1</sup>/V<sup>Hey2</sup>)GAF. Focussing on this consensus, FrHey1.1 (contig T004546), FrHey1.2 (contig T000531) and FrHey2 (contig T014948) could be determined for the pufferfish (table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Interestingly, all 3 proteins show at least one exchange to the C-terminal consensus sequence. According to the similarity in the bHLH-domain the two other proteins in contig T003476 and T005657 belong also to the Hey type proteins (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). However, like mouse HRT3 ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], accession number: AF172288) FrHey3 (contig T005657) possesses the TEIGAF motif but deviates to a higher degree from the YRPW-motif. The other protein (in contig T003476) does not possess a KP<bold>YRPW</bold>GTE(I<sup>Hey1</sup>/V<sup>Hey2</sup>)GAF motif at the C-terminal end. Instead a completely diverged amino acid sequence is present. Furthermore, the basic domain is somehow truncated (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">additional file 4</xref>). Interestingly, this protein consists of 4 exons. This is in contrast to the other identified Hey-genes, which have 5 exons in human and <italic>Fugu</italic> (see table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Nevertheless, the human orthologue, defined as "bHLH protein similar to Hesr-1/Hey1" (accession number: XM_068025, table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">additional file 4</xref>) shows equal aberrant features from the Hey-type genes. Therefore, we will refer to the <italic>hey</italic>-related gene in <italic>Fugu</italic> as Fr<italic>hhesr1</italic>-related.</p><p>12 identified pufferfish proteins belong to the Hairy class of bHLH transcription factors that can be further subdivided into 3 branches. 5 proteins belong to the <italic>c-hairy</italic> type class compared to two genes known so far from zebrafish (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>: bluegreen box). At a first glance, in the second branch at least two of three proteins seem to be the zebrafish orthologues Her1 and Her7, which are involved in somitogenesis (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>: violet box). A detailed analysis of the c-Hairy type class as well as of the Her1/5/7 is given in the following sections. The third branch consists of three proteins that are related to the zebrafish Her8 (table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>: light green box).</p><p>Comparing both fish species, the number of <italic>h/E(spl)/hey</italic>-related genes in pufferfish is twice the number of these genes currently known from zebrafish. Evidence from Hox cluster analysis suggests that the extent of duplication in <italic>Fugu</italic>, if any, is far less extensive than in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that more <italic>h/E(spl)/hey</italic>-related genes in zebrafish exist. Deduced from the comparative tree it can be estimated that at least for <italic>hey</italic> type genes and in particular for genes of the <italic>c-hairy</italic> type class further zebrafish homologues have to be expected.</p><p>A screen with the 20 conceptually translated <italic>Fugu</italic> proteins against the human genomic sequence database yielded 10 <italic>h/E(spl)/hey</italic>-related genes (for accession numbers see Materials and Methods). These 10 genes can be further divided into 6 <italic>h/E(spl)</italic> genes, 3 <italic>hey</italic> genes (<italic>hey1</italic>, <italic>hey2</italic>, <italic>heyL</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]) and 1 <italic>hey</italic>-related gene (<italic>hhesr1</italic>, accession number: XM_068025). In Fugu, 15 <italic>h/E(spl)</italic> genes, 4 <italic>hey</italic>-genes and 1 <italic>hey</italic>-related gene were identified. Deduced from the sequence alignment of the Hey type proteins (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">additional file 4</xref>), FrHey1.1 and FrHey1.2 are similar to human Hey1, FrHey2 is similar to human Hey2 and FrHey3 is similar to human HeyL. One copy of the hey-related gene exists in both genomes (<italic>hhesr1</italic>, accession number: XM_068025, and Fr<italic>hhesr1</italic>). While the set of <italic>Hey</italic>- and <italic>Hey</italic>-related genes is quite comparable in both organisms, the number of <italic>h/E(spl)</italic> genes in <italic>Fugu</italic> (15) is 2.5 times higher than in the human genome (6). This indicates a duplication of those genes in <italic>Fugu</italic> or loss of members of the <italic>h/E(spl)</italic> genes in human. It is not known how these genes are expressed in <italic>Fugu</italic> but interestingly the majority of the zebrafish <italic>her</italic> genes is expressed in subsets of differentiating neuroblasts during nervous system development ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]; <italic>her</italic>8 unpublished). Since fish possess a unique set of neurons and sensory organs, compared to higher vertebrates, it might be that selective duplication of the <italic>hairy</italic> genes was one source that led to neuronal/sensory cell diversification.</p></sec><sec><title>A novel class of c-Hairy proteins exist in the genomes of two pufferfish species</title><p>The 5 c-Hairy type proteins of the Hairy class of bHLH transcription factors in <italic>Fugu rubripes</italic> can be divided into three distinct c-Hairy subclasses, namely the c-Hairy1 class and c-Hairy2 class [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and a third novel c-Hairy class, which we will refer to as the c-Hairy-related class since no apparent orthologue from chicken is known so far. Members of the three subclasses can be distinguished by length of the amino acid sequence between the orange domain and the WRPW motif (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). FrHer9 (in contig T000078) possesses the longest amino acid sequence stretch between the two domains and therefore belongs to the c-Hairy1 class, like zebrafish Her9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Sequence alignment of the different c-Hairy type proteins</bold> The Her6, Her9 and Her10 proteins from pufferfish <italic>Fugu rubripes</italic> and <italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis</italic> were aligned with <italic>Danio rerio</italic> and other corresponding vertebrate proteins.

This feature is indicative for c-Hairy2 class proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Thus, FrHer6.1 and FrHer6.2 belong to the c-Hairy2 class and can be considered as Her6 homologues.</p><p>Deduced from the high conservation in the bHLH domain to the other c-Hairy proteins, FrHer10.1 (in contig T000956) and FrHer10.2 (in contig T008912) constitute a third to our knowledge novel c-Hairy class. In both proteins a sequence stretch of around 40 amino acids is missing, like in the c-Hairy2 class. In addition, a second stretch just C-terminal to the orange domain is absent compared to the already known two classes (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Proteins of this c-Hairy type are so far not known in other vertebrates. However, these two <italic>Fugu</italic> proteins show similarity to the Hes2 proteins from mouse and human (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). But in the Hes2 proteins the number of amino acids between the orange domain and the WRPW motif is even more reduced in comparison to the c-Hairy-related proteins. To elucidate whether the class of c-Hairy-related proteins is unique in <italic>Fugu</italic>, the shotgun sequences of <italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis</italic> were screened with the 5 <italic>Fugu c-hairy</italic> type nucleotide sequences. Like in <italic>Fugu</italic>, the two c-Hairy-related class members (TnHer10.1 and TnHer10.2, TnHer10_1 and TnHer10_2 in fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and also the second member of the c-Hairy2 class were found (TnHer6.2, TnHer6_2 in fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) supporting that respective proteins have to be expected in zebrafish.</p></sec><sec><title>Is the zebrafish <italic>her1/7</italic> gene complex conserved in pufferfish?</title><p>One branch of the tree consists of the <italic>Fugu</italic> homologues of zebrafish <italic>her1</italic>, <italic>her5</italic> and <italic>her7</italic> (see fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> violet box and table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7</italic> genes in zebrafish have been shown to be cyclically expressed and are thought to play an important role in somitogenesis. Besides, they are arranged in a head to head orientation (accession number: AF292032). In contrast, Fr<italic>her1</italic> (in contig T002307) is orientated in the same manner to Fr<italic>her5</italic>. Fr<italic>her7</italic> was identified on another contig (T014589). But sequence similarity does not strictly mean functional similarity. It has been shown that the specificity of the biological action <italic>in vivo</italic> of proteins of the H/E(spl) family is mediated by the orange domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Sequence comparison of the orange domain of FrHer5 with zebrafish Her7 and Her5 shows that the domain from the <italic>Fugu</italic> protein is equally similar to that of the zebrafish proteins (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Besides, FrHer5 possesses a prolin residue C-terminal of the WRPW motif, which is indicative for Her7/Hes7 proteins of zebrafish, mouse and human. Moreover, in the FrHer7 basic domain the prolin residue, which is necessary for the repressive function by binding to N-boxes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], is missing. Instead, a histidin residue is present at this position (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Additionally, the loop region of FrHer7 is shorter in comparison to zebrafish Her7. Length differences in the loop region are known to be responsible for functional specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. All observed differences indicate that FrHer7 is not the functional equivalent of zebrafish Her7.

The SPS sequences in the <italic>her1</italic> promoters of both pufferfish deviate from the other sites identified so far.

Single exchanges to the GTGGGAA consensus might exist. Taking these parameters into account examination of the zebrafish <italic>her1/7</italic> promoter yielded one SPS candidate sequence (table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The two potential Su(h) sites have a distance of 31 nucleotides and a hexamer motif. Both sites deviate from the GTGGGAA consensus.
