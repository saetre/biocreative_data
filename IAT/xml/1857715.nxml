Recently, bladder epithelial cells (BECs) were reported to express TLR4 and to evoke a vigorous cytokine response upon exposure to LPS. We examined intracellular signaling events in human BECs leading to the production of IL-6, a major urinary cytokine, following activation by <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> and isolated LPS. We observed that in addition to the classical NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;associated pathway, TLR4 triggers a distinct and more rapid signaling response involving, sequentially, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, adenylyl cyclase 3&#x02013;generated cAMP, and a transcriptional factor, cAMP response element&#x02013;binding protein. This capacity of BECs to mobilize secondary messengers and evoke a more rapid IL-6 response might be critical in their role as first responders to microbial challenge in the urinary tract.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>In spite of frequent cross contamination by bacteria from the gut, urinary tract infections are relatively infrequent. Although much of the credit goes to cells lining the urinary tract, such as bladder cells, how this is achieved remains unclear. Human bladder cells display, on their surfaces, special molecules called Toll-like receptors, which sense the presence of bacteria and trigger the cells to release a variety of chemicals called cytokines. Cytokines contribute to the recruitment of phagocytic cells from the blood to the site of infection to clear bacteria. In this paper, we reveal that the Toll-like receptor&#x02013;initiated intracellular signals leading to the production of cytokines by bladder cells involve the same pathway seen in other cells, as well as an additional and more rapid signaling pathway. Rapid production of cytokines by bladder cells will facilitate early clearance of bacteria. Additionally, possession of multiple signaling pathways by bladder cells for producing cytokines is advantageous because bacteria that infect the urinary tract have the capability to suppress certain signaling events that lead to cytokine production by bladder cells.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Song J, Duncan MJ, Li G, Chan C, Grady R, et al.

These cells recognize microorganisms via a limited number of germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize microbial components known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which are essential for the survival of the microorganism and, therefore, difficult for the microorganism to alter &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. Several classes of PRRs, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytoplasmic receptors, recognize distinct microbial components and directly activate immune cells, triggering intracellular signaling cascades that rapidly induce the expression of a variety of inflammatory cytokines that initiate a variety of overlapping immune responses. One of the best known PRRs is TLR4, which recognizes the major Gram-negative bacterial surface component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. Studies on TLR4 signaling in monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells have revealed that engagement of TLR4 by LPS triggers a signaling cascade involving several intracytoplasmic and nuclear transcriptional factors. TLR4 activation first engages a set of adaptor family members that link TLR4 to the serine/threonine kinases. These kinases mediate phosphorylation and ubiquitination of various substrates, eventually resulting in the activation of the transcriptional factor NF-&#x003ba;B, which regulates the expression of several immunomodulatory cytokines &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The urinary tract is extremely intractable to infection by most pathogens. This is attributable to a large extent on the multifaceted innate immune defenses of the bladder and, in particular, bladder epithelial cells (BECs). These cells selectively exfoliate upon bacterial colonization and undergo re-epithelialization as a mechanism to reduce bacterial load in the bladder. They are also a major source of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the urinary tract following bacterial infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;.

A prominent mediator released by BECs is IL-6 and it is, by far, the single most prominent cytokine detected in the urine of infected patients &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.

The production of some of the earliest indicators of inflammation in the body such as the acute phase proteins has been directly related to production of this cytokine &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Considering the large number of pathogens capable of infecting the urinary tract, it is remarkable that uropathogenic <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> (UPEC) account for over 85&#x00025; of urinary tract infections in patients without underlying predisposing factors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. The singular success of UPEC in the urinary tract has been attributed to bacterial surface expression of filamentous fimbrial appendages, called type 1 fimbriae &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. These structures promote avid bacterial binding to uroplakin 1a molecules on the surface of BECs, triggering bacterial invasion of these cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. In their intracellular location, UPEC avoid elimination by the flushing actions of urine &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Recent studies have suggested additional traits on UPEC that account for their success as uropathogens. These include their capacity to block apoptosis and exfoliation of infected BECs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d; as well as inhibit the ability of BECs to mount a cytokine responses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Although several genes on UPEC have been implicated in inhibiting cytokine production, the underlying mechanism remains elusive, a problem exacerbated, at least partly, by the fact that most of our current understanding of TLR4 signaling is based almost exclusively on cells of hematopoietic origin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. Here, we sought to better define LPS/TLR4 signaling pathway in BECs. We were especially interested in defining the role, if any, of two second messengers, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), since these low molecular weight diffusible molecules have been globally implicated in cellular signaling events, including cytokine responses. We investigated the IL-6 responses of human BECs to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> and to isolated LPS. Our studies demonstrated that the IL-6 response triggered by TLR4 in BECs involves not only the classical NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;associated pathway, but also a distinct pathway involving Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, cAMP, and cAMP response element&#x02013;binding protein (CREB). Interestingly, the latter pathway resulted in a significant IL-6 response, which is evident at least 3 h before the NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;associated pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Bacteria and BECs</title><p>A K-12 laboratory <italic>E. coli</italic> strain ORN103(pSH2) and a UPEC type 1 fimbriated and non-hemolytic strain CI5 were utilized in this study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b015">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.

In addition, a membrane-permeable cAMP analog, dibutyryl cAMP, induced a greater than 3-fold increase in BEC IL-6 production in the absence of bacterial exposure, demonstrating the importance of intracellular cAMP in inducing BEC IL-6 production. However, a membrane-permeable cAMP analog (8-CPT-cAMP) that does not activate the classical cAMP-target protein, protein kinase A (PKA), but only activates the recently discovered cAMP-target protein Epac (exchange protein activated by cAMP) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, did not induce the production of BEC IL-6, indicating that PKA is involved in the downstream induction of IL-6 production by exposed BECs to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g003">Figure 3</xref>C).

First, we determined which AC isoforms were actually expressed in BECs. RT-PCR was performed on total cellular RNA, using primers specific for each known AC isoform and only mRNA for AC isoforms AC-3, AC-4, AC-6, and AC-7 was detectable in BECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). We confirmed that the other AC isotype-specific primers used were functional by undertaking RT-PCR on total RNA from human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, positive control cells, where all ACs except AC-4 and AC-8 were expressed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; (unpublished data). RNAi was utilized to minimize the expression of each AC, which was verified by AC isotype-specific RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Following <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> exposure, intracellular cAMP, as well as IL-6 secretion, rose significantly in all of the KDs, except for the KD of AC-3, indicating that AC-3 is the BEC AC isoform linked to the IL-6 response following <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g004">4</xref>D). It is noteworthy that of the four AC isoforms expressed by BECs, only AC-3 is known to be activated by increases in &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;<sub>i</sub> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. The KD of AC-3 also abrogated the production of intracellular cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g004">Figure 4</xref>E) and expression of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g004">Figure 4</xref>F) following exposure of BECs to purified LPS. Interestingly, in the AC-3 KD BECs, forskolin-induced IL-6 expression was largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g004">Figure 4</xref>F). The appreciable IL-6 response to forskolin suggested that a general increase in intracellular cAMP was sufficient to signal IL-6 secretion in BECs. The absence of any reduction in the IL-6 response to forskolin in AC-3 KD BECs is attributable to the presence of other isoforms of ACs in these cells, which were directly activated by forskolin. Remarkably, when AC-3&#x02013;specific Western blotting was performed on BECs before and after bacterial exposure or exposure to purified LPS, no discernible increase in the expression of AC-3 protein was observed, indicating that an increase in activity, rather than expression, of AC-3 occurred following infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g004">Figure 4</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g004">4</xref>H).

To link cAMP to the classical pathway, we examined its effects on the translocation of the transcriptional factor NF-&#x003ba;B from the cytoplasm to the nucleus following bacterial exposure. Remarkably, when we examined control-transfected BECs and AC-3 KD BECs 1 h following exposure to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> (which corresponds to the time we observed significant secondary messenger responses) for nuclear translocation, we found little or no translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B in either cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). However, when we increased the incubation time to 2 h following exposure to <italic>E. coli,</italic> we detected a marked increase in translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B in control-transfected BECs, and an identical increase was also seen in AC-3 KD BECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). This finding revealed that (i) the cAMP responses in BECs preceded the nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B by significant amounts of time, and (ii) these cAMP responses did not appear to impact the NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;associated signaling pathway. These observations raised the intriguing possibility that secondary messengers such as cAMP may be acting via an independent pathway. To see whether the regulatory effect of cAMP on the IL-6 response was at the transcriptional level, we compared IL-6 mRNA levels in WT BECs, control-transfected BECs, and AC-3 KD BECs before and 1 h after exposure to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>. We observed a marked increase in IL-6 mRNA in WT BECs and control-transfected BECs but not in AC-3 KD BECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g005">Figure 5</xref>C), indicating that the AC-3&#x02013;mediated elevation in intracellular cAMP was regulating the IL-6 response at the transcriptional level. It is pertinent to also note the time frame of when these assays were undertaken. Here, mRNA for IL-6 was detected in control-transfected BECs as early as 1 h after exposure to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). Considering that nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B was detectable only after 2 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g005">Figure 5</xref>B), this cAMP-regulated pathway appears to be activated sooner than the classical pathway. Interestingly, when we examined AC-3 KD BECs for IL-6 mRNA 6 h after exposure to <italic>E. coli,</italic> we detected similar amounts of message in AC-3 KD BECs and control-transfected BECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g005">Figure 5</xref>D), indicating that the classical NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;mediated pathway was still functional in AC-3 KD BECs. Thus, the IL-6 response in BECs appears to originate from two distinct pathways: the NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;associated pathway and a separate but speedier pathway involving Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and cAMP. One mechanism through which cAMP may directly affect transcription of IL-6 is by promoting phosphorylation of CREB, which binds to CRE in the IL-6 promoter region &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;.

Upon phosphorylation, CREB promotes the recruitment of various transcriptional co-activators that promote transcription of target genes with consensus sites for CREB, such as IL-6 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. When we examined for CREB phosphorylation in BECs exposed to forskolin and calcium ionophore A23187, two potent elevators of intracellular cAMP, we observed a marked increase in CREB phosphorylation on the Western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g005">Figure 5</xref>E) consistent with the idea that CREB phosphorylation occurred following elevation of intracellular cAMP levels. To see if bacterial exposure also triggered phosphorylation of CREB, CREB protein from extracts of BECs before and after exposure to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> was probed for phosphorylation. Following <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> exposure, we found an appreciable increase in phosphorylation of CREB in non-transfected BECs and control-transfected BECs, but not in AC-3 KD BECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g005">Figure 5</xref>F). To extend these findings, we investigated the binding of CREB to the CRE sites on the IL-6 promoter region. Nuclear extracts of BECs were obtained after 1 h incubation with <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> ORN103(pSH2) and then incubated with the biotinylated oligonucleotides corresponding to CRE on the IL-6 promoter. Binding of CREB to CRE was assessed by a colorimetric assay. We found that CREB bound to CRE oligonucleotides but not to a scrambled oligonucleotide sequence of identical length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g005">Figure 5</xref>G). Thus, cAMP appears to be modulating IL-6 responses through the binding of the phosphorylated transcriptional factor CREB to the CRE site on the IL-6 promoter region.</p><p>Since there are other inflammatory mediators such as IL-1&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-8 with consensus CRE sites in their promoter region that have known to be activated during urinary tract infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;, we examined whether production of any of these mediators was modulated by the cAMP/CREB pathway following exposure to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>.

We found that mRNA levels for IL-8 but not IL-1&#x003b1; or IL-1&#x003b2; appeared to be regulated by the TLR4/cAMP/CREB pathway. Thus, in addition to IL-6, production of IL-8 by BECs appears to be under the regulation of the novel signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>The IL-6 Response to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> of BECs Is the Product of Two Separate Signaling Pathways</title><p>Based on the evaluation of transcriptional messages, the IL-6 response of BECs is mediated by two separate signaling pathways with different expression kinetics.

At the later incubation periods, the contribution of this novel pathway to the IL-6 response is superseded by the traditional NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;mediated pathway. Evidence for the involvement of &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;<sub>i</sub> in the early BEC IL-6 response comes from the finding that a flux in &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;<sub>i</sub> was observed within a minute of exposure to <italic>E. coli,</italic> and inhibiting this flux with Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channel inhibitors or &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;<sub>i</sub> chelators inhibited the IL-6 response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Since a general inducer of calcium influx such as ionophore A23187 was able to induce IL-6 production from BECs even in the absence of <italic>E. coli,</italic> increase in &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;<sub>i</sub> appears sufficient to trigger the IL-6 response from BECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Evidence for the role of cAMP in the IL-6 response comes from the finding that the IL-6 response to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> was closely associated with a 3-fold increase in intracellular levels of cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). In addition, inhibition of cAMP-generating ACs significantly reduced the IL-6 response of BECs to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). As with the &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;<sub>i</sub> flux, merely enhancing intracellular levels of cAMP with a membrane-permeable cAMP analog induced significant IL-6 release from BECs even in the absence of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Thus, the two secondary messengers are sufficient, as well as necessary, for the early IL-6 secretion in BECs.</p><p>That Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> response preceded the cAMP production following bacterial stimulation was deduced from the findings that (i) the earliest detectable increase in intracellular cAMP levels was observed 15 min following exposure to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> (unpublished data), whereas Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> responses could be seen within a minute of bacterial exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), and (ii) the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> flux following exposure to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> remained largely unaffected in AC-3 KD BECs, while the cAMP response was abrogated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g004">Figure 4</xref>I). Since enhancement of intracellular cAMP specifically required an increase in &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;<sub>i</sub>, we suspected that a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-inducible form of AC was responsible. BECs were found to express mRNA for AC-3, AC-4, AC-6, and AC-7, but only RNAi KD of AC-3, a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-inducible AC isoform, inhibited <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>&#x02013;induced intracellular cAMP production and subsequent IL-6 expression.</p><p>To identify where in the signaling cascade cAMP was exerting its effects, we compared IL-6 message levels in control and AC-3 KD BECs. The absence of IL-6 message in AC-3 KD BECs after 1 h of exposure to bacteria suggested that cAMP was regulating IL-6 production at the transcriptional level rather than at the levels of translation or cytokine secretion. Since translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B into the nucleus of BECs following exposure to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> was largely unaffected in the AC-3 KD BECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g005">Figure 5</xref>B), cAMP may not be exerting its effect through altering NF-&#x003ba;B. Interestingly, one way that cAMP can directly promote expression of certain genes is to activate PKA, which translocates to the nucleus, where it phophorylates the transcriptional factor CREB &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Upon phosphorylation, CREB is believed to promote transcription of a number of genes, including IL-6, IL-8, IL-1&#x003b1;, and IL-1&#x003b2;, which possess consensus CRE sites on their promoter region &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b051">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, in BECs, only IL-6 and IL-8 appear to be regulated by the cAMP/CREB pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g005">Figure 5</xref>). That cAMP was modulating phosphorylation of CREB was evident from CREB phosphorylation in control BECs following exposure to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> but not in AC-3 KD BECs. Thus, taken together, our cumulative data reveal the existence of a distinct TLR4-activated signaling pathway in BECs involving Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, cAMP, and phosphorylated CREB. A diagrammatic representation of the proposed TLR4-initiated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-, cAMP- and CREB-dependent pathway, as well as the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway in BECs, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g008">Figure 8</xref>. Although in the figure we have indicated that the cAMP/CREB pathway in BECs is activated by TLR4, our data also suggest that TLR2 and TLR3 activation may also trigger this pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g006">Figure 6</xref>E).</p><p>Our analysis of the kinetics of IL-6 secretion in WT and AC-3 KD BECs has revealed that this novel second messenger/CREB-mediated pathway is mediating a faster IL-6 response than the classical NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;mediated pathway. Following exposure of BECs to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> ORN103(pSH2), marked phosphorylation of CREB was observed at least 1 h before nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B was evident. Indeed, the earliest evidence of nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B in BECs following exposure to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> was at 2 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Another piece of evidence implicating the second messenger/CREB pathway in a rapid and distinct IL-6 response was the observation that a message for IL-6 was detectable in control BECs 1 h following exposure to <italic>E. coli,</italic> whereas no message for IL-6 was seen in AC-3 KD BECs. However, by 6 h after the classical NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathways had been activated, there was very little difference in the amounts of mRNA in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). Consistent with this finding, the kinetics of IL-6 secretion by WT BECs and AC-3 KD BECs following exposure to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> ORN103(pSH2) revealed a 3-h lag in the latter's response, but by 12 h the amounts of IL-6 secreted were comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). Thus, the rapid and vigorous inflammatory responses to infection typically observed in the urinary tract may be attributable, at least in part, to this distinct cAMP-dependent signaling pathway. The relevance of the early IL-6 response by BECs may be linked to their role as first responders. One of the primary cell types in the urinary tract reacting to BEC-generated IL-6 are also BECs. These cells possess IL-6 receptors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d; and this cytokine, acting in autocrine fashion, may trigger various antimicrobial responses, such as production of antimicrobial peptides &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d; and mucins, &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d; as well as promote exfoliation of infected BECs.</p><p>The existence of multiple pathways in BECs for triggering IL-6 responses could be an adaptation to avoid inactivation by UPEC. Several recent studies have suggested that host-adapted pathogens possess the intrinsic capacity to block NF-&#x003ba;B activation in macrophages and cultured human epithelial cells through release of toxins or proteases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b057">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;. Hunstad et al. have recently identified several genes <italic>(rfa, rfb,</italic> and <italic>surA)</italic> in UPEC that contribute to suppressing the cytokine responses of BECs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Our observations that primary BECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g007">Figure 7</xref>) evoked a more modest IL-6 response to clinical UPEC CI5 compared to the laboratory <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> strain and that the cAMP/CREB&#x02013;mediated IL-6 response to UPEC CI5 in BEC lines was not striking compared to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> ORN103(pSH2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g006">Figure 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030060-g006">6</xref>B) could be manifestations of this phenomenon. Conceivably, depending on the nature of the BECs, the UPEC CI5 strain is able to partially diminish one or both of the two TLR4-mediated signaling pathways leading to IL-6 secretion.</p><p>Finally, because of the rapid emergence of multi-resistance among UPEC isolates, there is mounting interest in the development of alternate antimicrobial strategies. One approach is to bolster innate immune defenses in the urinary tract either before or during infection. In this regard, our finding that small molecule enhancers of intracellular levels of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and cAMP are sufficient to trigger early and vigorous cytokine responses from BECs is of interest. There are available many compounds capable of modulating the intracellular levels of both Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and cAMP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b061">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030060-b063">63</xref>&#x0005d;. Judicious application of some of these agents for the treatment and prevention of urinary tract infections is a possibility that will require further examination.</p></sec><sec
