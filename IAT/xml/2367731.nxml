H3t is robustly expressed in the testis, and thus was assigned as the testis-specific H3 variant. However, recent proteomics and tissue-specific RT-PCR experiments revealed a small amount of H3t expression in somatic cells. In the present study, we purified human H3t as a recombinant protein, and showed that H3t/H4 forms nucleosomes with H2A/H2B by the salt-dialysis method, like the conventional H3.1/H4. We found that H3t/H4 is not efficiently incorporated into the nucleosome by human Nap1 (hNap1), due to its defective H3t/H4 deposition on DNA. In contrast, human Nap2 (hNap2), a paralog of hNap1, promotes nucleosome assembly with H3t/H4. Mutational analyses revealed that the Ala111 residue, which is conserved among H3.1, H3.2 and H3.3, but not in H3t, is the essential residue for the hNap1-mediated nucleosome assembly. These results suggest that H3t may be incorporated into chromatin by a specific chaperone-mediated pathway.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In eukaryotes, the huge amount of genomic DNA is compacted into the nucleus by the chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The nucleosome is the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin, and is composed of a histone octamer and a 146 base-pair DNA, which is wrapped 1.7 times around the histone octamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The histone octamer contains two each of the core histones, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. In the nucleosome, the core histones are composed of flexible N- and/or C-terminal tails and the globular domain, which contains the histone fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The histone-fold domain is involved in the formation of dimers between histones H2A and H2B (H2A/H2B), and between histones H3 and H4 (H3/H4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>Three non-allelic isoforms of histone H3, H3.1, H3.2 and H3.3, have been identified in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), in addition to the centromere-specific H3 homolog, CENP-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). These four H3 variants increase the diversity of nucleosomes, and are considered to have distinct functions in the organization of chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>). H3.1 and H3.2 are expressed at S phase, and are incorporated into chromatin in a replication-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). On the other hand, H3.3 is constitutively expressed, and is incorporated into transcriptionally active chromatin regions in a replication-independent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Histone H3t was found as the testis-specific H3 variant in mammals, and it may play an important role in the chromatin reorganization required for spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15">13&#x02013;15</xref>).</p><p>Comprehensive proteome analyses revealed the presence of H3t in the nucleoli of HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). This finding suggested that H3t may also function in somatic cells, or that it may be expressed due to an extensive modification of the chromatin structure leading to malignant transformation. In addition, an RT-PCR experiment revealed H3t expression in the brain and in embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). However, the nucleosomes containing H3t probably comprise only a small proportion of the bulk chromatin in somatic cells, if H3t is present. Therefore, the mechanisms controlling the assembly and function of H3t in chromatin have not been elucidated.</p><p>The incorporation of histone variants into chromatin is mediated by histone chaperones. In human cells, the H3.1 and H3.3 variants reportedly form large pre-assembled complexes including the histone chaperones CAF1 and HIRA, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). CAF1 and HIRA are known to be required for the DNA-synthesis-dependent and -independent nucleosome assembly pathways, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), suggesting their specific functions in H3.1 and H3.3 incorporation into nucleosomes. Consistently, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, H3.3 is deposited throughout the chromosomes except at the centromeres, in a DNA-synthesis-independent manner, whereas the conventional H3 was excluded from the DNA-synthesis-independent nucleosome-assembly pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Therefore, the specific histone-chaperone activity may be required for nucleosome assembly with the specific H3 variant.</p><p>Nucleosome assembly protein 1, Nap1, is a prominent histone chaperone, which facilitates nucleosome assembly <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Nap1 reportedly interacts with H2A/H2B <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23 B24 B25">23&#x02013;25</xref>), suggesting that it functions as the histone chaperone for H2A/H2B. However, biochemical studies indicated that Nap1 prefers to bind H3/H4 in the presence of all four core histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27 B28">26&#x02013;28</xref>). Consistently, Nap1 has the potential to alter the H3/H4 dimer&#x02013;tetramer equilibrium within the tetramer nucleosomes (tetrasome) without H2A/H2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). These facts suggest that Nap1 also functions for H3/H4. On the other hand, Nap2 (hNap2), which shares about 60% amino acid sequence identity with hNap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), has been identified in humans, and may also function as a histone chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we purified human H3t as a recombinant protein, and established a method for the preparation of the H3t/H4 complex. We also purified hNap1 and hNap2, and tested their nucleosome-formation activities with H3t/H4 <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Overexpression of recombinant human histones</title><p>Human H2A, H2B, H3.1 and H4 were overexpressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells as N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tagged proteins, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).

The N-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tags were removed from the H2A/H2B and H3/H4 complexes by thrombin protease treatment (1 unit/mg of histones, GE Healthcare Biosciences) at room temperature for 3 h. The removal of the His<sub>6</sub> tags was confirmed by SDS-16% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE); the recombinant histones without the His<sub>6</sub> tag migrated faster than the His<sub>6</sub>-tagged histones.

In the present study, we established a method for the reconstitution of H3t/H4, and showed that H3t/H4 is proficient in nucleosome formation with H2A/H2B by the salt-dialysis method. However, we found that H3t/H4 is not efficiently incorporated into nucleosomes by hNap1, which is a prominent nucleosome assembly protein in eukaryotes. H3t is the only H3 variant defective in the hNap1-mediated nucleosome assembly <italic>in vitro</italic>, because hNap1 promoted nucleosome assembly with other H3 variants, H3.2, H3.3 and CENP-A, in addition to H3.1, under our experimental conditions (data not shown). To form nucleosomes, Nap1 must deposit H3/H4 on DNA prior to the H2A/H2B deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Our results showed that hNap1 deposits H3t/H4 less efficiently than H3.1/H4 on DNA. Therefore, the defects in the H3t-containing nucleosome formation by hNap1 may be due to this inefficient H3t/H4 deposition. On the other hand, we found that hNap1 bound to H3.1/H4 with higher affinity than to H3t/H4, although the hNap1-H3.1/H4 complex is less stable than the hNap1-H3t/H4 complex in the presence of DNA. One possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that the hNap1-H3.1/H4 complex may have a more suitable conformation for the H3/H4 deposition than the hNap1-H3t/H4 complex. Further studies are required to clarify this issue.</p><p>Intriguingly, hNap2, which shares &#x0223c;60% amino acid sequence identity with hNap1, catalyzes the formation of H3t-containing nucleosomes <italic>in vitro</italic>. This finding suggests that the formation of the H3t-containing nucleosome may require a specific histone chaperone. hNap2 expression is reportedly three-fold higher in the testis, as compared to that in other somatic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), implying that it may have a specific function in chromatin reorganization during meiosis and/or the post-meiotic maturation of male germ cells. In germ cells, drastic chromatin reorganization, including the process of histone replacement by histone variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), occurs in association with meiotic events, such as homologous recombination, synaptonemal complex formation and chromosome segregation. After meiosis, the histones are finally replaced by protamines during sperminogenesis. To promote this post-meiotic maturation of male haploid germ cells, chromatin reorganization by the testis-specific histone variants may also be an essential process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). It is intriguing to study how histone chaperones contribute to such global chromatin remodeling with histone variants during and after meiosis.</p><p>Our mutational analyses with recombinant H3 also revealed that the Ala111 residue of the conventional H3.1 plays an essential role in the hNap1-mediated nucleosome formation. H3t, which does not participate in hNap1-mediated nucleosome assembly, has a Val residue at position 111. Although the molecular mechanism by which the H3t-Val111 residue inhibits the hNap1-mediated nucleosome formation has not been elucidated, our results indicate the functional importance of residue 111 in the chaperone-mediated nucleosome assembly. In the crystal structure of the human nucleosome core particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), the &#x003b2;-CH<sub>3</sub> group of the Ala111 residue of H3.1 is located close to the side chain of the Arg116 residue, which forms hydrogen bonds with the Asp123 residue within the H3.1 monomer. The Val residue includes two &#x003b3;-CH<sub>3</sub> groups, which do not exist in the Ala residue, and these additional masses at position 111 in H3t may cause a steric clash with Arg116. A mutation of the Arg116 residue, known as the Sin2 mutation, alleviates the transcriptional defects due to the inactivation of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). An <italic>in vitro</italic> study revealed that the Arg116 mutation of H3 decreased the stability of the nucleosome core particle, and increased the nucleosome-sliding rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). These facts indicate that the Arg116 residue, which may sterically clash with the Val111 residue in the H3t-containing nucleosome, is important for the nucleosome structure. Therefore, the naturally occurring A111V substitution in H3t probably affects its tertiary structure, resulting in a hNap1-H3t/H4 complex that is less competent for nucleosome assembly. Structural studies of the H3t-containing nucleosome may be required to understand the molecular basis of H3t discrimination by hNap1.</p><p>H3t expression was also found in somatic cells. A proteome analysis revealed that H3t exists in the nucleoli of HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The H3t mRNA was also detected in cells from brain and embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). However, nucleosomes containing H3t may comprise only a small proportion of the bulk chromatin in somatic cells, because H3t expression in somatic cells was drastically lower than that in testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). This makes the study of endogenous H3t in somatic cells difficult. Hence, our <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses with the purified histones and histone chaperones provide useful new information related to the chaperone-mediated nucleosome assembly of H3 variants.</p><p>In the present study, we showed that hNap1 discriminates H3t in nucleosome formation. hNap1 reportedly mediated the assembly and disassembly of H2A.Bbd, a histone H2A variant, more efficiently with nucleosomes containing H3.3 than with those containing the conventional H3.1 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). These facts suggest that hNap1 functions as a chromatin remodeling factor at distinct chromosome regions, where specific histone variants are located, and may regulate gene expression by its chromatin remodeling activity. Interestingly, the Nap1 deletion in yeast leads to up- and down-regulation of about 10% of all open reading frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). These transcriptional regulation changes in the Nap1-deletion strain may be associated with an altered chromatin structure, in which promoter activation and transcription elongation through the nucleosomal DNA may be perturbed in the absence of Nap1. Consistently, Nap1 stimulates transcription factor binding to DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), and co-localizes in promoter regions with the CHD (chromo-helicase/ATPase DNA binding) remodeling factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>), supporting the idea that Nap1 is involved in transcription processes. In addition, Nap1 reportedly associates with transcriptional regulators, such as p300/CBP and Alien (a potential co-repressor of the vitamin D receptor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>).
