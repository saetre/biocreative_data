A novel quality of a highly repetitive mouse DNA sequence is described which points to a functional role: All copies (approximately 50,000 per haploid genome) of this DNA sequence reside on genomic Alu I DNA fragments each associated with nuclear polypeptides that are not released from DNA by proteinase K, SDS and phenol extraction. By this quality the repetitive DNA sequence is classified as a member of the sub-set of DNA sequences involved in tight DNA-polypeptide complexes which have been previously shown to be components of the subnuclear structure termed 'nuclear matrix'. From these results it has to be concluded that the repetitive DNA sequence characterized in this report represents or comprises a signal for a large number of site specific attachment points of the mouse genome in the nuclear matrix.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0157-a" xlink:role="8354"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0158-a" xlink:role="8355"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0154.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8351"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0155.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8352"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0156.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8353"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0157.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8354"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0158.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8355"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0159.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8356"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0160.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8357"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0161.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8358"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0162.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8359"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00159-0163.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8360"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
