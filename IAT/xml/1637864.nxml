Groups of 20 male mice were exposed by gavage for 6 months to the vascular carcinogen urethane at 1, 10, or 100 mg/kg body weight/day. Wild-type and heterozygous p53 knockout control groups were exposed by gavage to the vehicle alone. Another group of 20 male mice received d-limonene by gavage (d-limonene is noncarcinogenic in mice). The high dose of urethane caused early mortality in the majority of mice associated with histopathologic evidence of toxicity and tumors, including a high incidence of benign and malignant vascular tumors, in all animals. At the intermediate dose, toxicity was less marked and 3 of 20 mice had tumors; mice that received the low dose did not have signs of toxicity or neoplasia. The two control groups had no tumors and the d-limonene group had one tumor of the prostate, which was considered spontaneous. We conclude that the p53 knockout mouse is a useful tool for investigating vascular tumorogenesis.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00302-0094-a" xlink:role="62"/></fig><fig id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00302-0096-a" xlink:role="64"/></fig><fig id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00302-0096-b" xlink:role="64"/></fig><fig id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00302-0096-c" xlink:role="64"/></fig><fig id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00302-0096-d" xlink:role="64"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="envhper00302-0093.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="61" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00302-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="62" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00302-0095.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="63" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00302-0096.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="64" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00302-0097.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="65" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
