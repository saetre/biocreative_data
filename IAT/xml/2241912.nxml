MLE is presumably involved in incorporating the non-coding <italic>roX</italic> RNA into the dosage compensation complex (DCC), which is an essential but poorly understood requirement for faithful targeting of the complex to the X chromosome. Sequence comparison predicts several RNA-binding domains in MLE but their properties have not been experimentally verified. We evaluated the RNA-binding characteristics of these conserved motifs and their contributions to RNA-stimulated ATPase activity, to helicase activity, as well as to the targeting of MLE to the nucleus and to the X chromosome territory. We find that RB2 is the dominant, conditional RNA-binding module, which is indispensable for ATPase and helicase activity whereas the N-terminal RB1 motif does not bind RNA, but is involved in targeting MLE to the X chromosome. The C-terminal domain containing a glycine-rich heptad repeat adds potential dimerization and RNA-binding surfaces which are not required for helicase activity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The gene that encodes the RNA helicase <italic>maleless</italic> (MLE) was originally discovered in a screen for male-specific lethal mutations that revealed genes crucial for dosage compensation in male <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). This system serves to increase the transcription from the single X chromosome in male fruit flies to match the cumulative expression from the two female X chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4">2&#x02013;4</xref>). Failure of this activation of transcription in the 2-fold range is lethal for male flies. The function of MLE in dosage compensation is not known but it is presumably involved in mediating the effects of two non-coding <italic>roX</italic> (<italic>RNA-on-the-X</italic>) RNAs, <italic>roX1</italic> and <italic>roX2</italic>, which are obligatory for dosage compensation. These two RNAs reside in a regulatory ribonucleoprotein complex, the dosage compensation complex (DCC; also known as Male-specific lethal or MSL complex). The DCC presumably first assembles at the site of <italic>roX</italic> transcription, from which it distributes to associate with many sites on the X chromosome, most prominently the coding regions of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In the absence of <italic>roX</italic> the MSL proteins will only bind to a reduced number of sites on the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>So far, three proteins of the DCC are known to interact with RNA: the histone acetyltransferase MOF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), male-specific lethal-3 (MSL3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and MLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Since MLE is maternally provided to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> egg, it is the first protein to interact with and to stabilize the <italic>roX1</italic> RNA, which is transcribed 2 h after egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In the absence of MLE, <italic>roX</italic> RNA is not incorporated into the DCC and can only be seen at the site of transcription in polytene chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The ATPase/helicase activity of MLE is required for its function in dosage compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Recently, Lucchesi and colleagues generated mutations in MLE that separate ATPase and helicase activities and found that the ATPase activity was sufficient for MLE's role in transcriptional activation, whereas the helicase activity is necessary for the spreading of the complex along the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). <italic>roX</italic> RNA may play a transient role in targeting the DCC to the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), which suggests that its interaction with the complex is dynamic. Accordingly, MLE is not an integral member of the DCC, but peripherally associated, which leads to its loss during purification of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>Although it is usually assumed that <italic>roX</italic> RNAs are the crucial targets of MLE, this has not been confirmed. In fact, MLE has roles outside dosage compensation that are not reflected by the male-specific lethal phenotype of its loss-of-function mutant. One particular temperature sensitive (ts) <italic>MLE</italic> allele, <italic>MLE<sup>napts</sup></italic> (nap stands for &#x02018;no action potential&#x02019;), is characterized by a reduced expression of the <italic>para</italic> gene, which encodes a Na<sup>+</sup> channel of the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The data are consistent with the idea that the MLE helicase activity is required to unwind a secondary structure of the <italic>para</italic> primary transcript to permit faithful splicing. Other possibilities should not be excluded since RNA helicase A (RHA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), the MLE ortholog in vertebrates, has been implicated in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including transcription, processing and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Most recently, RHA was shown to be involved in the loading of small interfering RNAs (siRNA) into RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Following the idea that dosage compensation mechanisms adapt components of other nuclear processes to fine-tuning chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) leads to speculations that MLE activity may affect the secondary structure of <italic>roX</italic> RNAs to facilitate productive interactions with the MSL proteins.</p><p>Currently, all our knowledge about MLE as an enzyme stems from the pioneering study of Lee <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) who documented that recombinant MLE has ATPase and helicase activities and binds single-stranded nucleic acids. In the current work we extended the biochemical analysis significantly, by subjecting MLE to a thorough structure-function analysis, which clarified the domain requirements for RNA interaction, helicase activity and localization to the X chromosomal territory. In addition we analyzed the effects of nucleotides on RNA-binding as a first step towards a mechanistic understanding of the nucleotide cycle of MLE's helicase activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Monoclonal anti-MLE antibodies</title><p>The NcoI/HindIII DNA fragment, corresponding to the first 265 amino acids (aa) of MLE was cloned from the pBB-6X-HisMLE (a gift from M.

In keeping with their proposed RNA-binding function they are positively charged at neutral pH, with pIs of 9.6 and 10.0 for RB1 and RB2, respectively. A further feature is a 9-fold imperfect repetition of the sequence GGGYGNN in the C-terminus of MLE (&#x02018;G&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), where a tyrosine occupies every seventh position within the repeat (Supplementary Figure 2). Such a pseudo-heptad arrangement could indicate an amphipatic helix, with a hydrophobic surface that may be employed in interactions. The C-terminus of MLE (from aa 1163 onwards) has an overall pI of 11.0 and hence is a strong candidate for an RNA-binding domain.</p><p>In order to experimentally evaluate the RNA-binding potential of these domains we expressed tagged versions of RB1, RB2, a fragment consisting of RB1 and RB2, as well as the glycine-rich C-terminus in insect cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) and purified them to apparent homogeneity using tag affinity chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, insert). Since any complex RNA consists of single- (ss) and double-stranded (ds) RNA segments we characterized the interaction of the isolated MLE domains with both types of substrates. Although the RNA substrates we tested were derived from roX2 RNA the interaction with these substrates under our conditions was non-specific [electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) data not shown]. In order to produce a truly ssRNA substrate we amplified a 75 bp piece of roX2 cDNA which was predicted not to form any secondary structure when transcribed into RNA (see Methods section). The PCR product was transcribed with radiolabeled nucleotide precursors to produce ssRNA. Annealing of this RNA with unlabeled complementary RNA, transcribed from the other strand of the DNA template, yielded a substrate with a dsRNA core (dsRNA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). The ss and ds RNAs can be separated by gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>C, 2C lanes &#x02018;ss&#x02019;, &#x02018;ds&#x02019;) and were used for EMSA. We observed robust binding of RB2, yielding a continuum of complexes with ssRNA as well as dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Surprisingly, RB1 bound either RNA substrate much worse than RB2. Both domains together were only slightly more efficient in the EMSA than RB2 alone, pointing to a very small contribution of RB1 to RNA interactions in this context. The G-rich C-terminus proved to be the best binder and yielded a well-defined complex with both RNA substrates.</p><p>In light of the poor RNA interaction of RB1 we were concerned that EMSA was too stringent to reveal all RNA interaction potential. We therefore employed filter-binding as a second assay. The different MLE domains were allowed to bind radiolabeled dsRNA and the reactions were then filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane with an underlying positively charged nylon membrane. In the absence of protein dsRNA runs through the nitrocellulose membrane and is retained on the nylon. Proteins, however, bind to nitrocellulose and trap associated RNA on this layer of the blot. The percentage of input dsRNA retained on the nitrocellulose membrane was calculated and plotted after subtraction of background from control samples prepared in the absence of proteins. The filter-binding assay essentially confirmed the poor RNA-binding potential of RB1 relative to RB2 and the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D).</p><p>In order to assess the functions of these domains in the context of full length MLE we generated a series of MLE derivatives in which individual domains were deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). These proteins were subjected to the same RNA-binding assays and showed a much stronger RNA-binding capacity, since binding is observed at a stoichiometry of about 1:1 (as compared to 50&#x02013;100 fold excess used for the isolated domains). Binding of intact MLE to dsRNA yielded two retarded bands, which we interpret as one and two molecules of MLE interacting with the RNA, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Interaction of MLE with ssRNA led to a clearly defined ssRNA&#x02013;MLE complex as well as a smear of retarded bands, conceivably due to heterogeneity of RNA conformations. Inactivating the ATPase of MLE by converting lysine 413 to glutamic acid (K413E) (MLE<sup>GET</sup>) led to a slight reduction of dsRNA-binding, in line with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In agreement with the poor RNA interaction potential of RB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), deletion of the N-terminal RB1 motif did not affect binding to either substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). To our surprise we found that deleting the G-rich C-terminus improved the interaction of MLE with dsRNA slightly, but led to a much better definition of the MLE&#x02013;ssRNA complex. Obviously, although this fragment can interact with RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), it does not provide the dominant interaction surface in the context of MLE in EMSA. Deletion of RB1 was also neutral in the context of the C-terminal truncation (Supplementary Figure 3). The dominant RNA recognition motif of the enzyme was revealed by the deletion of RB2, which essentially abolished all RNA-binding activity of MLE under those conditions. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Binding of MLE and MLE derivatives to dsRNA and ssRNA.

In this assay, an MLE derivative lacking the RB2 domain still showed significant dsRNA-binding, which may be due to the C-terminal domain and the central helicase domain itself, which is known to contact RNA in the context of other helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). We conclude that EMSA mainly reveals the strong RNA interaction of RB2, but other domains, such as the helicase domain and the C-terminus, contribute to RNA interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of nucleotides on RNA interactions</title><p>Previously, Lee and Hurwitz have analyzed the effect of ATP on the interactions of MLE with ssRNA and did not observe a major effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). We have now explored how the presence of ATP, ADP, AMP-PNP, AMP-PCP or the slow-hydrolyzing derivative ATP&#x003b3;S affect the interaction of MLE with dsRNA. The incubation of the enzyme with RNA in the presence of nucleotide was on ice in order to limit the unwinding of dsRNA in the presence of ATP. The MLE&#x02013;RNA complexes were assayed by EMSA as well as filter-binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Under our conditions some ATP hydrolysis and hence helicase activity still occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, upper panel, ATP-lanes).

There is a trend for MLE derivatives to bind RNA better in the presence of non-hydrolysable ATP analogs. Conceivably, the RNA interactions are promoted by ATP-binding. However, MLE also binds RNA well in the presence of ADP. The MLE<sup>GET</sup> mutant is largely unaffected by the presence of nucleotides presumably because the mutant enzyme binds nucleotides with much reduced affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of the RNA substrate on ATPase activity</title><p>The ATPase activity of RHA and MLE is strongly stimulated by RNA, but the effect of ssRNA and dsRNA have not been compared so far. We also wished to establish whether any of the domains, besides RB2, was particularly involved in transmitting the RNA signal to the ATPase domain. We did not detect significant ATPase activity of MLE<sup>&#x00394;RB2</sup> (data not shown), which is explained by the fact that RB2 is the major RNA interaction domain. Deleting the N-terminal RB1 (&#x00394;RB1) or the C-terminus including the G-rich domain (&#x00394;G) did not affect the robust, concentration-dependent stimulation of the ATPase activity by dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, upper panel). Interestingly, deletion of the C-terminus selectively reduced the ATPase stimulation by ssRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, B, lower panels). Combining N- and C-terminal deletions again did not affect dsRNA stimulation but selectively reduced the stimulatory effect of ssRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Analysis of MLE<sup>&#x00394;G</sup> thus shows that RNA-binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) and ATPase stimulation need not necessarily correlate. A very stable interaction as observed by EMSA may indicate structural rigidity that does not support extensive ATPase cycles. Deletion of the C-terminus renders the enzyme differentially sensitive towards a potential helicase substrate (dsRNA) versus the product of a helicase reaction (ssRNA). <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Stimulation of MLE ATPase activity by RNA.

The radiolabeled single strand that is freed by the unwinding reaction is clearly separated from the dsRNA on a polyacrylamide gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). In the absence of ATP no unwinding was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, B, lanes 2&#x02013;5). Catalytic amounts of full length MLE efficiently unwound the dsRNA substrate and this process was unaffected by deletion of the RB1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 6&#x02013;13). Deletion of the glycine-rich C-terminus, alone or in combination with RB1, led to a striking increase in helicase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 14&#x02013;17, 5B, lanes 9&#x02013;14), demonstrating that the ssRNA-binding activity of the C-terminus is not required for optimal unwinding, but conceivably for regulation of the appropriate enzyme activity in a more physiological context. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Contributions of MLE domains to helicase activity.

It has previously been suggested that monomeric helicases are characterized by multiple RNA-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), however, our analysis shows that the predicted RB1 and the G-rich C-terminus are dispensable for helicase activity. Native and recombinant RHA migrate as monomeric enzymes on glycerol gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). However, dimers may form transiently and conditionally. For example, the HCV helicase NS3 is a model for monomeric helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), yet an oligomeric state was evidenced by crosslinking and has been suggested to be of functional importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). We subjected recombinant full length MLE to glycerol gradient sedimentation and observed a single peak of migration around 140&#x02013;160 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A), which suggests that MLE is predominantly monomeric in solution and confirms earlier results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Addition of various RNAs (total cellular RNA, ss/ds EMSA probes) did not change this migration behavior. However, we cannot exclude that dimerization might be promoted by a very specific RNA substrate. In order to monitor more transient interactions we coinfected Sf9 cells with viruses expressing His<sub>6</sub>-MLE and various flag-tagged MLE derivatives. We monitored the expression of each derivative by western blot analysis of total extracts from infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, &#x02018;input&#x02019;). Flag-tagged MLE derivatives were retrieved from the extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, &#x02018;pull down&#x02019;, centre and bottom panel) and probing for the his-tag revealed associated His<sub>6</sub>-MLE. This experiment documented an interaction between two differently tagged MLE proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lane 8). Deletion of RB1 did not affect this interaction and deletion of RB2 diminished the binding to some extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lane 9). However, deleting the C-terminus (from aa 1163 onwards) abolished the interaction entirely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lane 11). A C-terminal fragment containing the glycine-rich heptad repeats was able to pull down full length MLE very efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B), which revealed a potential for this peptide in MLE dimerization. However, MLE<sup>&#x00394;G</sup> is a very efficient helicase <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), thus we conclude that for mechanistic considerations MLE should be treated as a monomeric helicase.

In order to see which of the RNA-binding domains analyzed in this study were involved in X chromosome targeting, we transiently expressed MLE derivatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A) with C-terminal Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) fusions in male SF4 cells. Successful targeting to the X chromosome was concluded from co-localization with the MSL1 marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). For each fusion protein at least 50 nuclei of MLE expressing cells were analyzed. Clear and selective X chromosomal staining was scored as positive (&#x02018;+&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B), whereas a clear enrichment of GFP at sites of MSL1-binding over a diffuse nuclear staining was scored as intermediate (&#x02018;+/&#x02212;&#x02018;in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). Examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A. MLE-GFP fusion protein localized to the X chromosomal territory with a pattern very similar to endogenous MLE (data not shown). 73% of all nuclei showed an enrichment of the protein on the X chromosome. Inactivating the ATPase activity of MLE (MLE<sup>GET</sup>) led to a reduced X chromosomal targeting of the fusion protein. This is in agreement with the observations of Lee <italic>et al</italic>. who found that MLE<sup>GET</sup> bound fewer sites on X chromosomes and an increased number of autosomal sites in transgenic flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Surprisingly, MLE<sup>&#x00394;RB1</sup> failed to be efficiently targeted to the X chromosome. Considering that the RNA-binding and helicase activities of this protein were similar to wild type MLE, this suggests that RNA interactions are not the only targeting principles. However, RNA interactions are required for X chromosomal recognition, since deletion of RB2 abolished all recruitment activity. MLE<sup>&#x00394;G</sup> was found exclusively in the cytoplasm. This may be explained by the fact that the deletion removed a sequence preceding the G-rich heptad repeats that harbors a candidate nuclear localization sequence (NLS Supplementary Figure 2), which has been recently mapped in the context of RHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). We confirmed the presence of an NLS in this fragment of MLE by expression of the C-terminal fragment (&#x02018;G&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) fused to GFP in SF4 cells (&#x02018;G&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). As expected the fusion protein was nuclear, but did not localize to the X chromosome. Lastly, we furnished the MLE<sup>&#x00394;G</sup> with a heterologous, SV40-derived NLS. The fusion protein became nuclear by this NLS and localized to the X chromosome with an intermediate efficiency, similar to that of the MLE<sup>GET</sup> mutant. In summary, this experiment showed that the two N-terminal RB domains contribute to X chromosome targeting. Targeting via RB2 may involve RNA interactions, since RB2 provides the dominant RNA interaction surface. RB1, however, which does not bind RNA, must contribute to targeting by other types of interactions. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><italic>In vivo</italic> localization of MLE and MLE derivatives.

Little is known about the role of MLE in dosage compensation, although the available evidence suggests that its substrates are the long, non-coding <italic>roX</italic> RNAs, which may need to be reorganized for incorporation into productive DCCs. Whether this reorganization involves unwinding inappropriate secondary structures or destabilization of unwanted protein&#x02013;RNA interactions is unknown. A prerequisite to understanding MLE's function is knowledge about the properties of its presumed RNA interaction domains, which are predicted from sequence comparison, but have not been characterized so far.</p><sec><title>The role of the N-terminal dsRB motifs</title><p>The N-terminal RB1 and RB2 motifs of MLE are related to a family of RNA-binding domains called dsRBM (double-stranded RNA-binding motifs). Although the name suggests that they interact with dsRNA it has become clear that the term subsumes a variety of related domains with different interaction potential. This includes ssRNA-binding and even protein interactions; for some &#x02018;orphan dsRBMs&#x02019; interactors have not been identified so far [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) and references therein]. We now show that the most N-terminal RBM of MLE (RB1), despite of its basic nature, does not contribute to RNA-binding <italic>in vitro</italic>. At first glance this finding is at odds with the observed RNA-binding potential of the homologous domain in RHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). However, a more resolving analysis revealed that dsRBM1 of RHA by itself is a poor RNA binder and requires the context of a proline-rich segment between RHA aa 73&#x02013;120 to bind nucleic acids, notably DNA in addition to RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). This accessory sequence is not conserved in MLE, which explains the lack of RNA interaction in this context. However, it remains possible that RB1 synergizes with other structures within DCC to interact with nucleic acids. Our observation that deletion of RB1 abolished the targeting of MLE to the X chromosome territory in male cells is consistent with this hypothesis. Whether this targeting involves RNA, DNA or protein interactions remains an interesting subject for future studies.</p><p>In striking contrast to the poor RNA interacting potential of RB1, RB2 provides a dominant nucleic acid interaction surface for MLE. Deletion of RB2 abolishes those RNA interactions that resist the experimental conditions of gel electrophoresis. Notably, RB2 is required for RNA-dependent ATPase and helicase activity of MLE. RB2&#x02013;RNA interactions are therefore an obligatory intermediate of MLE activity. Gibson and Thompson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) have speculated earlier on the importance of dsRB-type accessory RNA interaction domains (i.e. those in addition to the helicase domain) for helicase activity.</p></sec><sec><title>The role of the G-rich C-terminus</title><p>Our studies reveal integration of various functions at the very C-terminus of MLE. This part of MLE is dominated by a 9-fold imperfect repeat of the aa heptad GGGYGNN, which is reminiscent of the wide spread RGG domains that contribute to RNA-binding in many different contexts. This repeat is preceded by a basic sequence that is conserved in vertebrate RHA, where it was shown to function as an NLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Although we have not repeated the fine mapping of the NLS in the context of MLE, our data are consistent with the notion that the homologous sequence (aa 1171&#x02013;1189, Supplementary Figure 2) is also an NLS. Deletion into this sequence (MLE<sup>&#x00394;G</sup>) destroys the nuclear localization of MLE and fusion of the C-terminus targets GFP to the nucleus. There are other examples where the NLS is separable from adjacent G-rich domains, such as the RGG/GAR domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). The basic nature of the NLS may be responsible for the observed RNA interactions <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, these interactions are not required for helicase activity; to the contrary, deletion of the entire C-terminus improves ssRNA interactions and helicase activity of MLE <italic>in vitro</italic>. The C-terminus may thus be engaged in other interactions, including transport factors, and not be available for RNA-binding. Interestingly, we observed that the C-terminus was able to mediate MLE dimerization, which is reminiscent of the glycine-rich GAR domains of hnRNPA1 that enable self-association <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). The regular heptad repeat of a tyrosyl residue may define a hydrophobic interaction surface on a presumed amphipatic helix, which may engage in corresponding interactions. These interactions may play a regulatory role including conditional RNA-binding. In the absence of these regulatory factors the C-terminus may interact with RNA and retard helicase activity, or interfere with ssRNA interactions of the helicase domain. Interestingly, the GGGYGNN heptad is not conserved even in the MLE of <italic>D.pseudoobscura</italic> and <italic>D.virilis</italic> (Supplementary Figure 2), suggesting that <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> MLE may have acquired a novel function. The G-rich domain of vertebrtate RHA is reminiscent of the well-known RGG/GAR domain found in many RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>).

Such a scenario is consistent with its role in <italic>para</italic> splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Conceivably, MLE modifies the secondary structures of the complex <italic>roX</italic> RNA to facilitate the MSL protein interactions that characterize a productive DCC. Currently it is not known whether DCC corresponds to a single homogenous assembly or whether variant configurations exist. Alternate RNA structures, brought about by MLE action, may affect the arrangement and activity of the protein subunits of DCC. Interestingly, certain RNA translocases are able to displace bound protein by tracking along ssRNA, a property that is ideally suited to (re-) organize the conformations of ribonucleoprotein particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).</p><p>The context of DCC defines special circumstances of MLE action. First, MLE must not necessarily be a very processive enzyme in order to elicit its function. Further, its action is likely to be sequence/structure-specific. Identifying its preferred RNA substrate in the long roX RNAs poses a considerable challenge. Finally, although the association of MLE with the remaining DCC is relatively labile, its co-localization with the other MSL proteins on chromosomal target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) suggests that it is a component of DCC.
