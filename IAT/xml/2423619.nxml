This lethal phenotype has generally been attributed to a proliferation defect in the cell cycle phase of G1.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>In the present study, we show that the major cell cycle defect in murine embryonic stem (mES) cells occurs in G2/M. Specifically, knockdown of B-Myb by short-hairpin RNAs results in delayed transit through G2/M, severe mitotic spindle and centrosome defects, and in polyploidy. Moreover, many euploid mES cells that are transiently deficient in B-Myb become aneuploid and can no longer be considered viable. Knockdown of B-Myb in mES cells also decreases Oct4 RNA and protein abundance, while over-expression of B-MYB modestly up-regulates <italic>pou5f1</italic> gene expression. The coordinated changes in B-Myb and Oct4 expression are due, at least partly, to the ability of B-Myb to directly modulate <italic>pou5f1</italic> gene promoter activity in vitro. Ultimately, the loss of B-Myb and associated loss of Oct4 lead to an increase in early markers of differentiation prior to the activation of caspase-mediated programmed cell death.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Appropriate B-Myb expression is critical to the maintenance of chromosomally stable and pluripotent ES cells, but its absence promotes chromosomal instability that results in either aneuploidy or differentiation-associated cell death.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog-2 (<italic>mybl2</italic>) is a member of a multigene family of transcription factors involved in control of cell cycle progression, differentiation and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002478-Oh1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002478-Sala1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. All members of this family, A-MYB, B-MYB (MYBL2) and C-MYB, contain conserved regulatory and transactivation domains that exhibit sequence-specific DNA-binding activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002478-Ness1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>; and in vitro, each protein can bind to the same consensus sequence C/TAACNG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002478-Oh1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. B-MYB is, however, a relatively poor transactivator when compared with either A- or C-Myb.

Although the mechanism responsible for this lethality has generally been attributed to a defect in cell cycle progression through G1, based on studies using a dominant-negative and inducible form of C-Myb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002478-Iwai1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, neither the molecular basis of embryonic lethality nor its function in ES cells has been evaluated. In the present study, we show that B-MYB is required not only for normal ES cell cycle progression but also for correct mitotic spindle formation and maintenance of euploidy. Moreover, knockdown of B-Myb in ES cells promotes either differentiation coupled to apoptosis or generation of aneuploid ES cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>Mybl2</italic> gene products in pre-implantation blastocysts and pluripotent stem cells</title><p>Previous studies have shown that B-Myb is present in mES cells, is required for continued epiblast growth during the post-implantation phase of mouse development, and is necessary for the derivation of mES cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002478-Tanaka1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. We have extended these earlier studies and found that B-MYB proteins are present in pre-implantation embryos at 2- and 4- cell stages, in the morula and in early cavitation stage embryos (not shown). We also detect B-MYB in both the inner cell mass and mural trophectoderm of pre-implantation blastocysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

B) Summary qRT-PCR data showing the relative abundance of B-Myb mRNA among cells and tissues. Data are expressed in heat map form, where color intensity (red) indicates the relative abundance of B-Myb transcripts. Although relatively high expression is seen in proliferating MEFs and adult brain, transcripts are more than 100-fold less than that seen in ES cells. Data for Oct4 and Nanog are included for comparison. C) Transcripts for B-Myb (100 bp), A-Myb (74 bp) and C-Myb (76 bp) were detectable in ES cell lines by PCR, but B-Myb was the most abundant. D) Graphic representation of qRT-PCR analysis of B-Myb transcripts in hES cells (H1), HeLa cells and adult human tissues (heart). Similar to mES cells, B-Myb is highly abundant in hES cells. E) Representative one- and two-dimensional B-Myb immunoblot showing that anti-B-Myb antibodies react with a predicted protein of &#x0223c;95 kDa. F) B-MYB immunostaining is located in the nucleus, but during mitosis, it segregates away from chromatin, suggesting that its binding is dynamic. Data are from mouse lines (R1, D3 and EG-1), where B-Myb immunstaining is shown green (FITC) and nuclear staining (Hoechst) is in blue; and from human H1 ES cells, where immunostaining for B-Myb and Oct4 are shown in green (FITC), and nuclear staining is in red (TOPRO). A magnified view of human ES cells showing the dissociation of B-Myb and Oct4 from the chromatin of mitotic cells is indicated by arrows. G) B-Myb transcripts are transiently down-regulated when ES cells are induced to differentiate by serum (FCS) and LIF withdrawal. H) B-MYB immunostaining is transiently decreased by FCS and LIF withdrwal in D3 and R1 (inset) ES cells. I) The transient decrease in B-MYB proteins observed through immunostaining was quantitatively confirmed by western blotting. In this image, an expanded view of the two-dimensional westerns shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g001">Figure 1E</xref> (dashed boxed region) is shown. When normalized to total protein, the transient loss of B-MYB (two-spots) was highly reproducible (p&#x0003c;0.05) and similar to but more rapid than that observed for B-Myb RNA.

Transcripts to A-Myb and C-Myb were detected in mES and mEG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), but at levels much lower than those found in testes and Sca1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> bone marrow cells, respectively. In contrast, B-Myb was &#x0223c;10- and 5-fold less abundant in testes and Sca1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells than were transcripts to A-Myb and C-Myb, respectively (n&#x02265;3 independent samples). The relative abundance of <italic>myb</italic> family members in these tissues is consistent with the expression data found in the Gene Expression Atlas, thus confirming primer specificity and the presence of A- and C-Myb transcripts in ES cells. Interestingly, the quantity of A-Myb and B-Myb transcripts were similar in trophectoderm (TS) cell lines. Finally, B-Myb transcripts were also prevalent in the human ES cell line H1 and at levels much greater than in normal human adult tissues like heart. Its abundance was, however, only 5&#x02013;10-fold greater on average than that in HeLa cells, which has relatively high levels of B-Myb (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://symatlas.gnf.org/SymAtlas/201710_at">http://symatlas.gnf.org/SymAtlas/201710_at</ext-link> in NCI60 on U133A, gcRMA)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>In mES cells, a band (spot) of 95 kDa was observed for B-MYB on both one- and two-dimensional gel western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). No signal for either A- or C-MYB could however be demonstrated in any ES cell line (R1, D3) examined, thus confirming the preponderance of B-MYB in mES cells. At the cellular level, B-MYB immunostaining was predominantly nuclear and relatively homogeneous in mES and in human ES cells (line H1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Mitotic cells, however, had a unique staining pattern that was characterized by dissociation of B-MYB and OCT4 from the chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g001">Figure 1F</xref>, hBMYB and hOCT4). This latter finding indicates that these transcription factors may be redistributed to the extrachromosomal space during periods of mitosis.</p><p>Notably, induction of mES cell differentiation led to dynamic changes in B-Myb RNA and protein expression, but the timing of change depended on the model of differentiation. The first model that we tested consisted of an aggregation technique where mES cells were dissociated with trypsin and allowed to reaggregate to form embryoid bodies (EB) in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). With this model, B-Myb RNAs were significantly reduced within 48&#x02013;72 hours (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, R1 Cells), and this reduction was slightly earlier than the decrease in Oct4 transcripts. Separately, withdrawal of both fetal calf serum (FCS) and LIF from non-aggregated mES cells led to a significant decrease in B-Myb transcripts within 8 hours of withdrawal. This decrease was transient, because within 24 hours, B-Myb transcripts returned to control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). No significant change in Oct4 transcripts could however be demonstrated during this same time course. At the cellular level, FCS and LIF withdrawal induced a rapid decrease in B-MYB immunostaining in mouse ES cells (D3, R1: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g001">Figure 1H</xref>). The reduction was particularly apparent in D3 ES cells, where loss of staining was observed within 2 hours and prior to any significant change in B-Myb RNA. The greatest reduction in immunostaining was observed at 8 hours of differentiation, and similar to the RNA data, the signal intensity returned to baseline levels at &#x02265;24 hours after FCS and LIF withdrawal. Moreover, these dynamic and transient changes in B-MYB protein abundance could be quantified by western. B-MYB proteins significantly (p&#x0003c;0.05) decreased (relative to total protein) within 4 to 8 hours of FCS and LIF withdrawal, but after 24 hours, the protein returned to levels observed in undifferentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g001">Figure 1I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Knock-down of B-Myb</title><p>Since B-Myb was transiently down-regulated in mES cells with differentiation, a short-hairpin RNA based technique was employed to deplete B-Myb mRNAs to examine its function.

In pilot experiments, all five shRNAs decreased the quantity of B-Myb in the E14 and D3 cells, but shRNA1 and 2 proved most effective. In this study, only these latter two constructs were employed to knockdown B-Myb.

Following transfection, cells were cultivated in the presence of FCS and LIF, prior to the selective addition of puromycin to enrich for transfected cells. Relative to the NT shRNA controls, cells transfected with control Oct4 shRNA reduced endogenous Oct4 transcripts by &#x0003e;90&#x00025; (data not shown), while knock-down of B-Myb led to a significant reduction in endogenous B-Myb transcripts by 60&#x02013;70&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and by &#x0003e;90&#x00025; in puromycin-selected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). None of the major proteins observed on an amido black stained gel showed altered expression and, more specifically, no change in Utf1 and Hdac transcripts could be seen (see below), demonstrating the specificity of this shRNA-mediated knockdown.</p><p>After an overnight cultivation, nucleofected R1 mES cells formed small dome-shaped colonies that consisted primarily of small round cells with a relatively large nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, insets in panels 1, 2, 4 and 5). The lipofectamine treated cells however formed loosely aggregated, flattened cell clusters. We attribute the morphological changes to differences between the two protocols, but importantly and irrespective of the technique, puromycin-resistant ES cells colonies transfected or nucleofected with control vectors (pSuper, NT) remained relatively compact and increased in size as a function of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, panels 1 and 2). Selected cells that had been transfected with a shRNA against Oct4 however began to differentiate. Specifically, most of the Oct4-deficient cells appeared relatively large and had distinct cytoplasmic and nuclear regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, panel 3). Similarly, knockdown of B-Myb led to a modified colony morphology, but one that was distinct from cells lacking Oct4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, panels 4&#x02013;6). First, the puromycin-resistant ES cells lacking B-Myb were comprised primarily of small, and apparently non-proliferating cell clusters. Second and within 48&#x02013;72 hours of transfection, a number of cells both within and around the cell clusters began to exhibit characteristics of differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, panels 5 and 6, see arrows). These included the formation of spindle shaped cells, and an increase in the cytoplasmic to nuclear ratio. Most of the cells within a cluster/colony, however, retained morphological traits consistent with undifferentiated ES cells. Subsequently and at &#x0003e;72 hours post-puromycin selection, numerous individual and small groups of cells were present that showed distinct signs of differentiation (finger-projections, low nuclear to cytoplasm ratio), vacuolization and membrane blebbing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that B-Myb might play a role not only in mES cell proliferation but also in the initiation of differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Loss of B-Myb inhibits proliferation, increases aneuploidy and promotes mitotic spindle errors</title><p>To directly assess proliferation, shRNA nucleofected cells were exposed to bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and incorporation of this thymidine analog into unsynchronized R1 ES cells was quantified by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In these experiments, non-selected ES cells were examined 48 hours after nucleofection, and following pulse incorporation of BrdU (30-minutes) into newly synthesized DNA to provide an estimate of the fraction of cells in S-phase. The percentages of BrdU-labeled cells decreased in cells transfected with shRNAs targeted to B-Myb relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, p&#x0003c;0.001). At this time, the number of cells in G1, determined by propidium iodine incorporation, did not differ among any of the nucleofected groups, but a significant increase and decrease, respectively in the number of cells in G2/M and S phases were observed in B-Myb-deficient cells. Additionally, a two-hour pulse produced a highly significant (p&#x0003c;0.001) and unique pattern of BrdU incorporation, characterized by localized, patchy or punctate staining. The percentage of cells (n&#x02265;200) with strong punctate or patchy staining ranged from 35&#x00025; (pSuper, NT) to 67&#x00025; (shRNA1); whereas, those cells with a more diffuse or relatively homogenously BrdU staining (containing discrete foci of BrdU immunoreactivity equally distributed throughout the nucleus) ranged from 65&#x00025; in controls to 32&#x00025; in knockdown experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).

Knockdown of B-Myb decreased the number of G1 and S phase cells, increased the number of G2/M cells, and significantly increased the number of cells with &#x0003e;4N complement of chromosomes. Nucleofection alone, but not lipofectamine-mediated transfections, increased the incidence of cell aneuploidy in R1 cells from &#x0003c;0.1&#x00025; to 8&#x02013;11&#x00025;; however, knockdown of B-Myb by either technique specifically led to either tetraploidy (4N) or aneuploidy in &#x0223c;20&#x00025; of the mES cells (24 h, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

At 24 hours after nucleofection with shRNA1 and 2, the number of cells in S phase decreased concomitant with an increase in the number of cells in G2/M relative to controls. At 48 hours, knockdown of B-Myb led to increased octoploidy (8N), and the incidence of octoploidy was increased further at 72 hours (p&#x0003c;0.05). At this time, cells with a 16N and 32N (not shown) complement of DNA were also detectable (see arrows in the inset, Logscale). B) In these experiments, ES cells were transfected with either a NT shRNA (black line) or shRNA1 and selected by puromycin for 24 hours. Within 96 hours, the selected cells began to recover and proliferate, and within one week, cells transfected with shRNA1 demonstrated a rightward shift in the cell's DNA content, indicating that these surviving and proliferating cells were karyotypically abnormal (i.e., aneuploid). C) Metaphase chromosome spreads after labelling in the presence of BrdU for &#x0223c;24 hours and counterstaining with Giemsa. Sister chromatin exchanges (SCE) (shown by the arrows) were scored each time a color switch between dark or light sister chromatids occurred.

The number of polyploid cells generated with shRNA1 was also reduced by 27.9&#x00025;; however, when the expression vector containing the silent mutation was nucleofected with shRNA2, no rescue could be observed. The rescue of the shRNA1 phenotype was however only partial, probably because knockdown of endogenous B-Myb transcripts was temporally faster than the expression of the rescue vector.</p><p>After 5&#x02013;7 days of cultivation and following an initial puromycin selection for 24 hours, almost none of the surviving, proliferating cells retained 8N, 16N or 32N chromosomes. Instead, numerous cells were aneuploid. This finding was confirmed both by flow cytomety &#x0005b;i.e., the DNA content was shifted to the right (&#x0003e;2N and &#x0003e;4N peaks) relative to an internal control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g004">Figure 4B</xref>)&#x0005d; and by chromosome spreads, where additional chromosome fragments were observed. Interestingly, the aneuploid cell population had many of the growth characteristics of karyotypically normal R1 ES cells i.e., the cells proliferated quickly, required passaging every 24&#x02013;36 hours, and had similar colony morphologies. OCT4, NANOG and SOX2 proteins were also present, and when induced to differentiate, diverse cell morphologies were observed, suggesting that these aneuploid cells remained multipotent. The karyotype of some surviving cells was however abnormal (aneuploidy), leading us to conclude that these cells may no longer be viable germ-line transmissible mES cells.</p><p>To elucidate mechanisms underlying these chromosomal abnormalities, we assessed the incidence of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), analyzed &#x003b3;-H2AX histone immunoreactivity (as an index of DNA strand breaks), and determined the number of DNA events associated with fragmentation, fusion, and breakage (abnormalities/chromosome). The incidence of SCEs and the number of abnormalities/chromosome did not differ among the groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002478-t002">Table 2</xref>), and we could not demonstrate any increase in &#x003b3;-H2AX histone immunostaining among any of the B-Myb knockdown groups relative to controls (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4). The most obvious defects in cells lacking B-Myb were numeric changes in chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g004">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002478-t003">Table 3</xref>), which could be due to errors in spindle formation/function or chromosomal segregation during the M phase of the cell cycle. To examine these latter possibilities, R1 ES cells were immunostained with antibodies against &#x003b1;- and &#x003b3;-tubulin, which respectively, are the major components of spindles and centrioles found in the mitotic organizing regions (centrosomes) of dividing cells. In these experiments, cells in prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase were readily observed in control (pSuper, NT) cells, and the majority of mitotic cells (&#x0223c;80&#x02013;90&#x00025;) contained two centrosomes located at opposite poles in the cell. Normal spindle formation was also observed between mitotic organizing regions and chromosomes (NT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). In contrast, it was difficult to find any B-Myb-deficient cells in anaphase or telophase, and mitotic cells had significantly fewer bipolar centrosomes than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, p&#x0003c;0.001). In fact, over 35&#x00025; of the mitotic cells contained monopolar spindles comprised of either a single centrosome or grouped centrosomes, and spindle abnormalities were significantly increased (B-Myb shRNA1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g004">Figure 4D, 4E</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pone-0002478-t002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002478.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Frequency of SCE and chromosome abnormalities</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0002478-t002-2" xlink:href="pone.0002478.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0002478-t002-2"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sample I.D.</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total no.

For this, we quantified RNAs encoding early markers of differentiation (CoupTF and FGF5), and markers specific for ectoderm (Sox1, Nestin), endoderm (Sox17, Gata4), mesoderm (Brachyury), and trophectoderm (Cdx2, Hand1) lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

B) Western analysis of Sox17, CoupTf and Hand1 confirmed that loss of B-Myb was associated with an up-regulation in markers of differentiation. C) Knockdown of B-Myb led to a significant reduction in transcripts encoding pluripotency markers Oct4 and Sox2 within 48 hours, but not in UTF1. A significant reduction in Nanog was generally only observed &#x0003e;72 hours after loss of B-Myb. All data were determined by qRT-PCR. D) Knockdown of B-Myb also led to a reduction in OCT4 and SOX2 proteins at 48 hours post-nucleofection that could be detected by western (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3). E) Over-expression of B-MYB, relative to the parental vector control, led to increased OCT4 and SOX2 protein abundance.

In these experiments, the over-expression of B-Myb was transient, as were the increases in Oct4 and Sox2. G) The WST-1 assay shows a significant segregation in the absorbance of the colormetric dye in D3 cells transfected with B-Myb shRNAs relative to controls. This segregation indicates a loss in cell viability in mES cells lacking B-Myb (p&#x0003c;0.05). H) Loss of B-Myb promotes apoptosis, but only 72 hours after nucleofection. No increased genomic DNA fragmentation (apoptosis) was ever observed at 24 or 48 hours following knockdown. Importantly, the DNA fragmentation could be inhibited by Z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor, indicating that the observed DNA laddering was due to active caspases. &#x0002a;p&#x0003c;0.05 relative to NT controls (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0002478.g005"/></fig><p>Importantly, a significant decrease in <italic>pou5f1</italic> and <italic>sox2</italic> gene products (RNA and protein)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g005">Figures 5C, 5D</xref>) was observed within 24&#x02013;48 hours of B-Myb knock-down, while transient over-expression of B-MYB increased endogenous OCT4 and SOX2 proteins by 18&#x02013;30&#x00025; (p&#x0003c;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g005">Figure 5E, 5F</xref>). In contrast, no consistent decrease in NANOG could be demonstrated after knock-down of B-Myb except in puromycin- selected cells between 48 and 72 hours after transfection. Over-expression of B-Myb did not produce a significant increase in NANOG. These data in particular suggest that the genes encoding Sox2 and Oct4, but not Nanog, might be targets of B-MYB regulation.</p><p>To further validate the findings of differentiation, independent of gene markers, we examined the viability of the transfected cells and determined whether apoptosis, which is generally elevated with differentiation, was altered. For this we employed the the water-soluble tetrazolium (WST)-1 assay, an indicator of both mitochondrial function in living cells and cell viability. Using this assay, we found a significant segregation and loss of viability in mES cells transfected with B-Myb shRNAs (p&#x0003c;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g005">Figure 5G</xref>).

The DNA laddering was caspase dependent, and it could be fully inhibited by addition of 40 &#x000b5;mol/L Z-VAD-FMK (carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-&#x0005b;O-methyl&#x0005d;-fluoromethylketone) a cell-permeant pan caspase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). Moreover, activated caspase 3 was observed at &#x0003e;48 hours in those cells nucleofected with shRNA1 (data not shown); however, activated caspase 3 could not be detected in controls (pSuper, NT) at any time point examined.

In mouse, six putative <italic>mybl2</italic> binding sites (consensus and non-consensus) were identified with software from Genomatix (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genomatix.de/">http://www.genomatix.de/</ext-link>).

To determine if any of these sites might bind B-MYB, chromosomal immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed with DNA extracts from mES (R1) cells.

In these experiments, PCR amplifications were performed with total input DNA (positive control without immunoprecipitation) and following immunoprecipitation (IP) with antibodies to either B-MYB or to rabbit IgG (as a negative control). Amplifications of immunoprecipitated DNA were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and Myc was employed as a positive control. The presence of an amplification product in the anti-B-Myb immunoprecipitated DNA indicates that B-Myb binds a proximal region of the mouse <italic>pou5f1</italic> promoter. B) In the second set of experiments, which were evaluated by qRT-PCR, we find that B-MYB dynamically binds to the endogenous <italic>pou5f1</italic> promoter region. In undifferentiated cells, an amplification signal 10&#x02013;15-fold above that seen in the IgG control is observed; however, this signal is reduced to only 2&#x02013;4 fold above the IgG control following withdrawal of LIF and FCS. All qRT-PCR amplifications were performed using SYBR Green with primers located 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; to the putative binding site.

D) To test the transactivation potential of B-MYB on pluripotency genes, human (h)Oct4 and mouse Nanog promoter constructs containing a Luciferase reporter were used in transient transfection assays. In these experiments, D3 cells were transfected with the constructs as indicated. The positive control Oct4 shRNA reduced the promoter activities of both the hOct4 and mouse Nanog promoters; however, knockdown of B-Myb only reduced the promoter activity of the hOct4 promoter. &#x0002a;p&#x0003c;0.05 relative to NT controls. E) To determine if B-MYB proteins could bind to the human Oct4 promoter, EMSAs were performed with HeLa cell nucleoextracts (lanes 1&#x02013;6) and R1 nucleoextracts. Positive control cassettes revealed two DNA-protein complexes (<italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic>) in HeLA cell nuclear extracts and a single higher molecular weight complex in extracts from R1 ES cells. Addition of anti-B-MYB antibodies resulted in formation of a complex in mouse with a lower mobility, and in HeLa cells, most but not all of complex <italic>b</italic> (supershift, ss) showed decreased mobility. Complex <italic>a</italic> did not show any change in mobility and was therefore considered non-specific. An oligonucleotide cassette containing base pair changes within the putative MYB-binding site failed to form DNA complexes in either R1 or HeLa cells, and the addition of a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide also led to a loss of signal. &#x0005b;Data are presented as follows: Lane 1: biotin-end labeled 24 bp DNA duplexes containing the putative MYB-binding site located at position &#x02013;223 of the hOct4 promoter.

R1: biotin-end labeled 24 bp DNA duplexes containing the putative MYB-binding site located at position &#x02013;223 of the hOct4 promoter and incubated with nucleoextracts from R1 ES cells.

F) A 2.8 kb hOct4 promoter-Luciferase construct was employed to assess the ability of B-MYB to directly regulate its activity in vitro. In these experiments, R1 ES and P19 EC cells were co-transfected with plasmids containing a 2.8 kb hOct4 promoter-Luciferase construct promoter and either a CMV promoter driven mouse B-Myb construct or empty vector. Relative luciferase activity, normalized to Renilla luciferase and the empty vector controls, was taken as a measure of transcriptional activity. G) R1 ES and P19 EC cells were co-transfected with either a CMV promoter driven mouse B-Myb construct or empty vector, but in this case, the 2.8 kb hOct4 promoter-Luciferase construct contained a mutation in the putative Myb-binding site (position &#x02013;223) that had been putatively identified from a genomic analysis with Genomatix software. H) To exclude the possibility that pluripotency factors present in ES and EC cells might have affected the relative luciferase activities, wildtype and mutant hOct4-Luc constructs were co-transfected into human kidney 293T cells. In these experiments, the relative activity of the hOct4-Luc constructs was much less than that observed in R1 or P19 cells; however, when co-tranfected with the CMV-B-Myb vector, the relative luciferase activity increased significantly relative to empty vector controls. The increase was however significantly less when the mutant hOct4-Luc construct was employed in 293T cells. In summary, data from the luciferase assays (F, G and H) indicate that B-Myb can transactivate the hOCT promoter in vitro, and that its actions are mediated in part through protein binding to the proximal Myb-binding site located at position &#x02013;223. &#x0002a; p&#x0003c;0.05 relative to either the native or mutant hOct4 promoter-Luciferase&#x0002b;empty vector. #p&#x0003c;0.05 relative to mutant hOct4-Luciferase&#x0002b;B-Myb (PGK-BMYB).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0002478.g006"/></fig><p>Next, we employed the mouse nanog and human Oct4 promoters in transient transfection assays of murine ES cell lines (D3, R1) to determine whether B-MYB could directly regulate the transcriptional activity of pluripotency genes. In these experiments, knockdown of B-Myb significantly decreased Oct4 promoter activity by 30&#x02013;40&#x00025; relative to controls (NT and pSuper); whereas, Nanog promoter activity did not significantly differ among any of the experimental groups (i.e, NT, pSuper, shRNA1 and shRNA2).

Complex <italic>a</italic> did not show any change in mobility and was therefore considered non-specific. The specificity of these protein-DNA complexes for B-Myb was further verified by an oligonucleotide cassette containing base pair changes within the putative MYB-binding site, which failed to form DNA complexes in either R1 or HeLa cells, and by addition of a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide.</p><p>To determine whether the myb-binding site was functional, pluripotent murine R1 ES, P19 EC and non-pluripotent human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected with native and mutant hOct4-Luc constructs together with either a B-Myb over-expressing vector under the control of the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter or an empty vector. All luciferase data are reported relative to the empty vector and after normalization to Renilla luciferase activity. In both R1 ES and P19 EC cells, transient over-expression of B-MYB led to an increase in hOct4-Luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). No significant increase in luciferase activity could be demonstrated in P19 cells relative to controls, but an &#x0223c;50&#x00025; decrease in luciferase activity was observed in R1 ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g006">Figure 6G</xref>), with the mutant constructs relative to controls.

Unexpectedly, the mutant hOct-4-Luc constructs also showed an increase of &#x0223c;1.5&#x02013;2-fold, suggesting that another binding site on this promoter might be regulated by B-MYB. The increase observed in the mutant was however significantly less than that elicited by the wildtype hOct4 promoter sequence, leading us to conclude that the <italic>trans</italic>-activation potential of the human Oct4 promoter by B-MYB is elicited, at least in part, through the MYB-binding site located in the proximal promoter of this gene.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we show that knockdown of B-MYB in mES cells decreases proliferation, cell viability and colony size, and it delays transit through the G2/M phase of the cell cycle.

B) The primary effect of reduced levels of B-Myb is the generation of polyploid and aneuploid cells due to a loss of normal cell cycle progression through G2/M and spindle defects. Loss of B-Myb also causes a reduction in Oct4 expression and ES cell differentiation. Because differentiated cells have tight checkpoint controls that are capable of recognizing chromosomal abnormalities and activating apoptosis, this may represent a control mechanism necessary to maintain chromosome fidelity during early embryo development. Many of the surviving mES cells that were transiently deficient in B-Myb do not undergo apoptosis. Instead some of these cells become aneuploid, and can no longer be considered as authentic ES cells.

They showed that activation of dnMyb did not induce the expression of any germ layer differentiation markers, even though E-Cadherin, a marker of epiblast, was down-regulated; and they did not observe any apoptosis. One possible explanation for the disparity between their study and ours may be experimental. In the present study, we employed shRNAs and puromycin selection to examine cells that had a significant and specific reduction in B-MYB proteins. In contrast, Iwai et al. had assumed, because of the conserved protein homologies and consensus binding sequences, that the dominant-negative interfering form of C-Myb would inhibit the activity of B-Myb in ES cells; however, important differences are now known to exist between these two transcription factors. First, only B-Myb, and neither A- nor C-Myb, can rescue the phenotype of Dm-Myb deficient Drosophila mutants in complementation experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002478-Davidson1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

It is therefore likely that knockdown of B-Myb would have different effects on either transcription and/or replication than those exhibited by a dominant-negative interfering form of C-Myb.</p><p>Our results also provide an additional explanation for the causes of embryonic lethality reported by Tanaka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002478-Tanaka1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Developmentally and after implantation on day 4, the early murine epiblast begins to expand and differentiate to form columnar epithelium. This transition is accompanied by increased cell proliferation and expansion of pluripotent cells from &#x0223c;25 to &#x0223c;660 cells by 6.5 dpc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002478-Snow1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the embryonic lethality of B-Myb-knockout mice at 4.5&#x02013;6.5 dpc has generally been attributed to defects in proliferation, we show that the primary cell cycle defects in mES cells are due to delays in G2/M that are associated with mitotic spindle defects and polyploidy. We also show that loss of B-Myb in LIF-cultivated ES cells leads to an up-regulation of differentiation markers followed by an activation of caspase-mediated DNA fragmentation. Since mES cell differentiation is associated with the establishment of robust cell cycle checkpoint controls that strongly promote apoptosis of polyploid cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002478-Mantel1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, the loss of ICM observed by Tanaka et al. may have resulted not only from a proliferation defect but also from programmed cell death that is activated in response to differentiation and the formation of columnar epithelium.</p><p>Moreover, the data presented in the current paper are consistent with B-Myb being a general regulator of S phase progression. In fact, we show highly significant and inappropriate BrdU incorporation into chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), which indicates either a potential replication defect or problems with chromosome condensation. Similarly, Manak et al. have shown in Drosopholia that the primary function of B-MYB is associated with DNA replication, and not in gene regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002478-Manak1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002478-Manak2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>; however, we also show specific defects in mitotic progression and spindle formation that are similar to those reported in zebrafish. Shepard et al. showed that zebrafish mutants lacking <italic>crb</italic> (the zebrafish B-myb equivalent) had enhanced chromosomal instability and that injection of cyclin B RNA partially restored the genomic integrity of Myb mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002478-Shepard1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with their findings, cyclin B1 transcripts are decreased in ES cells following knockdown of B-Myb (unpublished data), and since cyclin B is activated in late S phase by B-Myb, it is likely that the defects in spindle formation and centrosomes observed in ES cells lacking B-Myb are elicitied, at least in part, through control of cyclin gene expression during progression through S phase.</p><p>Importantly, B-MYB specifically binds to a proximal sequence in the endogenous mouse <italic>pou5f1</italic> promoter, and altered expression of B-Myb in mES cells leads to coordinate changes in endogenous Oct4 expression. Although the changes in endogenous Oct4 expression are modest, studies with the human Oct4 gene promoter show that the effects of B-Myb on this gene are unambiguous. Specifically, point mutations to a proximal myb-binding site of the human Oct4 promoter inhibited the trans-activating potential of this transcription factor both in pluripotent stem and 293T cells; however, the inhibition in 293T cells, was only partial, suggesting that another binding site or formation of an unique transcriptional complex regulated by B-MYB may be involved in the control of <italic>pou5f1</italic> gene activity. Some differences in activity were also noted between R1 ES and P19 EC cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g006">Figure 6D</xref>), and since the Oct4 promoter depends on distal and proximal enhancer elements to control pre- (ES cell) and post- (EC cell) implantation expression, respectively, a detailed promoter analysis will be required to elucidate how <italic>pou5f1</italic> promoter activity is regulated by B-MYB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002478-Nordhoff1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

It is however possible that some fate decisions (i.e., Cdx2, Hand1 expression) may be mediated, in part, through B-Myb mediated changes in Oct4 expression, particularly since a modest change in OCT4 can promote ES cell differentiation to trophectoderm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002478-Niwa1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> or specification to a cardiac lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002478-Zeineddine1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

Appropriate levels of B-Myb are required to maintain chromosomal integrity and cellular euploidy, and any dysregulation in the expression or function of B-Myb promotes differentiation and/or aneuploidy that can result in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002478-g007">Figure 7</xref>). B-Myb is therefore critical not only for mouse embryonic development, but also for a normal karyotype and maintenance of viable embryonic, and potentially, all proliferating somatic stem cells. Because human ES cells are susceptible to chromosomal rearrangements and karyotypic abnormalities, the data generated in this study suggest one possible mechanism that may account for some of this instability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture</title><sec id="s4a1"><title>Mouse and Human cell lines</title><p>D3, R1, E14 murine (m)ES cell lines, H1 (h)ES (WiCell, Agreement No: 05-W102, NIH code WA01) cells, P19 EC and EG-1 cell lines were cultivated on feeder layers of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) or under feeder free conditions as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002478-Wobus1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002478-Xue1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.
