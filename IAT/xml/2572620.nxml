In spite of this genetic stability, homologous DNA recombination has been hypothesized to lie at the basis of antigenic variation of the major surface protein, P1, of <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic>. In order to identify the proteins that may be involved in homologous DNA recombination in <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic>, we set out to characterize the MPN229 open reading frame (ORF), which bears sequence similarity to the gene encoding the single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) protein of other micro-organisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The MPN229 ORF has the capacity to encode a 166-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 18.4 kDa. The amino acid sequence of this protein (<italic>Mpn </italic>SSB) is most closely related to that of the protein predicted to be encoded by the MG091 gene from <italic>Mycoplasma genitalium </italic>(61% identity). The MPN229 ORF was cloned, and different versions of <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB were expressed in <italic>E. coli </italic>and purified to &#x0003e; 95% homogeneity.

It has previously been reported that <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic>-induced pneumonia may be observed most frequently among children 5&#x02013;15 years of age. However, later studies have indicated that <italic>M. pneumoniae </italic>may also occur endemically and sometimes epidemically in older persons as well as in children less than 5 years of age.</p><p>Mycoplasmas are among the smallest self-replicating organisms, in both cellular dimensions and genome size, that are capable of free existence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The genome of <italic>M. pneumoniae </italic>(strain M129) was found to have a length of 816,394 base pairs (bp), containing 688 open reading frames (ORFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. As would be expected on the basis of the relatively small size of its genome, being at least 5 times smaller than the <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>genome, <italic>M. pneumoniae </italic>possesses limited metabolic and biosynthetic capacities in comparison to 'classical' bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These limitations necessitate a parasitic lifestyle, and a close association of the bacterium with the respiratory epithelium of its human host.</p><p>A crucial step in the initiation of infection by <italic>M. pneumoniae </italic>is its attachment to the respiratory epithelium (cytadherence) of the host. This process is essential to pathogenesis since mutants that are unable to adhere are also avirulent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Cytadherence is mediated by a specialized and complex attachment organelle. This organelle is localized at the tip of the bacterium and consists of a network of adhesins and accessory proteins. The major adhesion protein (cytadhesin) that is concentrated in the attachment organelle is the surface-exposed, 170-kDa P1 protein. This protein, which is encoded by the MPN141 gene, was demonstrated to be essential for attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Apart from its function in cytadherence, the P1 protein is known to elicit a strong humoral immune response during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In relation to this immunodominance, the P1 protein was hypothesized to undergo antigenic variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. At the basis of this hypothesis is the finding within the P1 gene of two sequence blocks of which multiple variants exist throughout the <italic>M. pneumoniae </italic>genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These sequences (repetitive elements) were designated RepMP4, which is located near the 5' end of the P1 gene, and RepMP2/3, which is located at the 3' end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Within the <italic>M. pneumoniae </italic>M129 genome, a total of 8 variants of RepMP4 and 10 variants of RepMP2/3 were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Because the different variants of a given RepMP element are closely related in sequence, but not identical, it is possible that recombination between the P1 gene and RepMP sequences elsewhere in the genome could generate significant sequence variation within the P1 gene, resulting in amino acid changes in the P1 protein at the bacterial surface.</p><p>In order to demonstrate that recombination between RepMP elements lies at the heart of antigenic variation of <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic>, we initiated a study aimed at the identification of proteins that may be involved in this process. On the basis of sequence comparison, at least four <italic>M. pneumoniae </italic>ORFs were proposed to play a role in DNA recombination: MPN229 (or G07_orf166), MPN490 (or P02_orf336), MPN535 (or G12_orf206) and MPN536 (or G12_orf307), which may encode homologs of the <italic>E. coli </italic>single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB), RecA, RuvA and RuvB, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, SSB is a protein that primarily binds single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and plays a central role in most aspects of DNA metabolism, including DNA replication and recombination. <italic>E. coli </italic>RecA is responsible for promoting pairing between a single-stranded donor DNA molecule and a homologous, double-stranded recipient DNA molecule, while RuvA and RuvB interact to form RuvAB, which possesses DNA helicase activity and catalyzes branch formation during recombination of two DNA strands.</p><p>Of the <italic>M. pneumoniae </italic>ORFs that were predicted to encode proteins involved in DNA recombination, only MPN535 has been studied in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This protein (<italic>Mp</italic>RuvA) was demonstrated to bind Holliday junctions and other branched DNA substrates in a similar fashion as <italic>E. coli </italic>RuvA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In order to initiate the analysis of the complete set of putative DNA recombination enzymes from <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic>, we have examined the characteristics of the MPN229 protein product, which was designated <italic>Mpn </italic>single-stranded DNA-binding protein (<italic>Mpn </italic>SSB). We here report that <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB has a strong and selective ssDNA-binding activity, and promotes <italic>E. coli </italic>RecA-dependent DNA strand transfer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Strains</title><p><italic>M. pneumoniae </italic>strain MAC (ATCC<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>no. 15492&#x02122;) was cultured in Mycoplasma medium containing 1.4% Difco&#x02122; PPLO broth (Becton Dickinson), 0.15% Difco&#x02122; TC Yeastolate, UF (Becton Dickinson), 1.4% glucose, 20% horse serum, 1,000 U/ml Penicillin G, 500 U/ml Polymyxine B, 3 &#x003bc;g/ml Fungizone, 5 &#x003bc;g/ml Voriconazol and 0.02 mg/ml phenol red. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.8&#x02013;8.0 using a solution of 2 N NaOH. Finally, the medium was filter-sterilized. Cells were harvested upon color change of the medium (from red/orange to yellow).</p></sec><sec><title>Cloning of the MPN229 gene and generation of Mpn SSB expression constructs</title><p>DNA was purified from cultures of <italic>M. pneumoniae </italic>as follows. Cultures (3 ml) were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min in a microcentrifuge at full speed. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml 0.9% NaCl. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in 400 &#x003bc;l of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0). Then, 70 &#x003bc;l of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 5 &#x003bc;l of Proteinase K (10 mg/ml) was added. After incubation for 10 min at 65&#x000b0;C, 100 &#x003bc;l of 5 M NaCl was added, followed by the addition of 100 &#x003bc;l of a solution of 10% N-cetyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) in 0.7 M NaCl. The solution was incubated for 10 min at 65&#x000b0;C. The DNA was subsequently extracted from the solution using 500 &#x003bc;l of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1, vol:vol). The DNA in the upper, aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube and precipitated by the addition of 360 &#x003bc;l of isopropanol. Following incubation at -20&#x000b0;C for 30 min, the DNA was pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at full speed in a microcentrifuge. The DNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 10 &#x003bc;l of H<sub>2</sub>O. The MPN229 (or G07_orf166 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]) ORF was amplified by PCR from the <italic>M. pneumoniae </italic>MAC genomic DNA. The PCR mixture (50 &#x003bc;l) contained 0.3 &#x003bc;M of oligonucleotide primer SSB_fw (5'-GGTCGT<bold>CAT<italic>ATG</italic></bold>AACCGCGTTTTTTTATTTG-3'; the sequence in bold indicates a unique <italic>Nde</italic>I restriction endonuclease recognition site, which overlaps with the translation initiation codon [in italics] of MPN229), 0.3 &#x003bc;M of primer SSB_rv (5'-GCAGCC<bold>GGATCC</bold><italic>TTA</italic>TTCATCATCACTCTCCTC-3'; the sequence in bold indicates a unique <italic>Bam</italic>HI restriction site, which is adjacent to the translation termination codon [anticodon in italics] of MPN229), 10 ng of <italic>M. pneumoniae </italic>genomic DNA, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1 unit of <italic>Pfu </italic>DNA polymerase (Fermentas), and 1 &#x000d7; <italic>Pfu </italic>buffer containing MgSO<sub>4 </sub>(20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.8], 10 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>). PCR was performed using the following conditions: 3 min at 95&#x000b0;C, followed by 30 cycles of 30 sec at 95&#x000b0;C, 30 sec at 50&#x000b0;C, and 2 min at 72&#x000b0;C. The resulting 522-base pairs (bp) PCR fragment was cloned into the pJET1/blunt cloning vector (Fermentas) using the GeneJET&#x02122; PCR cloning kit (Fermentas). From the generated plasmid, pJET1-<italic>Mpn</italic>SSB, the MPN229 ORF was excised by digestion with <italic>Nde</italic>I and <italic>Bam</italic>HI, and cloned into <italic>Nde</italic>I- and <italic>Bam</italic>HI-digested expression vectors pET-11c and pET-16b (Novagen), resulting in plasmid pET-11c-<italic>Mpn</italic>SSB and pET-16b-<italic>Mpn</italic>SSB, respectively. In plasmid pET-11c-<italic>Mpn</italic>SSB, the MPN229 ORF is cloned such as to express <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB in its natural, non-tagged form. In plasmid pET-16b-<italic>Mpn</italic>SSB, the MPN229 ORF is fused at its 5' end to a sequence encoding a polyhistidine tag (MG(H)<sub>10</sub>SSGHIEGRH). This polyhistidine sequence allows one-step affinity purification of the MPN229-encoded protein by Ni<sup>2+</sup>-affinity chromatography (see below). For the generation of a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-<italic>Mpn </italic>SSB fusion protein expression construct, the <italic>Nde</italic>I-<italic>Bam</italic>HI fragment containing MPN229 was first made blunt-ended by incubation with dNTPs and 'Klenow fragment' (Fermentas) and then cloned into <italic>Sma</italic>I-digested and Shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Promega)-treated vector pRP265 (NCCB Plasmids database, element No. PC-V3271; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.knaw.nl/scripts/Plasmids.dll/ShowPlasmid?Nr=3271"/>). Plasmid pRP265 is a derivative of the expression plasmid pGEX-2T in which the polylinker 5'-GGATCCCCGGGAATTC-3' has been replaced by the sequence 5'-GGATCCCCATGGTACCCGGGTCGACTAGTATGCATAAGCTTGAATTC-3'. The resulting plasmid was termed pRP265-<italic>Mpn</italic>SSB. Vector pRP265 was used for the production of native GST. The integrity of all DNA constructs used in this study was verified by DNA sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression and purification of Mpn SSB, Mpn H<sub>10</sub>-SSB and GST(-SSB)</title><p>Constructs pET-11c-<italic>Mpn</italic>SSB, pET-16b-<italic>Mpn</italic>SSB, pRP265-<italic>Mpn</italic>SSB and pRP265 were introduced into <italic>E. coli </italic>BL21(DE3) and the resulting strains were grown overnight at 37&#x000b0;C in LB medium containing 100 &#x003bc;g/ml ampicillin. The cultures were diluted 1:100 in 100&#x02013;150 ml LB medium with ampicillin and grown at 37&#x000b0;C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6. Protein expression was then induced by the addition of isopropyl-&#x003b2;-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.3 mM. After 3 hr, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and stored at -20&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Non-tagged <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB was purifed as follows. Frozen, bacterial pellets corresponding to 100 ml of culture were resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT). The suspension was sonicated on ice and clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 12,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>(4&#x000b0;C). To the supernatant, 5 ml of saturated ammonium sulphate was added, followed by 15 min of incubation on ice. After centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 &#x000d7; g (4&#x000b0;C), the protein pellet, which contained the <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB protein, was dissolved in 10 ml of buffer A. Subsequently, 1 ml of a 50% suspension of DNA-cellulose (Worthington biochemical corp., Lakewood NJ), equilibrated in buffer A, was added, and the suspension was left on a rotating mixer for 1 hour at 4&#x000b0;C. The DNA-cellulose was poured into a column, and protein was eluted stepwise by the addition of 0.5 ml of a buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT) containing increasing concentrations of NaCl (from 200 to 1500 mM). The fractions containing <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% Tween 20, 50% glycerol. The protein was stored at -20&#x000b0;C.</p><p>The polyhistidine-tagged <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB protein (<italic>Mpn </italic>H<sub>10</sub>-SSB) was purified as follows. Bacterial pellets corresponding to 150 ml of culture were resuspended in 10 ml of buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.3 M NaCl) plus 5 mM imidazole. The suspension was sonicated on ice and clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 12,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>(4&#x000b0;C). To the supernatant, 1 ml was added of a 50% slurry of Ni<sup>2+</sup>-nitroloacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose (Qiagen), equilibrated previously in buffer B containing 5 mM imidazole. The suspension was stirred for 1 hr at 4&#x000b0;C and subsequently poured into a column. Non-specifically bound proteins were washed from the Ni-NTA agarose by two subsequent washes (of 4 ml each) with buffer B containing 5 mM, 10 mM and 20 mM imidazole, respectively. The bound <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB protein was eluted from the column with 2.5 ml of buffer B containing 250 mM imidazole. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), pooled, and dialyzed against buffer B plus 1 mM DTT and 50% glycerol. Aliquots of purified protein were stored at -20&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Both GST and GST-tagged <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB protein (GST-SSB) were purified as follows. Bacterial pellets corresponding to 100 ml of culture were resuspended on ice in 5 ml of PBS (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1.8 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.3) and sonicated. Then, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the suspension was left on a rotating mixer for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Subsequently, the suspension was clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 10,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>(4&#x000b0;C). To the supernatant, 0.8 ml was added of a 50% slurry of Glutathione-Agarose (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA), equilibrated previously in PBS. The suspension was incubated on a rotating mixer for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C and subsequently poured into a column. The column was washed consecutively with 3 ml of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and with 5 ml of PBS. Specifically bound protein was eluted from the column by addition of 3 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 containing 10 mM reduced glutathione (Sigma). Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% Tween 20, 50% glycerol. Aliquots of purified protein were stored at -20&#x000b0;C. Protein concentrations were determined using the BC Assay protein quantitation kit (Interchim) as well as by SDS-PAGE analysis in conjunction with bovine serum albumin standards. All purified proteins were obtained at concentrations of at least 1 mg/ml, having an estimated homogeneity of 95% or greater.

Albeit less extensive, acidic residues are also concentrated near the C-terminus of other SSB proteins. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, these residues have been demonstrated to be involved in the interaction of SSB with other proteins, such as exonuclease I, uracil DNA glycosylase, and DNA polymerase III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Several residues of the <italic>E. coli </italic>SSB protein have been demonstrated to play a role in DNA-binding. These include three tryptophan (W) residues at position 41 (adjacent to OB box '2' in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), 55 (within box '3') and 89 (adjacent to box '45<sub>1</sub>') [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, none of these residues appear to be conserved with the SSB proteins from the Mycoplasmataceae. Only W55 seems to have a clear counterpart in the mycoplasma proteins, i.e. a tyrosine (Y) residue in <italic>M. pneumoniae </italic>(Y44) and a phenylalanine (F) in both <italic>M. genitalium </italic>(F44) and <italic>U. parvum </italic>(F43). Other residues that were found to be implicated in <italic>E. coli </italic>SSB DNA-binding, however, do have a counterpart in the mycoplasma SSBs.

The lack of conservation of this apparently crucial amino acid residue, however, can be reconciled with the finding that substitution of residue H56 of <italic>E. coli </italic>SSB for either an F or I residue, did not change the properties of the protein measurably [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Expression and purification of the MPN229-encoded protein</title><p>The MPN229 gene was cloned into different expression vectors in order to express <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB either in its native form (<italic>Mpn </italic>SSB), as an N-terminal polyhistidine-tagged polypeptide (<italic>Mpn </italic>H<sub>10</sub>-SSB) or as a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged fusion protein (GST-SSB).

To further investigate this, we tested the ability of <italic>Mpn </italic>H<sub>10</sub>-SSB to bind <sup>32</sup>P-labeled homooligomers (50-mers) of dA, dT, dC and dG (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Although the (T)<sub>50 </sub>substrate seemed to be bound most efficiently, each of the homooligomers was bound by the protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The (C)<sub>50 </sub>substrate, despite being labeled inefficiently, most likely due to the formation of inaccessible secondary structures, was also bound by <italic>Mpn </italic>H<sub>10</sub>-SSB. These data show that the protein indeed binds ssDNA irrespective of the DNA substrate sequence. It is interesting to note that binding of <italic>Mpn </italic>H<sub>10</sub>-SSB to the 50-nucleotide homooligomer substrates resulted in the formation of two different DNA-protein complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). As the formation of the larger of the two complexes was favored at higher protein concentrations, it is likely that this larger species represents DNA-protein complexes in which a higher number of SSB DNA-binding units (eg., dimers or tetramers) are present than in the smaller species. Thus, a 50-mer DNA substrate may be bound by a single binding unit at relatively low protein concentrations, whereas two or more binding units may occupy the substrate at higher protein concentrations. To study this further, we tested binding of <italic>Mpn </italic>H<sub>10</sub>-SSB to a series of oligonucleotides with lengths ranging from 15 to 50 nucleotides, and each containing the same 15-nucleotide 'core sequence', which was randomly chosen (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, only the 15-nucleotide substrate was bound inefficiently by the protein, whereas the other substrates were bound efficiently, each being completely complexed at higher protein concentrations. Interestingly, a second, larger DNA-protein complex was seen exclusively with substrates with a length equal to or larger than 30 nucleotides. The efficiency of formation of these larger complexes was even higher with the 40- or 50-mer substrates (lanes 14&#x02013;20). Thus, whereas a 20-mer substrate may accommodate binding of a single SSB DNA-binding unit, longer substrates may allow binding of two or more units, generating protein-DNA complexes with a lower electrophoretic mobility than do single unit-bound complexes.</p><p>To investigate whether <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB binds with similar affinities to 20- and 50-mer substrates, a DNA-binding competition experiment was performed in which <italic>Mpn </italic>H<sub>10</sub>-SSB was incubated with a constant amount of radiolabeled oligonucleotide and increasing amounts of the other, unlabeled oligonucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Complexes with 20-mer substrates were no longer observed when a 5-fold molar excess of the 50-mer substrate was present in the DNA-binding reaction (compare lanes 2 and 3). By contrast, the formation of complexes with the 50-mer substrate was only partially inhibited in the presence of a 20-100-fold excess of unlabeled 20-mer oligonucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, lanes 11&#x02013;13). These results indicate that <italic>Mpn </italic>H<sub>10</sub>-SSB binds with a higher affinity to the 50-mer substrate than to the 20-mer substrate.</p></sec><sec><title>dsDNA- versus ssDNA-binding of SSB and divalent cation-dependence of DNA-binding</title><p>To study the ability of <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB to also bind dsDNA, the protein was incubated with either single- or double-stranded &#x003c6;X174 DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). While almost all ssDNA was shifted towards a lower mobility form at the lowest concentration of <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB tested (1.3 &#x003bc;M; lane 10), significant binding to dsDNA could not be observed at any protein concentration used (lanes 14&#x02013;16). These results demonstrate that <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB preferentially binds ssDNA. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> further shows that the gel mobility of <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB-ssDNA complexes becomes lower when <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB concentrations are increased (lanes 10&#x02013;12). Similarly as described above for the oligonucleotide substrates, it is likely that increasing numbers of <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB molecules accumulate on the ssDNA substrates when higher concentrations of protein are present. Consequently, the size of the DNA-protein complexes will increase when the protein concentration becomes higher, resulting in lowering of the gel mobility of these complexes. Similar DNA-binding results were obtained for each of the purified, recombinant <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB proteins, including GST-SSB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lanes 7&#x02013;11), as well as for <italic>E. coli </italic>SSB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;4). Interestingly, the <italic>E. coli </italic>SSB protein may assemble on DNA substrates in a different fashion than does <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB, as more heterogeneously sized protein-DNA complexes were formed by the <italic>E. coli </italic>protein than by the <italic>M. pneumoniae </italic>protein, in particular at relatively low protein concentrations (compare lanes 2 and 10 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Mpn </italic>SSB binding to long DNA substrates and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of DNA-binding</bold>.

To study the potential of <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB to stimulate <italic>E. coli </italic>RecA-catalyzed DNA recombination, so-called three-strand exchange reactions were performed. In these reactions, RecA promotes the transfer of one of the strands of a linear, dsDNA molecule (donor) to a complementary, circular ssDNA molecule (acceptor), resulting in a double-stranded, circular product and a linear, single-stranded product (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Mpn </italic>SSB promotes <italic>E. coli </italic>RecA-catalyzed three-strand DNA transfer</bold>.

Consequently, <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB may play a similar, crucial role as <italic>E. coli </italic>SSB in DNA recombination processes. The elucidation of the activities of <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB can therefore be considered an important step in unraveling the recombinatorial events that may occur in the genome of <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic>, and which may play a pivotal role in antigenic variation of this bacterium.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In order to assess whether recombination between RepMP elements within the genome of <italic>M. pneumoniae </italic>lies at the heart of antigenic variation of this bacterium, we set out to identify the proteins that may be involved in DNA recombination. Previously, four <italic>M. pneumoniae </italic>ORFs were proposed to code for proteins that could play a role in DNA recombination: MPN229, MPN490, MPN535 and MPN536 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These ORFs show sequence similarity with the <italic>E. coli </italic>genes encoding SSB, RecA, RuvA and RuvB, respectively. Up until now, only one of these four ORFs, i.e. MPN535, has been subjected to a detailed study. This ORF was found to encode a RuvA homolog (<italic>Mp</italic>RuvA) which is capable of binding Holliday junctions and other branched DNA structures in a manner similar to <italic>E. coli </italic>RuvA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In contrast to <italic>E. coli </italic>RuvA, however, <italic>Mp</italic>RuvA did not support branch migration mediated by <italic>E. coli </italic>RuvB. <italic>Mp</italic>RuvA was also found to differ from <italic>E. coli </italic>RuvA in its inability to allow <italic>E. coli </italic>RuvC to stably bind a <italic>Mp</italic>RuvA-bound DNA junction complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition, <italic>Mp</italic>RuvA was unable to promote DNA repair in <italic>E. coli ruvA </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These findings clearly illustrated that the DNA recombination machinery in <italic>M. pneumoniae </italic>may differ considerably from that in <italic>E. coli</italic>. In agreement with this notion, we found the <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB protein to differ in several characteristics from its <italic>E. coli </italic>counterpart. First, the sequence similarity between these proteins is rather low (17% identity). Second, <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB and <italic>E. coli </italic>SSB appear to diverge in the way by which they assemble on long, single-stranded DNA substrates. This was illustrated by the heterogeneity of the DNA-protein complexes formed by <italic>E. coli </italic>SSB, whereas complexes formed by <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB appeared rather homogeneous in size (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The heterogeneous size of these <italic>E. coli </italic>SSB-DNA complexes may be indicative of the non-random distribution of the protein on DNA substrates, reflecting the cooperative DNA-binding activity of <italic>E. coli </italic>SSB (see Lohman and Ferrari for a review)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Nevertheless, <italic>E. coli </italic>SSB can interact with ssDNA in different binding modes, each having different characteristics, including cooperativity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These binding modes were found to be dependent on the solution conditions, such as protein to DNA ratio, salt concentration and nucleotide sequence of the DNA substrates. Although <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB appears to bind with a significantly lower level of cooperativity than its <italic>E. coli </italic>counterpart in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, it is possible that cooperative binding by <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB is also strongly dependent on the binding conditions used. In our study, these conditions may not have been optimal for <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB cooperativity.</p><p>Another factor that plays an eminent role in protein-DNA complex formation is the multimeric state of the protein. <italic>E. coli </italic>SSB was reported to form homotetramers in solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB protein also appears to exist as a tetramer in solution. With regard to the oligomeric status of <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB, is interesting to note that the bacterial SSBs that have previously been analyzed can be divided in separate groups on the basis of their oligomeric status and number of OB DNA-binding domains per monomer. The most prominent group consists of proteins that contain a single OB fold per monomer and function as homotetramers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Among the members of this group are the SSB proteins from <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and <italic>Herbaspirillum seropedicae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and <italic>M. pneumoniae </italic>(this study). Another group of bacterial SSB proteins appears to possess two OB folds and function as dimers. Members of this group are the SSBs from <italic>T. aquaticus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], <italic>T. thermophilus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and <italic>D. radiodurans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These proteins are considerably larger in size than those from the first group. A common feature of both groups of SSBs is that they contain four OB folds per functional protein oligomer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to the differences between the SSB proteins from <italic>E. coli </italic>and <italic>M. pneumoniae </italic>in primary sequence as well as DNA-binding characteristics, these proteins were found to be indistinguishable in their capacity to promote <italic>E. coli </italic>RecA-catalyzed DNA strand exchange reactions. In previous studies it has been shown that the SSBs from <italic>D. radiodurans </italic>and <italic>S. pneumoniae </italic>were also able to stimulate <italic>E. coli </italic>RecA protein-promoted DNA three-strand exchange reactions with at least the same efficiency as <italic>E. coli </italic>SSB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, these activities of the <italic>D. radiodurans </italic>and <italic>S. pneumoniae </italic>SSB proteins may not be regarded as unexpected, as they show, unlike <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB, a relatively high level of sequence similarity with their <italic>E. coli </italic>counterpart (38% and 31%, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB represents the <italic>M. pneumoniae </italic>counterpart of the <italic>E. coli </italic>SSB protein. As a consequence, it is likely that this protein may be involved in various aspects of the DNA metabolism of <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic>. In a study on the complete proteome of <italic>M. pneumoniae </italic>by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry, the <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB protein was the only protein detected of the four proteins that were proposed to be involved in DNA recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Studies aimed at the detection and characterization of the other three proteins, i.e. the RecA, RuvA and RuvB homologs, are currently underway. It will be important to determine whether these proteins interact and/or cooperate to catalyze homologous DNA recombination in <italic>M. pneumoniae </italic>and whether these proteins are necessary and sufficient for the recombination between RepMP elements in the bacterial genome. However, as homologs of SSB, RecA, RuvA and RuvB are found in all living organisms from bacteria to humans, it is tempting to speculate that the site-specific recombination of RepMP elements may require the activity of one or more specialized, yet unidentified proteins. The identification of such proteins and the elucidation of the DNA recombinatorial pathways in <italic>M. pneumoniae </italic>will be the main challenge of our future studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MS cloned and sequenced the <italic>Mpn </italic>SSB gene, generated most of the recombinant plasmid constructs, purified the majority of the recombinant proteins, and performed most of the DNA-binding and strand transfer experiments.
