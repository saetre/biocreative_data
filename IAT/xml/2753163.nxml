This is thought to provide an environment that allows for extensive ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing, folding, and assembly events without the interference of the array of translation factors and other ribosome-associated factors present in the cytoplasm. After the initial rRNA processing and assembly in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Venema and Tollervey, 1999</xref>), the nascent ribosomal subunits are exported out of the nucleus for final maturation in the cytoplasm (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fromont-Racine et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tschochner and Hurt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zemp and Kutay, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson, 2009</xref>). The recruitment of export factors may be a means of monitoring the progress of assembly to ensure that only correctly assembled subunits are exported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson et al., 2002</xref>). Further maturation steps in the cytoplasm are required before the subunits become translationally active. The critical event in cytoplasmic maturation of the small subunit appears to be cleavage of the rRNA to yield mature 18S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Udem and Warner, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fatica et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, no major cytoplasmic rRNA-processing events are known for the large subunit. However, multiple ATPases and GTPases act on the subunit to release trans-acting factors that were exported with the subunit and to assemble several ribosomal proteins into the subunit (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fromont-Racine et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zemp and Kutay, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson, 2009</xref>).</p><p>A critical structure of the large subunit is the ribosome stalk, comprising the factor-binding region of the GTPase-associated center. The stalk is required for recruitment of translation factors and is essential for ribosome activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ballesta and Remacha, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gonzalo and Reboud, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berk and Cate, 2007</xref>). In eukaryotic cells, it is composed of five proteins: Rpp0 (or P0) and two copies each of the acidic proteins P1 and P2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ballesta and Remacha, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krokowski et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2006</xref>). P0 is a large protein that, together with Rpl12, interacts directly with 25S rRNA and forms the base of the stalk and the binding platform for the P1 and P2 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krokowski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brice&#x000f1;o et al., 2009</xref>). Because the stalk can be isolated as a pentameric complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanson et al., 2004</xref>) and the P1 and P2 proteins facilitate the folding of P0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krokowski et al., 2005</xref>), it is likely that the entire complex is assembled together onto the ribosome. In bacterial ribosomes, L10 and L11, which correspond to eukaryotic P0 and Rpl12, bind cooperatively to helices 43 and 44 in domain II of 23S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rosendahl and Douthwaite, 1995</xref>). It is likely that eukaryotic P0 and Rpl12 show similar cooperative binding to 25S rRNA as loss of Rpl12 reduces the affinity of P0 for the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briones et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>In eukaryotes, the nucleolar protein Mrt4 is closely related to P0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zuk et al., 1999</xref>); the two proteins share a conserved N-terminal domain, which is responsible for ribosome binding, whereas P0 contains an extended C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rodriguez-Mateos et al., 2009</xref>). Mrt4 has been identified in pre-60S ribosome complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gavin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collins et al., 2007</xref>) but not in mature 60S subunits, suggesting that Mrt4 binds ribosomes at an early stage of assembly in the nucleolus. On the contrary, P0 is cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boguszewska et al., 2002</xref>) and is present in cytoplasmic pre-60S particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kressler et al., 2008</xref>) and mature 60S subunits. Based on these findings, it is assumed that Mrt4 is the nuclear paralogue of P0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rodriguez-Mateos et al., 2009</xref>) and that during assembly, Mrt4 is exchanged for P0. How Mrt4 is released to allow the assembly of P0 is not known.</p><p>Yeast Yvh1 was identified by sequence similarity to a dual-specificity phosphatase from vaccinia virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guan et al., 1992</xref>). However, the sequence conservation between these two proteins is restricted to their phosphatase domains, making it unlikely that they perform similar functions. Yvh1 and closely related proteins from other organisms have an N-terminal phosphatase domain and a C-terminal zinc-binding domain and are grouped in the atypical dual specificity phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patterson et al., 2009</xref>). Yvh1 is highly conserved throughout eukaryotes, and human Yvh1 (DUSP12) complements the slow-growth phenotype of a <italic>YVH1</italic> disruption mutant in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Muda et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we reveal the pathway for assembly of the ribosomal stalk base. We show that Yvh1 is required for release of Mrt4 from the nascent pre-60S subunit in yeast to allow assembly of the essential stalk base protein P0. Loss of Yvh1 results in the persistence of Mrt4 on pre-60S subunits and the relocalization of Mrt4 to the cytoplasm. Similarly, siRNA knockdown of the Yvh1 orthologue DUSP12 in HeLa cells leads to redistribution of MRTO4 to the cytoplasm, underscoring the role of Yvh1 as a critical factor regulating the assembly of the base of the ribosome stalk in eukaryotic cells. An accompanying paper in this issue by <related-article related-article-type="article-reference" vol="186" page="863" id="d32e279" ext-link-type="pmc">Kemmler et al.</related-article> presents similar conclusions about the role of Yvh1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Yvh1 is required for ribosome biogenesis</title><p>A recent genome-wide protein complementation assay (PCA) in yeast linked Yvh1 to Tif6, Lsg1, and Rei1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tarassov et al., 2008</xref>). These factors are all required for biogenesis of the 60S subunit, and Lsg1 and Rei1 are strictly cytoplasmic proteins (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fromont-Racine et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zemp and Kutay, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson, 2009</xref>). PCA monitors proximity (&#x02264;80 &#x000c5;) but does not report direct physical interaction between protein pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tarassov et al., 2008</xref>). Based on this PCA analysis, we speculated that Yvh1 functions in maturation of the large subunit. The two-hybrid interaction between Yvh1 and the nucleolar 60S biogenesis factor Nop7 further supported a role in 60S biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sakumoto et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p><italic>YVH1</italic> is not essential, but its deletion (<italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic>) causes a strong defect in growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guan et al., 1992</xref>). To determine whether Yvh1 acts in ribosome biogenesis, we fractionated extracts from <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> and wild-type cells by sedimentation through sucrose density gradients. We observed that the level of 60S subunits was reduced in the <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>), which was indicated by reduced free 60S levels and the appearance of halfmers, 43S preinitiation complexes that contain 40S but not 60S subunits.

To dissect which functional domain of Yvh1 is required in 60S biogenesis, several Yvh1 mutants were constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Consistent with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu and Chang, 2009</xref>), Yvh1 containing a mutation in the catalytic site of the phosphatase domain (yvh1-C117S) or deleted of the entire phosphatase domain (<italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic>N) complemented the deletion mutant, whereas Yvh1 lacking the zinc-binding domain (<italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic>C) did not (unpublished data).

However, the two proteins show distinct compartmentalization; Mrt4 is present in the nucleolus and nucleoplasm, whereas P0 is a constituent of the mature ribosome in the cytoplasm. The similarity between the two proteins and the distinct localization suggests that Mrt4 acts as a biogenesis factor for the ribosome in the nucleolus and is replaced by P0 at a later stage in assembly. Sequence alignment of Mrt4, P0 and bacterial L10 (Fig. S2), and the atomic model of bacterial L7/L12 stalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kavran and Steitz, 2007</xref>) indicate that the conserved N-terminal domain of P0 and Mrt4 is responsible for RNA binding. Additionally, Mrt4 and P0 bind to the 60S subunit in a mutually exclusive fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rodriguez-Mateos et al., 2009</xref>), further supporting the notion that the two proteins bind to the same site on the ribosome.</p><p>We considered that Yvh1 may be required for the release of Mrt4 from the subunit to allow P0 loading.

To distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed the cosedimentation of Mrt4 with ribosomes in sucrose density gradients. Mrt4 cosedimented exclusively at the position of free 60S subunits in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>), which is consistent with its role as a trans-acting factor of 60S subunits (note that these gradients do not resolve the different pre-60S and 60S species). The sedimentation pattern of Mrt4 was unaltered in a <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>), indicating that the Mrt4 observed in the cytoplasm in the absence of Yvh1 remains bound to free 60S subunits.</p><p>For further evidence that Mrt4 remained on subunits in the cytoplasm, we asked whether we could detect a shift in Mrt4 association from nuclear to cytoplasmic complexes. Rlp24, Nmd3, and Lsg1 are essential trans-acting factors in 60S ribosome biogenesis. Both Rlp24 and Nmd3 shuttle, but their steady-state distributions are primarily nuclear and cytoplasmic, respectively, whereas Lsg1 is restricted to the cytoplasm. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>, Mrt4 was depleted from the Rlp24 complex but accumulated in Nmd3, and Lsg1 immunoprecipitated complexes in a <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> mutant. Thus, in the absence of Yvh1, Mrt4 is not efficiently released from the subunit and mislocalizes to the cytoplasm.</p><p>If the persistence of Mrt4 on the subunit is responsible for the slow growth of <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells, elimination of Mrt4 may alleviate the problem. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>, the <italic>mrt4&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> single mutants were almost indistinguishable from the <italic>mrt4&#x00394; yvh1&#x00394;</italic> double mutant in growth rate, indicating an epistatic relationship between <italic>mrt4&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic>. Deletion of <italic>MRT4</italic> did not improve the growth defect of the <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> mutant, probably because deletion of <italic>MRT4</italic> itself results in a growth defect comparable to deletion of <italic>YVH1</italic>. We also tested the effect of increasing the levels of Mrt4 in <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells, reasoning that overexpressing Mrt4 could restore the nuclear pool of Mrt4 to support 60S biogenesis. However, if Yvh1 were absolutely required for release of Mrt4, increasing Mrt4 levels would be expected to drive more Mrt4 onto nascent subunits. Without a mechanism for its release, this could be deleterious in a <italic>yvh1</italic> mutant.

We confirmed this suppression of <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> by Mrt4-G68D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). To determine whether Mrt4-G68D suppresses the 60S ribosome biogenesis defects of <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic>, we analyzed the polysome profile of <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells expressing Mrt4-G68D as the sole copy of <italic>MRT4</italic>. Expression of Mrt4-G68D in <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells fully restored the polysome profile of <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells, reversing the free subunit imbalance and eliminating the halfmers evident in the <italic>yvh1</italic> deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>).

Gly68 is in a region of Mrt4 that is highly conserved among Mrt4, P0, and bacterial L10 (Fig. S3), and flanking residues make direct contact with 23S RNA in the <italic>H. marismortui</italic> structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diaconu et al., 2005</xref>). In this model, Gly68 is at the Mrt4&#x02013;25S rRNA interface located in a tight turn of the peptide backbone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, D and E</xref>). Introduction of Asp at this position would likely give electrostatic repulsion or distort the local structure of Mrt4, thereby weakening its affinity for the RNA. A weakened interaction with the ribosome could allow Mrt4 to be displaced from the ribosome without the need for Yvh1, explaining the mechanism of suppression. This would be similar to mutations in Tif6 that weaken its binding to the ribosome and bypass the requirement for Efl1 and Sdo1 to release Tif6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Senger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Menne et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether Mrt4-G68D has reduced affinity for the ribosome, as we predicted from the structure model, we compared the salt sensitivity of the association of Mrt4 and Mrt4-G68D with 60S subunits. We found that the binding of Mrt4-G68D to the ribosome was significantly more salt sensitive than Mrt4. At 100 mM NaCl, the majority of wild-type and mutant Mrt4 was ribosome bound. However, at 200 and 300 mM NaCl, the majority of Mrt4-G68D was released from the subunit, whereas wild-type Mrt4 was largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F</xref>). The weakened affinity of Mrt4-G68D for the 60S subunit likely obviates the need for Yvh1 to release Mrt4. Because Mrt4-G68D fully complements the growth defect of an <italic>mrt4&#x00394;</italic> mutant (unpublished data), the affinity of Mrt4-G68D for the ribosome must be finely balanced between binding strongly enough to support ribosome biogenesis but not so strongly that it requires Yvh1 for its release. It may seem counterintuitive that mutant Mrt4 with weaker affinity for 60S subunits is dominant, implying that it competes efficiently with wild-type Mrt4 for binding to the ribosome. However, in <italic>yvh1</italic> mutants, wild-type Mrt4 is depleted from the nucleus because it is not released from subunits in the cytoplasm. This allows mutant Mrt4-G68D to load onto subunits effectively without competition from wild-type Mrt4.</p></sec><sec><title>Rpl12 is required for the recruitment of Yvh1 to the ribosome</title><p>Based on the structure of the archaeal 50S subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, D and E</xref>), Rpl12 binds to the GTPase-associated domain of 25S rRNA, which is adjacent to Mrt4 in the pre-60S or P0 in the mature 60S subunit. Together, Rpl12 and P0 form the stalk base. Because Mrt4 is released by Yvh1 but Rpl12 remains in the Yvh1&#x02013;60S complex (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>), we speculated that Rpl12 might be required for Yvh1 binding on the 60S subunits. This idea was tested in an <italic>rpl12</italic> deletion strain. In yeast, Rpl12 is encoded by two genes, <italic>RPL12A</italic> and <italic>RPL12B</italic>. The double deletion (<italic>rpl12&#x00394;&#x00394;</italic>) is viable but slow growing.

However, Yvh1 was quantitatively lost from 60S subunits from the <italic>rpl12&#x00394;&#x00394;</italic> strain. This indicates that Rpl12 is required for Yvh1 binding to the large subunit, suggesting that Rpl12 comprises part or all of the binding site for Yvh1.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Rpl12 is required for Yvh1 binding to the 60S subunit.</bold> (A) The binding of Yvh1 to 60S subunits was assayed in W303 and 6EA1 (<italic>rpl12&#x00394;&#x00394;</italic>) expressing Yvh1-myc (pAJ2020) by sedimentation through sucrose cushions at 100 mM NaCl.

All three bait proteins immunoprecipitated similar levels of 60S subunits, which were monitored by Western blotting for Rpl8.

The steady-state distribution of Yvh1 is cytoplasmic and nuclear, whereas P0 is cytoplasmic. The localization of Yvh1 suggests that it shuttles and is consistent with a report that Yvh1 interacts physically with the nuclear 60S biogenesis factor Nop7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sakumoto et al., 2001</xref>). However, the cytoplasmic distribution of P0 does not preclude that it might also shuttle. If these proteins shuttle, we would expect their export to be linked to the 60S subunit, assuming that they are exported with the subunit. Because 60S export depends on Crm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ho et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gadal et al., 2001</xref>), we treated cells with the Crm1 inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) and tested whether Yvh1 or P0 was trapped in the nucleus. Under conditions where export of Nmd3 and Rpl25 was blocked, Yvh1 accumulated in the nucleus, although the degree to which Yvh1 accumulated appeared less than that of Nmd3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref> and not depicted). However, P0 remained in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). Although this result is consistent with the idea that Yvh1 shuttles out of the nucleus while bound to the 60S subunit, it does not rule out the possibility that Yvh1 is exported separately from the subunit but in a Crm1-dependent fashion. As an additional test, we examined Yvh1 localization in an <italic>nmd3-1</italic> mutant. The <italic>nmd3-1</italic> allele expresses a mutant protein that binds to pre-60S particles in the nucleus but is truncated for its C-terminal, leucine-rich nuclear export signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ho et al., 2000</xref>) and thus specifically impairs 60S export. This mutant showed strong nuclear accumulation of Yvh1 but not P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). These results suggest that Yvh1 shuttles and is exported from the nucleus bound to the nascent 60S particle, whereas P0 is restricted to the cytoplasm.</p><p>In an attempt to test whether Yvh1 could function in the nucleus, we fused the well-characterized nuclear localization sequence from the SV40 large T antigen to the amino terminus of Yvh1.

Consistent with the localization of Mrt4 in yeast, MRTO4 was localized in the nucleus and nucleolus in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 C</xref>, top).

The relocalization of MRTO4 from the nucleoplasm to the cytoplasm is consistent with our observation in yeast that Yvh1 is required for the release of Mrt4. However, it was surprising to us that the nucleolar pool of MRTO4 was also not diminished. In wild-type cells, MRTO4 is concentrated in the nucleolus, suggesting that its residence time in the nucleolus is long compared with that in the nucleoplasm. Because the DUSP12 depletion was not complete, MRTO4 is presumably released from subunits, but at a reduced rate. Under these conditions, if the recycling of MRTO4 to the nucleolus is slower than its export from the nucleus, we would expect the observed depletion of the nucleoplasmic pool preferentially over the nucleolar pool.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have defined the assembly pathway for the ribosome stalk, which is an essential structure of the ribosome that recruits and activates translation factors. In eukaryotes, the stalk is composed of a pentameric complex of P0 and two heterodimers of the P1 and P2 proteins. The stalk is anchored to the ribosome through the N-terminal, RNA-binding domain of P0 and interaction with Rpl12, corresponding to bacterial L10 and L11, respectively. However, during initial assembly of the ribosome in the nucleolus, the P0 paralogue Mrt4 is used in place of P0. Consequently, a critical step in maturation of a functional ribosome is the exchange of Mrt4 with P0. We have shown that the atypical dual-specificity phosphatase Yvh1 (DUSP12 in human) is required for the release of Mrt4 to facilitate P0 loading. The ribosome-binding domain but not the phosphatase activity is required for Mrt4 release. This pathway is highly conserved in eukaryotes, indicated by the fact that DUSP12 complements the function of yeast Yvh1 to release Mrt4, and depletion of DUSP12 from human cells results in a failure to release MRTO4, which is analogous to the phenotype resulting from deletion of <italic>YVH1</italic> in yeast.</p><sec><title>The order of events</title><p>Our analysis suggests a linear series of events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>). We propose that Yvh1 binds to pre-60S subunits through its interaction with Rpl12 and thereby releases Mrt4. It is possible that an additional factor acts with Yvh1 in the removal of Mrt4, as we were unable to trigger release of Mrt4 from subunits with purified Yvh1 in vitro (unpublished data). Physical and genetic interactions with <italic>NOP7</italic> and the GTPase <italic>NOG1</italic> could indicate a role for these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Honma et al., 2006</xref>). The localization of Mrt4 was not altered in mutants known to be required for other late maturation events, including <italic>drg1</italic>, <italic>rei1</italic>, <italic>efl1</italic>, or <italic>lsg1</italic> mutants (unpublished data), suggesting that none of these factors act with Yvh1. The Yvh1&#x02013;pre-60S particle is a discrete intermediate that contains neither Mrt4 nor P0. Yvh1 is subsequently released, and P0, and probably the P1 and P2 dimers as well, are loaded onto the subunit. We do not yet know whether the removal of Yvh1 requires additional factors or if P0 itself is capable of displacing Yvh1; all other known trans-acting factors on the 60S subunit in the cytoplasm require an ATPase or GTPase for their release.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p><bold>Model for the pathway of assembling the stalk base in eukaryotes.</bold> Mrt4 and Rpl12 facilitate the correct folding of the RNA of the stalk base during ribosome biogenesis in the nucleolus.

We have provided evidence that Yvh1 shuttles and is exported from the nucleus with the pre-60S particle. Yvh1 accumulates in the nucleus upon treatment with LMB and in an export-defective <italic>nmd3-1</italic> mutant. We drove Yvh1 into the nucleus by providing it with a strong NLS. This protein was fully functional, suggesting that it can act in the nucleus. Furthermore, the two-hybrid interaction between Yvh1 and the nuclear protein Nop7 suggests a nuclear function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sakumoto et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast, in the accompanying paper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kemmler et al. (2009)</xref> suggest that Yvh1 is restricted to the cytoplasm and Mrt4 shuttles. It is clearly the case that in the absence of Yvh1, Mrt4 is exported with the pre-60S subunit. In their study, Yvh1 was tethered to the cytoplasmic protein Arc1. This protein was fully functional, suggesting that Yvh1 can function when restricted to the cytoplasm. Presently, it is difficult to reconcile these different results. Indeed, it is possible that Yvh1 can release Mrt4 in either cellular compartment. In contrast to Yvh1, we and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kemmler et al. (2009)</xref> both found no evidence that P0 enters the nucleus. Using fluorescence techniques, we could not detect a nuclear pool of P0 in wild-type cells nor could we trap P0 in the nucleus by inhibiting export by different means. Thus, we conclude that the loading of P0 is exclusively cytoplasmic.</p></sec><sec><title>Is there more than one pathway to release Mrt4?</title><p>In the absence of Yvh1, Mrt4 persists on 60S subunits in the cytoplasm but is not found on polysomes. Because P0 is essential, <italic>yvh1</italic> mutants must continue to synthesize ribosomes with P0 despite the fact that the persistence of Mrt4 in these cells blocks P0 binding. It is possible that Mrt4 can be released from subunits independently of Yvh1 perhaps by direct displacement by P0. However, overexpressing P0 did not suppress a <italic>yvh1</italic>&#x00394; mutant. Alternatively, Yvh1 may be absolutely required for the release of Mrt4. In this scenario, the persistence of Mrt4 on subunits in a <italic>yvh1</italic> mutant will prevent the loading of P0 onto the Mrt4-containing subunits. In the absence of Mrt4 recycling to the nucleus, the nuclear pool of Mrt4 would be depleted, and because Mrt4 is not essential, these cells will continue to synthesize ribosomes effectively in the absence of Mrt4. Subunits made without Mrt4 will not require Yvh1 before P0 can load. We found that overexpression of Mrt4 was strongly dominant negative and reduced P0 loading in a <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> mutant. This is the expected result if Mrt4 requires Yvh1 for its release. Thus, we favor the idea that Yvh1 is required for the release of Mrt4 and that in the absence of Yvh1, the persistence of Mrt4 prevents assembly of the stalk, resulting in inactive 60S subunits.</p><p>The suppression of <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> by high copy <italic>RPL12</italic> may also be explained by the deficiency for Mrt4 in the nucleus in the absence of Yvh1. Assuming that Rpl12 and Mrt4 bind 25S rRNA cooperatively, as observed for bacterial L10 and L11 on 23S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rosendahl and Douthwaite, 1995</xref>), the depletion of Mrt4 from the nucleus could impair the binding of Rpl12 to the nascent ribosome. Increasing Rpl12 levels may overcome this defect.</p></sec><sec><title>Why is Yvh1 needed for 60S subunit biogenesis?</title><p>Although Yvh1 is needed for the release of Mrt4, Mrt4-G68D efficiently bypasses the need for Yvh1. Why then have cells evolved the additional factor Yvh1? A similar question can be posed for other factors involved in 60S export and maturation. For example, mutations have been identified in Tif6 that bypass the requirement for the Tif6 release factors Sdo1 and Efl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">B&#x000e9;cam et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Senger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Menne et al., 2007</xref>), and mutations in Arx1 bypass the requirement for its release factor, Rei1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hung and Johnson, 2006</xref>). It seems likely that these release factors provide an added level of control of the final maturation steps of the 60S subunit. They could ensure that the pre-60S factors remain stably bound to the subunit with high affinity until the subunits reach the cytoplasm where they are released. Factors with reduced affinity would be expected to have a higher off rate and perhaps dissociate prematurely from the subunit. It is also possible that the cytoplasmic factors such as Yvh1 can be regulated by cellular signals, thereby monitoring, for example, the metabolic or translational capacity of the cell. Along these lines, DUSP12 was indentified as a protein that interacts with and accelerates the activity of glucokinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mu&#x000f1;oz-Alonso et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting the possibility of signaling between ribosome biogenesis and glycolysis.</p><p>Although the phosphatase domain of Yvh1 is highly conserved throughout the Yvh1/DUSP12 subfamily of atypical protein phosphatases, mutating the catalytic cysteine of Yvh1 had no effect on its role in releasing Mrt4 and did not yield a growth phenotype. Many dual-specificity protein phosphatases act on mitogen-activated protein kinases; however, the atypical dual-specificity phosphatases lack the specificity domain of these phosphatases and act on diverse substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patterson et al., 2009</xref>). It is reasonable to think that the substrate for Yvh1 would be a ribosomal protein or biogenesis factor. However, the atypical phosphatase DUSP11 (PIR1) hydrolyzes 5&#x02032;-tri- and -diphosphates from RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deshpande et al., 1999</xref>), raising the possibility that Yvh1 could have a role in RNA processing.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional compartmentalization of ribosome assembly</title><p>Why have cells evolved a complicated assembly pathway in which ribosomes are first assembled in the nucleolus with Mrt4 only to be replaced by the mature ribosomal protein P0 in the cytoplasm? It would seem more economical to assemble fully functional ribosomes that contain P0 from the start. We suggest that this reflects an additional level of separation of ribosome assembly from translation that we will call functional compartmentalization. This would seem unnecessary if there was rigid spatial separation of trans-acting factors and the nuclear compartment. In this case, the ribosomal proteins would all enter the nucleus for assembly into a subunit, obviating the need for preassembly with an orthologue. However, this strict separation of assembly and function may be difficult to achieve if, for instance, a translation factor has high affinity for a ribosomal protein that serves as its binding site, as this could result in nuclear import of the translation factor by virtue of associating with its cognate ribosomal protein. In addition, functionally compartmentalizing assembly from translation may also be important in organisms with an open mitosis where translation factors could gain access to the nucleus as the nuclear envelope is reassembled.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Strains, plasmids, and media</title><p>All <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>.
