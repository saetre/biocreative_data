Two recombinant phage and four cosmid clones were analysed in detail by restriction mapping and sequencing. Each one contained a single VKI sequence. Two of these six sequences are potentially functional VK genes and four are pseudogenes. Two pseudogenes derived from different genomic DNAs are highly homologous and are therefore either allelic variants or the products of a recent duplication event. Comparisons of our sequences with all fully determined human VKI amino acid and DNA sequences reveal identical segments which at first sight appear like minigenes. But these segments do not coincide with the subregions and some of the segments include both, framework and complementarity determining regions (FR, CDR, ref. 2). The findings may be explained by an evolutionary model generating composite genes by gene conversion and selection.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00331-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5249"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00331-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5250"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00331-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5251"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00331-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5252"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00331-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5253"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00331-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5254"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00331-0117.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5255"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00331-0118.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5256"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00331-0119.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5257"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00331-0120.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5258"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00331-0121.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5259"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00331-0122.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5260"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00331-0123.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5261"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00331-0124.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5262"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00331-0125.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5263"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
