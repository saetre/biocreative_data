They have various functions including genome protection, and the control of gene expression, development and heterochromatin formation. RNA interference (RNAi) is the post-transcriptional destruction of RNA, which is mediated by a ribonucleoprotein complex that contains, among several components, RNA helicases and Argonaute proteins. RNAi is functional in trypanosomes, protozoan parasites that separated very early from the main eukaryotic lineage and exhibit several intriguing features in terms of the control of gene expression. In this report, we investigated the functions of RNAi in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>By searching through genome databases, novel Argonaute-like proteins were identified in several protozoa that belong to the kinetoplastid order, a group of organisms that diverged early from the main eukaryotic lineage. <italic>T. brucei </italic>possesses two Argonaute-like genes termed <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>and <italic>TbPWI1</italic>. Dual transient transfection assays suggest that TbAGO1, but not TbPWI1, is involved in RNAi. The entire coding region of <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>was deleted by double gene knockout. <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>cells turned out to be completely resistant to RNAi generated either by transfected double-stranded RNA or by expression of an inverted repeat. <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>cells were viable but showed a dramatically reduced growth rate. This was probably due to defects in mitosis and abnormal chromosome segregation as revealed by <italic>in situ </italic>analysis. The RNAi and growth phenotypes were complemented by the inducible expression of a GFP::TbAGO1 fusion protein that revealed the cytoplasmic location of the protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The requirement of TbAGO1 for RNAi in trypanosomes demonstrates the evolutionary ancient involvement of Argonaute proteins in RNAi silencing processes. RNAi-deficient <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>cells showed numerous defects in chromosome segregation and mitotic spindle assembly. We propose a working hypothesis in which RNAi would be involved in heterochromatin formation at the centromere and therefore in chromosome segregation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>RNA silencing includes a wide range of post-transcriptional phenomena in eukaryotes, such as post-transcriptional gene silencing in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], quelling in fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], homology-dependent gene silencing in ciliates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and RNA interference (RNAi) in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The latter is a process in which the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of a given sequence induces the rapid, efficient and specific degradation of the mRNA with the corresponding sequence. In most cases, long dsRNA is fragmented into 21 &#x02013; 26 bp dsRNAs, termed short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], by the action of Dicer, a type III ribonuclease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These siRNAs are part of an enzymatic complex that scan RNA and target those with the identical sequence to that of the siRNAs for destruction. Other types of proteins involved in RNAi include RNA helicases, Argonaute proteins, and, in some species, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Mechanistic aspects of RNA silencing are remarkably well conserved among organisms as diverse as protists, fungi, plants and animals, indicating that it has important functions. One such function appears to be the protection of the genome from unwanted nucleic acids, such as those expressed by viruses in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], or those originating from transposons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Additional functions have been unveiled, such as the control of gene expression during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], genome rearrangement in ciliates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and the formation of heterochromatin and control of gene expression in plants and fission yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Trypanosomes are protozoan parasites belonging to the order Kinetoplastida, which diverged very early from the main eukaryotic lineage. These unicellular organisms are responsible for several tropical diseases including sleeping sickness in central Africa, which is caused by the species <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>. This species is found alternately in the digestive tract of an insect vector, the tsetse fly, and the bloodstream of a mammalian host. It adapts to these different environments by activating specific programs of differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Trypanosomes develop as extracellular parasites and escape the host immune response by means of a sophisticated process of antigenic variation. Their surface is entirely covered by a dense coat composed of a single type of molecule, the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). Trypanosomes possess several hundreds of <italic>VSG </italic>genes scattered throughout their genome but these can only be expressed from one of ~20 expression sites, with only a single site being active at one time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Trypanosomes were among the first organisms in which RNAi was identified. RNAi was detected in mutants expressing dsRNA of genes coding for the paraflagellar rod A protein (PFRA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and for tubulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. RNAi was rapidly exploited as a powerful tool for the study of gene function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. As in other organisms, long dsRNAs are degraded into siRNAs and incorporated into a ribonucleoprotein complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. About 10 &#x02013; 20 % of siRNAs are associated with translating polyribosomes, suggesting a possible interaction between RNAi and the translation machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Cloning and sequencing of trypanosome siRNA has revealed a large number of endogenous short RNAs corresponding to the INGI and SLACS retroposon elements, suggesting that one function of RNAi could be the control of mobile genetic elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Interestingly, such mobile elements are missing from the genome of the related parasite <italic>Leishmania</italic>, where RNAi does not seem to be functional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>To evaluate the role of RNAi in the control of gene expression and in the general biology of trypanosomes, we searched for molecular components of the RNAi machinery and investigated their function. We identified two Argonaute proteins, TbAGO1 and TbPWI1 and demonstrate that the first is essential for RNAi. Moreover, we show that cells deprived of TbAGO1 display numerous defects in chromosome segregation and mitotic spindle assembly. Finally, we propose a working model to explain the observed results.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of new Argonaute proteins</title><p>In order to investigate RNAi functions in trypanosomes, we first searched candidate genes potentially involved in this mechanism. We screened various protist genome databases with the sequence of genes known to be involved in RNAi in other organisms. The genomes analysed were from <italic>T. brucei</italic>, <italic>T. cruzi </italic>and <italic>Leishmania major </italic>(all belonging to the order Kinetoplastida), from <italic>Giardia lamblia </italic>and from <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. Two distinct Argonaute-like proteins, TbAGO1 and TbPWI1, were identified in <italic>T. brucei </italic>whereas single proteins were found in <italic>G. lamblia </italic>(GlAGO1), <italic>T. cruzi </italic>(TcPWI1) and <italic>L. major </italic>(LmPWI1). Searches through the complete genome sequence of <italic>P. falciparum </italic>failed to identify any Argonaute-like genes. These proteins were examined for the presence of motifs and aligned with other members of the Argonaute protein family from several eukaryotic species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). TbAGO1 is a protein of 892 amino acids, with a calculated molecular weight of 98015 Da and with an estimated pI of 9.18. It possesses a PAZ and a Piwi domain, typical signatures of Argonaute proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The Piwi domain shows 20 &#x02013; 31 % homology with Piwi domains of Argonaute proteins from other species (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file: 1</xref>), whereas the PAZ domain shows weaker conservation. In addition, TbAGO1 contains an amino-terminal RGG box (a nucleic acid-binding domain), with 10 copies of the arginine-glycine-glycine motif. This feature has not been observed previously in Argonaute proteins from other species. However, detailed analysis of the poly-glutamine (poly-Q) box present at the amino-terminal end of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>AGO1 protein revealed the presence of five copies of the RGG motif (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Argonaute-like proteins in protists. <bold>A. </bold>Schematic representation of Argonaute-like proteins.

Neither possesses an RGG box. These two proteins show high homology in their Piwi domain (55.4% identity), with a specific insertion that is not found in Argonaute proteins from other organisms (see supplementary data).</p></sec><sec><title>TbAGO1, but not TbPWI1, is required for RNAi</title><p>We explored whether TbAGO1 and TbPWI1 are involved in RNAi silencing in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. Since trypanosomes display different life cycle stages, each with a specific pattern of protein expression, we first checked whether <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>and <italic>TbPWI1 </italic>were expressed in the procyclic culture stage used for this study. Real time PCR analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) showed that RNA for both <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>and <italic>TbPWI1 </italic>were expressed in this stage.</p><p>To evaluate the possible participation of TbAGO1 and TbPWI1 in RNAi in trypanosomes, we used a double transient transfection assay as developed in <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Trypanosomes were first transfected with dsRNA targeting RNA coding for proteins potentially involved in RNAi and returned to culture for 10 h. To evaluate the consequences of silencing the candidate protein on the behaviour of the RNAi machinery, a second dsRNA targeting a marker gene was introduced. We selected the <italic>PFRA </italic>gene as a marker: this gene codes for an abundant flagellar protein that is essential for cell motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Loss of PFRA <italic>via </italic>RNAi produces a viable and obvious paralysis phenotype that can easily be monitored by immunofluorescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Candidate genes included <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>and <italic>TbPWI1</italic>, as well as <italic>green fluorescent protein </italic>(<italic>GFP</italic>) as a control. Transfection of <italic>GFP </italic>dsRNA did not modify the ability of <italic>PFRA </italic>dsRNA to subsequently silence PFRA expression, producing the usual number of paralysed trypanosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In contrast, the introduction of <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>dsRNA led to a five-fold reduction in the efficiency of RNAi generated by <italic>PFRA </italic>dsRNA. Electroporation of <italic>TbPWI1 </italic>dsRNA led to normal <italic>PFRA </italic>silencing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). These results were reproduced six times, including with two different markers (tubulin and flagellum adhesion glycoprotein-1 [FLA1]). These data suggest that TbAGO1, but not TbPWI1, is involved in RNAi.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>TbAGO1 is required for RNAi in transient transfection assays. <bold>A. </bold>Wild-type trypanosomes were first electroporated with dsRNA corresponding to the indicated genes, returned to culture for 10 h and then transfected with <italic>PFRA </italic>dsRNA.

GFP::TbAGO1 protein levels were monitored by FACS analysis. Only <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>dsRNA was able to reduce GFP::TbAGO1 fluorescent protein levels (notice shift of thick red line compared to blue or green thick lines). Cells were transfected with the <italic>PFRA </italic>dsRNA 10 h later and PFRA silencing was monitored as above (inset). This experiment was carried out twice and yielded similar results.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1741-7007-1-2-2"/></fig><p>To confirm that the observed reduction in RNAi silencing activity was due to the knockdown of TbAGO1 RNA and protein, we generated a cell line expressing TbAGO1 fused to GFP under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). We fused the <italic>GFP </italic>gene upstream of <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>as downstream fusions have turned out to be non-functional in other organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This construct allows monitoring of the TbAGO1 silencing effect by visualisation of the GFP::TbAGO1 fluorescent protein. The cell line expressing the GFP::TbAGO1 protein was transfected with <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>dsRNA or with dsRNA from the unrelated <italic>TbGRP1 </italic>gene as control. <italic>GFP </italic>dsRNA could not be used as a control in this experiment as the <italic>GFP </italic>gene was fused to <italic>TbAGO1</italic>. Cells were returned to culture for 10 h and then transfected with <italic>PFRA </italic>dsRNA. FACS analysis revealed a ~10-fold reduction of GFP::TbAGO1 fluorescence after introduction of <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>dsRNA, confirming that <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>is at least partially silenced during the assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In these conditions, PFRA silencing was strongly diminished (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, inset), reproducing the results obtained with wild type (WT) cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In contrast, cells electroporated with the control <italic>TbGRP1 </italic>dsRNA did not show any reduction in their GFP::TbAGO1 fluorescence signal compared with untransfected controls, and subsequent introduction of <italic>PFRA </italic>dsRNA produced the usual PFRA silencing effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). These data indicate that the observed inhibition of RNAi silencing was indeed due to the reduction in TbAGO1 abundance.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Generation of <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>(KO) and <italic>TbAGO1-/- +GFP::TbAGO1</italic><sup><italic>Ti </italic></sup>cell lines. <bold>A. </bold>Schematic representation of the endogenous <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>locus (top), and of the constructs used for double <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>knock-out (middle) and for expression of GFP::TbAGO1 fusion protein (bottom).

The first allele of <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>was replaced by the <italic>BSD </italic>marker before the obtained cell line was transfected with the <italic>NEO </italic>construct to replace the second allele. Viable double-resistant cells were obtained and further characterised. Southern blotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) and PCR analysis (data not shown) of genomic DNA from the double-resistant cells confirmed that both constructs had integrated at the expected locus and that all endogenous copies of <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>had been deleted. The cell line was subcloned and termed <italic>TbAGO1-/-</italic>. <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>cells were further transfected with plasmid pGFPTbAGO1430 for expression of the fusion protein GFP::TbAGO1 in order to attempt functional complementation experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). As the <italic>GFP::TbAGO1 </italic>fusion gene in this plasmid is expressed <italic>via </italic>a tetracycline-inducible promoter, we further transformed these cells with plasmid pHD360 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] that expresses the tet-repressor, allowing tetracycline-inducible control of expression of GFP::TbAGO1. The cell line was named <italic>TbAGO1-/-+GFP::TbAGO1</italic><sup><italic>Ti</italic></sup>. Northern blotting analysis confirmed that the <italic>GFP::TbAGO1 </italic>RNA was expressed in the presence of tetracycline (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).

Immunofluorescence analysis with a PFRA-specific antibody failed to detect a single cell with reduced PFRA abundance. Therefore, RNAi silencing was completely abolished in the knockout cell line, demonstrating that TbAGO1 was essential for RNAi. A similar result was observed in the <italic>TbAGO1-/-+GFP::TbAGO1</italic><sup><italic>Ti </italic></sup>cell line as long as the fusion protein was not expressed. In contrast, expression of GFP::TbAGO1 was sufficient to restore <italic>PFRA </italic>silencing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), therefore complementing the phenotype and confirming that TbAGO1 is required for RNAi in trypanosomes.

The doubling time of the knockout cell line was ~15 h as opposed to 8&#x02013;9 h for WT or complemented cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). In an effort to understand the reduced growth rate of mutant cells, we monitored their cell biological behaviour. During the cell cycle, trypanosomes need to replicate two single unit genomes: the nuclear and the mitochondrial genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Trypanosomes possess a single mitochondrion, the kinetoplast, which contains a large DNA network that is visible under light microscopy. The kinetoplast duplicates first, followed by the nucleus, defining three cell cycle stages: cells with one kinetoplast and one nucleus (1K1N), cells with two kinetoplasts and one nucleus (2K1N) and cells with two kinetoplasts and two nuclei (2K2N) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Cultures of <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>cells showed normal proportions of these three sub-populations compared to WT or <italic>TbAGO1-/-+GFP::TbAGO1</italic><sup><italic>Ti </italic></sup>cells grown in the presence of tetracycline (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), despite the presence of discrete modifications. However, <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>cultures exhibited a &#x0003e;30-fold increase in the proportion of cells with one kinetoplast but with no nucleus, also called zoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and a &#x0003e;20-fold increase in the proportion of cells with one kinetoplast but with two nuclei (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). These cell types are rare in normal, healthy cultures and are the consequences of a defect in nuclear mitosis. The classic nuclear mitosis / cytokinesis checkpoint is absent in trypanosomes, where cytokinesis is linked to kinetoplast duplication and segregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Therefore cells with delayed nuclear mitosis that have managed to duplicate and segregate their kinetoplasts can undergo cytokinesis to produce one daughter cell without a nucleus but with a kinetoplast and another daughter cell with a kinetoplast and one or two nuclei, if mitosis can be completed.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>cells show delayed growth rate and abnormal cell types. <bold>A. </bold>Growth curve of wild type (W.T., red squares), <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>(K.O., blue crosses), or of <italic>TbAGO1-/- +GFP::TbAGO1</italic><sup><italic>Ti </italic></sup>cells grown in the absence (-TET, non-induced, open diamonds and dotted green line) or in the presence of tetracycline (+TET, induced, closed diamonds and full green line). <bold>B. </bold>Analysis of cell types within populations of wild-type (W.T.), <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>(K.O.), or of <italic>TbAGO1-/- +GFP::TbAGO1</italic><sup><italic>Ti </italic></sup>cells grown in the presence of tetracycline (K.O.+GFP::TbAGO1+TET). 1K1N, cells with one kinetoplast and one nucleus; 2K1N, cells with two kinetoplasts and one nucleus; 2K2N, cells with two kinetoplasts and two nuclei; 1K0N, cells with one kinetoplast but without nucleus (zoids) and 1K2N, cells with one kinetoplast and two nuclei.

We therefore examined the state of mitotic cells in cultures from WT, <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>and <italic>TbAGO1-/-+GFP::TbAGO1</italic><sup><italic>Ti </italic></sup>cells grown in the presence of tetracycline (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Trypanosomes were fixed and stained with 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to visualise kinetoplast and nuclear DNA and with the anti-tubulin KMX-1 antibody to identify the mitotic spindle. In WT trypanosomes, mitotic cells are identified by the presence of a large nucleus and two well-separated kinetoplasts (2K1N cells). The mitotic spindle is easily recognisable, stretching in the direction of the long axis of the cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, top panel). The vast majority of such 2K1N wild-type cells displayed a normal spindle (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), as expected from previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In contrast, more than 20 % of the <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>cells at the 2K1N stage did not possess a recognisable spindle at all, and of those with a spindle, almost half displayed various abnormalities (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In many cases, the spindle was not fully assembled and failed to show the typical elongation seen in WT trypanosomes. For example, the <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>cell shown on the central panel of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> is at the same stage of its cell cycle as its WT counterpart shown on the top panel, judging from the distance separating the two kinetoplasts. Intriguingly, in the knockout cell, the spindle was barely formed, being very short and with no recognisable spindle poles when compared with the WT cell in the top panel. Another frequent defect was the presence of a large bent spindle, showing a bundle of microtubules present on only one side of the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, bottom panel). In several cases, the DNA staining pattern of the mitotic nucleus also looked unusual. Instead of a large, relatively homogenous amount of DNA (trypanosome chromosomes do not condense at mitosis), patches of disperse intense staining were frequently observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, central panel).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Spindle formation is frequently aberrant in <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>cells.

To assess whether nuclear segregation was complete, we used the monoclonal antibody L1C6, which recognises an unknown antigen localised to the nucleolus (L. Kohl and K. Gull, unpublished observations). In trypanosomes, the nucleolus is not dispersed at mitosis, which is intranuclear, but it is segregated along the mitotic spindle. In non-mitotic WT cells, this antibody stained the nucleolus, producing one bright spot per nucleus (data not shown). During early anaphase, the signal looked like a bright bar (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, left), corresponding to the nucleolus that is being segregated, since the nucleolus and nuclear membrane remain present throughout the trypanosome cell cycle. At telophase, both nuclei contained a well-defined nucleolus, recognisable as a bright spot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, centre and right). Observation of binucleated cells of the <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>mutant revealed that one third of them displayed unequal distribution of the L1C6 nucleolar marker, suggesting that nuclei did not inherit the same amount of nucleolar material (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). In some cells, spots of staining appeared in the cytoplasm between the two nuclei, suggesting delayed or lost material (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>, central panels). In addition, DAPI staining showed that the two nuclei often had different morphologies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>, right panels).</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Nucleolus segregation is not equal in <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>cells.

These data suggest possible difficulties in chromosome segregation, a defect previously reported in yeast RNAi mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. To evaluate this possibility, we performed fluorescence <italic>in situ </italic>hybridisation (FISH), using a probe recognising the tandem repeats of 5S ribosomal DNA, to visualise chromosome I at mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In WT trypanosomes, two spots could be identified in G1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). Progression through mitosis can be monitored by DAPI staining using both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes as markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In early (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>) and late (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>) anaphase, WT cells showed four spots migrating towards the spindle poles, reproducing published findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In contrast, this pattern was frequently modified in <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>mitotic cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D,8E,8F</xref>). Judging from the distance separating the two kinetoplasts, the <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>cell shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref> is at the same stage of the cell cycle as its WT counterpart presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>. However, chromosome I segregation appeared to be delayed, with all the chromosomes found in the centre of the mitotic spindle. This defect was the most frequent in <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>mitotic cells. In other cases, unequal chromosome segregation was observed, with three chromosomes migrating towards one pole of the spindle and only one towards the opposite pole (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E</xref>). In more remarkable cases, DAPI staining revealed the presence of several DNA entities containing variable numbers of chromosome I (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8F</xref>). These data strongly suggest that, in addition to spindle formation defects and to nucleolar segregation defects, chromosome segregation is also affected in the absence of TbAGO1. Taken together, these data indicate that the growth delay measured in the <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>mutant is very likely to be due to a mitotic defect and suggest a possible involvement of the RNAi machinery in this process.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Chromosome segregation is modified in <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>cells.

These protists belong to the orders Kinetoplastida and Diplomononida, which diverged very early from the main eukaryotic lineage, revealing the ancient origin of the Argonaute proteins.

It should be noted that three of the Argonaute proteins proven to be involved in RNAi (AtAGO1, DmAGO2 and TbAGO1) possess amino-terminal extensions.

Similarly, several mutants of the RNAi pathway in <italic>N. crassa</italic>, <italic>A. thaliana </italic>and <italic>C. elegans </italic>survive normally under laboratory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

In trypanosomes, detailed analysis demonstrated that <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>mutant cells encountered significant difficulties in cell cycle progression, resulting in reduced growth rate. Four lines of evidence indicated that the Argonaute protein is essential for mitosis and proper chromosome segregation in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. Firstly, the mutant showed a 20&#x02013;30-fold increase of zoids and 1K2N cells, aberrant cell types typical of problems with mitosis such as those caused by the microtubule inhibitor rhizoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Treatment of WT trypanosomes with low concentrations of this drug selectively interferes with spindle formation, resulting in severe deficits in mitosis. However, mitochondrial genome duplication and segregation are not affected and cytokinesis can occur. This produces progeny with one kinetoplast but without a nucleus (zoids), and progeny with either one kinetoplast and one nucleus (if mitosis is completely inhibited) or with one kinetoplast and two nuclei (if mitosis is perturbed but not abolished). Significant production of zoids is also observed when mitosis progression is inhibited <italic>via </italic>RNAi targeting either cyclins or proteasome components potentially involved in cyclin control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. A delay in mitosis is further corroborated by the observation that, in the mutant <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>cell line, the proportion of 2K1N cells is increased, whereas that of 2K2N cells is reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Secondly, the spindle was frequently not recognisable in mitotic mutant cells and, when present, it exhibited significant defects in formation, being too short, without poles or bent. Thirdly, following mitosis, around one third of the binucleated mutant cells showed an unequal distribution of a nucleolar marker. Fourthly, and most significantly, FISH analysis revealed frequent chromosome segregation defects in <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>mitotic cells. Taken together with the presence of lagging DNA material and the frequent occurrence of apparently unequal DNA amounts in the two nuclei following mitosis, these data indicate significant problems in chromosome segregation and nuclear mitosis. It now remains to be seen whether these defects are related to the inability to carry out RNAi or to another function performed by TbAGO1.</p><p>These results are reminiscent of those reported in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, in which genetic deletion of AGO1 (the only Argonaute protein) or RDP1 (a homologue of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) or DCR1 (a homologue of Dicer) leads to chromosome segregation defects and a reduced growth rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. RNAi has recently been shown to be functional in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. However, it has not been reported whether any of these three proteins are involved. Intriguingly, AGO1, RDP1 and DCR1 are all essential for heterochromatin formation at the centromere, transcriptional gene silencing of this same area and proper centromere function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. It has been suggested that the RNAi machinery is required to process non-coding transcripts from the centromere, targeting these genomic sequences for formation of heterochromatin mediated by histone H3 methylation and recruiting Swi6/HP1 followed by cohesin protein complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. These results are also supported by the sequencing of yeast siRNAs, revealing a significant abundance of centromere-derived RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Defects in heterochromatin formation at the centromere interfere with kinetochore and mitotic spindle formation, probably explaining the mitotic segregation defects reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Interestingly, <italic>csp9</italic>, a fission yeast mutant impaired in chromosome segregation and transcriptional silencing at the centromere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] turned out to be an allele of AGO1 (cited as personal communication by R.C. Allshire in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]).</p><p>In <italic>T. brucei</italic>, one could imagine a similar involvement of the RNAi machinery in heterochromatin formation at the centromere, contribution to kinetochore assembly and chromosome segregation at mitosis. Unfortunately, centromeres have not yet been identified in trypanosomes and full sequencing and assembly of chromosomes I and II did not reveal any typical centromeric sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], thereby preventing direct testing of this hypothesis. One may wonder how the related kinetoplastid <italic>Leishmania </italic>behaves during mitosis, as the RNAi machinery appears to be absent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. This situation is reminiscent of observations in yeast. Indeed, all the components of the RNAi machinery are present in fission yeast, whereas none of them have been found in budding yeast, although both genomes have been fully sequenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. This observation could be related to the striking difference between centromere structure in these two organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Similarly, trypanosomes and <italic>Leishmania </italic>separated a long time ago and could have developed separate systems to perform centromeric functions. Unfortunately the lack of information on centromere identity in both organisms prevents further investigation.</p><p>Finally, there is little information about heterochromatin structure in trypanosomes, despite the fact that it appears to play critical roles in the control of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>].

The complete coding sequence of <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>was amplified by PCR with <italic>Pwo </italic>DNA polymerase (Roche) from genomic DNA using primers GCACG<underline>TCTAGA</underline>ATGTCTGACTGGGAACGTGG (<italic>Xba</italic>I site underlined) and GCACG<underline>GGATCC</underline>TTATAGATAATGCATTGTTGT (<italic>Bam </italic>HI site underlined). The PCR product was cloned in pCR-Blunt-II-TOPO (Invitrogen) and the <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>coding sequence (including its stop codon) was cloned in frame with the <italic>EGFPN2 </italic>gene in the pGFPPFRC430 vector using <italic>Xba </italic>I and <italic>Bam </italic>HI sites to generate plasmid pGFPTbAGO1430. This plasmid was linearised with <italic>Eco </italic>RV and transformed in the PTH cell line that expresses the Tet-repressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] to generate a cell line that expresses the GFP::TbAGO1 fusion protein only in the presence of tetracycline (1 &#x003bc;g per ml).</p><p>For <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>gene deletion, <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>flanking sequences were amplified by PCR with <italic>Pfu </italic>DNA polymerase from genomic DNA using primers CGCCAACTGTACACTCGTATT and TTTATTTAAATCCTTTTTATTAAGTTGCTT (upstream region, amplifying a sequence of 500 bp terminating immediately ahead of <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>start codon) and ACCACCGCTTCTCCGGGGAAAGCAA and ACCACGAAACTCACACTGCTGTCAG (downstream region, amplifying a sequence of 453 bp, starting immediately downstream of <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>stop codon). The full coding sequences of gene resistance markers <italic>BSD </italic>and <italic>NEO </italic>were amplified with <italic>Pfu </italic>(Invitrogen) from plasmid DNA using primers ATGGCCAAGCCTTTGTCTCA and TTAGCCCTCCCACACATAAC (<italic>BSD</italic>) or ATGCGCGAAATCGTCTGCG and TCAGAAGAACTCGTCAAGAAGG (<italic>NEO</italic>). PCR products were ligated and re-amplified using the PCR-ligation protocol as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>] with a few modifications. We used bolting primers CGCCAACTGTACACTCGTATT (upstream region, position in the sequence: -466) and GAAACTCACACTGCTGTCAGC (downstream region, position in the 3' flanking sequence: +448) for amplification after the second ligation. Final products used for transfection were therefore composed of 466 bp from the <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>upstream flanking region, the gene resistance marker <italic>BSD </italic>or <italic>NEO </italic>and 448 bp from the <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>downstream flanking region. First, the first allele of TbAGO1 was replaced by transformation of wild-type <italic>T. brucei </italic>(strain 427) with the BSD construct followed by selection with 10 &#x003bc;g/ml blasticidin (Sigma). Resistant cell lines were obtained at the expected frequency and further transformed with the <italic>NEO </italic>construct to replace the second <italic>TbAGO1 </italic>allele. Cells were selected with 10 &#x003bc;g/ml of blasticidin and 15 &#x003bc;g/ml of G418 (Calbiochem). Double resistant cells were obtained at the expected frequency and analysed by Southern blotting. A transformant cell line was selected, subcloned by limited dilution and termed <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>cell line.</p><p>For complementation, the <italic>TbAGO1-/- </italic>cell line was transformed with the pGFPTbAGO1430 plasmid and selected with 2 &#x003bc;g/ml phleomycin (Sigma), 10 &#x003bc;g/ml of blasticidin and 15 &#x003bc;g/ml of G418. Transformant cell lines were screened by FACS analysis detecting GFP fluorescence. To obtain tetracycline-regulatable expression of GFP::TbAGO1 in the knock-out background, this cell line was further transformed with plasmid pHD360 (linearised with <italic>Not </italic>I), that expresses the tet-repressor after integration in the tubulin locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. <italic>TbAGO1-/-+GFP::TbAGO1</italic><sup><italic>Ti </italic></sup>cell lines were selected in the presence of 1 &#x003bc;g/ml tetracyline, 20 &#x003bc;g/ml hygromycin (Sigma), 2 &#x003bc;g/ml phleomycin, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml blasticidin and 15 &#x003bc;g/ml G418. Transformants were screened by FACS analysis before being grown in the absence of tetracycline to select cell lines with optimal control of expression. In all cases, cell lines were subcloned before any detailed analysis. For measurements of growth rates, cells were always grown without antibiotics (with the exception of tetracycline when required) for at least 7 days before the experiments and for the duration of the whole experiment.</p></sec><sec><title>RT-PCR, Northern and Southern blotting</title><p>RT-PCR was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] using 250 ng of total RNA (DNA-free) and the following primers: ACGCCAAGCTTGGCGGTAGCGAAGACGCATTTG and GCACCCTCGAGACGCTCGTCGGATACTACCGCG (<italic>TbAGO1 </italic>segment from the nucleotide coding sequence 425 to 936); GCATCCAAGCTTCCATAGGTCGTTACTGTCG and CGTCGTCTCGAGCCACCGGAAGATGTGCCTGC (<italic>TbPWI1 </italic>segment from the nucleotide coding sequence 2228 to 2847). Northern blotting was carried out as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], except that DNA probes were radiolabelled by random priming. For Southern blotting, 20 &#x003bc;g genomic DNA was extracted from the various trypanosome cell lines and digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, before separation on an 0.8 % agarose gel. Samples were transferred by capillarity to a HybondN<sup>+ </sup>(Amersham) membrane. The membrane was washed in 2x SSC, prehybridised in RapidHyb buffer (Amersham) at 65&#x000b0;C for 30 min and hybridised with radiolabelled probes overnight at 65&#x000b0;C. The membrane was washed twice for 5 min in 2x SSC and once for 20 min with 2x SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65&#x000b0;C. Radioactive signals were identified by Typhoon 9410 (Amersham) analysis and quantified using ImageQuant 5.2 software.</p></sec><sec><title>RNAi assays by transient transfection</title><p>RNA was synthesised <italic>in vitro </italic>with T3 and Sp6 polymerases using PCR products as templates.

Amplified regions were selected to avoid cross-RNAi with any other sequence present in the <italic>T. brucei </italic>database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Single-stranded RNAs were mixed, heated at 90&#x000b0;C for 5 min and annealed in the RNA transcription buffer at 65&#x000b0;C for 30 min. Annealed dsRNA were sterilised by addition of 2.5 volumes of ethanol and 0.1 volume of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.0) followed by precipitation and resuspended in sterile water. Annealed dsRNA was introduced into trypanosomes by electroporation as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. For direct transfection assays, cells were transformed with <italic>PFRA</italic>, <italic>FLA1 </italic>or &#x003b1;-<italic>tubulin </italic>dsRNA, and returned to culture for 15&#x02013;18 h before fixation and analysis by immunofluorescence. For dual transfection assays, cells were first electroporated with dsRNA from the gene to be tested, returned to culture for 10 hours and transfected with <italic>PFRA</italic>, <italic>FLA1 </italic>or <italic>tubulin </italic>dsRNA, grown for 15&#x02013;18 h and processed as above. When GFP fluorescent proteins were used, cells were analysed by FACS (FACSort, Becton Dickinson) before transfection and immediately before fixation.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence, FISH, image acquisition and analysis</title><p>For indirect immunofluorescence with the anti-PFRA specific monoclonal antibody L8C4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] or with the anti-nucleolar antibody L1C6 (L.
