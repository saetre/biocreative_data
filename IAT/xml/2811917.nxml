The interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine.

One of the most serious complications of major trauma is the sequential dysfunction of vital organs, which is associated with post-traumatic sepsis in the majority of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Therefore, preventing sepsis and subsequent organ dysfunction is crucial in the treatment of surviving patients with major trauma. It has been demonstrated that inappropriate immune inflammatory response contributes to the development of sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in major trauma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Increasing evidence suggests that genetic variants, particularly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), are critical determinants for inter-individual differences in both inflammatory responses and clinical outcome in trauma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Delineating the variation in genes and associated differences in response to trauma may contribute to the development of new genetically tailored diagnostic and therapeutic interventions that will improve outcome in the patients with major trauma.</p><p>IL-10 is one of the key anti-inflammatory cytokines and it decreases the production of inflammatory molecules, such as TNF-&#x003b1;, interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3;, IL-12, reactive nitric oxide metabolites, major histocompatibility complex molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and inhibits antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The magnitude of the proinflammatory cytokine response, neutrophil infiltration, and injury were shown to be greater in IL-10<sup>(-/-)</sup>-null mice after visceral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Administration of exogenous IL-10 results in a decrease in neutrophil infiltration in IL-10<sup>(-/-)</sup>-null mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It suggests that lower producers of IL-10 might be sensitive to the development of sepsis and MODS due to its ability to suppress inflammation. IL-10 has been shown to be elevated after trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and is well correlated with the development of sepsis and outcome in patients with major trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that the variation in IL-10 production is largely genetically determined, which is mainly related to genetic variations in the promoter region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The IL-10 5'-flanking region, which controls transcription, is polymorphic, with two microsatellites between -4000 and -1100, and three SNPs (-1082, -819, and -592) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The -1082, -819 and -592 polymorphisms are shown to be in close linkage disequilibrium and construct only three haplotypes in the white population (GCC, ACC and ATA in an order of -1089/-819/-592) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These haplotypes are associated with high (GCC), intermediate (ACC), and low (ATA) IL-10 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Genetic association studies have indicated that the three SNPs in the IL-10 promoter are linked to various diseases, such as Crohn's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], hepatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], endometriosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], Alzheimer's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], acute respiratory distress syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, clinical relevance of the three SNPs is still not fully understood, due to considerable controversy in the literature regarding the influence of these SNPs on susceptibility to diseases and their functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Schroeder and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] reported the association of the IL-10 with the -1082 and -592 polymorphisms with the incidence of MODS and acute respiratory failure in patients with major trauma, respectively, and also showed inconsistent results.</p><p>In this study we investigated whether the genetic variations at positions -1082, -819 and -592 in the IL-10 promoter affect IL-10 production after trauma, and whether there is an association of these polymorphisms with the development of post-traumatic sepsis and MODS. Our hypothesis was that genetically determined lower production of IL-10 might increase susceptibility to post-traumatic complications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>A total of 308 patients with major trauma (240 male and 68 female) were prospectively recruited in this study. All of them are Han Chinese and live in Chongqing district. The patients were consecutively admitted to the Department of Trauma Surgery in the Daping Hospital and the Chongqing Emergency Medical Center between 1 January, 2005 and 1 June, 2008. They were enrolled in the study if they met the following criteria: (1) aged between 18 and 65 years; (2) expected Injury Severity Score (ISS) greater than 16 combined with the presence of at least one life-threatening injury and at least one additional severe injury in another part of the body and (3) probability of survival greater than 48 hours. Patients were not eligible if they had penetrating injuries, or pre-existing cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic, hematologic or immunological diseases. ISS was performed according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale 2005 by independent evaluators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. All patients requiring surgical intervention received standard surgical care and postoperative intensive care unit treatment. The protocol for this study was approved by the Ethical and Protocol Review Committee of the Third Military Medical University, and informed consent was obtained from the patients or the patient's next of kin.</p></sec><sec><title>Genotyping of the IL-10 promoter polymorphisms</title><p>Blood specimens were collected in tripotassium ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid sterile tubes from trauma patients immediately after admission (generally within 10 hours after injury) in order to avoid the effect of blood transfusion. The genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood using Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method was used to detect the IL-10 promoter polymorphisms. The oligonucleotide primers for amplification and PCR conditions were shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. PCR products were digested with XagI, Hin1&#x003b1; or Rsa I (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA) for one hours at 37&#x000b0;C. The SNPs were then genotyped by fragment size obtained after agarose gel electrophoresis, which were further confirmed by DNA sequencing of the IL-10 promoter with 10 random samples (Takara Biotech, Dalian, China). The genotyping was performed in a blinded fashion such that those analyzing the genotype data did not know any other experimental results.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Primers and endonucleases for genotyping of IL-10 promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center">SNPs</th><th align="center">Primers</th><th align="center">PCR conditions</th><th align="center">Restriction endonucleases</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">-1082A/G</td><td align="center">F:ACACAAATCCAAGACAACACTACTAAGGCTTCCTTGGGA</td><td align="center">3 minutes at 94&#x000b0;C followed by 35 cycles of 40 seconds at 94&#x000b0;C, 45 seconds at 56&#x000b0;C, 40 seconds at 72&#x000b0;C, then 10 minutes at 72&#x000b0;C</td><td align="center">XagI</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">R:GTGATCAAACAGAGGCACAGACAT</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">-819T/C</td><td align="center">F:CACTCTAAGGCTTCCTTGGGA</td><td align="center">3 minutes at 94&#x000b0;C followed by 35 cycles of 40 seconds at 94&#x000b0;C, 45 seconds at 56&#x000b0;C, 40 seconds at 72&#x000b0;C, then 10 minutes at 72&#x000b0;C</td><td align="center">Hin1&#x003b1;</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">R:CCTACCGTCTCTATTTTATAGTGAGCAAACTGAGGCACAGACAT</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">-592 A/C</td><td align="center">F:AGCTGAAGAGGTGGAAACATGTG</td><td align="center">3 minutes at 94&#x000b0;C followed by 35 cycles of 40 seconds at 94&#x000b0;C, 45 seconds at 63&#x000b0;C, 40 seconds at 72&#x000b0;C, then 10 minutes at 72&#x000b0;C</td><td align="center">Rsa I</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">R:TGGGTTCTCATTCGCGTGTT</td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title><italic>Ex vivo </italic>IL-10 production</title><p>A human whole-blood assay was used as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].

Any deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was calculated by a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test. The chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test was used to determine differences in frequencies of the IL-10 promoter polymorphisms among trauma patients with different genotypes. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using logistic regression models whenever that chi-squared or Fisher's exact test was significant. The association of the IL-10 promoter polymorphisms with plasma IL-10 levels and MODS scores was determined using one-way analysis of variance. Three genetic models (allele-dose, dominant, and recessive) were used. Significant probability values obtained were corrected for multiple testing (Bonferroni correction). <italic>P </italic>values less than 0.05 were considered significant.

As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>, there were no significant differences in age, gender ratio and ISS scores among trauma patients with different genotypes of the three polymorphisms. Spontaneous IL-10 production was not significantly different between different genotypes of all three loci (data not shown). However, LPS-induced IL-10 production was shown to be significantly different between different genotypes of the -1082 and -592 polymorphisms, showing that the -1082A and -592A alleles were associated with lower IL-10 production (<italic>P </italic>= 0.005 and <italic>P </italic>= 0.001, respectively by dominant effect). Data from linear regression analysis indicated that the functional association of these two polymorphisms with IL-10 production was significantly allele-dose dependent (<italic>P </italic>= 0.003 and <italic>P </italic>= 0.037 for -1082 and -592, respectively). Although the -819T allele is also associated with lower LPS-induced IL-10 production, no significant difference was found between the different genotype groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). In case of a combination effect of the three SNPs, we further analyzed the association of ATA haplotype with IL-10 production. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref> showed that the production of IL-10 was lowest in those with haplotype genotype 2 ATA, showing significant difference if compared with those with genotype 0 ATA (<italic>P </italic>= 0.041).

The described genotype and allele frequencies of the IL-10 polymorphisms studied in this cohort are quite similar to previously reported distributions in other studies in Chinese patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and other Asian populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The minor alleles at positions -819 and -592 are the C allele in Asian populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], which is different to those seen in Western populations, being T and A alleles, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Although the minor allele at position -1082 is G in both Asian and Western populations, its frequency is quite different, over 40% in Western populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and about 10% in Asian populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This leads to quite a difference in the common haplotypes between Asian and Western populations. Three common haplotypes in this cohort are ATA, ATC and ACA, respectively, while GCC, ATA and ACC are the common haplotypes in Western populations. The differences in allele prevalence might be due to ethnic difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>It has been shown that about 75% of the variation in IL-10 production is genetically determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. IL-10 production appears to be controlled at the transcriptional level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The -1082, -819 and -592 polymorphisms have been shown to affect promoter activity, showing that the ATA haplotype is associated with the lowest transcription activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Results from bioinformatics analysis indicates that base pair substitutions at positions -1082, -819 and -592 might affect putative transcription factor binding, such as C/EBP beta, GATA-binding factor 2, Ets and STAT3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Given the functionality of the IL-10 promoter SNPs, we investigate whether these SNPs affect IL-10 production in response to a known stimulus such as LPS immediately after trauma. In the case of the effect of individual SNP, our results indicate that both of the -1082 A and -592 A alleles are shown to be associated with LPS-induced IL-10 production. However, there is no association for the -819 polymorphism. Our results are in agreement with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], but in contrast to the results reported by Keijsers and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and Rad and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. They showed that the A allele at -1082 and the T allele at -819 were associated with higher and lower IL-10 production, respectively. Similar to their effect on transcription, LPS-stimulating production of IL-10 by peripheral blood leukocytes is lowest in patients with combined genotype 2 ATA, which is significantly different compared with patients with genotype 0 ATA. The ATA haplotype has been demonstrated to have lowest transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Our results further confirm the functionality of the IL-10 promoter SNPs in relation to IL-10 production. It also suggests that individual differences in IL-10 production in trauma patients might be at least in part related to genetic variations in the IL-10 promoter region.</p><p>Given the functional significance of the -1082 and -592 polymorphisms and ATA haplotype, we further hypothesized that the IL-10 promoter polymorphisms would be important in influencing severity to the development of sepsis and MODS in trauma patients by changing the balance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. There were no significant differences in age, gender ratio and ISS scores among the different genotype groups, which minimized the influence of interfering factors. The patient cohort consisted of young patients with a low background of coexisting morbidity. Similar to their association with IL-10 production, genetic variations at the three loci have a trend to be associated with lower risk of sepsis and MODS. However, only the -1082 polymorphism has statistical significance, showing that the patients with the A allele had significantly higher sepsis morbidity and a borderline significant increase in MODS scores. There are also significant differences in the frequencies of the allele and AA genotype at this polymorphic locus between patients with sepsis and non-sepsis. The finding of no significant difference in the GG genotype frequency might be due to a small number of patients carrying the GG genotype in the current study. Results from Stanilova and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] also revealed that the AA genotype of the -1082 locus was associated with lower IL-10 production in LPS-, phytohemagglutinin- or pokeweed mitogen-stimulated healthy peripheral blood leukocytes. Patients with severe sepsis were shown to have a significant elevation of A allele frequency when compared with healthy controls. In addition, Gong and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] further reported that the high IL-10-producing -1082 GG genotype was protective against organ failure and mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome. It is increasingly recognized that the overall balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses is important in the development of sepsis and MODS after trauma. Therefore, it is reasonable that lower IL-10-producing -1082 AA genotype might be used as a relevant risk estimate for organ dysfunction and sepsis in trauma patients. This is not consistent with the report by Schroeder and colleagues, which showed that the -592 polymorphism, but not -1082, was associated with MODS in patients with major trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The different patient populations studied may explain this discrepancy. With respect to the combination effect, our results show that the patients with 2 ATA haplotypes have higher sepsis morbidity rates, but this lacks statistical significance, although it is significantly associated with lower IL-10 production. This is in accordance with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. It suggests that there is a lack of synergistic effect among the -1082, -819 and -592 polymorphisms in relation to the development of sepsis and MODS in trauma patients. Other pathogenic factors should be also considered when explaining the current results. One important factor is the polygenetic and multifactorial involvement in the pathogenesis of sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction after trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In fact, there is increasing evidence indicating that genetic polymorphisms of other genes are associated with the occurrence of post-traumatic complications, such as IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF&#x003b1;, heat shock protein 70, IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The susceptibility to sepsis and organ dysfunction in trauma patients might be the result of a combination of numerous genetic polymorphisms. In addition, the relatively small sample size we recruited in this study might also affect our conclusions. Our sample, although being considered adequate by means of the Power and Sample Size program, just has a size of about 300 patients, among which only 147 and 160 patients had sepsis and MODS, respectively. Further studies are needed to confirm the clinical relevance of the IL-10 promoter polymorphisms in a larger cohort of trauma patients and to investigate the relation of these SNPs with other genetic polymorphisms in prediction of sepsis and outcome in trauma patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study investigated the clinical relevance of the genetic variations at positions -1082, -819 and -592 in the IL-10 promoter in patients with major trauma.
