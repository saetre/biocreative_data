When the 3&#x02032; end of the primer is located opposite the lesion, partially fractionated human primary fibroblast extracts efficiently catalyzed primer-terminus extension by adding a ladder of about 15 dGMPs, in an apparently non-templated reaction. This activity was not detected in SV40-transformed fibroblasts or in HeLa cell extracts unless purified human DNA polymerase mu (Pol &#x000b5;) was added. In contrast, purified human Pol &#x000b5; alone could only add three dGMPs as predicted from the sequence of the template. These results suggest that a cofactor(s) present in cellular extracts modifies Pol &#x000b5; activity. The production of the dGMP ladder at the primer terminus located opposite the AAF adduct reveals an unusual ability of Pol &#x000b5; (in conjunction with its cofactor) to perform DNA synthesis from a slipped intermediate containing several unpaired bases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Recently, a systematic screening of human sequence databases allowed the identification of DNA polymerase mu (Pol &#x000b5;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c2">2</xref>). This novel DNA polymerase belongs to the X-family, whose members are structurally related to Pol &#x003b2;, a non-processive enzyme with no proofreading activity that is involved primarily in base excision repair. In vertebrates, the X-family includes also terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT), a DNA-independent DNA polymerase whose expression is restricted to primary lymphoid tissues, and the recently identified Pol &#x003bb;, predicted to be involved in DNA repair synthesis during meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c3">3</xref>) and base excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c4">4</xref>). The N-terminal portion of Pol &#x000b5;, Pol &#x003bb; and TdT contain a BRCT motif (identified initially at the C-terminal domain of BRCA1 protein) that have no counterpart in Pol &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c3">3</xref>). This BRCT motif is proposed to mediate protein&#x02013;protein or DNA&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c6">6</xref>) and may specifically modulate the activity of these homologous DNA polymerases, thereby defining their biological function.</p><p>Preferential expression of Pol &#x000b5; in secondary lymphoid organs led to the hypothesis of a specific involvement of this error-prone DNA polymerase in somatic hypermutation of the V regions of immunoglobulin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c7">7</xref>). However, recent data indicate that a combination of several error-prone DNA polymerases might contribute to this process: Pol &#x003b6; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c8">8</xref>), Pol &#x003b7; and Pol &#x003ba; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c10">10</xref>) as well as Pol &#x003b9; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c11">11</xref>) are potential candidates (for a review on new eucaryotic DNA polymerase, see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c12">12</xref>). Further investigations are required to determine whether Pol &#x000b5; is also involved in this process.</p><p>Pol &#x000b5; has also been proposed to be the DNA polymerase responsible for DNA synthesis during the repair of double-strand breaks by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c13">13</xref>). NHEJ is the predominant form of repair of double-strand breaks occurring in vertebrate mitotic cells exposed to oxidation or ionizing radiation, particularly in the G<sub>1</sub> phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c15">15</xref>). NHEJ is&#x000a0;&#x000a0;also an essential mechanism that repairs DNA segments during V(D)J recombination of the immunoglobulin and T cell-receptor genes. During this process, TdT contributes to antigen-receptor diversity by adding nucleotides to DNA ends. The interaction of TdT with the Ku70&#x0002f;86 heterodimer that binds to DNA ends may target the enzyme to the recombination sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c16">16</xref>). In agreement with the structural similarity of Pol &#x000b5; and TdT (41&#x00025; overall amino acid identity), it has been speculated that Pol &#x000b5; is also able to interact with the Ku subunits and play a general role in NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c7">7</xref>). The potential role of the DNA polymerases that could be involved in this process in mammalian cells has been investigated recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c17">17</xref>). In yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the pol &#x003b2;-related POL IV was found to be required for NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c18">18</xref>).</p><p>Recent data show that human Pol &#x000b5; is able to efficiently extend mismatched bases by annealing the primer end with a microhomology region in the template 3 or 4 nt downstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c13">13</xref>). In the work reported here, we present evidence that Pol &#x000b5; in conjunction with additional factor(s) present in the cellular extract, and most likely recruited at an <italic>N</italic>-2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF)-adduct lesion, is able to perform DNA synthesis from a slipped intermediate containing several looped-out bases. This property of promoting DNA synthesis despite the presence of mismatched nucleotides near the primer terminus is also consistent with a role in processing DNA ends during NHEJ.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell lines and culture conditions</title><p>Human primary fibroblast cell strains were derived from the skin of normal (1BR) or XPV (XP6DU) individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c19">19</xref>).

The site-specific modified template was mixed with a 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled primer (5&#x02032;-AGTGCCAAGCTTAGTCGATGTCCC-3&#x02032;) whose 3&#x02032; end is opposite to the lesion (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf297f1">1</xref>A). That primer is protected in 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; with phosphorothioate bonds to prevent nucleotidyl degradation by exonuclease activities in the cellular extracts. Annealing of the primer was achieved by heating the template&#x0002f;primer mixture (ratio 4&#x0002f;1) to 70&#x000b0;C and allowing it to cool to room temperature for several hours. The annealed template&#x0002f;primer (3 fmol) was incubated in the presence of 5 &#x000b5;g of cell extracts in a 2 &#x000b5;l reaction volume containing 50 mM HEPES, 7 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT and 1&#x000a0;mM dNTPs.

The supernatant was diluted with buffer A &#x0002b; 0.5 M NaCl to reach 120 OD<sub>260</sub> U&#x0002f;ml, and the DNA present in the soluble extract was removed by polyethyleneimine (PEI) precipitation. By adding 0.3&#x00025; PEI (10&#x00025; stock solution, in water, at pH 7.5) and stirring for 10 min, DNA forms a white precipitate that sediments by centrifugation at 15 000 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was treated with ammonium sulfate at 50&#x00025; saturation to obtain a PEI-free precipitate containing most of the Pol &#x000b5;.

Pol &#x000b5; eluted at an ionic strength corresponding to 0.3&#x02013;0.5 M NaCl. This Pol &#x000b5;-enriched fraction was diluted in buffer A up to 0.3 M NaCl, loaded in a HiTrap heparin column (Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted at 0.4 M NaCl.

The primers (OligoExpress) used for the amplification were as follows: Pol &#x000b5; forward, 5&#x02032;-AGGCTGTCGTCCCAATGCTC-3&#x02032; (located in exon 1); Pol &#x000b5; reverse, 5&#x02032;-CAGGCATAGGCAGGCATCCA-3&#x02032; (located in exon 3); GAPDH forward, 5&#x02032;-GTTCGACAGTCAGCCGCATC-3&#x02032; (located in the 5&#x02032; untranslated region); and GAPDH reverse, 5&#x02032;-TTGAGGCTGTTGTCATACTTCTCAT-3&#x02032; (located in exon 6).

The modified G-AAF single-stranded template was annealed to a primer whose 3&#x02032; end is located opposite the lesion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf297f1">1</xref>A) thus forming a replication intermediate referred to as the LT. Upon incubation of the template&#x0002f;primer with cellular extracts in the presence of dGTP only, incorporation of three dG residues was expected (at the most) given the template sequence context of three dC residues located 5&#x02032; to the AAF adduct. Surprisingly, a specific fraction (fraction B, see Materials and Methods) from normal (1BR) or XP6DU primary fibroblasts extracts extended very efficiently the LT, by adding a ladder of about 15 dGMP residues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf297f1">1</xref>B). In contrast, incorporation of dGMP was reduced in equivalent extracts from MRC5, CTAg and HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf297f1">1</xref>B).</p><p>Normal and XP6DU (deficient in Pol &#x003b7;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c25">25</xref>) fibroblasts showed the same pattern of elongation, clearly indicating that the dG ladder-synthesizing activity is not mediated by DNA Pol &#x003b7; but by another DNA polymerase that remained to be identified.</p></sec><sec><title>The presence of AAF adduct triggers the dG ladder-synthesizing activity</title><p>In order to characterize further the enzymatic properties of the fractionated 1BR extract, its ability to elongate an oligonucleotide in the absence of a template was investigated. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf297f2">2</xref>A, no elongation could be detected with any of the&#x000a0;nucleotides tested. Conversely, in the presence of the corresponding non-modified template and dGTP, three guanine residues were incorporated, as predicted by the sequence context (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf297f2">2</xref>B). Only a faint signal of incorporation was detected when the other three dNTPs were assayed individually. In these cases, the mobility of the extended products is identical to the one of the dG-extended products, suggesting that they correspond to accurate elongation mediated by low endogenous levels of dGTP present in the extract. As an exception, by adding dCTP, a &#x02018;true&#x02019; dCMP-extended product is observed at the &#x0002b;1 position.</p><p>In the presence of the AAF-modified substrate, 1BR extract catalyzed the aberrant primer extension of the LT by using exclusively dGTP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf297f2">2</xref>C). The extension pattern obtained in the presence of all four dNTPs was identical, suggesting that, in this particular sequence context, dGTP is the only nucleotide selected even when a pool of the four dNTPs is provided (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf297f2">2</xref>D).</p><p>Taken together, these results indicate that fraction B of human primary fibroblasts contains a DNA-dependent polymerase that displays a dG ladder-synthesizing activity, only in the presence of the AAF adduct. This aberrant reaction may be triggered by the strong distortion that a G-AAF adduct imposes upon the DNA template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c26">26</xref>). The specificity and reiteration of the end-addition reaction being restricted to dGMP suggest that it is driven by the run of three Cs downstream to the AAF adduct on the template strand.</p></sec><sec><title>Pol &#x000b5; complements deficient extracts</title><p>The observations mentioned above are consistent with the possibility that the LT extension observed when using extracts from fibroblasts is mediated by a DNA polymerase related to TdT. However, as TdT expression is restricted to primary lymphoid cells at a precise stage of their differentiation, it is unlikely that the observed LT extension in fibroblast extracts is due to TdT. We decided to test Pol &#x000b5;, which shares a 41&#x00025; amino acid identity with TdT. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the purified enzyme displays intrinsic terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase activity but, unlike TdT, the catalytic efficiency of polymerization carried out by Pol &#x000b5; was strongly enhanced by the presence of a template strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c2">2</xref>). These biochemical properties of Pol &#x000b5; were tested using the same template&#x0002f;primer structures as above. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf297f3">3</xref>A, 1 ng of purified Pol &#x000b5; was able to catalyze the addition of one dTMP to a DNA primer in the absence of a template. This nucleotide preference has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c2">2</xref>). In the presence of the non-modified primer&#x0002f;template substrate, template-directed insertion of three dGMPs occurred. The enzyme was also able to add dTMP and dCMP but less efficiently than dGMP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf297f3">3</xref>B). These observations are consistent with the biochemical properties of Pol &#x000b5;, including an optimal activity in the presence of a template&#x0002f;primer and low fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c2">2</xref>). When the reaction was carried out using the AAF mono-modified template (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf297f3">3</xref>C), Pol &#x000b5; is able to catalyze template-directed addition of three dGMPs more efficiently than misincorporation of dTMP and dCMP. Besides, the primer appears to be more efficiently elongated (number of primers extended), but the proportion of primer molecules stalled at position &#x0002b;2 in the presence of dGTP is higher when using the AAF mono-modified template. The extension catalyzed by Pol &#x000b5; stops after three dGMPs have been incorporated even though all the four dNTPs are included in the reaction, suggesting that the presence of the AAF adduct hinders further progression of the DNA polymerase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf297f3">3</xref>D). A similar inhibition of elongation can be observed when dTMP and dCMP are independently provided.</p><p>A dramatically different result was obtained when Pol &#x000b5; activity was assayed in the presence of a cellular extract that was defective in the dG ladder-synthesizing activity, such as a HeLa total extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf297f3">3</xref>E). In this case, the specificity of the nucleotide insertion was very strict, and no other dNTP but dGTP could be incorporated. Moreover, a run of about 15&#x000a0;dGMPs was incorporated instead of the three dGMP residues obtained when purified Pol &#x000b5; was used alone. This extension pattern was identical to that observed by using primary fibroblast extracts.</p><p>The ability of Pol &#x000b5; to complement a deficient extract suggests that a cofactor(s) present in the extract modulates the activity of the DNA polymerase, modifying its incorporation pattern. This cofactor(s) is specific for Pol &#x000b5;, as purified Pol &#x003b2;, although being as efficient as Pol &#x000b5; for the extension of the LT by three dGMPs failed to restore the dG ladder-synthesizing activity in the deficient extract (data not shown). These results demonstrate that Pol &#x000b5; and Pol &#x003b2; are not interchangeable and that the dG ladder-synthesizing activity specifically results from an interaction between Pol &#x000b5; and cofactor(s) present in the extracts.</p></sec><sec><title>Anti-Pol &#x000b5; antibodies specifically inhibit the dG ladder-synthesizing activity</title><p>To further confirm that the dG ladder-synthesizing activity can be attributed to Pol &#x000b5;, LT extension was assayed in the presence of either native or heat-denatured antibodies raised against human Pol &#x000b5;. Native antibodies inhibited the catalytic activity of purified Pol &#x000b5; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf297f4">4</xref>A). The level of inhibition quantified by phosphorimagery varied from 14- to 5-fold depending to the concentration of IgG used. LT extension catalyzed by a primary fibroblast extract (1BR; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf297f4">4</xref>C), as well as that of a reconstituted extract (MRC5 extract supplemented with Pol &#x000b5;; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf297f4">4</xref>B), were also inhibited by the antibody in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition was not observed with an unrelated antibody (data not shown) or when using heat-inactivated anti-Pol &#x000b5; antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf297f4">4</xref>). The data provided evidence that Pol &#x000b5; is indeed the DNA polymerase responsible for the observed dG-ladder formation. Furthermore, IgG anti-Pol &#x000b5; failed to inhibit DNA polymerase activity of Pol &#x003b2; (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf297f4">4</xref>D) showing that the antibody specific for DNA polymerase &#x000b5; has no effect on other polymerase.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of Pol &#x000b5; mRNA correlates with the dG ladder-synthesizing activity</title><p>The LT primer elongation assay used in this study allowed a clear distinction between primary cell extracts which displayed an efficient dG-ladder formation and transformed cell extracts which hardly incorporate &#x0003e;4 nt. In order to compare the expression of Pol &#x000b5; in these different cell strains, real-time quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR was performed using serially diluted cDNA. Amplification of the GAPDH gene was used to normalize the results. The specificity of the PCR products was documented by electrophoresis and <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> determination. Cycle number of CP versus cDNA input were plotted to calculate the slope (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf297f5">5</xref>A&#x02013;C). The average PCR efficiencies using the cDNA from the various cell lines were identical for GAPDH (1.87 &#x000b1; 0.06) and for Pol &#x000b5; (1.87 &#x000b1; 0.15). By using the established mathematical model of Pfaffl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c23">23</xref>), we determined that Pol &#x000b5; expression in XP6DU cells was almost identical to that observed in 1BR cells (66.7&#x00025;). In contrast, Pol &#x000b5; expression was significantly down regulated in CTAg (13.7&#x00025;), MRC5 (4&#x00025;) and HeLa cells (2.6&#x00025;). Thus, modulation of Pol &#x000b5; mRNA expression correlates with the detection of LT elongation in cell extracts, which is consistent with the implication of Pol &#x000b5; in this process.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We show that the Pol &#x000b5; present in human primary fibroblast extracts is able to extend efficiently the LT formed by a primer whose 3&#x02032; end anneals opposite an AAF adduct. The purified enzyme was unable <italic>per se</italic> to extend the primer by &#x0003e;3 nt. In marked contrast, in the presence of a cellular extract, Pol &#x000b5; efficiently catalyzed LT extension by producing a ladder of about 15 dGMPs. It is unlikely that the TdT-like activity of DNA Pol &#x000b5; could be involved in the production of the dG ladder. Indeed it has been shown that DNA Pol &#x000b5; is able to catalyze polymerization of any of the four dNTPs to a single-stranded DNA primer in the absence of a template, dTTP and dCTP being inserted more efficiently. We prefer to propose the following model (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf297f6">6</xref>): (i) Pol &#x000b5; extends the primer with one, two or three dGMPs; (ii) incorporation of additional nucleotides appears to be impeded by the presence of the AAF adduct in the primer binding cleft of the DNA polymerase; (iii) asymmetric translocation of the primer strand (slippage) repositions its 3&#x02032; end such that further extension by Pol &#x000b5; occurs again opposite the dC repeat; (iv) several cycles of slippage&#x0002f;extension produce a loop of unpaired bases on the neosynthesized strand; (v) the process stops, probably when the bulge in the primer strand gets too big to support stably DNA polymerase binding.</p><p>The entire process is strictly dependent upon the presence of a cellular extract that provides a cofactor(s) for dG-ladder formation. We propose that, by means of either a post-translational modification of Pol &#x000b5; or a protein&#x02013;protein interaction, the cofactor may allow the DNA polymerase to be more tightly associated with the DNA despite the presence of several unpaired bases. Alternatively, the slippage reaction may occur upon DNA polymerase dissociation from the template after pausing at the AAF site. In this case, the cofactor may facilitate the remodeling of the substrate and reloading of the polymerase to the distorted primer terminus.</p><p>The assay described here provides an unique opportunity to identify the cofactor(s) that is likely to have an important regulatory role of the biological function of Pol &#x000b5;. DNA-PK modifies TdT activity <italic>in vitro</italic> by limiting both the length and composition of nucleotide addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c27">27</xref>). As TdT and Pol &#x000b5; share a 41&#x00025; overall amino acid identity in both their BRCT and Pol &#x003b2; core domains, we tested the influence of DNA-PK on Pol &#x000b5; activity. Until now, we failed to demonstrate any functional interactions between the purified proteins to produce the dG ladder.</p><p>Pol &#x000b5; has the peculiar capacity of accepting distortions in both primer and template strands, being able to extend realigned mismatched primer terminus, and to produce misinsertions on the same basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c13">13</xref>). Such a feature, together with the biochemical properties reported in this paper, could be especially useful for the proposed function of Pol &#x000b5; in NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf297c7">7</xref>). This DNA polymerase could produce insertions or deletions resulting from template&#x0002f;primer misalignments due to replication blockage by either a secondary structure or a chemical lesion.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf297f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> LT extension reaction catalyzed by various cell extracts.
