Previous work has suggested an association between imprinting and the products of retrotransposition, but the nature of this link is not well defined. In the mouse, three imprinted genes have been described that originated by retrotransposition and overlap CpG islands which undergo methylation during oogenesis. <italic>Nap1l5, U2af1-rs1,</italic> and <italic>Inpp5f&#x0005f;v2</italic> are likely to encode proteins and share two additional genetic properties: they are located within introns of host transcripts and are derived from parental genes on the X chromosome. Using these sequence features alone, we identified <italic>Mcts2,</italic> a novel candidate imprinted retrogene on mouse Chromosome 2. <italic>Mcts2</italic> has been validated as imprinted by demonstrating that it is paternally expressed and undergoes promoter methylation during oogenesis. The orthologous human retrogenes <italic>NAP1L5, INPP5F&#x0005f;V2,</italic> and <italic>MCTS2</italic> are also shown to be paternally expressed, thus delineating novel imprinted loci on human Chromosomes 4, 10, and 20. The striking correlation between imprinting and X chromosome provenance suggests that retrotransposed elements with homology to the X chromosome can be selectively targeted for methylation during mammalian oogenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The conventional view is that DNA carries all of our heritable information and our genes control development into adulthood. The discovery of epigenetics, a term coined to describe effects that are not coded for by DNA sequence, but can nonetheless affect our development and well-being, has added another layer of complexity to our understanding of genetics. One class of genes under epigenetic control are imprinted genes. Mammals inherit two copies of every gene, one from mother and one from father, and in most cases, both are active. However, for a small number of imprinted genes in mammals, only one is active, either the maternal or the paternal copy. Epigenetics amounts to a control system for switching genes on and off appropriately. We focus on a group of little-studied imprinted genes that share features that give clues to their evolutionary origins. These so-called &#x0201c;retrogenes&#x0201d; are protein-coding sequences of DNA that have undergone duplication and jumped into novel locations in the genome. Because of this, it is possible to determine where, and roughly when, many of the imprinted retrogenes originated. This provides an opportunity to study the molecular events that have generated imprinted genes during mammalian evolution.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Wood AJ, Roberts RG, Monk D, Moore GE, Schulz R, et al.

Imprinted alleles are an exception to this rule, as their expression in offspring is dependent on the gender of the transmitting parent. These parent-of-origin effects arise due to differential epigenetic reprogramming events occurring in the male and female germ-line. Methylation at CpG dinucleotides is one modification known to play a key role, and germ-line differentially methylated regions (gDMRs) have been found in proximity to most known imprinted genes. In addition to performing an essential role in genomic imprinting &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030020-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;, DNA methylation also serves to suppress the activity of retrotransposon promoters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030020-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030020-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;.

For example, autonomously replicating L1 retroelements can be diverted to act on host cell mRNAs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030020-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that almost any cellular mRNA has the capacity to act as a retrotransposon. A recent survey identified 3,590 of these intronless gene duplicates in the human genome, of which 1,080 showed evidence of transcription &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030020-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.

One such gene, murine <italic>U2af1-rs1,</italic> is a retrotransposed copy of the X-linked <italic>U2af1-rs2</italic> gene, which lies within an intron of <italic>Murr1</italic> on Chromosome 11 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030020-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.

The human <italic>MURR1</italic> gene shows no evidence of imprinted expression or allele-specific methylation, indicating that imprinting at this locus arose at about the same time point in rodent evolution as the retroposon insertion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030020-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>To investigate the link between retrotransposition and genomic imprinting further, we performed a systematic screen of known imprinted genes in the mouse to identify candidate retrogenes. Eleven genes were identified, three of which have CpG islands overlapping the retrotransposed exons that undergo differential germ-line methylation. The other eight are likely to be controlled by differentially methylated elements that are not within the duplicated sequences. The three retrogenes share three sequence characteristics, namely, they are located within an intron of another gene, they are derived from an ancestral gene on the X chromosome, and they are associated with an overlapping CpG island. These characteristics alone were used to identify a novel imprinted locus consisting of <italic>Mcts2</italic> and <italic>H13,</italic> a pair of reciprocally expressed novel imprinted genes on mouse Chromosome 2. Finally, we show that imprinting is conserved in humans for the three retrogenes that predate the divergence of rodents and primates.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>A database of known imprinted genes in the mouse is housed on the Harwell imprinting Web site &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030020-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d; and the 76 currently listed were screened to identify candidate retrogenes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030020-sd001">Dataset S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030020-sd003">Text S1</xref>). Protein-coding capacity was ascertained from the references linked to each gene entry in the same database &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030020-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. To identify imprinted genes likely to have been associated with sequence duplications, the BLASTZ tool &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030020-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; (integrated into the self-chain track on the University of California, Santa Cruz genome browser, Mm build 34) was utilized to identify those that generated alignments with regions elsewhere in the mouse genome. The Harwell database includes a significant proportion of genes for which no functional open reading frame (ORF) has been identified, many of which are known to act as noncoding RNAs. Of the 55 for which a putatively functional ORF has been identified, 41 (75&#x00025;) generated BLASTZ self-alignments and are likely to be either the source or product of sequence duplications. To enrich for genes likely to have originated via an mRNA intermediate, genes with introns in their ORF were excluded. The remaining 11 represent candidate retrogenes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030020-t001">Table 1</xref>), although the three that lack multi-exonic paralogues cannot be definitively classified as such. It should be noted that <italic>Rtl1</italic> and <italic>Peg10</italic> belong to a family of endogenous retroviral elements that have lost the capacity to replicate in an autonomous manner &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030020-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, and hence may be considered distinct to the remaining nine genes that show no evidence of retroviral homology.</p><p>All 11 candidates are expressed from the paternally derived allele. Of the 76 imprinted genes listed in the Harwell database, 39 (51&#x00025;) are paternally expressed. Assuming a 51&#x00025; probability of paternal expression for each of the retrogene candidates, it is highly unlikely that all 11 would share this property by chance (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>).</p><p>We hypothesized that retrogene insertions might attract differential methylation in the germ-line and hence play a role in the formation of imprinted domains during evolution. However, the imprinting of four retrogenes situated within the <italic>Snrpn</italic> imprinted cluster on mouse Chromosome 7 is controlled by a gDMR situated over 1 Mb from the retroposed sequences &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030020-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, and a similar situation has been reported for the <italic>Dio3</italic> and <italic>Rtl1</italic> genes on Chromosome 12 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030020-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.

For this reason, we excluded putative retrogenes that were located within larger imprinted clusters, where known gDMRs do not overlap retrogene exons (references in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030020-t001">Table 1</xref>), leaving three genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030020-t002">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, all three are situated within introns of RefSeq-annotated multi-exonic host genes.

The methylation status of the CpG islands overlapping the two retrogene promoters was assessed by sequencing bisulphite-modified DNA from ovulated oocytes and mature sperm. Both regions are heavily methylated in female, but not male gametes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030020-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

The observation that the ORF of <italic>Inpp5f&#x0005f;v2</italic> is contained entirely within the first exon indicates a retrotransposition event originating from the <italic>Tmem114A</italic> gene on the X chromosome.

A multi-species sequence comparison using the <italic>Murr1</italic> genomic sequence revealed that this event occurred in a common ancestor of mouse and rat, after the divergence of rodents and primates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030020-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).

The presence of three monoexonic paralogues makes their precise relationship complicated to determine, and so a maximum likelihood tree was generated using the region of the <italic>Nap1</italic> domain common to all five family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030020-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). As the <italic>Nap1l5</italic> ORF is truncated and lacks regions of homology shared by all other family members (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030020-sg001">Figure S1</xref>), this gene cannot have acted as the source of <italic>Nap1l2</italic> or <italic>Nap1l3.</italic> Given this information, the imprinted paralogue is more likely to have originated from one of the two X-linked genes than from the autosomal <italic>Nap1l1</italic> or <italic>Nap1l4</italic> (supported by 93/100 bootstrap re-sampling trials; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030020-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), implicating <italic>Nap1l2</italic> or <italic>Nap1l3</italic> as the likely source.

Based on these observations, the most likely origin of the <italic>Nap1l5</italic> gene is an X-to-autosome retrotransposition event, although the exact relationship between family members is less clear than for <italic>Inpp5f&#x0005f;v2</italic> and <italic>U2af1-rs1.</italic> Comparative sequence analysis using the <italic>Herc3</italic> genomic sequence reveals that this retrogene originated in a common ancestor of all eutherian mammals examined, but is absent in marsupials and nonmammalian vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030020-g002">Figure 2</xref>D).</p><p>The promoter regions of the three retrogenes are associated with CpG islands in all species in which they are present. In contrast, CpG islands are absent in the orthologous intronic regions of genomes lacking the three retrogenes. The regions of CpG-rich sequence that undergo differential methylation in the germ-line therefore arose either during or shortly after the retrogene integration events. While it is possible to correlate the timing of the retroposon integrations with the origin of the corresponding CpG islands, the mechanism by which the CpG-rich sequences arose is unclear.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Common Features of Imprinted Retrogenes</title><p>All three imprinted retrogenes that undergo differential methylation in the germ-line are situated within introns of multi-exonic genes and are likely to be derived from ancestral genes on the X chromosome.

To contextualize our data, we collated a larger sample of mouse retrogenes that were assumed not to be imprinted. A detailed survey recently revealed 3,590 retrocopied gene duplicates in the human genome, 104 of which showed evidence of expression and originated in a common ancestor of rodents and primates. The 104 mouse retrocopies were manually annotated to identify those that had maintained an intact ORF and showed EST evidence of expression in the mouse genome (build v35, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030020-sd003">Text S1</xref>).

Genes acquired more recently in the rodent lineage (e.g., <italic>U2af1-rs1</italic>) would not have been detected, and so additional candidates might be revealed by an analysis focused on the mouse genome. Because of the stringent criteria that were necessarily applied, this study would also have omitted potential retrogenes that showed the greatest degree of similarity to monoexonic paralogues (e.g., <italic>Nap1l5</italic>).</p><p>Regardless of the total number of imprinted retrogenes that are present in the mammalian genome, the properties shared by each of the four examples identified in this report are likely to yield clues to the nature of the imprinting mechanism. All four gDMR-associated retrogenes are situated within introns of actively transcribed host genes. The fact that none are situated in intergenic regions suggests that transcription through the gDMR may be a necessary mechanistic component. Several other maternally methylated gDMRs are situated within introns <italic>(Kcnq1ot1, Air, Nnat, Nespas, Gnas exon1A, Grb10),</italic> indicating that this feature is common among elements that undergo methylation during oogenesis. Further work is required to determine the mechanistic significance of this property, but we speculate that transcription through the CpG island in germ cells may play a role.</p><p>The observation that all four gDMR-associated retrogenes have paralogues situated on the X chromosome suggests that this feature may also have mechanistic significance. Male and female germ cells differ in their sex chromosome constitution, and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation results in the transcriptional shutdown of X-linked genes during spermatogenesis.

All strands showed &#x0003e;95&#x00025; conversion of non-CpG cytosines.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0030020-sd001"><label>Dataset S1</label><caption><title>Known Imprinted Genes in the Mouse</title><p>(45 KB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.0030020.sd001.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0030020-sd002"><label>Dataset S2</label><caption><title>Mouse Retrogenes Originating Prior to the Rodent/Primate Divergence</title><p>(34 KB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.0030020.sd002.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0030020-sd003"><label>Text S1</label><caption><title>Generation of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030020-sd001">Datasets S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030020-sd002">S2</xref></title><p>(31 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.0030020.sd003.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0030020-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>ORF Alignment of the Nap1l Protein Family</title><p>(93 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.0030020.sg001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0030020-sd004"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><title>PCR Primers, Conditions, and SNPs</title><p>(12 KB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.0030020.sd004.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><sec id="s5a"><title>Accession Numbers</title><p>The GenBank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank</ext-link>) accession numbers for the genes discussed in this paper are <italic>H13</italic> (NM&#x0005f;010376), <italic>INPP5F&#x0005f;V2</italic> (AK091448), <italic>MCTS2</italic> (BC053868), <italic>Mcts1</italic> (also known as <italic>Mct-1;</italic> NM&#x0005f;026902), <italic>Mcts2</italic> (NM&#x0005f;025543), <italic>NAP1L5</italic> (NM&#x0005f;153757), <italic>Nap1l2</italic> (NM&#x0005f;008671), <italic>Nap1l3</italic> (NM&#x0005f;138742), <italic>Nap1l5</italic> (NM&#x0005f;021432), <italic>Tmem114A</italic> (BC028317), <italic>Inpp5f&#x0005f;v2</italic> (also known as <italic>Tmem114B;</italic> DQ648020), <italic>U2af1-rs1</italic> (NM&#x0005f;011663), and <italic>U2af1-rs2</italic> (NM&#x0005f;178754).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank J.
