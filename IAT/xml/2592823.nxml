Upon DNA damage, an activation mechanism involving autophosphorylation has been reported to allow ATM to phosphorylate downstream targets important for cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair. In humans, serine residues 367, 1893, and 1981 have been shown to be autophosphorylation sites that are individually required for ATM activation. To test the physiological importance of these sites, we generated a transgenic mouse model in which all three conserved ATM serine autophosphorylation sites (S367/1899/1987) have been replaced with alanine. In this study, we show that ATM-dependent responses at both cellular and organismal levels are functional in mice that express a triple serine mutant form of ATM as their sole ATM species. These results lend further support to the notion that ATM autophosphorylation correlates with the DNA damage&#x02013;induced activation of the kinase but is not required for ATM function in vivo.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>J.A.

Unrepaired DSBs are a source of genomic instability that can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McKinnon and Caldecott, 2007</xref>). After sensor proteins recognize damaged chromatin, the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase is recruited to the break site and initiates a cellular response through phosphorylation of consensus sites on numerous substrates that signal for repair of the DNA and/or prevent cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shiloh, 2003</xref>). In addition to amplifying the DNA damage signal, ATM may also participate more directly in DNA repair by stabilizing repair complexes on damaged chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bredemeyer et al., 2006</xref>). The critical function of ATM in maintaining genomic stability is underscored by its high conservation in eukaryotes and its deficiency in the cancer-prone ataxia telangiectasia disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shiloh, 2003</xref>).</p><p>ATM kinase activity is directly stimulated by damaged DNA and the MRE11&#x02013;RAD50&#x02013;NBS1 (MRN) sensor complex, which also stabilizes ATM to the break site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Girard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Uziel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee and Paull, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Difilippantonio et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cerosaletti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dupre et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berkovich et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">You et al., 2007</xref>). The DNA damage&#x02013;induced activation of ATM results in the dissociation of inactive ATM dimers and/or multimers into enzymatically active monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakkenist and Kastan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee and Paull, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dupre et al., 2006</xref>). An autophosphorylation mechanism has been proposed to initiate ATM activation upon DNA damage by promoting monomerization and subsequent localization of ATM to break sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakkenist and Kastan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berkovich et al., 2007</xref>). In human cells, serine residues 367, 1893, and 1981 (S367, S1893, and S1981) have been shown to be autophosphorylation sites that are individually required for ATM activation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakkenist and Kastan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kozlov et al., 2006</xref>). In a reconstituted in vitro system, however, evidence suggests that ATM monomerization by MRN does not require ATM S1981 autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee and Paull, 2005</xref>). Moreover, using <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts, high concentrations of damaged DNA can promote ATM monomerization without concomitant autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dupre et al., 2006</xref>). Also, in a <italic>Xenopus</italic> system, there is evidence that ATM recruitment to DSBs can precede autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">You et al., 2005</xref>), further questioning its importance in ATM activation. Because of the lack of physiologically relevant models, the significance of these autophosphorylation sites still remains poorly understood.</p><p>Using an ATM transgenic mouse model, we recently found that the most prominent S1981 autophosphorylation site in humans (S1987 in mice) is dispensable for murine ATM function in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pellegrini et al., 2006</xref>). To test whether other putative autophosphorylation sites compensate for the loss of murine S1987, we used bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) recombineering to generate a transgenic mouse model in which all three conserved ATM serine autophosphorylation sites (S367/1899/1987) have been replaced with alanine. In this study, we show that ATM-dependent responses remain functionally intact in mice that express a double or triple serine mutant form of ATM as their sole ATM species. Collectively, our data strongly support the notion that DNA damage&#x02013;induced activation of the ATM kinase does not depend on autophosphorylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Triple S1987/367/1899A mutant ATM displays normal kinase activity in response to DNA DSBs</title><p>All three human ATM autophosphorylation sites are conserved in the mouse (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>).

These results suggest that ATM activation and function during CSR is intact in the absence of S1987, S367, and S1899 autophosphorylation.</p><p>The infertility of both male and female <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice results from a lack of mature gametes caused by chromosomal fragmentation and arrest during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barlow et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xu et al., 1996</xref>). <italic>Atm<sup>Tg3SA</sup>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice had normal testes size and numbers of spermatids within the seminiferous tubules compared with the degeneration and complete absence of spermatids in <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> testes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>).

Collectively, our results demonstrate that physiological DNA rearrangements that require ATM function to resolve DSBs during V(D)J, CSR, and meiotic recombination are not dependent on ATM autophosphorylation at S1987, S367, and S1899.</p><p>A hallmark of ataxia telangiectasia is extreme sensitivity to the effects of ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Taylor and Byrd, 2005</xref>).

To further investigate whether multiple ATM autophosphorylation sites are important for ATM function in vivo, mice were subjected to 8 Gy of whole-body &#x003b3; irradiation.

Although the possibility of different requirements in humans and mice exists, high conservation of the ATM protein sequence between the two organisms as well as the conservation of other phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase&#x02013;related kinase family members strongly suggests mechanistic similarity in their response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shiloh, 2003</xref>). Of note, no autophosphorylation site mutations have been identified in ataxia telangiectasia patients described thus far (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chromium.liacs.nl/LOVD2/home.php">http://chromium.liacs.nl/LOVD2/home.php</ext-link>).</p><p>Our results from transgenic mouse models strongly suggest that ATM autophosphorylation at S1987, S367, and S1899 is dispensable for the DNA damage&#x02013;induced activation and function of the kinase in vivo. We show that 3SA autophosphorylation mutant ATM can accumulate at sites of DNA damage, phosphorylate target substrates, activate cell cycle checkpoints, maintain genomic stability, and function in lymphocyte and meiotic recombination processes as well as in the recovery from whole-body irradiation. Because expression of the mutant ATM protein is 2.5-fold higher than normal, it is possible that this could mask a nonessential role for ATM autophosphorylation on ATM activity. For example, if ATM autophosphorylation were to enhance ATM activity 2.5-fold and the nonphosphorylatable ATM were expressed 2.5-fold higher than normal, mice expressing the Tg might be normal in terms of ATM function. This seems unlikely because levels of ATM expressed over a range of one- to sixfold higher than normal in <italic>Atm<sup>TgWT</sup></italic> and <italic>Atm<sup>TgS1987A</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pellegrini et al., 2006</xref>) display indistinguishable ATM substrate phosphorylations compared with <italic>Atm</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Atm</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> controls. Moreover, TgWT, TgS1987A, Tg2SA, and Tg3SA completely rescue the defects in growth, lymphocyte development, and meiotic arrest observed in <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pellegrini et al., 2006</xref>). On a different note, at least three other ATM phosphorylation sites have been identified in response to DNA damage besides S367, S1893, and S1981 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kozlov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matsuoka et al., 2007</xref>), some of which may also be sites of autophosphorylation, raising the formal possibility that other autophosphorylation sites may still compensate for the loss of S1987/367/1899. Nevertheless, pretreatment of human cells in culture with the KU55933 ATM kinase inhibitor did not affect the irradiation-induced increase in ATM kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pellegrini et al., 2006</xref>), providing additional evidence against an essential role for autophosphorylation in ATM activation.</p><p>Collectively with our in vivo evidence, we propose that ATM autophosphorylation occurs simultaneously or as a consequence of ATM activation and may be the combined result of ATM localization to break sites along with promiscuous phosphorylation of consensus sites exposed on the surface of ATM. By proposing that autophosphorylation is not the mechanism of ATM activation, we stimulate speculation on the relevant way in which damaged chromatin activates the ATM kinase. The MRN complex clearly plays a critical role in ATM activation by retaining ATM to DNA breaks, stimulating substrate binding, and directly stimulating kinase activity through activities on DNA by the RAD50 ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee and Paull, 2007</xref>). Growing evidence suggests that ATM activation at DNA damage sites is mediated through direct recruitment by MRN, and to what extent other posttranslational modifications of ATM, such as acetylation at lysine 3016 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sun et al., 2007</xref>), may function remains to be determined.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Generation of mice</title><p>The S1987A mutant murine <italic>Atm</italic> BAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pellegrini et al., 2006</xref>) was recombineered as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang and Sharan, 2003</xref>) to contain an EcoRI site between exons 35 and 36 for a PCR-based method to distinguish between <italic>Atm<sup>Tg</sup>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>Atm<sup>Tg</sup>Atm<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> genotypes.
