This inhibition by FLRT3 is specific because it can be reverted either by overexpression of C-cadherin or by treatment with the specific C-cadherin activating antibody, AA5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), similar to the regulation of C-cadherin by PAPC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Chen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

In contrast, Ogata et al. reported that FLRT3, which is also downstream of activin, inhibited C-cadherin mediated adhesion by stimulating the internalization of C-cadherin into the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Ogata1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in our experiments employing both trypsin sensitivity assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008411.s002">Figure S2A</xref>) and surface biotinylation assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008411.s002">Figure S2B and S2C</xref>), FLRT3 overexpression did not significantly affect C-cadherin levels at the cell surface, similar to activin and PAPC. Moreover, immunofluorescence staining of C-cadherin in the involuting mesoderm, where both FLRT3 and PAPC are expressed endogenously, showed no decrease in C-cadherin staining at cell-cell contacts compared to the ectodermal or endodermal regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008411.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). The extensive internalization of C-cadherin observed by Ogata et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Ogata1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> might be a secondary event due to a more severe or prolonged loss of cadherin mediated adhesion caused by prolonged and higher activin or FLRT3 expression, since disengaged cadherin molecules are known to be more susceptible to endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Le1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Kartenbeck1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

FLRT3 is mainly expressed in the dorsal marginal zone and involuting mesoderm during gastrulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Ogata1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. FLRT2 is expressed later at neurula stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Ogata1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and therefore does not need to be considered at the stage that our experiments are performed. Therefore, we eliminated the function of FLRT1 and FLRT3 proteins by either knocking down their expression with morpholinos or by knocking down the expression of RND1, the downstream effector of FLRT proteins, as done previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Ogata1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the effectiveness and specificity of these morpholinos had been described before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Ogata1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, we still tested the efficacy of FLRT3 morpholinos (FLRT3-MO) since we had anti-FLRT3 antibody. FLRT3-MO knocked down exogenously expressed FLRT3 by over 90&#x00025; in Xenopus embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008411.s003">Figure S3</xref>). In addition, FLRT1 morpholinos and RND1 morpholinos all caused gastrulation defects (data not shown) as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Ogata1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that they were effective. Co-injection of FLRT1&#x00026;3 morpholinos (FLRT-MO) or RND1 morpholinos (RND1-MO) with PAPC-RNA, counteracted the down-regulation of C-cadherin mediated adhesion that is observed with PAPC expression alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

RND1-MO and FLRT-MO had the same effects on M-PAPC induced cell adhesion decrease and cell sorting as on FL-PAPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that the absence or presence of the cytoplasmic tail of PAPC does not affect the relationship of PAPC with FLRT3 and RND1.</p><p>However, it has been reported that knocking down FLRT or RND1 expression with morpholinos increases cell adhesion in the embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Ogata1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, we find that blastomeres from FLRT-MO or RND1-MO injected embryos adhered better to C-cadherin substrates compared to mock-injected control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), and cells from RND1-MO injected embryos sort to the center of cell aggregates when mixed with uninjected control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g002">Figure 2B, right panel</xref>). In contrast, PAPC expressing cells sort to the periphery of aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Chen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g002">Figure 2B, left panel</xref>).

Therefore, RND1 or FLRT knockdown may counteract the affects of PAPC expression simply because they affect adhesion in the opposite direction of PAPC, rather than being required downstream of PAPC.</p><p>To unambiguously determine whether FLRT and RND1 are required for PAPC function, we examined whether PAPC can still induce cell sorting among cells that are uniformly deficient in RND1- or FLRT- expression. RND1 or FLRT expression was knocked down with morpholinos in all the cells used for the cell reaggregation sorting assays, and PAPC was expressed only in one half of the cells (also labeled with GFP expression). Despite the absence of RND1 or FLRTs, PAPC still caused strong cell sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Because the cell sorting activity of PAPC depends on its ability to decrease C-cadherin adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Chen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Chen2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, these results demonstrate FLRT1, FLRT3 and RND1 are not required for PAPC to mediate adhesion regulation, and that PAPC and FLRT3 probably function in parallel to dynamically regulate cadherin-mediated cell adhesion during gastrulation.</p><p>Despite the finding that they appear to be able to function independent of each other, PAPC and FLRT-RND1 may nonetheless function coordinately in the regulation of cell adhesion and sorting. We therefore examined how co-expression of PAPC and FLRT3 affect each other's cell sorting activity. As described previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>), high levels of FLRT3 expression did not cause strong cell sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, 100 pg FLRT3) because they disrupted tissue integrity that is necessary for cell sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Also, low levels of PAPC expression, which do not significantly inhibit C-cadherin-mediated adhesion, did not cause cell sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, 50 pg M-PAPC); intermediate levels of PAPC caused only modest sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, 100 pg FL-PAPC). However, when high amounts of FLRT3 RNA were co-injected with the low or intermediate amounts of PAPC RNA, the cells exhibited very strong cell sorting activity compared to embryos expressing either protein alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). As control, PAPC-TMC, an extracellular domain deleted PAPC mutant that is inactive in regulating C-cadherin mediated adhesion or inducing cell sorting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Chen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Chen2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> (also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, 100 pg PAPC-TMC), did not show the cooperation with FLRT3 in inducing cell sorting like FL-PAPC and M-PAPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Although they can regulate adhesion independently, the cooperative effects of FLRT3 and PAPC in cell sorting suggest that they might function together <italic>in vivo</italic> to optimally regulate cell adhesion, cell sorting and morphogenetic cell movements during gastrulation.</p><p>We then investigated the reason for this cooperation between PAPC and FLRT3. A clue came from the observation that FLRT3 only mediates cell sorting activity when expressed at low levels that do not cause cell dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). We therefore asked whether PAPC could modulate the adhesion disrupting activity of FLRT3. Injection of 400 pg FLRT3 RNA into early embryos lead to severe disruption of cell adhesion at the blastula stage and causes blastomeres to completely dissociate from the blastocoel roof (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), as observed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Ogata1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. When animal cap explants were excised, most of the inner layer cells were dissociated and rounded up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). However, when either M-PAPC or FL-PAPC was co-expressed with FLRT3, the cell dissociation phenotype was significantly rescued, and was limited to only a very small area immediate around the injection sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The quantitative results from several independent experiments summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g003">Figure 3C</xref> demonstrate that PAPC reproducibly rescues the FLRT3 induced cell dissociation phenotype, irrespective of the presence or absence of its cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular domain-deleted FLRT3 mutant, FLRT3-TMC (also known as FLRT3-&#x00394;LRR, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008411.s001">Figure S1</xref>), also disrupts cell adhesion similar to FLRT3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Ogata1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. As expected, FL-PAPC and M-PAPC also rescue the FLRT3-TMC induced cell dissociation phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008411.s004">Figure S4B-S4C and S4E-S4F</xref>). In contrast, PAPC-TMC failed to rescue the phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008411.s004">Figure S4D and S4H</xref>). This result not only provides a good specificity control for the rescue by FL-PAPC and M-PAPC in addition to the GFP control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008411.s004">Figure S4A and S4D</xref>), but also suggests that the extracellular domain of PAPC is required for its ability to counter FLRT3 function.</p><p>We confirmed that the suppression of FLRT3-induced cell dissociation by PAPC is due to its effects on C-cadherin-mediated adhesion. Although both PAPC and FLRT3 inhibit C-cadherin adhesion activity, with FLRT3 causing more severe inhibition, co-expression of PAPC reduced the magnitude of the effect of FLRT3 on C-cadherin mediated cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). This moderating effect of PAPC on FLRT3 function therefore produces a more physiological change in adhesion that allows cells to remain integrated in the tissue and to rearrange and sort out within the confines of the tissue. We propose that PAPC functions as a molecular &#x0201c;governor&#x0201d; to limit the activity of the more potent cell adhesion inhibitor, FLRT3, and together they decrease cadherin-mediated cell adhesion in an optimal range for morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>PAPC, FLRT3 and Cadherin Physically Interact</title><p>The similar expression profiles and the functional interactions between PAPC and FLRT3 suggest that they may physically interact. Moreover, since both proteins regulate C-cadherin adhesion activity, they may physically interact with cadherins. Although we were able to detect interactions between C-cadherin and PAPC and FLRT3 in embryo lysates using chemical crosslinking (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008411.s005">Figure S5</xref>), the signal was very weak (although reproducible) due to interference with the method by the large amounts of yolk proteins. Therefore, we decided to investigate the potential interactions between PAPC, FLRT3 and a classical cadherin in tissue culture cells using both bead recruitment assay and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay.</p><p>Co-recruitment of cell surface proteins to ligand-coated beads has been employed widely as an assay to detect interactions between membrane proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Perrais1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Fukuhara1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Microbeads coated with either human E-cadherin or with anti-HLA antibody (as a cell binding negative control) were attached to A431 cells expressing PAPC, FLRT3 or both, and cells were washed, fixed and subject to double immunofluorescence staining: red fluorescence for E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain (not present in the ligand) and green fluorescence for either PAPC or FLRT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The E-cadherin (Ecad) beads not only efficiently recruited endogenous E-cadherin to the beads as expected, but also efficiently recruited PAPC and FLRT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g004">Figure 4A</xref>: the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> columns and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g004">Figure 4B</xref>: the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> columns).

Nonetheless, a significant amount of PAPC co-IPed with FLRT3 in A431 cells expressing both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008411-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that PAPC also interacts somehow with FLRT3, either directly or mediated by E-cadherin.

PAPC, FLRT3 and RND1 are all expressed at the dorsal marginal zone and involuting mesoderm in response to the Nodal signaling during gastrulation, and they are likely to form a functional protein complex with the more broadly expressed C-cadherin protein. FLRT3 recruits the RND1 GTPase to the cell surface, where it antagonizes RhoA, disrupts cortical actin cytoskeleton network, and thereby strongly interferes with C-cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Ogata1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-WunnenbergStapleton1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Wennerberg1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Nobes1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

This ensures that the decrease in the cell adhesion is optimal for cell rearrangements without being destructive to tissue integrity.</p><p>We do not know the exact molecular details by which PAPC governs FLRT3 activity, but based on our knowledge of the protein domains involved and the biochemical properties of the two proteins, we offer the following model. FLRT3 is known to form homodimers, probably mediated by the transmembrane domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008411-Karaulanov1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and we speculate that only dimerized FLRT3 can recruit RND1 and disrupt cell adhesion.

We speculate that only oligomeric forms of PAPC transmembrane domains are competent for its interactions with FLRT3 transmembrane domain. If oligomers of PAPC inhibit dimerization of FLRT3 via interactions between their transmembrane domains, recruitment of RND1 by FLRT3 would be blocked, leading to an inhibition of FLRT3 signaling.

Stage 9 blastomeres, which were either untreated (Con), treated with 5 ng/ml activin for 1 hr, or from embryos that had been injected with 0.2 ng of FLRT3 RNA (FLRT3) or 1.5 ng of FL-PAPC (PAPC) at 4-cell stage, were incubated with surface biotinylation reagent, NHS-sulfo-s-s-Biotin. The labeled surface proteins were pulled down with neutravidin beads and analyzed by western blotting against C-cadherin. Each lane of triplet is an independent experiment. C) The quantification of the percentage of biotinylated C-cadherin in samples from B. D) Anti-C-cadherin confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of the dorsal marginal zone cryosection of a stage 12 embryo. ec &#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a; ectoderm; me &#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a; mesoderm; en &#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a; endoderm; yp &#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a; yolk plug.</p><p>(9.14 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0008411.s002.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0008411.s003"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p>FLRT3 morpholinos effectively knocks down FLRT3 expression in Xenopus embryos.
