Its activity is partially mediated by binding to syndecan 4 (S4), a proteoglycan receptor. Angiogenesis requires polarized activation of the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac1, which involves localized dissociation from RhoGDI1 and association with the plasma membrane. Previous work has shown that genetic deletion of S4 or its adapter, synectin, leads to depolarized Rac activation, decreased endothelial migration, and other physiological defects. In this study, we show that Rac1 activation downstream of S4 is mediated by the RhoG activation pathway. RhoG is maintained in an inactive state by RhoGDI1, which is found in a ternary complex with synectin and S4. Binding of S4 to synectin increases the latter's binding to RhoGDI1, which in turn enhances RhoGDI1's affinity for RhoG. S4 clustering activates PKC&#x003b1;, which phosphorylates RhoGDI1 at Ser<sup>96</sup>. This phosphorylation triggers release of RhoG, leading to polarized activation of Rac1. Thus, FGF2-induced Rac1 activation depends on the suppression of RhoG by a previously uncharacterized ternary S4&#x02013;synectin&#x02013;RhoGDI1 protein complex and activation via PKC&#x003b1;.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>FGFs are among the most potent inducers of endothelial cell migration, which is a critical event in angiogenesis and numerous other biological processes. FGFs signal via four high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFR1&#x02013;4) and the low-affinity heparan sulfate proteoglycan, syndecan 4 (S4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murakami et al., 2008</xref>). The ability of S4 to signal independently of FGF receptors is largely credited to its ability to activate PKC&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Horowitz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Partovian et al., 2008</xref>) and to assemble a signaling complex via its postsynaptic density disc large ZO-1 (PDZ)&#x02013;binding domain. This domain mediates S4's association with synectin, a ubiquitous PDZ-containing 38-kD cytoplasmic protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Studies involving the deletions of S4 and synectin have demonstrated their respective roles in physiological events as diverse as wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexopoulou et al., 2007</xref>), arterial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chittenden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dedkov et al., 2007</xref>), endotoxic shock protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishiguro et al., 2001</xref>), murine vibrissae growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iwabuchi and Goetinck, 2006</xref>), and neural crest development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Matthews et al., 2008</xref>). Although the molecular causes of these phenotypes remain largely undefined, S4&#x02013;synectin signaling is known to target the small Rho family GTPase Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tkachenko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Matthews et al., 2008</xref>), which orchestrates actin polymerization in migrating cells.</p><p>Rac1 can be activated via several parallel pathways, and its active form is typically found in highest concentrations at the plasma membrane of migrating cells' leading edges. One upstream activator of Rac1 is the highly homologous small Rho GTPase, RhoG. This protein has been specifically implicated in cell migration, activating Rac1 upon binding ELMO and Dock180 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katoh and Negishi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Katoh et al., 2006</xref>). RhoG is ubiquitously expressed and is a principal mediator of two separate endocytic pathways: macropinocytosis and caveolar endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ellerbroek et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Prieto-Sanchez et al., 2006</xref>). RhoG-mediated endocytosis is also exploited during infection by <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Patel and Galan, 2006</xref>) and <italic>Shigella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Handa et al., 2007</xref>) and is required for endothelial apical cup formation during leukocyte extravasation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van Buul et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The activation of Rho GTPases is primarily regulated by the guanine exchange factor (GEF) class of proteins. GEFs catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP on their targets, whereas GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) accelerate the intrinsic GTPase activity of these proteins and facilitate their rapid inactivation. In this way, the trimeric complex of RhoG, ELMO, and Dock180 functions as a GEF in the activation of Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katoh and Negishi, 2003</xref>). A third class of proteins, guanine dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), serves to sequester pools of inactive GTPases, shielding them from GEF and GAP interactions. Three Rho family GTPase-interacting GDIs have been identified (RhoGDI1&#x02013;3) with some degree of overlap in their GTPase targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dovas and Couchman, 2005</xref>).</p><p>We and others have shown that the genetic knockout of either S4 or synectin results in a signaling defect whereby cells exhibit a constitutively high level of Rac1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saoncella et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chittenden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tkachenko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bass et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Matthews et al., 2008</xref>). These cells migrate poorly as a result of the mislocalization and overabundance of active Rac1, and mice with the constitutive signaling imbalance display various physiological abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pankov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chittenden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Partovian et al., 2008</xref>). Correct spatial and temporal regulation of Rac1 activity is therefore an indispensable prerequisite for directional cell migration, angiogenesis, and normal cardiovascular function.</p><p>In this study, we sought to identify (a) the mechanism of basal GTPase suppression before stimulation and (b) how Rac1 becomes activated downstream of S4 during endothelial cell migration. We report that S4-mediated Rac1 activation proceeds via the RhoG&#x02013;Dock180&#x02013;ELMO pathway. Before activation, RhoGDI1 keeps RhoG inactive and sequestered as part of a previously uncharacterized protein complex with S4 and synectin. Upon FGF2 treatment, S4 oligomerization leads to PKC&#x003b1; activation, resulting in the phosphorylation of RhoGDI1 at Ser<sup>96</sup>. Phosphorylation initiates the release of RhoG from the S4&#x02013;synectin&#x02013;RhoGDI protein complex and permits its activation, which in turn induces the polarized activation of Rac1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Rac1, a critical component of endothelial cell migration, can be activated by RhoG through the DOCK180&#x02013;ELMO complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katoh and Negishi, 2003</xref>). Because RhoG plays a prominent role in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van Buul et al., 2007</xref>), we examined the involvement of RhoG in Rac1 activation when endothelial cells respond to FGF2. RhoG activity increased when rat fat pad endothelial cells (RFPECs) were stimulated with FGF2, peaking at &#x0223c;10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>). These kinetics also mirrored those of FGF2-induced Rac1 activation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810179/DC1">Fig. S1 a</ext-link>). Because FGF2 can signal via its high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptor or via S4, we examined whether S4 clustering alone is sufficient to activate RhoG. The activity of RhoG was measured upon antibody-induced clustering of an S4 chimera, which contains human Fc receptor (FcR) 1a (CD64) in place of the extracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tkachenko and Simons, 2002</xref>). S4-FcR clustering led to RhoG activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>) with kinetics comparable with those of Rac1 activation by S4-FcR clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tkachenko et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>FGF2 and S4 clustering activate Rac1 via RhoG.</bold> (a) RFPECs were cultured in 0.5% FBS/DME for 24 h before RhoG activity assay.

First, RFPECs were transfected with wild-type (WT) RhoG, A37 RhoG (which does not bind its effector, ELMO), or V12 RhoG (constitutively active). Measurement of Rac activity in cell lysates 10 min after FGF2 stimulation demonstrated a 1.5-fold increase in cells expressing WT RhoG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 c</xref>), whereas A37 RhoG significantly blunted Rac1 activation. Conversely, the constitutively active V12 RhoG mutant induced high Rac1 activity that did not change after FGF2 treatment. Second, we examined the effect of knocking down RhoG expression, in this case measuring Rac1 activity in live cells using an intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe (Raichu-Rac1). This probe measures the local balance of GEF and GAP activities but is insensitive to regulation by RhoGDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Itoh et al., 2002</xref>). In control cells, FGF2 increased Rac1 activity between 5 and 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 d</xref>, top), whereas in cells expressing RhoG short hairpin RNA (shRNA), Rac1 baseline activity was reduced (Fig. S1 b), and stimulation by FGF2 was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, d [bottom] and e</xref>). These results confirm the effects of the RhoG dominant negative and indicate that changes in GEF or GAP activity, rather than RhoGDI, must mediate the effect.</p><p>We next investigated whether RhoG is required for FGF2-induced cell migration. Knockdown of RhoG diminished endothelial cell migration in response to FGF2, whereas expression of V12 RhoG potentiated cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 f</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that FGF2 activates RhoG via S4, that RhoG is required for Rac1 activation, and that RhoG mediates FGF2-induced cell migration.</p><p>S4 is required to maintain low baseline Rac1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saoncella et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tkachenko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bass et al., 2007</xref>), although the mechanism of this effect is unknown. Given our finding that both baseline Rac1 activity and its stimulation by FGF2 depend on RhoG, we investigated whether S4 likewise affects Rac1 baseline activity via RhoG. To begin, measurement of baseline RhoG activity in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells from S4<sup>+/+</sup> and S4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed that loss of S4 significantly increased baseline RhoG activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref>). The S4 cytoplasmic tail contains a PDZ-binding sequence that interacts with synectin, a ubiquitously expressed protein that also affects Rac1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chittenden et al., 2006</xref>). A yeast two-hybrid screen with synectin as bait revealed S4 and RhoGDI1 as binding partners (unpublished data). RhoGDI1 regulates the activity of Rho family GTPases by preventing interactions with GEFs. Therefore, we explored whether S4 influences RhoG activity through synectin and RhoGDI1. A biotinylated, synthetic peptide corresponding to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of S4 bound not only synectin as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 b</xref>, top) but also pulled down RhoGDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 b</xref>, bottom) from RFPEC lysates.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>S4 mediates baseline RhoG activity and associates with synectin, RhoGDI1, and RhoG.</bold> (a) Murine pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells from WT and S4 knockout mice were cultured in 0.5% FBS/DME for 24 h before assay of RhoG activity. &#x003b2;-Actin and RhoGDI were used as loading controls.

In both cases, the target proteins were pulled down only when incubated with the S4 tail peptide. (c) Coimmunoprecipitations were performed with antibodies against RhoGDI and synectin in three cell lines: WT RFPECs (left), RFPECs expressing the S4-FcR chimera (middle), and RFPECs expressing the S4-FcR (PDZ&#x02212;) chimera (right). &#x003b2;-Actin was used as a loading control. IP, immunoprecipitation. (d) Glutathione beads conjugated with recombinant RhoGDI1 (right) or without the recombinant protein (left) were incubated with lysates of RFPECs for 12 h at 4&#x000b0;C. After washing, proteins were denatured by boiling and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a membrane and probed for RhoG and synectin. (e) RFPECs were transfected with the S4-FcR chimera. Cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated human IgG to stain the chimera (left), washed twice with PBS, fixed, permeabilized, and stained with antibodies against RhoGDI1 and RhoG (middle and right, respectively). Arrows indicate regions of colocalization.

RhoGDI immunoprecipitates contained synectin in WT RFPECs and in RFPECs overexpressing the S4-FcR chimera but not in RFPEC overexpressing the S4 chimera containing a nonfunctional PDZ-binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 c</xref>, top). Synectin immunoprecipitation also brought down less RhoGDI in these cells compared with S4-overexpressing or WT S4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 c</xref>, middle). Because the PDZ-binding domain of S4 is required to bind synectin, these data demonstrate the importance of S4&#x02013;synectin interaction in synectin's binding to RhoGDI1.</p><p>Whether RhoG associates with this S4&#x02013;synectin&#x02013;RhoGDI1 complex was studied next. Published data are inconsistent on whether RhoG binds RhoGDI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Faur&#x000e9; and Dagher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brunet et al., 2002</xref>). We found that glutathione beads conjugated with recombinant GST-RhoGDI1 bound both synectin and RhoG from RFPEC lysates, whereas control beads showed no binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 d</xref>). The use of purified RhoGDI1 in combination with a specific anti-RhoG antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Meller et al., 2008</xref>) in these experiments provides strong evidence for this interaction. The cellular distribution of RhoG in living cells also changes in a RhoGDI1-dependent manner, further demonstrating the interaction of these two proteins (Fig. S1 c). We finally sought to confirm the existence of this protein complex within intact cells. The S4-FcR chimera was expressed and stained in RFPECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 e</xref>). Despite the largely cytoplasmic distribution of RhoGDI1, certain membrane regions demonstrated colocalization of the S4 construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 e</xref>, left), RhoGDI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 e</xref>, middle), and RhoG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 e</xref>, right). Validation of the RhoG monoclonal antibody for immunofluorescence is presented in Fig. S1 (d&#x02013;f).</p><p>We hypothesized that the interaction between RhoG and RhoGDI1 is regulated, which may account for the contradictory reports in different studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Faur&#x000e9; and Dagher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brunet et al., 2002</xref>). To test whether synectin enhances RhoGDI's affinity for RhoG, we measured the effect of synectin overexpression in RFPECs on RhoG activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 a</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, synectin overexpression decreased RhoG activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 a</xref>), and endothelial cells from synectin knockout mice were also found to have high basal levels of RhoG activity (Fig. S1 g). To test whether synectin suppresses RhoG activity by increasing RhoGDI's affinity for RhoG, we used two complementary approaches. First, the effect of overexpressed synectin on binding of RhoG to recombinant GST-tagged RhoGDI1 was examined. RFPECs were transfected with His-tagged synectin or GFP as a control. Expression of synectin substantially increased binding of endogenous RhoG to RhoGDI1 beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 b</xref>, compare left with middle), whereas no binding was observed to glutathione beads alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 b</xref>, right). Interestingly, synectin overexpression also enhanced RhoGDI&#x02013;Rac1 binding (Fig. S1 h). Second, we examined the effect of synectin knockout on the ability of RhoGDI1 to bind RhoG. In murine lung endothelial cells, immunoprecipitation of RhoGDI1 brought down less RhoG in synectin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells than in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 c</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that synectin enhances both the binding of RhoG by RhoGDI and the suppression of RhoG activity.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Synectin and RhoGDI1 are required for RhoG suppression at baseline.</bold> (a) WT murine pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells were transfected with either GFP- or 4His-tagged synectin 48 h before lysis and RhoG activity assay.

Previous studies indicate that S4 oligomerization leads to the activation of PKC&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oh et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horowitz et al., 2002</xref>). To explore the role of this kinase in RhoG activation, we examined the effect of constitutively active (myristoylated) PKC&#x003b1; on baseline RhoG activity. RFPECs transfected with myristoylated PKC&#x003b1; showed increased RhoG activation at baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 a</xref>). Conversely, a dominant-negative PKC&#x003b1; construct blocked FGF2-induced RhoG activation (Fig. S1 i). RhoGDI1 is among the targets of PKC&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Price et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knezevic et al., 2007</xref>); therefore, we hypothesized that PKC&#x003b1;-dependent phosphorylation of RhoGDI1 might cause release of RhoG followed by its activation. To determine which RhoGDI1 phosphorylation site affects RhoG binding, RhoGDI1 constructs with mutated phosphorylation sites were screened (unpublished data). The Ser<sup>96</sup> residue, when mutated to alanine (S96A), resulted in baseline levels of RhoG activity that were comparable with GFP controls, whereas a phosphomimetic mutation (S96D) led to strong activation of RhoG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 b</xref>). The S96A mutant did not suppress RhoG activity as efficiently as WT RhoGDI, mirroring this mutation's effect on RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knezevic et al., 2007</xref>) and implying that alanine substitution at this site also moderately weakens RhoGDI&#x02013;RhoG binding. This result also indicates that in previously reported instances of simultaneous RhoG and RhoA activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van Buul et al., 2007</xref>), the Ser<sup>96</sup> residue of RhoGDI1 is a common site of regulation.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>PKC&#x003b1; phosphorylation of RhoGDI1 at Ser<sup>96</sup> induces RhoG activation.</bold> (a) RFPECs were transduced with GFP or GFP-myristoylated PKC&#x003b1; adenoviral constructs for 48 h before RhoG activity assay.

(c) RFPECs with stable expression of the S4-FcR chimera were used to cluster the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of S4. These cells were treated with 2 &#x000b5;g/ml nonimmune human IgG and washed twice with PBS. Clustering was initiated with anti&#x02013;human IgG F(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> fragments at 3 &#x000b5;g/ml for the indicated times. Cells were lysed and analyzed by immunoblotting. A rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for the phosphorylation of Ser<sup>96</sup> was used for the top panel. (d) HeLa cells overexpressing the indicated GFP-tagged RhoGDI1 mutants were lysed 72 h after transfection and subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-GFP antibodies conjugated to protein A/G beads. The immunoblot was probed for RhoG. RhoGDI1 (S96D) leads to decreased RhoG&#x02013;RhoGDI1 interaction. (e) RFPECs were transfected with the indicated constructs and serum starved. FGF2 treatment was performed for 1 min. Lysates were subsequently analyzed by Western blotting using anti&#x02013;phospho-RhoGDI (Ser<sup>96</sup>) antibodies. Both FGF2 and (myristoylated) constitutively active (CA) PKC&#x003b1; resulted in RhoGDI1 phosphorylation Ser<sup>96</sup>, whereas kinase-dead (KD) PKC&#x003b1; resulted in a lower baseline level of RhoGDI phosphorylation at this residue. Error bars represent SEM.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_200810179_GS_Fig4"/></fig><p>We next studied RhoGDI1 phosphorylation more directly with a phosphorylation site&#x02013;specific antibody (validation shown in Fig. S1, j and k). RhoGDI1 Ser<sup>96</sup> phosphorylation was detected within 1 min after clustering the S4-FcR chimera and then returned to a lower plateau level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 c</xref>). Thus, RhoGDI1 phosphorylation precedes RhoG and Rac1 activation. To establish a functional role for RhoGDI1 Ser<sup>96</sup> phosphorylation, we expressed GFP-tagged RhoGDI1 mutants in HeLa cells (on account of their high transfection efficiency) and performed immunoprecipitations using antibodies against GFP. The S96D mutation resulted in decreased association between RhoGDI and RhoG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 d</xref>). We confirmed a published report that the Ser<sup>96</sup> site does not affect Rac1 activity (Fig. S1 l; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knezevic et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, despite their homology, interactions of RhoGDI with RhoG and Rac1 are regulated differently, and the data are consistent with a direct effect on RhoG followed by an indirect effect on Rac1. Finally, we demonstrated that both FGF2 treatment and transfection with constitutively active PKC&#x003b1; result in phosphorylated Ser<sup>96</sup>, whereas transfection with dominant-negative PKC&#x003b1; diminishes this phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 e</xref>). Collectively, these results support a model in which activation of PKC&#x003b1; by S4 triggers phosphorylation of RhoGDI and release of RhoG, which can then be activated by GEFs that reside near the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>RhoG activation is regulated by a S4&#x02013;synectin&#x02013;RhoGDI1 complex.</bold> RhoG activity is suppressed at baseline by a complex consisting of S4, synectin, and RhoGDI1. Within this complex, S4 enhances synectin&#x02013;RhoGDI1 binding, and synectin increases the affinity of RhoGDI1 for RhoG. Upon FGF2 stimulation and subsequent S4 oligomerization, PKC&#x003b1; becomes activated, which phosphorylates RhoGDI at its Ser<sup>96</sup> residue. This induces the dissociation of RhoG from RhoGDI1, after which RhoG becomes activated. Active RhoG associates with ELMO1 and Dock180 to form a functional GEF complex, which is required for Rac1 activation in this pathway.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_200810179_RGB_Fig5"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Rho family GTPase activation is generally a fast and transient event effected by local shifts in the balance between GEFs and GAPs. RhoGDI1 is also important in GTPase regulation. Indeed, knockdown of this protein results in a more than twofold increase in baseline RhoG activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 d</xref>). This result demonstrates that when RhoG is not sequestered by RhoGDI1, the GEF/GAP balance favors RhoG activation. We therefore sought to characterize the mechanism of RhoGDI-dependent GTPase suppression between activation cycles.</p><p>Studying the RhoGDI&#x02013;RhoG interaction, we identified a novel multiprotein complex of S4&#x02013;synectin&#x02013;RhoGDI1 as the central regulatory component of RhoG activity. The contributions of each protein were then characterized beginning with S4. A single amino acid deletion in the PDZ-binding domain of S4 diminished the efficiency of ternary complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 c</xref>). This finding explains previous results that a mutated PDZ-binding domain results in elevated Rac1 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tkachenko et al., 2006</xref>) and demonstrates the importance of S4 in stabilizing the complex.</p><p>Synectin was also found to be an indispensable component of the ternary RhoG regulation complex. Our data are the first to describe a protein that enhances the affinity of RhoGDI1 for a GTPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, a&#x02013;c</xref>), although studies have characterized proteins that perform the opposite role: the ezrin&#x02013;radixin&#x02013;moesin (ERM)-CD44 system, involved in actin reorganization, is a direct binding partner of RhoGDI that decreases the affinity of the GDI for Rho GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirao et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Takahashi et al., 1997</xref>). Furthermore, the neurotrophin receptor p75<sup>NTR</sup> and nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Etk also decrease RhoGDI1&#x02013;RhoA association, leading to RhoA activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yamashita and Tohyama, 2003</xref>). Although functionally opposed to synectin, ezrin similarly binds directly to both RhoGDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirao et al., 1996</xref>) and syndecans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gran&#x000e9;s et al., 2000</xref>); these observations present another interesting dimension to the antagonism between ezrin and synectin, one that is likely to be illuminated upon discovery of their specific RhoGDI-binding sites.</p><p>RhoGDI1 inhibits RhoG activation by GEFs and serves as the physical link between S4&#x02013;synectin and RhoG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, d and e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, b and c</xref>; and Fig. S1 b). However, conflicting studies describe RhoG's ability to bind RhoGDI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Faur&#x000e9; and Dagher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brunet et al., 2002</xref>). In this study, the use of purified RhoGDI1 with a specific anti-RhoG antibody enabled us to definitively determine that this interaction exists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, d and e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3, b and c</xref>; and Fig. S1 b) and is functionally significant in RhoG activity regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 d</xref>). S4 and synectin increased this interaction, which may furthermore explain the failure to detect binding in previous studies. Although synectin was shown to enhance the RhoGDI&#x02013;GTPase interaction for both RhoG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 b</xref>) and Rac1 (Fig. S1 h), whether this effect encompasses additional Rho family GTPases remains to be determined.</p><p>Published studies involving RhoGDI2 (Ly-GDI or GDI-D4) have shown the ability of this GDI to affect the activity states and localization of Rho GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ota et al., 2004</xref>), and we investigated whether RhoGDI1 likewise determines the localization and activity of RhoG. Our finding that the Ser<sup>96</sup> site is phosphorylated to release RhoG from RhoGDI is supported by related published findings. First, RhoGDI1 is phosphorylated by p21-activated kinase on two sites, causing Rac1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DerMardirossian et al., 2004</xref>). RhoGDI1 Ser<sup>96</sup> also becomes phosphorylated by PKC&#x003b1; and is involved in RhoA activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knezevic et al., 2007</xref>). Given that RhoA and RhoG are often activated simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van Buul et al., 2007</xref>), it is likely that Ser<sup>96</sup> phosphorylation determines the activity of both GTPases similarly.</p><p>Finally, our confirmation of the observation that Ser<sup>96</sup> phosphorylation does not affect Rac1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knezevic et al., 2007</xref>) indicates an important point of departure between RhoG and Rac1; these two proteins have high sequence homology, are part of the same signaling pathway, are activated with similar kinetics, and both bind to RhoGDI1. However, we demonstrate that activation via Ser<sup>96</sup> phosphorylation affects only RhoG. Although critical in FGF2 signaling, RhoG is not common to all signaling cascades that converge upon Rac1. For example, syndecans and integrins contribute synergistically but distinctly to GTPase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bass et al., 2007</xref>), and integrin-mediated Rac1 activation does not require RhoG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Meller et al., 2008</xref>). In the case of FGF2 stimulation, the finding that A37 RhoG blocks Rac1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 c</xref>) strongly suggests ELMO1&#x02013;Dock180 involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katoh and Negishi, 2003</xref>), although other parallel RhoG-dependent modes of Rac1 activation could also contribute.</p><p>Previous studies indicated that S4 orchestrates the polarization of active Rac1 in the presence of chemotactic signals such as FGF2 and that S4 induces Rac-dependent cell migration in a manner that requires both its PDZ-binding domain and PKC&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tkachenko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bass et al., 2007</xref>). This study unifies these observations with the discovery of the S4&#x02013;synectin&#x02013;RhoGDI1 protein complex. Examining this ternary complex revealed a mechanism to explain these earlier reports that the S4 PDZ-binding domain is crucial for GTPase regulation: the PDZ-binding domain mediates the S4&#x02013;synectin interaction and enhances the latter's affinity for RhoGDI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 c</xref>). Additionally, our observations substantiate the involvement of PKC&#x003b1; by showing that this kinase phosphorylates RhoGDI1, releasing RhoG to activate Rac1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>More importantly, we found that the S4&#x02013;synectin&#x02013;RhoGDI1 complex mediates the baseline suppression of RhoG. How such GTPases are constitutively maintained in their inactive states has been poorly understood, and our data reveal the mechanism by which S4 and synectin are required for this process. Disrupting any part of the S4&#x02013;synectin&#x02013;RhoGDI1 complex (by gene silencing or mutagenesis) creates a persistently dysregulated state of active RhoG by decreasing its binding to RhoGDI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref>; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, a and d</xref>). Although this invariably leads to a high baseline level of RhoG and Rac1 activity, FGF2 stimulation is still able to further activate these GTPases in cells lacking S4 or synectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chittenden et al., 2006</xref>). This result implies that the S4&#x02013;synectin&#x02013;RhoGDI1 complex mediates the sequestration and release of inactive RhoG but is dispensable for actual activation event, which is presumably catalyzed by a yet undetermined GEF. In the case of FGF2 signaling, it is likely that activation of this GEF proceeds downstream of FGF tyrosine kinase receptor (FGFR1&#x02013;4) signaling.</p><p>In animal models, genetic deletions of S4, synectin, or RhoGDI1 result in pronounced vascular phenotypes (both developmental and homeostatic) that include arterial branching defects, endotoxic shock susceptibility, elevated blood pressure, and enhanced pulmonary vessel permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishiguro et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chittenden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gorovoy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Partovian et al., 2008</xref>).
