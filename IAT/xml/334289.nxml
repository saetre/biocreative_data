In addition to the previously characterized Oct-1, Oct-2 and Brn-3 factors, ND7 cells have been shown by this means to express a novel POU factor. This factor is closely related to Brn-3 but differs at seven amino acids in the POU domain, one of which is located in a region which is critical for protein-protein interactions between different POU proteins. Like Brn-3, the novel factor is expressed at high levels in embryonic brain and declines in abundance during neuronal development. In contrast to Brn-3 however, it is absent in mature sensory neurons and its expression declines during the in vitro differentiation of ND7 cells to a non-dividing phenotype whilst Brn-3 expression increases. The significance of these distinct but overlapping expression patterns is discussed in terms of the possible role of these two factors in regulating neuronal gene expression.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00230-0131-a" xlink:role="5095"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00230-0131-b" xlink:role="5095"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00230-0131-c" xlink:role="5095"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00230-0129.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5093"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00230-0130.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5094"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00230-0131.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5095"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00230-0132.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5096"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
