RVFV is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes fever and severe hemorrhagic illness among humans, and fever and high rates of abortions in livestock. A nonstructural RVFV NSs protein inhibits the transcription of host mRNAs, including interferon-&#x003b2; mRNA, and is a major virulence factor. The present study explored a novel function of the RVFV NSs protein by testing the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs gene in the presence of actinomycin D (ActD) or &#x003b1;-amanitin, both of which served as a surrogate of the host mRNA synthesis suppression function of the NSs. In the presence of the host-transcriptional inhibitors, the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs protein, but not that carrying NSs, induced double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)&#x02013;mediated eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)2&#x003b1; phosphorylation, leading to the suppression of host and viral protein translation. RVFV NSs promoted post-transcriptional downregulation of PKR early in the course of the infection and suppressed the phosphorylated eIF2&#x003b1; accumulation. These data suggested that a combination of RVFV replication and NSs-induced host transcriptional suppression induces PKR-mediated eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation, while the NSs facilitates efficient viral translation by downregulating PKR and inhibiting PKR-mediated eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation. Thus, the two distinct functions of the NSs, i.e., the suppression of host transcription, including that of type I interferon mRNAs, and the downregulation of PKR, work together to prevent host innate antiviral functions, allowing efficient replication and survival of RVFV in infected mammalian hosts.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The mosquito-borne bunyavirus Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) devastates both humans and domestic animals; it causes abortions in ruminants and complications such as hemorrhage, encephalitis, or retinal vasculitis in humans. A major RVFV virulence factor, NSs, disables host cell mRNA synthesis. Here we describe our new evidence that showed NSs working in a second way; in addition to inhibiting host cell transcription, NSs kept translation active in infected cells. It is well-established that activated protein kinase PKR phosphorylates a translation factor, eIF2&#x003b1;, and then this phosphorylated eIF2&#x003b1; suppresses translation. We found that NSs decreased PKR abundance and prevented eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation in infected cells, allowing efficient viral translation and replication. In contrast, when cells were infected with an RVFV mutant lacking NSs in the presence of transcriptional inhibitors that mimic the transcription inhibition function of NSs, the PKR reduction did not occur and phoshorylated eIF2&#x003b1; was accumulated, resulting in the inhibition of virus gene expression and replication. Thus, NSs functions in two ways to help RVFV replicate in mammalian hosts: its newly identified PKR downregulation function secures efficient viral translation, and its host transcription inhibition function suppresses the expression of host innate antiviral functions.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic pathogen, which is distributed in sub-Saharan Africa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000287-Peters1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> and has also caused large outbreaks in Madagascar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000287-Morvan1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, Egypt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000287-Meegan1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000287-ElAkkad1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000287-Arthur1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, Saudi Arabia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000287-Shoemaker1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, and Yemen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000287-Shoemaker1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

Furthermore, the RVFV NSs binds to Sin3A-Associated Protein 30 (SAP30), which is important for maintaining the repressor complex containing histone deacetylase 3 on the interferon (IFN)-&#x003b2; promoter, and suppresses the IFN-&#x003b2; promoter activation early in infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000287-LeMay2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

Because RNA synthesis of bunyaviruses occurs in the cytoplasm, NSs protein in cytoplasm may promote the minigenome RNA synthesis by unknown mechanism.</p><p>To establish that RVFV NSs exhibits a novel function, we hypothesized that, when combined, RVFV replication and NSs-induced host transcription suppression likely induces a cellular environment that is unsuitable for viral replication. Thus, to secure efficient RVFV replication, the NSs protein, in turn, alters this putative, virally unfriendly cellular environment to one that supports efficient viral replication. To test this possibility, we examined the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs gene, a mutant which was generated by employing a reverse genetics system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000287-Ikegami1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, in the presence of a host transcription inhibitor, e.g., actinomycin D (ActD) or &#x003b1;-amanitin; these drugs were selected because they mimicked the host transcriptional suppressive activities of the NSs. Consistent with our supposition, RVFV lacking the NSs, but not RVFV, failed to replicate efficiently in ActD-treated cells. We noted that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-mediated eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)2&#x003b1; phosphorylation suppressed the translation of RVFV lacking NSs in the presence of ActD. Further studies uncovered that RVFV NSs promoted PKR downregulation as early as 4 hours post-infection, and prevented eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation, which secured efficient viral translation. We speculate that this novel function of RVFV is important for counteracting the antiviral activities of PKR and allowing efficient virus replication and survival in infected hosts.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>RVFV lacking the NSs undergoes poor viral protein synthesis and viral replication in ActD-treated cells</title><p>To explore a novel biological function of RVFV NSs protein, in addition to its host transcriptional shutoff activity, we investigated the effect of ActD, a host transcriptional inhibitor, on the replication of MP-12 lacking the NSs gene in IFN-incompetent VeroE6 cells.

Cell extracts were prepared at 16 h.p.i., and the samples were applied to SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000287-g001">Figure 1C, top panel</xref>). In the absence of ActD, the host protein synthesis of rMP12-rLuc-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000287-g001">Figure 1C, lane 5</xref>) and rMP12-C13type-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000287-g001">Figure 1C, lane 7</xref>) was more efficient than that of MP-12-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000287-g001">Figure 1C, lane 3</xref>). It is possible that NSs-mediated transcriptional suppression that occurred only in MP-12-infected cells, but not in cells infected with viruses lacking NSs, caused a reduction of host mRNA abundance, leading to the less efficient translation of host mRNAs in MP-12-infected cells. Efficient N protein synthesis occurred in cells infected with all three viruses in the absence of ActD, a finding which was consistent with our previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000287-Ikegami1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, while for some unknown reasons the accumulation of N proteins of rMP12-rLuc and rMP12-C13type was slightly higher than that of MP-12. ActD treatment resulted in a strong inhibition of both host proteins and N protein synthesis in rMP12-rLuc-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000287-g001">Figure 1C, lane 6</xref>) and rMP12-C13type-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000287-g001">Figure 1C, lane 8</xref>). In contrast, ActD treatment did not inhibit N protein translation in MP-12-infected cells; rather, it moderately inhibited host protein synthesis in MP-12-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000287-g001">Figure 1C, lane 4</xref>). A similar ActD-induced, moderate host protein synthesis inhibition also occurred in mock-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000287-g001">Figure 1C, lane 2</xref>). Western blot analysis of cell extracts at 16 h.p.i. clearly showed that ActD treatment strongly inhibited N protein accumulation in rMP12-rLuc-infected cells and rMP12-C13type-infected cells, but not in MP-12-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000287-g001">Figure 1C, bottom panels</xref>). In summary, ActD treatment had little effect on MP-12 replication, whereas it strongly inhibited the expression of both host and viral proteins in the cells infected with MP-12 lacking the NSs gene, which resulted in poor virus production.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>NSs protein expression promotes viral replication in rMP12-rLuc&#x02013;infected cells in the presence of ActD</title><p>To further confirm that the NSs exerted an efficient viral replication in the cells that underwent ActD-induced host transcriptional suppression, 293 cells, which showed higher RNA transfection efficiencies than did VeroE6 cells (data not shown), were infected with rMP12-rLuc at an moi of 2. After virus adsorption, infected cells were mock-transfected or independently transfected with in vitro-synthesized RNA transcripts encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), MP-12 NSs, or wt RVFV ZH501 NSs. Then, the cells were mock-treated or treated with ActD.

The endogenous PKR-mediated eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation suppressed translation of the RVFV lacking the NSs gene, resulting in poor virus replication.

Namely, nuclear NSs protein inhibits transcription of host mRNAs, including the IFN mRNAs; this activity is critical for efficient RVFV replication in IFN-competent systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000287-LeMay1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000287-Billecocq1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. However, a combination of RVFV replication and NSs-mediated host mRNA transcriptional suppression possibly induces PKR activation and subsequent eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation as a combination of RVFV replication and ActD or &#x003b1;-amanitin treatment induced it. The NSs protein, in turn, promotes PKR downregulation as early as 4 h.p.i., and prevents eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation to secure the translation of viral mRNAs and efficient virus replication. We think that both of these two NSs functions are tightly related and protect efficient viral replication by suppressing host antiviral responses.

Furthermore, some of the host pathogen-recognition receptors, e.g., toll-like receptors 3 and 7, in uninfected cells located near the RVFV-infected cells, recognize virus-specific signals, e.g., viral RNAs in the virus particles or viral dsRNAs in the cell debris from infected cells, leading to type I IFN production.

Thus, a significant accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2&#x003b1; occurred only in cells in which replication of RVFV lacking NSs was combined with the treatment with transcriptional inhibitors.</p><p>Several different mechanisms are conceivable for the accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2&#x003b1; in rMP12-rLuc-infected in cells treated with ActD or &#x003b1;-amanitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000287-g004">Figure 4</xref>). One possible mechanism relates to the eIF2&#x003b1; dephosphorylation step. Phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1; at Serine 51 induces a rapid synthesis of activating transcription factor (ATF)-4 mRNA, which can be translated in the presence of phosphorylated eIF2&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000287-Harding1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.

Other possible mechanisms relate to the failure to suppress the PKR function. Cells infected with adenovirus, human immunodeficiency virus-1, or herpes simplex virus undergo a dramatic increase in the abundance of Alu RNA, which carries a repetitive element of &#x0223c;300-nt in length that is transcribed by RNA polymerase III <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000287-Jang1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000287-Jang2">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000287-Panning1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000287-Hasler1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>.

If rMP12-rLuc replication induces Alu RNA accumulation to prevent PKR activation, then the drug-induced transcriptional suppression would inhibit Alu RNA accumulation, preventing Alu RNA-mediated PKR inactivation. Another possibility is that rMP12-rLuc replication transcriptionally induces host mRNAs, and some of their gene products have PKR inhibition activities. An example of this possibility is that influenza virus replication induces P58<sup>IPK</sup>, an inhibitor of PKR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000287-Lee1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. ActD or &#x003b1;-amanitin treatment suppresses the expression of the putative PKR inhibitor, resulting in an accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2&#x003b1;.

In contrast to poliovirus, only RVFV NSs protein was probably required for PKR downregulation since the downregulation of PKR occurred as early as 4 h.p.i. in RVFV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000287-g007">Figure 7G</xref>), whereas phosphorylated eIF2&#x003b1; accumulation occurred around 8 h.p.i. in rMP-12-rLuc-infected cells in the presence of ActD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000287-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, NSs downregulated PKRK296R, a non-phosphorylatable mutant PKR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000287-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). These data suggest that the phosphorylation of PKR was not essential for the NSs-mediated PKR downregulation.</p><p>A substantial reduction in the abundance of PKR occurred in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of MP-12-infected cells, but not in the mock-infected cells and in those infected with MP12 lacking NSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000287-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Expression of NSs alone resulted in a reduction in the amount of PKR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000287-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). These data established that NSs protein induced PKR downregulation. The NSs-induced PKR downregulation occurred as early as 4 h.p.i. of MP-12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000287-g007">Figure 7G</xref>). We also demonstrated the presence of PKR mRNA in NSs-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000287-g007">Figure 7C</xref>) and that ActD treatment had little effect on the NSs-induced PKR downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000287-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). We failed to detect PKR at 16 h.p.i. of MP-12-infected 293 cells, and yet we easily detected the PKR after a 16 h-long incubation of 293 cells with puromycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000287-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). Accordingly, the putative NSs-induced translational inhibition was not a main reason for the reduction in the abundance of PKR. Furthermore, pulse-chase experiments showed that NSs expression reduced the abundance of radiolabelled myc-tagged PKR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000287-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). All of these data strongly suggested that the NSs induced PKR downregulation at post-transcriptional levels.</p><p>It was reported that treatment of a macrophage cell line with IFN-&#x003b3; induced PKR degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000287-Maggi1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. Because NSs induced PKR degradation in ActD-treated cells and ActD treatment completely inhibited the IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000287-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), it is highly unlikely that IFN-&#x003b3; was involved in the NSs-induced PKR downregulation. PKC activation also potentially induces PKR downregulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000287-Zhou1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Treatment of MP-12-infected cells with a PKC inhibitor, G&#x000d6;6983, did not inhibit NSs-mediated PKR downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000287-g007">Figure 7D</xref>), which implied that PKC was not involved in it. Experiments using a proteasome inhibitor suggested that the NSs promoted PKR degradation through a proteasome pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000287-g007">Figure 7F</xref>). MG132 can induce GCN activation and translational suppression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000287-Mazroui1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.

Accordingly, a possibility still exists that the MG132-induced moderate translational inhibition affected the NSs-induced PKR degradation in MG132-treated cells. For example, if the NSs-induced PKR downregulation requires an unstable host protein, then the MG132-induced moderate translational suppression would prevent accumulation of this putative host protein, resulting in inhibition of the NSs-induced PKR downregulation. Obviously further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of PKR downregulation mediated by RVFV NSs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>Vero E6 cells, wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells and <italic>Pkr<sup>0/0</sup></italic> MEF cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000287-Yang1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> were maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) containing 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum.

Separate tubes (singleplex) real-time PCR was performed with 40 ng cDNA for both target gene and endogenous control by using a Taqman Gene expression master mix (Applied Biosystems: 4370074). The cycling parameters for real-time PCR were: UNG activation at 50&#x000b0;C for 2 min, AmpliTaq activation at 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min, denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 15 sec, and annealing/extension at 60&#x000b0;C for 1 min (repeat 40 times) on ABI7000. Duplicate C<sub>T</sub> values were analyzed by the comparative C<sub>T</sub> (&#x00394;&#x00394; C<sub>T</sub>) method, as described by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). The amount of target (2<sup>&#x02212;&#x00394;&#x00394;CT</sup>) was obtained by normalized to endogenous reference (18S rRNA) and relative to a calibrator (one of the experimental samples).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1000287.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Effects of ActD treatment on host translation activities.
