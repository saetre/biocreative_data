Several gene variants are known to alter triglyceride concentrations, including those in the <italic>Apolipoprotein E </italic>(<italic>ApoE</italic>), <italic>Lipoprotein Lipase </italic>(<italic>LPL</italic>), and most recently, the <italic>Apolipoprotein AV </italic>(<italic>ApoAV</italic>) gene. However, less is known about how variants in these genes alter triglyceride concentrations in pregnancy or affect fetal growth. We aimed to determine the effect of the recently identified <italic>ApoAV </italic>gene on triglycerides in pregnancy and fetal growth. We assessed the role of two <italic>ApoAV </italic>haplotypes, defined by the C and W alleles of the -1131T&#x0003e;C and S19W polymorphisms, in 483 pregnant women and their offspring from the Exeter Family Study of Childhood Health.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The -1131T&#x0003e;C and S19W variants have rare allele frequencies of 6.7% and 4.9% and are present in 13.4% and 9.7% of subjects respectively. In carriers of the -1131C and 19W alleles triglyceride concentrations were raised by 11.0% (1.98 mmol/ l(1.92 &#x02013; 2.04) to 2.20 mmol/l (2.01 &#x02013; 2.42), p = 0.035; and 16.2% (1.97 mmol/l (1.91 &#x02013; 2.03) to 2.29 mmol/l (2.12 &#x02013; 2.48), p &#x0003c; 0.001 respectively. There is nominally significant evidence that the -1131T&#x0003e;C variant is having an effect on maternal height (164.9 cm (164.3 &#x02013; 165.5) to 167.0 cm (165.2 &#x02013; 168.8), p = 0.029). There was no evidence that <italic>ApoAV </italic>genotype alters any other anthropometric measurements or biochemistries such as High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) or Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C). There is nominally significant evidence that the presence of a maternal -1131C variant alters fetal birth length (50.2 cm (50.0 &#x02013; 50.4) to 50.9 cm (50.3 &#x02013; 51.4), p = 0.022), and fetal birth crown-rump length (34.0 cm (33.8 &#x02013; 34.1) to 34.5 cm (34.1 &#x02013; 35.0), p = 0.023). There is no evidence that <italic>ApoAV </italic>genotype alters fetal birth weight or other fetal growth measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion variation in the <italic>ApoAV </italic>gene raises triglyceride concentrations in pregnancy, as well as normolipaemic states and there is preliminary evidence that it alters fetal growth parameters.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Triglycerides are a key fetal fuel in pregnancy. Triglyceride concentrations are raised in pregnancy due to the overproduction of triglyceride rich very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Pregnancy also elevates total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and lowers high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Triglyceride concentrations increase gradually with the duration of pregnancy with significant increases during the second trimester [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations return to pre-pregnant concentrations 20&#x02013;24 weeks post partum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], with a rapid reduction in triglycerides and cholesterol in breast-feeding mothers compared to mothers where lactation was never established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations are under strong genetic control. Variants in several genes, including, <italic>ApoE </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], <italic>LPL </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], <italic>LDL receptor </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], <italic>Apolipoprotein CIII </italic>(<italic>ApoCIII</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], <italic>Apolipoprotein AIV (ApoAIV) </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and, recently <italic>ApoAV </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] are associated with altered triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Despite this, little is known about how these variants alter lipid profiles in pregnancy. In one study of 250 pregnant females from a number of ethnic groups, the genes encoding <italic>LPL </italic>(S447X and N291S) and <italic>ApoE </italic>(E2 allele) are associated with altered triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol concentrations in pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>High triglyceride concentrations in pregnancy can result in acute pancreatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and are associated with pre-eclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In addition to these implications for maternal health, maternal triglyceride concentrations are correlated with offspring birth weight. This correlation is independent of maternal pre-pregnant Body Mass Index (BMI), maternal weight gain, fasting glucose, gender and gestational age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Common variation in the <italic>ApoAV </italic>gene has recently been shown to have one of the largest effects on triglyceride concentrations in the normal population. <italic>ApoAV </italic>was recently discovered in the <italic>ApoAI/CIII </italic>and <italic>AIV </italic>gene cluster using comparative genomics of human and mouse genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Studies on transgenic and knockout mice showed that <italic>ApoAV </italic>is a key regulator of triglyceride concentrations in mice. In man, two haplotypes of the <italic>ApoAV </italic>gene, each of ~6.0% frequency in caucasians and defined by the C and W alleles of the -1131T&#x0003e;C and S19W single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), are associated with increased triglyceride concentrations. Male carriers of one or two copies of the -1131C and 19W have triglyceride concentrations ~40.0% higher than subjects homozygous for the -1131T and 19S alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. There is less data available in women, but, a study of 442 caucasian women from the Dallas Heart Disease Prevention Project (DHDPP) showed an increase of 22.0% in carriers of either the -1131C or 19W haplotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition to altering triglyceride concentrations, <italic>ApoAV </italic>variants have been associated with VLDL-cholesterol (P = &#x0003c;0.001), but not altered HDL-cholesterol or LDL-cholesterol concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Non-pregnant caucasian women were shown to have triglycerides that were 23.0% (17.4% &#x02013; 36.6%) lower than caucasian males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p><p>The -1131C allele raises triglyceride concentrations in a variety of dyslipidaemic conditions such as hyperlipidaemia, hypoalphalipoproteinaemia and hyperalphalipoproteinaemia from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Genomic Resource in Arteriosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The chemical properties of Apolipoprotein AV indicate that it may retard triglyceride-rich particle assembly and may function intracellularly to modulate hepatic Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis and/or secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The Apolipoprotein AV gene is only expressed in the liver and has a very low plasma concentration. <italic>ApoAV </italic>may therefore affect plasma triglyceride levels by modulating hepatic VLDL assembly and secretion, rather than the intravascular metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The -1131T&#x0003e;C polymorphism is in the promoter region and may therefore affect transcription of the <italic>ApoAV </italic>gene. The S19W polymorphism changes the amino acid serine to a tryptophan at codon 19. This change could alter the secondary structure of the protein and alter protein folding, thus altering the function of the protein.</p><p>The role of <italic>ApoAV </italic>gene variants in regulating triglyceride concentrations in pregnancy is not known. To gain a better understanding of the genetic control of triglycerides in pregnancy and potential effects on fetal growth we have examined the role of the variants -1131T&#x0003e;C and S19W in the <italic>ApoAV </italic>gene in caucasian pregnant women and their offspring. We have shown that two common variants in the <italic>ApoAV </italic>gene alter triglycerides in pregnancy by 11.0% (1.5% to 22.2%) and 16.2% (7.6% to 25.9%).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Triglyceride concentrations in 483 pregnant females (2.01 mmol/l (1.96 &#x02013; 2.06)) were higher than those in their male partners (1.34 mmol/l (1.28 &#x02013; 1.39), p value of &#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>Both Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were in Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. The frequencies of the two rare alleles were 6.7% for -1131T&#x0003e;C and 4.9% for S19W. Nine point seven percent of subjects are carriers of at least one -1131C allele and 13.4% are carriers of at least one 19W allele with 0.6% carrying both a -1131C and a 19W allele. We did not observe any significant LD between the two variants, D' = 0.33; p &#x0003e;0.5.</p><sec><title>The -1131T&#x0003e;C and S19W <italic>ApoAV </italic>variants alter triglyceride concentrations in pregnancy</title><p>Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> show the effect on maternal anthropometry and biochemistry for -1131T&#x0003e;C and S19W respectively. Each of the two <italic>ApoAV </italic>variants was associated with altered triglyceride concentrations in pregnancy. The two SNPs increased triglycerides concentrations by a similar magnitude of effect, the -1131C showed a 11.0% increase (from 1.98 mmol/l (1.92 &#x02013; 2.04) to 2.20 mmol/l (2.01 &#x02013; 2.42), p = 0.035), and 19W a 16.2% increase (from 1.97 mmol/l (1.91 &#x02013;

The two haplotypes, defined in this study by the -1131T&#x0003e;C and S19W SNPs, raise triglycerides by 11.0% (1.5% &#x02013; 22.2%) and 16.2% (7.6% &#x02013; 25.9%) respectively. The -1131T&#x0003e;C and S19W alleles were previously shown to increase triglyceride concentrations in non-pregnant caucasian females by 22.0% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The -1131T&#x0003e;C variant therefore has a slightly lower magnitude of effect on triglycerides in pregnancy as it does outside pregnancy, although based on our 95% confidence intervals we cannot exclude an effect as small as 1.5% or as large as 22.2% for -1131T&#x0003e;C variant and as small as 7.6% and 25.9% for the S19W variant. Women carrying at least one of either the 19W or -1131C alleles may therefore be at increased risk of complications from raised triglycerides in pregnancy. Further studies are needed to assess this as the size of the increase is modest and the prevalence of clinical complications associated with hypertriglyceridaemia in pregnancy rare.</p><p>Evidence so far indicates that the effect of <italic>ApoAV </italic>variants on altering triglyceride concentrations is not lost or reduced in hyperlipidaemic states. In addition to our results in pregnancy, the -1131C allele was analysed in a variety of dyslipidaemic conditions including hyperlipidaemia, hypoalphalipoproteinaemia and hyperalphalipoproteinaemia from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Genomic Resource in Arteriosclerosis and increased triglyceride and VLDL-Cholesterol concentrations by 10.7% and 24.2% respectively and marginally reduced HDL-Cholesterol concentration by 4.9% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The -1131C allele was increased in frequency in hyperlipidaemia vs. control (13%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. There was however no evidence of an allelic association with either hypoalphalipoproteinaemia or hyperalphalipoproteinaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Both of the variants investigated may have different functional properties. The -1131T&#x0003e;C variant is in the promoter region and is in linkage disequilibrium with a -3A&#x0003e;G variant that is found in the 'kozak' region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This -3A&#x0003e;G variant disrupts a 6 to 8 bp sequence that precedes the initiation methionine and has been previously shown in other genes to severely disrupt ribosomal translation efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The S19W variant is in exon 2 and may cause a variation in the signal sequence which would reduce <italic>ApoAV </italic>secretion across the endoplasmic reticulum which has been previously seen with the ApoB signal peptide variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. As <italic>ApoAV </italic>may act as a brake on the transport of triglyceride rich lipoproteins from the liver, these variants would produce lower levels of <italic>ApoAV </italic>and therefore increase the triglyceride plasma concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Variants in other genes that raise triglycerides are also associated with raised triglycerides in pregnancy. In a study on 250 pregnant Canadian women in their third trimester, the presence of the e4/e4 polymorphism in the <italic>ApoE </italic>gene increased triglyceride concentrations by 0.4 mmol/l (15%) compared to carriers of the e2/e2 variants. Carriers of the S447X polymorphism in the LPL gene showed a decrease of 0.6 mmol/l (21%) (P = 0.003) compared to non-carriers and carriers of the N291S polymorphism showed an increase of 0.5 mmol/l (19%) (P = 0.2) compared to non-carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>In addition to effects on triglyceride concentrations in pregnancy we examined the role of maternal <italic>ApoAV </italic>genotype on fetal growth. Maternal triglyceride concentration correlates strongly with birth weight and therefore genetic effects on triglyceride concentrations in pregnancy could contribute to fetal growth. We found evidence that the presence of a maternal -1131T&#x0003e;C variant produces a 0.67 cm (1.3%) increase in birth length (p = 0.022) and a 0.57 cm (1.7%) increase in fetal birth crown to rump length (p = 0.023). However, further studies will be needed to confirm or refute these observations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion we have shown that variants in the <italic>ApoAV </italic>gene raise 28-week pregnancy triglyceride concentration, in addition to the triglyceride raising effect of pregnancy itself. Preliminary evidence indicates that the gene is having an effect on fetal growth parameters, but, this needs replicating in further studies</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Genotyping was performed on 483 pregnant caucasian females and their partners from the Exeter Family Study of Childhood Health.
