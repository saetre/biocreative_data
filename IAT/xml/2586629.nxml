RecBCD enzyme is a large heterotrimer (330 kDa) comprising RecB, RecC and RecD polypeptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and has dsDNA and single strand (ss)DNA exonuclease, ssDNA endonuclease, helicase, DNA-dependent ATPase and RecA loading activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This multifunctionality enables the enzyme to initiate homologous recombination. RecBCD carries out the presynaptic step of recombination to produce a 3' single-strand overhang. The E. coli hotspot Chi (5' GCTGGTGG 3') stimulates recombination near to and distant from its 3' end, so it facilitates the enzyme's task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Genetic and physical assays show that recombinational DNA repair in E. coli occurs as follows: if there is a ds break in the chromosome, RecBCD specifically binds to the blunt or near-blunt dsDNA ends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Unlike other helicases, RecBCD has two independent helicase subunits, RecB and RecD, so the enzyme is a processive helicase (&#x0003e;30 kb) and begins to unwind the dsDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Initially the enzyme degrades from the 3'-ended strand until it reaches the Chi sequence in excess Mg<sup>+2 </sup>ions. Thereafter, it degrades the complementary strand as unwinding continues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The combined helicase and nuclease effects produce a 3' overhang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. RecBCD loads the strand-exchange protein, RecA, on to this 3' overhang to form a RecA-ssDNA filament. This filament catalyzes the formation of a D-loop with a homologous dsDNA, which develops a Holliday junction structure. Postsynaptic resolution produces recombinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>A key aspect of this process is the interaction between Chi and RecBCD, which regulates the structure and activities of the enzyme. Chi is a recombinational hotspot in the RecBCD pathway and stimulates recombination up to 30-fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. During unwinding, this octameric sequence is recognized by the RecC subunit of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], if RecBCD only approaches from the right side [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and Chi and enzyme then interact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The enzyme continues to unwind after Chi, though more slowly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and at the end of the DNA the subunits disassemble to form an inactive enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. During the continued unwinding, the nuclease activity of the enzyme degrades the 5'-end strand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and the enzyme begins to load RecA on to the 3'-end strand to the left of Chi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The mechanisms of this regulation are not yet well understood, but it has been suggested that RecD plays a role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. On the basis of similarities between the features of RecBCD lacking RecD and RecBCD interacting with Chi, the following hypothesis has been proposed: RecD is ejected at Chi to form a recombinogenic enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, subsequent studies have shown that purified RecBC is different from the enzyme interacting with Chi: RecBC lacks exonuclease and Chi recognition activities, but can load RecA constitutively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Recent single-molecule studies have indicated that RecD remains associated with the RecBC subunits at the Chi site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. On the other hand, RecD inhibits RecA loading activity before the Chi site; a point mutation in the RecA loading domain of RecB eliminates RecA loading activity, but removing RecD from these mutants reverses this inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Against the hypothesis that RecD is eliminated at the Chi site, we propose that RecD is required to regulate RecA loading activity. To test this proposal, we generated two <italic>rec</italic>B-<italic>rec</italic>D genetic fusions that would allow us to examine the regulatory functions of RecD. We tested four predictions: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] the fusion enzymes cannot bind specifically to dsDNA ends and lack all enzyme activities; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] the fusion enzymes can bind to the ends but cannot unwind the dsDNA; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] the fusion enzymes can bind and unwind dsDNA, but lack nuclease and Chi genetic activities; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] the fusion enzymes behave like wild type.</p><p>In this study we describe the <italic>rec</italic>B-<italic>rec</italic>D fusion mutants that have wild type phenotypes. Both fusion enzymes are recombination proficient, can repair DNA damage, and have DNA unwinding, exonuclease and Chi genetic activities. However, the fusion between <italic>rec</italic>D and <italic>rec</italic>B reduced the heterotrimer level. Our findings suggest that <italic>rec</italic>B-recD fusion may form RecBD, a fusion protein, and may therefore affect assembly, but this effect does not change the three-dimensional structure of the heterotrimer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>rec</italic>B-<italic>rec</italic>D fusions were generated by recombineering</title><p>RecBCD is composed of the products of <italic>rec</italic>B, <italic>rec</italic>C and <italic>rec</italic>D, which lie between the <italic>arg</italic>A and <italic>thy</italic>A intergenic regions of E. coli (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). <italic>ptr</italic>, which encodes protease III, is located between <italic>rec</italic>C and <italic>rec</italic>B. The <italic>rec</italic>B termination codon overlaps the initiation codon of the downstream <italic>rec</italic>D by one nucleotide. Therefore, <italic>rec</italic>B and <italic>rec</italic>D form an operon with a major external promoter for both genes and with a minor internal promoter for <italic>rec</italic>D. The major promoter to the left of <italic>rec</italic>B directs the transcription of the 3543 and 1824 nucleotides of the <italic>rec</italic>B and <italic>rec</italic>D coding sequences, respectively, whereas the weaker promoter to the left of <italic>rec</italic>D appears to direct the transcription of <italic>rec</italic>D alone. To generate a genetic fusion between <italic>rec</italic>B and <italic>rec</italic>D, the mutations were targeted to this overlap site. Two fusion forms were generated: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] a deletion fusion mutation and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] a substitution fusion mutation. For the former, two nucleotides (TA) of the <italic>rec</italic>B termination codon at the overlap site were deleted; this removes the termination codon of <italic>rec</italic>B but does not yield a frameshift mutation. For the latter, three codons encoding two asparagine and one glycine residues, which has the potential of forming equivalent hydrogen bonds and facilitates a beta turn respectively, were substituted at the same site. This substitution leads to a short bridge between <italic>rec</italic>B and <italic>rec</italic>D.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>a</bold>.<bold> The physical map of the <italic>thy</italic>A-<italic>arg</italic>A region of the E. coli K-12 chromosome, and the nucleotide sequence of the <italic>rec</italic>B-<italic>rec</italic>D overlap site where <italic>rec</italic>BD fusion mutations were constructed.</bold> The nucleotide A that overlaps the stop codon <italic>rec</italic>B (TAA) and the start codon <italic>rec</italic>D (atg) is shown in the square. <italic>rec</italic>B nucleotides are depicted in capital letters while <italic>rec</italic>D nucleotides are depicted in small letters in order to distinguish them. <bold>b</bold>.

Short linear homologous DNA strands (e.g. 20&#x02013;70 bases) are required. Recombination can occur between single-stranded or double-stranded DNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] by the exo, beta and gamma proteins of lambda. Single-strand pairing is formed between a synthetic oligonucleotide containing a mutation and single-stranded chromosomal DNA arising from replication fork. This requires beta, an annealing protein, and a 35-nucleotide flanking homology on each end. To increase the frequency of recombination, the oligonucleotide should correspond to the lagging strand at the replication fork and the direction of replication should be counter-clockwise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In this study, the deletion and substitution fusion mutations were generated by single-strand pairing. Appropriate oligonucleotides were created and synthesized, then transformed into an E. coli strain containing lambda prophage (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Chromosomal DNAs isolated from the transformed cells were then amplified with appropriate primers. Six candidates with DNAs expected to encode RecBD fusion proteins were found for both mutants by colony-screening, and two were isolated by transduction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). They were named V2825 and V2826.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains and plasmids used in this study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">strains</td><td align="left">genotype</td><td align="left">source, ref,</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">HME63</td><td align="left">&#x00394;(argF-lac) U169 &#x003bb; cI857 &#x00394;cro-bioA galK tyr 145 UAG mutS&#x0003c;&#x0003e;amp</td><td align="left">Court, 2003</td></tr><tr><td align="left">AFT325</td><td align="left">thyA argA21 recF143 hisG4 met rpsL31 galK2 xyl-5 &#x003bb;<sup>- </sup>F<sup>-</sup></td><td align="left">Amundsen,86</td></tr><tr><td align="left">V2825</td><td align="left">hisG4 met rpsL31 galK2 xyl-5 <italic>rec</italic>BD2728</td><td align="left">This study</td></tr><tr><td align="left">V2826</td><td align="left">hisG4 met rpsL31 galK2 xyl-5 <italic>rec</italic>BD2729</td><td align="left">This study</td></tr><tr><td align="left">V2831</td><td align="left">hisG4 met rpsL31 galK2 xyl-5 <italic>rec</italic>BCD2731 (<italic>rec</italic>BCD&#x00394;)</td><td align="left">This study</td></tr><tr><td align="left">V66</td><td align="left">argA21 hisG4 recF143 met rpsL31 galK2 xyl-5 &#x003bb;<sup>- </sup>F<sup>-</sup></td><td align="left">Schultz,83</td></tr><tr><td align="left">V67</td><td align="left">RecB21::IS186 argA21 hisG4 recF143 met rpsL31 galK2 xyl-5 &#x003bb;<sup>- </sup>F<sup>-</sup></td><td align="left">Schultz,83</td></tr><tr><td align="left">V222</td><td align="left">argA::Tn10 argA21 hisG4 recF143 met rpsL31 galK2 xyl-5 &#x003bb;<sup>- </sup>F<sup>-</sup></td><td align="left">Amundsen,90</td></tr><tr><td align="left">V1306</td><td align="left">Thi-1 relA1 &#x003bb;<sup>- </sup>(Hfr PO44)</td><td align="left">Schultz,83</td></tr><tr><td align="left">594</td><td align="left">Lac-3350 galK2 galT22 rpsL179 &#x003bb;<sup>- </sup>F<sup>-</sup></td><td align="left">Schultz,83</td></tr><tr><td align="left">C600</td><td align="left">Thr-1 leuB6 thi-1 lacY1 tonA21 supE44 rfbD1 &#x003bb;<sup>- </sup>F<sup>-</sup></td><td align="left">Schultz,83</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">plasmids</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">pBR322&#x003c7; +F225</td><td align="left">-</td><td align="left">Smith, 81</td></tr><tr><td align="left">pDWS2</td><td align="left"><italic>rec</italic>BCD in pBR322</td><td align="left">Ponticelli,85</td></tr><tr><td align="left">pBD2728</td><td align="left">2nt&#x00394;<italic>rec</italic>BD fusion in pBR322</td><td align="left">This study</td></tr><tr><td align="left">pBD2729</td><td align="left">9nti <italic>rec</italic>BD fusion in pBR322</td><td align="left">This study</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Haploid alleles of <italic>rec</italic>B-<italic>rec</italic>D fusion mutants have wild type phenotype</title><p>Purified transductants were subjected to the phage spot test on LB plate with &#x003bb; red<sup>-</sup>gam<sup>-</sup>&#x003c7;<sup>+</sup>, &#x003bb; red<sup>-</sup>gam<sup>-</sup>&#x003c7;<sup>0</sup>, &#x003bb; red<sup>+</sup>gam<sup>+</sup>, T4, T4 gene 2<sup>- </sup>P1 and P2 phages (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

In contrast to RecBC, this mutant enzyme has nuclease and Chi genetic activities (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">7</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). It can unwind dsDNA as wild type enzyme does and recognizes the Chi sequence because it forms Chi fragments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Similarly, we found that the substitution fusion enzyme is recombination proficient and resistant to DNA damaging agents (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>, Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

Folding is a rapid process initiated by local elements that assemble to yield the final native fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Our protein analysis indicated not only the presence of RecBD fusion polypeptide, as we expected (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a&#x02013;c</xref>), but also the absence of intact RecB monomer and RecBC dimer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). This result is the most important evidence for a RecBD fusion heterodimer. An intact RecC that we found is essential for assembly and association into holoenzyme. However, we observed that the amount of heterotrimer was lower than in wild type. One possible explanation is that the assembly of the fusion protein to form the heterotrimer was affected because an oligomeric protein is formed by consecutive folding and association of the constituent polypeptides. A more significant finding than the reduction of heterotrimer level is RecD with wild type length. This indicates that the RecD polypeptide is expressed by its minor promoter, which may affect the assembly process. In E. coli, <italic>rec</italic>B <italic>and rec</italic>D form an operon with two promoters; the major promoter is external and directs the transcription of both genes, whereas the minor one is internal and appears to direct the transcription of <italic>rec</italic>D.

However, it is not yet clear when the weaker promoter for rec<italic>D </italic>governs, so we did not take it into consideration at the outset. Nevertheless, wild type length RecD could bind to Rec(BD fusion)-RecC assembly and could make Rec(BD fusion)-RecC-RecD enzyme that might be responsible for the functionality (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Model for the structures and functions of RecBDC fusion enzyme.</bold><bold>a</bold>.

This distance corresponds to about 17 amino acids. However, in our study, three amino acids were substituted between 1180 of RecB and 1 of RecD, so it corresponds to total 10 amino acids (about 35 &#x000c5;). Therefore at least seven more amino acids may be required to fuse <italic>rec</italic>B and <italic>rec</italic>D. Furthermore, this long distance between C-terminal of RecB and N-terminal of RecD may cause a functional enzyme which may be assembled by Rec(BD fusion)-RecC-Rec(BD fusion), in which RecB and RecD come from two different polypeptides.</p><p>Genetic studies showed that there is little or no Chi hotspot activity in frameshift or single amino acid mutations of RecC(<italic>rec</italic>C*, <italic>rec</italic>C343 respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

Based on our observations, it can be suggested that this signaling in both RecBDC fusion enzymes would retain in response to Chi.</p><p>The results presented here suggest that RecBD fusion enzymes have wild type phenotype and fully active. However, considering the distance between C-terminal of RecB and N-terminal of RecD in the three-dimensional structure, and the presence of wild type-length RecD, unusual subunit associations such as Rec(BD fusion)-RecC-RecD and Rec(BD fusion)-RecC-Rec(BD fusion) may be formed and may be responsible for the activity. To rule out this possibility, purification of those discrete molecules and then their extensive biochemical assays are required.

The first, containing a TA deletion at the <italic>rec</italic>B stop codon, 5'-TACTCTACAAACGGCCATACTGGGACCTCCTCCGCTACTTTAACGTTTTCGTTAATGACCTTCGACACCT-3', was used for the deletion mutation. The second, containing an aac-ggt-aac substitution at the overlap site, 5'-CCTACTCTACAAACGGCCATACTGGGACCTCCTCCGCTTGCCATTGACTTTAACGTTTTCGTTAATGACCTTCGACACC-3', was used for the substitution mutation.

Recombineering was performed on an E. coli strain (HME63) lacking the mismatch repair system but containing lambda prophage. A fresh culture of HME63 at 32&#x000b0;C was divided into two flasks. Half the culture was not induced but was kept for future use. The other half was induced by incubating at 42&#x000b0;C for 15 min, then on ice for 15 min. The culture was centrifuged at 4600 g and the pellet was dispersed in 1 ml cold water; 30 ml cold water was added and the suspension was centrifuged. The pellet was again dispersed in 1 ml cold water and centrifuged, and the pellet was dispersed in 200 &#x003bc;l cold water. Forty-five &#x003bc;l of induced cells was transferred into three electroporation cuvettes. Fifteen pmol of fusion oligo and 15 pmol of gal oligo were added to the second and third cuvettes, respectively. Forty-five &#x003bc;l of uninduced cells was transferred to two electroporation cuvettes. Fifteen pmol of gal oligo was added to the second cuvette. Electroporation was performed at 1.8 kV. LB (1 ml) was added to each cuvette. The cells were diluted with SM and spread on LB plates.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutant detection</title><p>A large chromosomal fragment (1.7 kb) containing fusion mutations was amplified. Two primers were used; the forward was relative to 1046 bp to the mutation site, and the reverse was relative to 656 bp (IDT). Transformed cells were grown overnight at 42&#x000b0;C. Fifty patch-grid plates were prepared from these fresh colonies. The cells were lysed at 96&#x000b0;C for 8 min. The chromosomal DNA was amplified in a reaction mixture containing 0.2 &#x003bc;M of each primer, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM dNTPs and 1 U Taq polymerase (Invitrogen, San Diago). The conditions of amplification were as follows: 94&#x000b0;C for 15 s, 55&#x000b0;C for 30 s, and 72&#x000b0;C for 2 min (30 cycles). PCR products were digested by BsaXI for the deletion mutation, and by NlaIII for the substitution mutation (New England BioLabs). As a result, approximately 1750 colonies were screened by colony PCR. A total of 5 candidates were detected for the deletion mutation and 1 candidate for the substitution mutation. Those candidates were purified and sequenced (Big Dye Cycle Sequencing Protocol, PE Biosystems).</p></sec><sec><title>Mutant isolation</title><p>Mutagenesis was generated in an E. coli strain (<italic>thy</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>arg</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>rec</italic>BCD<sup>+</sup>) containing lambda prophage.

P1-mediated transduction was performed by the plate stock method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A cell culture grown at 32&#x000b0;C overnight was mixed with P1 phage grown on the donor strain at an MOI of 0.5 and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for adsorption. The cells were grown overnight, harvested and centrifuged. The supernatant was the P1 phage stock containing the mutant strain. Phages were mixed with fresh E. coli cells (<italic>thy</italic><sup>-</sup><italic>arg</italic><sup>-&#x00394; </sup><italic>rec</italic>BCD) at 37&#x000b0;C for adsorption. Sodium citrate was added to stop phage adsorption. Transductants were selected on minimal medium containing histidine and methionine, then purified. The phenotypes of the mutant candidates were tested by a phage sensitivity test on LB plate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Fresh cultures of fusion mutants in TB were mixed with BBL-top agar, and poured on to BBL agar plates. Seven phages (10<sup>4 </sup>pfu/ml) were placed on the spots. Recombination frequency and Chi genetic activity were tested by &#x003bb; red<sup>-</sup>gam<sup>-</sup>&#x003c7;<sup>+</sup>, &#x003bb; red<sup>-</sup>gam<sup>-</sup>&#x003c7;<sup>0</sup>, &#x003bb; red<sup>+</sup>gam<sup>+ </sup>and P<sub>1 </sub>phages: &#x003bb; red<sup>-</sup>gam<sup>-</sup>&#x003c7;<sup>+</sup>and &#x003bb; red<sup>-</sup>gam<sup>-</sup>&#x003c7;<sup>0 </sup>produce plaques in Rec<sup>+</sup>cells. The sizes of the plaques in those spots reflect Chi activity. P1 needs Rec<sup>+ </sup>cells to grow. Exonuclease activity was tested by T4, T4 gene 2<sup>- </sup>and P<sub>2 </sub>phages. Gene 2 protein binds to the ends of T4 DNA and protects T4 DNA from the exonuclease activity of RecBCD after injection into the cell. P2 requires RecBCD exonuclease activity to grow. Recombination frequency and Chi genetic activity were assayed quantitatively by hotspot crosses as described by Schultz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. First, the stocks of lambda phages 1081, 1082, 1083 and 1084 were prepared. Cross 1 was made between parents 1081(c<sup>+</sup>) and 1082 (cI857), and Cross2 was made between parents 1083(c<sup>+</sup>) and 1084 (cI857). A fusion mutant culture (100 &#x003bc;l) was infected with 5 phages per cell. The mixture was incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for phage adsorption. The total phage count was titered on a (sup<sup>-</sup>) strain on BBL whereas the recombinant phage count was titered on a (sup<sup>+</sup>) strain on BBL-YE plates. Recombination frequency (%J<sup>+</sup>R<sup>+</sup>) was determined by the percentage ratio of recombinant phage count to total phage count on the same interval for two crosses. Chi activity was determined by counting the turbid plaques on a (sup<sup>-</sup>) strain on BBL plates and clear plaques on a (sup<sup>+</sup>) strain on BBL-YE plates. The square root of ratio of the turbid plaques to clear plaques in Cross 1 to Cross 2 gives the Chi activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Cloning of fusion mutants</title><p>A 18.3 kb BamH1 fragment containing either wild type <italic>rec</italic>BCD or <italic>rec</italic>B-<italic>rec</italic>D fusion mutants was ligated into the BamHI site of pBR322 by T4 DNA ligase (New England BioLabs), and transformed into V2831 <italic>thy</italic><sup>-</sup>-<italic>arg</italic><sup>- </sup>cells to select <italic>thy</italic><sup>+</sup>-<italic>arg</italic><sup>+ </sup>cells.

The pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10% sucrose and 1 mM EDTA. Aliquots were stored at -70&#x000b0;C in liquid nitrogen. Cells were thawed, their volume was measured, and 100 mM PMSF, 50 mM DTT and 500 mM EDTA were added to reach the final concentration. Lysozyme (10 mg/ml) was added to the mixture and incubated on ice for 5 min. NaCl (5 M) was added, incubated on ice and centrifuged for 30 min.
