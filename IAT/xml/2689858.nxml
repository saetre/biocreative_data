PAX gene products function as transcription factors. They all share the evolutionarily conserved 128 amino acid paired domain at their N-terminal, which mediates attachment to DNA sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Nine PAX genes (PAX1&#x02013;PAX9) have so far been described in vertebrates; these proteins are subdivided into four classes based on the presence of conserved sequence motifs, the octapeptide (repression domaine) and the homeodomaine (DNA binding domaine) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The PAX2 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 10, locus 24&#x02013;25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and encodes a transcription factor that has a critical role in the development of the urogenital tract, the eyes and ears, and the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It belongs to the subgroup 2, characterized by the octapeptide sequence and a truncated homeodomaine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and is composed of 12 exons spanning approximately 86 kb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Although PAX2 is primarily expressed during embryonic development and expression is normally repressed upon terminal differentiation, PAX gene expression was frequently identified in tumor cell lines, including lymphoma, breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancer, as well as in primary tumor tissue samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and was suggested as a sensitive marker for renal neoplasms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Apoptosis was induced in cell lines following RNA interference to silence PAX2 expression, suggesting that endogenous PAX2 gene expression is required for the growth and survival of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Therefore, it has gained interest as a target for immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Downstream targets of PAX2 are still less defined. PAX2 has been reported, to act as a transcriptional repressor of p53 and a transcriptional activator of WT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and prostate cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] as well as in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] a correlation with WT1 expression has been observed, suggesting that PAX2 is a positive transcriptional regulator of WT1. Recently, WNT5A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and human beta-defensin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] were identified as PAX2 targets.</p><p>Four isoforms of PAX2 are described so far. They are products of alternative splicing of exon 6, exon 10 and exon 12: Exon 6 is present in the PAX2a transcript and absent in the PAX2b transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Insertion of exon 10 in the exon 6 missing PAX2c transcript results in a different reading frame, and a stop codon is produced by the last three bases of exon 11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. PAX2d arises from deletion of the first 19 bp of exon 12 and is found with and without exon 6 (PAX2d+ex6 und PAX2d&#x00394;ex6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Here we characterized a previously undescribed intron 9 and exon10 containing splice variant of PAX2 in neoplastic B cell lines and solid tumor cell lines as well as in tumor tissue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cells and Reagents</title><p>14 lymphoma cell lines (AMO-1, DG75, EHEB, KARPAS-422, KM-H2, HDLM-2, L540, RAJI, SU-DHL-4, SUP-M2, U698, U937, U266, BONNA-12) and 35 solid tumor cell lines (4 thyroid cancer cell lines: 8505C, CGTHW-1, BCPAP, TT260Co2; 7 renal cell carcinoma cell lines: A706; Caki1; ACHN; A498; SN12; CC5; Caki2; 8 melanoma cell lines: SKMel23, Mel10, Mel16, Mel-HO, SKMel24, SKMel5, Mel28, 624.28; 8 colon carcinoma cell lines: SW620, HCT116, Cx94, CaCo2, Colo320, SW480, Colo205, HBL 100, 5 breast cancer cell lines: Mx1, T47D, MCF7, MDA-MB436, BT474; 3 lung carcinoma cell lines: Column6, A427, DMS79) All human cell lines were purchased from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany) and CLS (Eppelheim, Germany). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10&#x02013;20% FCS, 2% penicillin/streptomycin and 2% glutamine (Gibco, Karlsruhe, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>Patient samples</title><p>Fifteen primary low grade lymphoma, 9 myeloma, 11 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) samples and 7 AML samples were taken from patients that underwent routine diagnostics like venipuncture or bone marrow aspiration. Primary tumor single cell suspensions were prepared by ficoll hypaque separation. The lymphoma and leukemia samples contained more than 80% of tumor cells; therefore no further separation was done. For multiple myeloma, CD138 positive cells were isolated using Mini MACS technology (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). Tumor cells were resuspended in guanidium thiocyanate (GTC) buffer and stored at -80&#x000b0;C. 12 melanoma (8 skin melanoma, 4 ocular melanoma) and 12 colon carcinoma tissue samples were obtained from patients that underwent surgery for their tumors. Tissue samples were collected and dissected under stringent sterile conditions to prevent RNA contamination and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. There were no specific inclusion criteria with exception for the leukemia samples. Only PAX2 mRNA expressing AML and ALL samples were included. All patients had given informed consent for the analysis. Approval by the appropriate ethics committee has been obtained (approval number EA4/090/08) and analyses have therefore been performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. Blood samples of healthy volunteers served as negative controls.</p></sec><sec><title>RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was isolated by RNeasy Mini Kit including RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).

A band of the expected size of 185 bp was detected only in the cell lines KM-H2, EHEB, L540 and to a lesser extent in the cell line DG75. Sequencing analysis of the 339 bp PCR products revealed that this product results from the insertion of the entire intron 9 sequence. Thus, these cell lines expressed an undescribed PAX2 splice variant containing the entire intron 9 sequence and the exon 10 sequence (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>) with a stop codon at the beginning of intron 9.</p><p>To analyze, whether the new splice variant is also expressed in solid tumors, a panel of solid tumor cell lines was tested by RT-PCR with the same primer set spanning the intron 9 (PAX2_1). Analysis of the product size by gel electrophoresis showed, that 7 of the 8 melanoma cell lines, 7 of the 9 colon carcinoma cell lines and 1 of the 7 renal carcinoma cell lines expressed the intron 9 and exon 10 containing splice variant. The other cell lines showed only a band of 185 bp. Additionally, 5 of 5 breast carcinoma cell lines, 3 of 3 lung carcinoma cell lines and 4 of 4 thyroid carcinoma cell lines expressed this splice variant.</p><p>Next PAX2 positive leukemia patient samples were analyzed: In all 11 ALL samples and all 7 AML samples the new splice variant could be detected on gel electrophoresis. Subsequently, samples from patients with low grade lymphoma and multiple myeloma were analyzed. All 15 low grade lymphoma patient samples and 7 of the 9 multiple myeloma patient samples expressed the intron 9 containing splice variant. The remaining 2 multiple myeloma samples were negative for PAX2 mRNA (determined by an RT-PCR assay detecting all splice variants of PAX2, data not shown). However, 22 of 24 blood samples from healthy donors surprisingly were also positive for the intron 9 and exon 10 containing splice variant.</p><p>As PAX 2 recently gained importance as an immunotherapeutic target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], differences in the quantitative expression levels of this intron 9 positive PAX2 splice variant between tumor cell lines and tissue compared to blood samples from healthy donors were analyzed. A new RT-PCR with intron 9 specific primers (primer set PAX2_2) was established (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). In all 14 lymphoma cell lines intron 9 specific mRNA could be detected, also in the cell line KM-H2. The median expression level was 7.16 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-4 </sup>(range 1.42 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-4 </sup>- 7.61 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-2</sup>). Additionally, in all solid tumor cell lines intron 9 specific mRNA was detected. The median expression was 1.49 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-3 </sup>(7.96 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-5 </sup>- 1.04). Moreover, the expression of the intron 9 positive PAX2 isoform was analyzed in 12 melanoma (8 skin melanoma, 4 ocular melanoma) and 12 colon carcinoma patient samples as well as in 9 AML and 5 ALL patients. All leukemia samples, 11 of the 12 colon carcinoma and 7 of the 12 melanoma samples were positive for expression of intron 9 specific mRNA. The median expression level in solid tumor samples was 1.17 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-1 </sup>(range 1.43 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-2 </sup>- 5.44) and in leukemia samples 3.07 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-4 </sup>(range 1.22 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-5 </sup>- 1.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-2</sup>) (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). The expression level in solid tumor tissue was 2 logs above the expression level of solid tumor cell lines. The difference in PAX2 expression between solid tumor cell lines and solid tumor samples may be due to in-vitro selection in cell lines or stroma cell contribution in tumor tissue.</p><p>However, the intron 9 specific mRNA was also found in 13 of 13 blood samples of healthy donors with a median expression level of 1.18 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-2 </sup>(range 6.33 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-4 </sup>- 1.63 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-1</sup>) (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). The median expression level was significantly higher compared to solid tumor cell lines (p = 0.001) as well as lymphoma cell lines (p = 0.004) and leukemia samples (p = 0.001). In contrast solid tumor tissue samples exhibited a significant higher expression level than healthy controls (p &#x0003c; 0.001). However, regarding immunotherapeutic strategies we cannot exclude significant expression of PAX2 intron 9 protein in peripheral blood of healthy subjects and differences in mRNA expression levels may not automatically lead to significant differences in protein expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of the new splice variant by Western Blot</title><p>To verify the expression of this intron 9 positive splice variant on protein level, PAX2 protein expression was examined by Western Blot analysis in whole cell extracts of 3 colon carcinoma cell lines (HCT116, Colo320, Caco2) and 4 lymphoma cell lines (SU-DHL-4, KARPAS-422, U266, KM-H2). Protein bands corresponding to known PAX2 isoforms (PAX2a 44.5 kDa, PAX2b 42 kDa, PAX2c 41.8 kDa, PAX2d 43.6 kDa, PAX2e 46.2 kDa) could be found in all cell lines. Additionally, a band of approximately 37 kDa (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>) was identified in all 4 lymphoma cell lines and in 2/3 colon carcinoma cell lines (Caco2, HCT116), which corresponds to size of the new intron 9 and exon 10 containing splice variant. Actin control staining revealed a band of the expected size of 42 kDa in both cell lines.</p><p>However, in blood samples of healthy volunteers bands corresponding to the known splice variants of PAX2 and to a lesser extent to the new splice variant could be also detected. Expression of PAX2 in lymphoid cells was also observed by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, regarding PAX2 targeted therapies like vaccination strategies caution is needed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found a previously undescribed intron 9 and exon 10 splice variant of PAX2 on mRNA and protein level in B cell neoplasia and solid tumors as well as in peripheral blood of healthy patients. This splice variant has a distinct and a shorter C-terminus than the known exon 10 containing splice variant PAX2c due to the deletion of the last 89 amino acid residues. Alternative processing represents an important mechanism for the generation of various protein isoforms with different functions from one genetic locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The function of this intron 9 containing splice variant of PAX2 remains unclear, however, as the transactivation of PAX2 relies on multiple COOH-terminal domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], one might speculate, that the shortened new splice variant has a reduced transactivation activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Financial Disclosure: Ulrich Keilholz is holding a patent for the use of PAX2 for cancer immunotherapy.
