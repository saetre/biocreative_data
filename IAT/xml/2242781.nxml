Notch activity needs to be regulated precisely, and aberrant Notch activity is associated with a number of human diseases including cancers and congenital syndromes.</p><p>Notch signaling is influenced by two conserved glycosyltransferases, <italic>O</italic>-fucosyltransferase1 (OFUT1) and Fringe (FNG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. FNG transfers <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in a &#x003b2;1,3 linkage onto <italic>O</italic>-linked fucose on EGF domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Fringe was first identified because of its role in modulating Notch signaling during the development of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>wing, where it both potentiates the activation of Notch by one ligand, Delta, and inhibits the activation of Notch by another ligand, Serrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These opposing effects of Fringe on the activation of Notch by its ligands, together with the restriction of normal Fringe expression to dorsal wing cells, help to position a stripe of Notch activation along the dorsal-ventral (D-V) compartment boundary. This stripe of Notch activation is then essential for the further growth and patterning of the wing. Fringe also helps to regulate Notch activation in other <italic>Drosophila </italic>tissues; however, there are many Notch signaling events in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, such as the role of Notch in limiting the number of neural precursor cells (lateral inhibition) that are Fringe-independent. Similarly, vertebrate Fringe proteins are important regulators of Notch signaling in some contexts, but not in others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>OFUT1 catalyzes the transfer of fucose from GDP-fucose, the universal donor for fucosyltransferases, onto EGF domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It thus generates the <italic>O</italic>-linked fucose that is the substrate for FNG. Genetic studies of <italic>Ofut1 </italic>in flies, and its homolog <italic>Pofut1 </italic>in mice, have indicated that it has a much broader role in Notch signaling than FNG, and indeed appears to be universally required for all Notch signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. While this was initially taken to reflect a universal requirement for <italic>O</italic>-fucose on Notch, more recently a second function for OFUT1 was identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. OFUT1 is a soluble ER protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and, at least in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, acts as a Notch chaperone, facilitating the folding and secretion of Notch[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The fact that OFUT1 possesses both fucosyltransferase and chaperone activity for Notch raises the question of the respective contributions of these two activities to the genetic requirement for OFUT1 in Notch signaling. In this study, we have addressed this by examining the <italic>in vivo </italic>activity of Notch produced in cells with OFUT1 chaperone activity, but lacking fucosyltransferase activity. Surprisingly, we find that Notch expressed by these cells is a functional receptor. Our observations indicate that <italic>O</italic>-fucosylation is dispensable for many Notch signaling events during <italic>Drosophila </italic>development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>O</italic>-fucosylation of Notch is not required during embryonic neurogenesis</title><p>We have taken two complementary approaches to evaluate the respective contributions of the fucosyltransferase and chaperone activities of OFUT1 to Notch signaling. First, we employed a mutant isoform of OFUT1, OFUT1<sup>R245A</sup>. This mutation alters an invariant arginine within the putative GDP binding site, and it eliminates detectable fucosyltransferase activity, while retaining chaperone activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A genomic rescue construct carrying the <italic>Ofut1</italic><sup><italic>R</italic>245<italic>A </italic></sup>mutation was created, and then introduced into flies by P element-mediated transformation. The ability of the OFUT1<sup>R245A </sup>isoform to rescue Notch signaling phenotypes was then assayed in animals lacking wild-type OFUT1. As <italic>Ofut1 </italic>is provided maternally to embryos, this was done by making germline clones with a null allele of <italic>Ofut1</italic>, <italic>Ofut1</italic><sup>4<italic>R</italic>6</sup>, in animals containing the <italic>Ofut1</italic><sup><italic>R</italic>245<italic>A </italic></sup>genomic construct inserted on the same chromosome arm. In the absence of any rescue construct, animals lacking maternal and zygotic <italic>Ofut1 </italic>exhibit a strong neurogenic phenotype, in which impairment of lateral inhibition causes excess neurons to be produced at the expense of epidermal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This phenotype is characteristic of mutations in Notch pathway genes and can be visualized by staining with antibodies against a marker for neuronal cells, ELAV (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, cf. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Significantly, when <italic>Ofut1</italic><sup><italic>R</italic>245<italic>A </italic></sup>is provided to <italic>Ofut1</italic><sup>4<italic>R</italic>6 </sup>germline clones embryos, embryonic neurogenesis, as revealed by ELAV staining, appears indistinguishable from that in wild-type embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). These embryos lacking O-FucT activity can hatch, but die as first instar larvae. This result implies that the fucosyltransferase activity of OFUT1 is not essential for Notch signaling during lateral inhibition.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>O</italic>-fucose is not required during embryonic neurogenesis</bold>.

GDP-fucose is generated in the cytoplasm from GDP-mannose by enzymes including GDP-D-mannose dehydratase (GMD). Since <italic>Drosophila </italic>lack a salvage pathway for GDP-fucose synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and GDP-fucose is the common donor substrate for all fucosyltransferases, animals lacking GMD are expected to be unable to effect all types of fucosylation. Animals that are mutant for a null allele of <italic>Gmd</italic>, <italic>Gmd</italic><sup>1 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], die as larvae with no neurogenic phenotype (not shown), but the survival of <italic>Gmd </italic>zygotic mutants could have been a result of maternally provided product. Thus, requirements for <italic>Gmd </italic>during embryonic development were evaluated by making germline clones. Confirmation of the general deficit in fucosylation in these embryos was provided by staining with anti-HRP antibodies, which recognize a fucose-containing epitope on neuronal <italic>N</italic>-glycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Anti-HRP staining was completely eliminated in animals lacking both maternal and zyogotic contributions of <italic>Gmd </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Strikingly, however, Notch signaling in these embryos, as visualized by ELAV staining, was indistinguishable from wild type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) and <italic>Gmd </italic>germline clone embryos are able to complete embryogenesis and hatch before dying as first instar larvae. These results establish that all fucose modifications are dispensable for lateral inhibition, as well as all other developmental processes essential for the hatching of a <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryo.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of Notch <italic>O</italic>-fucosylation in the wing imaginal disk</title><p>Notch signaling participates in many different processes throughout development and many of the factors that modulate Notch signaling are context specific. For example, <italic>fng </italic>is dispensable for Notch functions during embryonic neurogenesis, but plays a critical role in the developing wing. In the wing, <italic>fng </italic>is expressed by dorsal cells and its positive and negative effects on signaling by Delta and Ser, respectively, position a stripe of Notch activation along the edge of <italic>fng </italic>expression at the D-V boundary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The critical role of <italic>fng </italic>in positioning Notch activation is evidenced by the observation that establishing novel <italic>fng </italic>expression boundaries by creating <italic>fng </italic>mutant clones in dorsal cells results in the induction of ectopic stripes of Notch activation, which can be visualized by examining expression of targets of Notch signaling, such as Wingless (WG; see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>Ofut1 </italic>mutant clones are associated with a complete loss of Notch activation in the wing (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], equivalent to that observed in <italic>Notch </italic>mutant clones.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold><italic>O</italic>-fucose is not required during Notch signaling in wing disks</bold>.

In one set of experiments, we expressed <italic>Ofut1</italic><sup><italic>R</italic>245<italic>A </italic></sup>from a genomic rescue construct, such that <italic>Ofut1</italic><sup><italic>R</italic>245<italic>A </italic></sup>was expressed under its own promoter. In an alternative approach, <italic>Ofut1</italic><sup><italic>R</italic>245<italic>A </italic></sup>was over-expressed in <italic>Ofut1</italic><sup>4<italic>R</italic>6 </sup>mutant clones using the mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], which employs the UAS-Gal4 system to drive expression under the control of a heterologous promoter. Both methods yielded similar results: when <italic>Ofut1</italic><sup><italic>R</italic>245<italic>A </italic></sup>expression is similar to endogenous <italic>Ofut1 </italic>levels, the rescued clones phenocopy <italic>fng </italic>mutant clones (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>, cf. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Thus, where the clones intersected the normal D-V boundary, normal WG expression is lost, whereas the borders of clones within the dorsal compartment can be associated with ectopic WG expression. This striking phenotype has two important implications. First, because WG expression can be induced within mutant cells expressing only <italic>Ofut1</italic><sup><italic>R</italic>245<italic>A</italic></sup>, it indicates that, as during embryonic neurogenesis, modification of Notch with <italic>O</italic>-fucose is not required for it to function as a receptor. Second, it indicates that the absence of <italic>O</italic>-fucose is functionally equivalent to the absence of elongated (i.e. FNG-modified) <italic>O</italic>-fucose in the developing wing.</p><p>We also attempted to extend these observations by examining <italic>Gmd </italic>mutants. Animals that are mutant for a null allele, <italic>Gmd</italic><sup>1</sup>, exhibit decreased growth and loss of WG expression in the wing imaginal disks, consistent with a deficit in Notch signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. To investigate whether this phenotype reflects a specific requirement for <italic>Gmd </italic>in FNG-dependent Notch signaling, or a more general requirement for <italic>Gmd </italic>in Notch signaling, we created clones of cells homozygous for <italic>Gmd</italic><sup>1</sup>. However, in most cases these did not show obvious <italic>Notch</italic>-loss-of-function phenotypes (not shown). Only when the <italic>Minute </italic>technique was used to generate disks in which all, or almost all, of the wing was composed of mutant tissue was a loss of WG expression observed, and in all cases the loss of WG expression was non-autonomous (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). A non-autonomous phenotype in clones has been reported previously for a mutation in UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, which is required for the synthesis of heparan sulfate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We suggest that a general non-autonomy of mutations in genes that participate in nucleotide sugar biosynthesis could be explained if nucleotide sugars can diffuse through cells via gap junctions. Owing this non-autonomy, <italic>Gmd </italic>clones could not be directly compared with <italic>fng </italic>or <italic>Ofut1 </italic>clones.</p></sec><sec><title>Over-expression of OFUT1 can inhibit Notch signaling independently of its fucosyltransferase activity</title><p>Loss of <italic>Ofut1 </italic>impairs Notch signaling, but over-expression of <italic>Ofut1 </italic>can also impair Notch signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This observation led to the suggestion that high levels of Notch <italic>O</italic>-fucosylation might suppress Notch signaling. However, the determination that it is the chaperone activity, rather than the fucosyltransferase activity, that is universally required for Notch signaling prompted us to re-examine the basis for the inhibition of Notch signaling associated with OFUT1 over-expression. Towards that end, <italic>Ofut1</italic><sup><italic>R</italic>245<italic>A </italic></sup>was expressed at high levels in the developing notum under the control of <italic>ap-Gal4</italic>. Expression of wild-type <italic>Ofut1 </italic>(<italic>UAS-Ofut1 [8.2]</italic>) under <italic>ap-Gal4 </italic>control interferes with Notch-mediated lateral inhibition, and so results in the production of extra bristles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, cf. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The effect on bristles was only evident in microchaetes, but not in macrochaetes. Over-expression of <italic>Ofut1</italic><sup><italic>R</italic>245<italic>A </italic></sup>(<italic>UAS-Ofut1</italic><sup><italic>R</italic>245<italic>A</italic></sup><italic>[28.3]</italic>) under <italic>ap-Gal4 </italic>control results in a similar phenotype (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). This observation, together with another recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], indicate that the over-expression phenotype is independent of OFUT1's fucosyltransferase activity. Interestingly, when much stronger <italic>Ofut1 </italic>expression (relative to Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) was induced in a thin stripe of cells along the anterior-posterior (A-P) compartment boundary using the <italic>ptc-Gal4 </italic>driver with <italic>UAS-Ofut1 [11.1]</italic>, WG expression was inhibited non-autonomously (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>, cf. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). As extracellular concentrations of nucleotide sugars are generally thought to be too low to support glycosylation, this non-autonomous affect is also consistent with a fucosylation-independent activity.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Over-expression of OFUT1 inhibits Notch activity non-enzymatically and non-autonomously</bold>.

Recently, however, our identification of this chaperone activity has been questioned and two additional activities for OFUT1 have been proposed in its place: the first, independent of its fucosyltransferase activity, promotes endocytosis of Notch from the plasma membrane to the early endosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]; the second, dependent upon fucosyltransferase activity, promotes trafficking of Notch from the plasma membrane to the sub-apical complex and adherens junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The two most critical experiments distinguishing between the chaperone model and these trafficking models for OFUT1 function relate to the localization of Notch in cells lacking OFUT1.</p><p>First, it was claimed that in contrast to our report that Notch is not secreted to the cell surface in the absence of OFUT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], Notch is secreted to the plasma membrane in <italic>Ofut1 </italic>mutant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This claim was based on an assay in which anti-Notch antibodies were added to live disks. However, this is not an effective assay for cell surface localization, because a cell surface receptor is not required for bulk endocytosis (e.g. even fluorescent dextran is efficiently endocytosed by disk cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]), and once endocytosed, antibodies could be spread throughout the secretory pathway and then accumulate wherever there are significant epitope concentrations. A standard assay for cell surface localization is to determine whether the accessibility of epitopes requires membrane permeabilization. Thus, we performed immunostaining using antibodies directed against the extracellular domain of Notch, both in the presence and in the absence of detergent. When wing disk cells are permeabilized with detergent, wild-type cells exhibit both intracellular staining as well as apical hexagonal staining, corresponding to the normal cell surface localization of Notch near the adherens junctions (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). <italic>Ofut1 </italic>mutant cells show increased Notch staining (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), which we have previously shown overlaps with ER markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). To demonstrate that the Notch accumulation near the apical surface in <italic>Ofut1 </italic>mutant cells is not exposed on the cell surface, we stained disks without detergent treatment. Under these conditions, no staining was observed in <italic>Ofut1 </italic>mutant cells, whereas neighboring wild-type cells exhibit normal apical surface staining (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). These results are consistent with previous data using <italic>Drosophila </italic>S2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and reconfirm that OFUT1 is required for secretion of Notch to the cell surface in wing disk cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Notch does not reach the cell surface in <italic>Ofut1 </italic>mutant cells</bold>.

This claim relies on the belief that the ER is homogeneous organelle, that is, that all ER proteins are homogeneously distributed. Both our studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and those of Sasaki <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] reveal overlap between Notch and ER markers in <italic>Ofut1 </italic>mutant or RNAi-depleted cells. At the same time, we agree that Notch does not overlap perfectly with ER markers in all focal planes; indeed, it is for this reason that we originally thought that Notch was not in the ER in the absence of OFUT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, we now think that differences between Notch and other markers reflect ER heterogeneity. In support of this idea, we have investigated the relative distributions of five different ER markers in wing imaginal disks cells: two dedicated ER chaperones (OFUT1 and Boca), a classic ER protein marker (Calnexin), a synthetic ER protein (GFP with a KDEL ER retention signal added) and bulk ER proteins (using an anti-KDEL antibody). Each of these ER markers exhibits partial, but not perfect, overlap with other ER markers (see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This observation of ER heterogeneity emphasizes that the lack of perfect correspondence among markers cannot be taken as compelling evidence for the absence of ER localization of Notch in <italic>Ofut1 </italic>mutant cells. Together with observations that the accumulated Notch in <italic>Ofut1 </italic>cells does not overlap markers for any other vesicles or organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], that the distribution of Notch in <italic>Ofut1 </italic>mutant cells is similar to the distribution of OFUT1 itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], which by several criteria is an ER protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and that Notch does partially overlap with a variety of ER markers in <italic>Ofut1 </italic>mutant or depleted cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], these observations are consistent with the conclusion that Notch accumulation within <italic>Ofut1 </italic>mutant cells is in the ER.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The observations we describe here lead to the unexpected conclusion that the fucosyltransferase activity of OFUT1 is not essential for all Notch signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The lack of requirement for Notch <italic>O</italic>-fucosylation is evidenced by the observation that expression of a form of OFUT1 that provides chaperone activity, but lacks fucosyltransferase activity, is sufficient to enable Notch receptor activation in at least two different contexts: during embryonic neurogenesis, where Notch signaling effects lateral inhibition, and during wing disk development, where inductive Notch signaling establishes specialized D-V boundary cells. Indeed, because <italic>Ofut1</italic><sup><italic>R</italic>245<italic>A</italic></sup>-rescued animals complete embryogenesis and hatch without grossly evident abnormalities, it is likely that many other Notch signaling events also do not require Notch fucosylation. Although reagents that would enable direct visualization of the <italic>O</italic>-fucosylation state of Notch in cells expressing <italic>Ofut1</italic><sup><italic>R</italic>245<italic>A </italic></sup>do not exist, prior characterization of this mutant isoform indicates that it is completely defective in fucosylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Further, the observation of <italic>fng</italic>-like phenotypes in the wing provides a genetic argument that fucosylation is lacking in cells expressing only <italic>Ofut1</italic><sup><italic>R</italic>245<italic>A</italic></sup>, as if <italic>O</italic>-fucose were present on Notch then it should be modified by FNG. Moreover, in a completely independent approach, the lack of requirement for Notch fucosylation was demonstrated by the observation of normal neurogenesis and completion of embryogenesis in <italic>Gmd </italic>mutants, whose general deficit in fucosylation was confirmed by anti-HRP staining. The absence of <italic>O</italic>-fucosylation in <italic>Gmd </italic>mutants is also consistent with the prior observation that Notch signaling at the D-V boundary of the wing is lost in <italic>Gmd </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], as this is a <italic>fng</italic>-dependent process. Collectively, these results indicate that Notch receptors can transduce signals without modification by <italic>O</italic>-fucose. Prior results suggesting that <italic>O</italic>-fucose is required for Notch-ligand binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] can be explained by the requirement for the chaperone activity of OFUT1. Indeed, a bacterially expressed fragment of mammalian Notch1 can bind to Delta in spite of the absence of glycosylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The observation that <italic>O</italic>-fucose is not universally required for Notch signaling does not mean that it has no effect. In acting as a substrate for FNG, <italic>O</italic>-fucose clearly has an important modulatory role. It is, however, conceivable that this is the only absolute requirement for <italic>O</italic>-fucose, as genetic studies of the <italic>Ofut1</italic><sup><italic>R</italic>245<italic>A </italic></sup>allele, as well as genetic studies of <italic>Gmd</italic>, are consistent with the possibility that all requirements for <italic>O</italic>-fucose might be explained by its role in FNG-dependent modulation of Notch: like <italic>Ofut1</italic><sup><italic>R</italic>245<italic>A</italic></sup>-rescued animals, or <italic>Gmd </italic>maternal and zygotic mutant animals, <italic>fng </italic>mutant animals die as first instar larvae, without obvious affects on embryonic neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The apparently normal embryogenesis of <italic>Gmd </italic>mutants is particularly striking, as fucose is a common component of insect <italic>N</italic>-glycans.</p><p>The similarity between <italic>Ofut1</italic><sup><italic>R</italic>245<italic>A</italic></sup>-rescued clones and <italic>fng </italic>mutant clones in the wing is also informative in terms of the nature of the requirement for FNG modification. That is, the observation that loss of <italic>O</italic>-fucose results in the same phenotype as loss of <italic>O</italic>-fucose elongation implies that modulation of Notch signaling by FNG is affected because a specific glycan created as a consequence of FNG modification (i.e. elongated <italic>O</italic>-fucose) alters Notch-ligand interactions, rather than because elongation of <italic>O</italic>-fucose covers up a glycan (i.e. the <italic>O</italic>-fucose monosaccharide) that promotes Serrate-Notch interactions or impairs Delta-Notch interactions.</p><p>Although the phenotypes of <italic>Ofut1</italic><sup>R245A </sup>and <italic>Gmd </italic>might be explained simply by the requirement for FNG-dependent elongation, there are nonetheless some indications that the monosaccharide form of <italic>O</italic>-fucose can have an influence on Notch. <italic>In vitro </italic>binding revealed that elimination of the <italic>O</italic>-fucose modification site located in the ligand-binding region (EGF repeat 12) of <italic>Drosophila </italic>Notch causes elevated Serrate binding in the absence of Fringe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Mutagenesis of the <italic>O</italic>-fucose site on EGF12 of Notch in mammalian cells also influenced Notch signaling, although in this case the result was an impairment of Delta-like 1 or Jagged-1 activation of Notch1 in cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and impaired Notch signaling <italic>in vivo </italic>(Ge and Stanley, personal communication). Moreover, the introduction of a novel <italic>O</italic>-fucosylation site on EGF repeat 14, as observed in the <italic>N</italic><sup><italic>spl </italic></sup>mutation, causes ectopic Notch activation during eye development, independently of Fringe activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. These observations are, however, subject to the caveat that the affects of these mutations might not actually be a result of their effects on <italic>O</italic>-fucosylation. Cell-based ligand binding assays have revealed that a soluble form of Notch produced from cells over-expressing wild-type <italic>Ofut1 </italic>results in increased binding to Serrate but decreased binding to Delta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], whereas Notch from <italic>Ofut1</italic><sup><italic>R</italic>245<italic>A </italic></sup>over-expressing cells exhibits increased binding to both Serrate and Delta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These differing affects of OFUT1 versus OFUT1<sup>R245A </sup>on Delta-binding suggest that increased <italic>O</italic>-fucosylation can modulate Notch-Delta interactions. A study of a <italic>Gmd</italic>-deficient mammalian cell line, Lec13, revealed that Jagged-1 dependent activation of Notch1 was reduced in the mutant cells, suggesting that <italic>O</italic>-fucose positively regulates Notch1 activation by Jagged-1 in this context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Finally, we note that the expression of <italic>Ofut1 </italic>is developmentally regulated in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, exhibiting a complex spatial and temporal pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Thus, while <italic>O</italic>-fucose is clearly not essential for all Notch signaling, it might still have a modulatory role in some contexts.</p><p>Our studies have focused on the fucosyltransferase and the chaperone activities of OFUT1 as distinct functions, genetically separable by the R245A mutation. Nonetheless, from an evolutionary perspective it would be surprising if these activities were unrelated. Given that OFUT1 acts during the folding process and dissociates from EGF domains upon <italic>O</italic>-fucosylation, it is tempting to speculate that <italic>O</italic>-fucose might serve as a tag for correctly folded EGF domains, thus directing OFUT1 to incompletely folded EGF domains. Therefore, although <italic>O</italic>-fucosylation is not absolutely required for Notch receptor activity, it might still affect the efficiency of the chaperone activity of OFUT1. In support of this hypothesis, we have observed modest decreases in Notch secretion in S2 cells treated with double-stranded RNA corresponding to <italic>Gmd </italic>(Tetsuya Okajima, unpublished observations).</p><p>Our studies also suggest the molecular basis for the previous observation that over-expression of OFUT1 inhibits Notch signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We showed that over-expressed OFUT1 inhibits Notch signaling non-autonomously and non-enzymatically (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Although OFUT1 is predominantly an ER protein, a small fraction is secreted from cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], which presents the possibility that the non-autonomous affect of OFUT1 might be effected through direct interaction of secreted OFUT1 with Notch or its ligands, presumably mediated by its ability to associate with EGF domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Indeed it has recently been observed that secreted OFUT1 can promote endocytosis of Notch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], which could provide an explanation for the inhibition of Notch signaling associated with OFUT1 over-expression. We note, however, that the biological relevance of this phenomenon remains to be determined: it can occur when OFUT1 is over-expressed, but it is not clear whether it is significant at endogenous expression levels. Nonetheless, it is of potential pharmacological interest to note that OFUT1 can act as a soluble inhibitor of Notch signaling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our findings demonstrated for the first time that <italic>O</italic>-fucose modification on Notch receptors is not absolutely required for their activity in <italic>fringe</italic>-independent developmental processes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and that successful folding mediated by chaperone activity of OFUT1 is sufficient to generate functional Notch receptors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Stocks</title><p><italic>Ofut1</italic><sup>4<italic>R</italic>6 </sup>was obtained from K Matsuno [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. <italic>UAS-Ofut1</italic><sup><italic>R</italic>245<italic>A</italic></sup><italic>[28.3] </italic>and <italic>Gmd</italic><sup>1 </sup>are described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].
