Van Lint, J. Ghysdael, P. Paras, Jr, A. Burny and E. Verdin (1994) <italic>J. Virol.</italic> 68, 2632&#x02013;2648]. In this study, we have further physically characterized each binding site and have shown that the transcription factors Oct-1, Oct-2, PU.1, Sp1 and Sp3 interact <italic>in vitro</italic> with the <italic>pol</italic> region. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using HIV-infected cell lines demonstrated in the context of chromatin that Sp1, Sp3, Oct-1 and PU.1 are recruited to the HS7 region <italic>in vivo</italic>. For each site, we have identified mutations abolishing factor binding to their cognate DNA sequences without altering the underlying amino acid sequence of the integrase. By transient transfection assays, we have demonstrated the involvement of the <italic>pol</italic> binding sites in the transcriptional enhancing activity of the intragenic region. Our functional results with multimerized wild-type and mutated <italic>pol</italic> binding sites separately (i.e. in the absence of the other sites) have demonstrated that the PU.1, Sp1, Sp3 and Oct-1 transcription factors regulate the transcriptional activity of a heterologous promoter through their respective HS7 binding sites. Finally, we have investigated the physiological role of the HS7 binding sites in HIV-1 replication and have shown that these sites are important for viral infectivity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The expression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the etiological agent of AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>), is regulated both at the transcriptional and the post-transcriptional levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Control of HIV-1 transcription is mediated by <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements located in the viral 5&#x02032;-long terminal repeats (5&#x02032;-LTRs), by the viral <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory protein Tat and by cellular transcription factors. In addition to the enhancer located in the 5&#x02032;-LTR, a 12-<italic>O</italic>-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-inducible intragenic enhancer has been identified in the <italic>pol</italic> gene of HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). This element is composed of two functional subdomains encompassing nt 4079&#x02013;4342 and nt 4781&#x02013;6026, both exhibiting TPA-inducible enhancing activity, on the herpes simplex virus (HSV) thymidine kinase (TK) promoter in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), but no significant activity in T-lymphoid and monocyte/macrophage cell lines. Nevertheless, analysis of the chromatin organization of integrated HIV-1 identified a single major nuclease-hypersensitive site in the 8 kb region located between the two LTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). This hypersensitive site, centered around nt 4490&#x02013;4766 [according to the numbering of the HIV-1 NY5 genome (where nt +1 is the start of U3 in the 5&#x02032;-LTR)], is located in the part of the <italic>pol</italic> gene encoding the integrase protein, precisely between the two functional domains of the intragenic enhancer identified in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). This constitutive hypersensitive site is present only in a cell line of monocytic origin (U1) and not in two cell lines of lymphoid origin (8E5 and ACH2), suggesting a cellular specificity associated with this intragenic element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). A 500 bp fragment (nt 4481&#x02013;4982) encompassing the <italic>pol</italic> gene hypersensitive site region (called HS7 region) acts <italic>ex vivo</italic> as a <italic>cis</italic>-acting positive regulatory element. Indeed, when cloned downstream and in the sense orientation relative to the HIV-1 promoter, the HS7 region reproducibly increases transcription mediated by the HIV-1 5&#x02032;-LTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>).</p><p>Physical characterization of the HS7 region identified several recognition sites for ubiquitous and cell-type-specific nuclear factors, suggesting their involvement in the control of the transcriptional activity of this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). By <italic>in vitro</italic> binding studies of the HS7 region, four distinct DNA-binding motifs for nuclear proteins (called from 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; site B, GC-box, site C and site D) were physically defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Site B (nt 4519&#x02013;4545) specifically binds four distinct nuclear protein complexes: an ubiquitous factor (B1), a B-cell specific factor (B2), a T-cell specific factor (B3) and a protein(s) related to the transcription factor PU.1 (B4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The GC-box (nt 4623&#x02013;4631) binds purified Sp1 protein <italic>in vitro</italic>. Site C (nt 4681&#x02013;4701) specifically binds three nuclear protein complexes: an ubiquitous factor (C1), a B-cell specific factor (C2) and a T-cell specific factor (C3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These factors have a DNA-binding specificity similar to that of factors binding to site B (B1, B2 and B3, respectively). Site D (nt 4816&#x02013;4851) specifically binds an ubiquitously expressed factor(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). However, the physiological role of these HS7 binding sites in HIV-1 transcription and replication remains unknown to date.</p><p>In this study, we have further characterized physically each of these four binding sites (sites B, C, D and the GC-box) located in the HS7 region, examined the functional transcriptional role of each site separately in a heterologous context, and investigated their biological significance in the HIV-1 replication cycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The monocytic cell lines U937 and U1 and the T-lymphoid cell lines JE6-1 (a clonal line of Jurkat cells), A3.01 (a clonal derivative of the CEM cell line), the clonal Jurkat JE6-1 cell lines stably expressing HIV-1 Tat proteins (Tat72 and Tat101) or the empty vector cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), and ACH2 were maintained in RPMI 1640-Glutamax I medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Myoclone Superplus).

The numerous potential sites revealed by this <italic>in silico</italic> analysis prompted us to perform a systematic substitution-scanning mutational analysis of sites B and C in order to localize by <italic>in vitro</italic> studies the nucleotides important in these sites for formation of the retarded complexes B1/C1, B2/C2 and B3/C3.</p><p>Nine mutant site B oligonucleotides (named m1&#x02013;m9) were prepared in which consecutive 3 bp regions of the wild-type site B were sequentially replaced with a 3 bp C/G-C/G-C/G sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To examine the effects of these mutations on specific factor binding to site B, we have systematically analyzed the ability of the scanning mutants to inhibit the formation of complexes B1, B2 and B3 in competition EMSAs. If mutations are introduced at critical positions, then a decrease in the ability of the unlabeled mutant oligonucleotide to compete for factor binding will be detected by the increase in band intensity as compared to the competition with the wild-type site B. Mutations at non-essential bases are expected to demonstrate binding competition similar to the wild-type. The competition assays were performed using site B wild-type as probe, nuclear extracts from the A3.01 cell line and unlabeled wild-type and substitution mutant site B double-stranded oligonucleotides as competitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Phosphorimaging analyses were used to quantify the percentage of competition for formation of complexes B1 and B3 by each of the unlabeled oligonucleotides. The competition activities of mutant sites B m1&#x02013;m9 were expressed relative to the competition activity of the wild-type site B, which was arbitrarily assigned a value of 100% of competition. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows a graphic representation of the quantification results for complex B1. Site B mutants m6, m7 and m8 exhibited the lowest percentages of competition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, 44.4, 34.1 and 32.7%, respectively), indicating that the base pairs which were substituted in these three double-stranded oligonucleotides, were the most important for complex B1 formation. Quantification of the bands corresponding to complex B3 indicated the importance of the same base pair (data not shown). Similar results were observed for complexes B1 and B2 when identical experiments were conducted with Raji nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results demonstrate that nucleotides between 4534 and 4542 in site B are critical for formation of all three complexes B1, B2 and B3, suggesting the presence of overlapping binding sites in site B or competition among factors for the same site.</p><p>We next prepared seven scanning mutants of site C (named m1&#x02013;m7), which sequentially replace 3 bp at a time of the entire site C sequence with a CCC sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We tested the ability of this set of substitution mutants to inhibit formation of complexes C1, C2 and C3 in competition EMSAs using wild-type site C as probe, A3.01 nuclear extracts and the unlabeled wild-type and mutant double-stranded oligonucleotides as competitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Phosphorimaging analyses were used to quantify the percentage of competition for the formation of complexes C1 and C3 by each of the unlabeled oligonucleotides. The competition activities of mutant sites C m1&#x02013;m7 were expressed relative to the competition activity of the wild-type site C, which was arbitrarily assigned to a value of 100% of competition. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> shows a graphic representation of the quantification results for complex C1. Site C mutants m3, m4 and m5 exhibited significantly reduced competition activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, 55.4, 20.3 and 25.2%, respectively), indicating that the base pairs which were substituted in these three oligonucleotides were the most important for complex C1 formation. Quantification of the bands corresponding to complex C3 indicated the importance of the same base pair (data not shown). Similar results were observed for complexes C1 and C2 when identical experiments were conducted with Raji nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These results demonstrate that nucleotides between 4687 and 4695 in site C are critical for the formation of all three complexes C1, C2 and C3, suggesting the presence of overlapping binding sites in site C or competition among factors for the same site.</p><p>In addition, we confirmed these results by complementary experiments in which a labeled probe containing site B was used and complex formation was competed by unlabeled oligonucleotides containing wild-type and mutant sites C, as well as by reverse experiments in which a labeled probe containing site C was used and complex formation was competed by unlabeled oligonucleotides containing wild-type and mutant sites B (data not shown), confirming that factors binding to site C have a DNA-binding specificity similar to that of factors binding to site B, except for PU.1. These data are in agreement with our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our results indicate that the DNA sequences identified here as critical for factors binding to sites B and C are located between nt 4534 and 4542 and between nt 4687 and 4695, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>The transcription factors Oct-1 and Oct-2 bind to sites B and C</title><p>Based on the above systematic mutational analysis, we performed a new computer search for potential transcription factor binding sites, which was focused on the critical nucleotide sequences of sites B and C. This search revealed the presence of a putative octamer regulatory sequence both in site B and in site C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, nt 4532&#x02013;4539 in site B and nt 4689&#x02013;4696 in site C). These two putative octamer sequences presented three mismatches with respect to the Oct consensus. Oct-1 and Oct-2 along with Pit-1 and Unc-86 are founding members of the POU family of transcription factors. These members show homology in the domain responsible for specific DNA-binding, the so-called POU domain. While Oct-1 is ubiquitous, Oct-2 is predominantly expressed in B-cells, as well as in activated T-cells and in nervous system. However, B-cells appear to contain the highest amounts of Oct-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether transcription factors binding to sites B and C are related to Oct proteins, unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared and used as competitors in EMSAs. Site C probe was incubated with nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells in the absence or in the presence of different competitor double-stranded oligonucleotides: the unlabeled homologous oligonucleotide, an unlabeled heterologous oligonucleotide corresponding to site D and an unlabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the octamer consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In the absence of competitor, two retarded complexes were detected: the ubiquitous complex C1 and the T-cell specific complex C3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lane 1). Formation of complex C1 was inhibited by a molar excess of unlabeled homologous oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;7), by the Oct consensus oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes 14&#x02013;19), but not by an oligonucleotide with an unrelated sequence containing site D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes 8&#x02013;13). Complex C3 was also out-competed by the homologous site C oligonucleotide and by the Oct consensus oligonucleotide (although to a lesser extent than complex C1) but not by the site D oligonucleotide. Similar competition experiments using site C as probe and nuclear extracts from Raji cells confirmed the above results for complex C1 and indicated that complex C2 was inhibited by an excess of unlabeled homologous oligonucleotide and by the Oct consensus, but not by the unrelated site D oligonucleotide (data not shown). We conclude from these experiments that the ubiquitous complex C1, the B-cell-specific complex C2 and the T-cell-specific complex C3 could contain a member(s) of the Oct proteins. Similar competition experiments performed with site B as probe supported the notion that formation of complexes B1, B2 and to a lesser extent B3 also resulted from binding of proteins belonging to the Oct family (data not shown).</p><p>To identify directly the factors present in the specific complexes B1/C1, B2/C2 and B3/C3, we performed supershift assays using antibodies directed against two individual members of the Oct family of transcription factors: the ubiquitously expressed Oct-1 protein and the lymphoid-specific Oct-2 protein. Labeled site C oligonucleotide probe was incubated with nuclear extracts from Jurkat or Raji cells in the presence of either an anti-Oct-1 antibody or an anti-Oct-2 antibody or purified rabbit IgG as control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). With Jurkat nuclear extracts, we observed, in the presence of the IgG control, the formation of the ubiquitous complex C1 and of the T-cell-specific complex C3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lane 1). Addition of the anti-Oct-1 antibody resulted in the complete disappearance of complex C1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lane 3), whereas the addition of the anti-Oct-2 antibody did not modify the migration profile of complexes C1 and C3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lane 5). With Raji nuclear extracts, we observed, in the presence of the IgG control, the formation of the ubiquitous complex C1 and the B-cell-specific complex C2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lane 2). The anti-Oct-1 antibody completely eliminated complex C1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lane 4) and complex C2 was eliminated by the anti-Oct-2 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lane 6). Similar results were obtained for complexes B1, B2 and B3 when identical experiments were conducted with site B as probe (data not shown).</p><p>In order to identify the protein(s) present in complexes B3/C3, we first tested, by supershift experiments, a series of protein candidates for potential transcription factor binding sites revealed by our <italic>in silico</italic> analysis: among others, the members of the MEF-2 transcription factor family. However, the latter assays did not provide any clue about the identity of the complexes B3/C3. Of note, the validity and/or the specificity of the different &#x003b1;-MEF-2 (&#x003b1;-MEF-2A, -2B, -2C and -2D) antibodies were established in separate experiments (data not shown). We also tried to purify complexes B3/C3 by affinity chromatography. However, despite many attempts, we did not succeed in the identification of these B3/C3 complexes. Additional purification and microsequencing studies are currently underway in our laboratory to identify the nature of the protein(s) present in complexes B3/C3.</p><p>From these data, we conclude that the ubiquitous complexes B1/C1 contain the Oct-1 transcription factor and that the B-cell-specific complexes B2/C2 contain the Oct-2 transcription factor. The transcription factor(s) present in the T-cell-specific complexes B3/C3 still remains (remain) to be identified.</p></sec><sec><title>The transcription factor PU.1 specifically interacts with site B of the HS7 region to form complex B4</title><p>Complex B4 was previously demonstrated by our laboratory to contain a protein related to the transcription factor PU.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Indeed, our laboratory has previously reported that a SV40 PU.1 consensus oligonucleotide inhibits specifically the formation of complex B4, whereas no competition of binding in complexes B1 and B2 was observed. We have also previously shown that the PU.1 protein, derived from lysates of Cos-1 cells transfected with a PU.1 expression vector, binds to site B in a PU box-dependent manner. Nevertheless, because proteins that bind DNA by means of an Ets domain share DNA recognition properties, we could not rule out the possibility that other Ets family members also bind to the PU box present in the HS7 site B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>To determine directly the presence of PU.1 in complex B4, we performed supershift assays. Preimmune serum or antiserum specific for PU.1 was incubated with nuclear extracts from U937 cells before the addition of the labeled probe corresponding to site B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We observed that the addition of the anti-PU.1 antibody interfered with the formation of complex B4, leading to its disappearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 2). In contrast, the preimmune serum did not affect complex B4 formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 1), indicating the specificity of the protein&#x02013;antibody interaction. These results indicated that the B4 complex contained PU.1. In addition, we also demonstrated that PU.1 protein produced in baculovirus bound to site B and induced the formation of a complex comigrating with complex B4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 4).</p><p>In conclusion, the macrophage- and B-cell-specific transcription factor PU.1 specifically interacts with site B in the HIV-1 HS7 region. Moreover, the comigration of complex B4 with purified PU.1 protein and the complete disappearance of complex B4 when using the anti-PU.1 antiserum suggest that this complex does not contain other Ets proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>The transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 specifically interact with the GC-box located in the HIV-1 HS7 region</title><p>We have previously identified a GC-box with close homology to the Sp1 consensus sequence at position nt 4623&#x02013;4631 in the HS7 region and we have shown, by <italic>in vitro</italic> DNase I footprinting analysis, that this site binds affinity-purified human Sp1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). In order to further assess the presence of Sp1 and/or other Sp family members on this GC-box, we designed a double-stranded oligonucleotide, and designed site Sp wt (nt 4616&#x02013;4638) encompassing the potential Sp site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This oligonucleotide was radiolabeled and tested in EMSAs for DNA&#x02013;protein interactions with nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Two retarded protein&#x02013;DNA complexes were observed. Similar results were obtained with nuclear extracts from the U937, Raji and A30.1 cell lines (data not shown). To evaluate the sequence specificity of the binding to the Sp wt probe, we performed competition EMSAs using increasing concentrations of different unlabeled double-stranded competitor oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The specificity of the protein binding was demonstrated because their formation was inhibited by competition with molar excesses of the unlabeled homologous Sp wt oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;5), but not by the same molar excesses of a heterologous oligonucleotide corresponding to site B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lanes 14&#x02013;17). A Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide (named Sp1 cons) inhibited the formation of the retarded complexes even at lower concentrations than the homologous oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lanes 6&#x02013;9). In contrast, these complexes were not competed by a mutated version of the Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide (named Sp1 cons mut) containing a GG to TT substitution, thereby demonstrating the specificity of the retarded complexes to the HS7 Sp motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lanes 10&#x02013;13). These results support the hypothesis that both complexes contain Sp family members.</p><p>To identify directly the Sp family members within the two retarded complexes observed with the HS7 Sp wt probe, we performed supershift assays using specific antibodies directed against individual members of the Sp family of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The HS7 Sp wt probe was incubated with nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells and polyclonal antibodies directed against Sp1, Sp2, Sp3 or Sp4 were added to the binding reaction mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and data not shown). The &#x003b1;-Sp1 antibody selectively supershifted the major slower migrating complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lane 3) and the &#x003b1;-Sp3 antibody resulted in the appearance of a supershifted complex and the corresponding disappearance of the faster migrating complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lane 4). We confirmed these results when both anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 antibodies were included in the same binding reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lane 5).

In contrast, the binding pattern was not affected by the addition of the antibodies directed against the other Sp proteins (Sp2 and Sp4) (data not shown), showing that the two complexes did not seem to involve these other proteins. Moreover, the binding pattern was not affected by the addition of an unrelated antibody against MEF-2, used as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lane 2).</p><p>Overall, these results demonstrate that Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors interact with the GC-box (renamed Sp site hereafter in the manuscript) located in the intragenic HS7 region of HIV-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcription factor(s) binding to site D seems (seem) to contain a zinc finger DNA-binding domain</title><p>Our laboratory has previously reported that an ubiquitously expressed factor(s) interacts (interact) specifically with site D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). This site is well conserved among many HIV-1 isolates, but computer analysis has revealed no relevant homology between this binding site and the recognition sequences for known transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Methylation interference analysis of site D has identified the guanine residues that are important for binding: methylation of two guanine residues at positions 4830 and 4833 on the coding strand and of one guanine residue at position 4835 on the non-coding strand has been shown to strongly interfere with binding to site D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we further characterized site D by EMSAs to identify the protein(s) present in complex D. Since many transcription factors are zinc finger proteins, the probe corresponding to site D was incubated with nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells in the absence or in the presence of increasing concentrations of a chelator of zinc, the 1,10-phenanthroline. Incubation of this site D probe resulted in one major ubiquitous retarded complex (labeled D) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, lane 1) as previously reported by our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). We observed that complex D disappeared in the presence of phenanthroline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;5). The presence of increasing concentrations of ZnCl<sub>2</sub> caused the restoration of complex D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, lanes 6&#x02013;9), whereas the presence of increasing concentrations of another ion (MgCl<sub>2</sub>) did not allow the reappearance of complex D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, lanes 10&#x02013;13).</p><p>We conclude that the binding of the ubiquitously expressed protein(s) to site D is Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent.

Nuclear extracts from a clone transfected with the empty expression cassette vector were used as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, lane 1). Both forms of Tat were used because Tat101 is expressed both early and late in the virus life cycle, while Tat72 is expressed solely in the late phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>).

Formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin from these cell lines was used for immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed against Sp1, Sp3, Oct-1 or PU.1 or a purified rabbit IgG as negative control. Following reverse of the cross-link, the purified DNA was subjected to PCR analysis using a set of primers flanking the HS7 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In ACH2 cells, Oct-1, Sp1 and Sp3 binding to the HS7 region was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, lanes 1, 2 and 3, respectively), whereas, as expected, immunoprecipitations of the cross-linked chromatin with the anti-PU.1 antibody or with the purified rabbit IgG gave no signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, lanes 4 or 5, respectively). In U1 cells, analysis of PCR products from immunoprecipitated DNA showed significant enrichment of the HS7 region when immunoprecipitation was carried out with the anti-Oct-1, anti-Sp1, anti-Sp3 or anti-PU.1 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, lanes 1, 2, 3 or 4, respectively). In contrast, no such enrichment was observed following immunoprecipitation of the cross-linked chromatin with the purified rabbit IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, lane 5). As a control, we used another set of primers flanking a region of the <italic>pol</italic> gene located 2 kb upstream of the HS7 region that has not been reported so far as binding any of these transcription factors. Immunoprecipitations with all the antibodies did not enrich eluates with DNA from this control region in both ACH2 and U1 cell chromatin, demonstrating the specificity of the HS7 interactions (data not shown).</p><p>These data, thus, demonstrate the occupancy <italic>in vivo</italic> of the HS7 region by Oct-1, Sp1 and Sp3 in both ACH2 and U1 cell lines as well as, consistently, the binding of PU.1 to the HS7 only in the U1 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of point mutations abolishing factor binding to the DNA motifs in the HIV-1 HS7 region</title><p>To further characterize physically the DNA motifs located in the HS7 region of the <italic>pol</italic> gene, we studied by using EMSA the effect of selected mutations on binding affinity. Point mutations were designed to abolish binding of factors to their respective sites without modifying the underlying amino acid sequence of the integrase. <list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p><italic>Site B:</italic> We demonstrated that Oct-1, Oct-2 and PU.1 bound to site B.

The oligonucleotide corresponding to this mutation was designated site B mutOct. To abolish PU.1 binding to site B, two cytosine residues at positions 4526 and 4529 were substituted with thymine residues in the site B PU box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). The oligonucleotide corresponding to this mutation was designated site B mutPU.1. The effect of these selected mutations was analyzed on binding affinity by using EMSAs. The wild-type and the two mutated site B oligonucleotides were used as probes and were incubated with nuclear extracts from U937 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), Raji and Jurkat (data not shown) cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> demonstrated the lack of Oct-1 binding to the site B mutOct oligonucleotide probe (lane 2) and the lack of PU.1 binding to the site B mutPU.1 oligonucleotide probe (lane 3).

Similar EMSAs using Jurkat nuclear extracts confirmed the lack of Oct-1 binding and showed the lack of T-cell-specific binding to the site B mutOct oligonucleotide probe (data not shown). Taken together, our results identify an octamer motif and a PU box in the HS7 site B. The octamer motif specifically binds the octamer proteins Oct-1 and Oct-2 <italic>in vitro</italic>. The PU box specifically binds the Ets protein PU.1. We report a 3 bp mutation, referred to as site B mutOct, that abrogates the binding of Oct-1 and Oct-2 and binding of the T-cell-specific factor to site B and a 2 bp point mutation, referred to as site B mutPU.1, that abrogates PU.1 binding to site B.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Sp site:</italic> We showed that Sp1 and Sp3 bound to the HS7 GC-box.

The effect of this 2 bp mutation on binding affinity was analyzed by EMSAs. The wild-type and the mutated oligonucleotides (referred to as site C wt and site C mutOct, respectively) were used as probes and incubated with Raji (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) or Jurkat nuclear extracts (data not shown). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref> showed the lack of Oct-1 and Oct-2 binding to the site C mutOct oligonucleotide probe. Similar EMSAs using Jurkat nuclear extracts confirmed the lack of Oct-1 binding and showed the lack of T-cell-specific binding to the same mutated probe (data not shown).

However, in the absence of Tat, the CAT values were too low to detect any enhancing activity of the HS7 region.</p><p>In order to address the potential functional role of the HS7 region in the basal (Tat-independent) activity of the HIV-1 promoter, we used the more sensitive luciferase transient expression system. We subcloned the 500 bp HS7 fragment into the construct pLTR in the sense orientation with respect to the transcriptional unit, downstream of the <italic>luciferase</italic> reporter gene, thereby generating the pLTR-HS7wt. The pLTR construct contains the complete HIV-1 LAI 5&#x02032;-LTR (plus the leader sequence up to the ATG of gag) driving the expression of the <italic>luciferase</italic> gene. The constructs pLTR and pLTR-HS7wt were transiently transfected into Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>) or U937 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). The reporter constructs were cotransfected into the cells with pRL-TK, and used as an internal control to measure the transfection efficiency. At 44 h post-transfection, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity. In Jurkat cells, transfection of plasmid pLTR-HS7wt caused a 1.58-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with that of the control plasmid pLTR tested under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). In U937 cells, transfection of pLTR-HS7wt caused a 1.98-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with that of pLTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). These results indicate that, in the absence of Tat, the region associated with the intragenic HS7 shows a weak transcriptional enhancing activity when it is cloned in a position similar to that observed within the viral genome (downstream and in sense orientation relative to the 5&#x02032;-LTR-luc transcriptional unit).</p><p>In order to determine the relative contribution of each factor binding sites (site B, site C, Sp site and site D) to the HS7 enhancing activity, the point mutations identified in EMSAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) were introduced individually or in combination in the context of the pLTR-HS7wt plasmid. The mutated plasmids were designed pLTR-HS7totmut, pLTR-HS7mutSp, pLTR-HS7mutD, pLTR-HS7mutB/PU, pLTR-HS7mutB/Oct, pLTR-HS7mutC and pLTR-HS7mutCmutB/Oct. These plasmids were assayed for luciferase activity after transient transfection in Jurkat or U937 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A or B</xref>, respectively). Remarkably, in both cell lines, transfection of plasmid pLTR-HS7totmut exhibited luciferase activity similar to that obtained with the control vector pLTR, thereby demonstrating that the enhancing effect observed with pLTR-HS7wt required intact site B, site C, Sp site and site D motifs. Moreover, in both cell lines, transfection of the plasmids containing the individual mutations presented luciferase activities similar to that obtained with the wild-type pLTR-HS7wt construct. In conclusion, mutations in the HS7 binding sites in combination abolish the transcription-enhancing activity of the <italic>pol</italic> HS7 region, suggesting that these sites are responsible for most of this activity. However, we could not demonstrate the functional role played by one individual site in the HS7 enhancing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A and B</xref>).</p><p>We next studied the effect of mutating the HS7 binding sites on the response of the HIV-1 promoter to Tat. We observed that the <italic>pol</italic> HS7 region exhibited transcriptional enhancing activity in the presence of Tat, in agreement with our previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>), and that mutations in all the HS7 binding sites in combination abolished this activity (data not shown).</p><p>Our functional results, thus, demonstrate a positive regulatory role of the <italic>pol</italic> HS7 region in both Tat-independent and Tat-dependent HIV-1 promoter-driven gene expression. These data indicate that the loss of transcriptional enhancing activity caused by mutations in the HS7 binding sites correlated with the loss in factor binding to these sites. Moreover, mutation of each HS7 binding site individually did not affect the enhancing activity of the intragenic positive regulatory region.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional analysis of the individual HS7 region binding sites by overexpression assays</title><p>We next wanted to further characterize the functionality of each HS7 site individually (sites for which we were able to identify by the above experiments the bound transcription factors) and to examine whether these transcription factors (PU.1, Sp1, Sp3, Oct-1 and Oct-2) act through the HS7 binding sites. Because these transcription factors present distinct cell-specific expression, we decided to study each site separately by overexpression assays using for each individual factor a cell line which does not express the factor considered. To this end, we produced a series of artificial luciferase reporter constructs in which multimerized copies of each wild-type and mutated HS7 binding sites were inserted upstream of the HSV TK minimal promoter into the pTK construct. The resulting constructs were cotransfected with expression vectors for the various transcription factors (PU.1, Sp1, Sp3, Oct-1 and Oct-2) and assayed for luciferase activity. The minimal TK promoter was used instead of the HIV-1 promoter (LTR) because the latter is known to contain binding sites for Oct, Ets and Sp family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) and could have therefore complicated the interpretation of the transfection results. In these experiments, we used multimerized HS7 binding sites because multimerization of a transcription factor binding site allows the amplification of its transcriptional effect.</p><sec><title>Ectopic expression of the Oct-1 and Oct-2 transcription factors down-regulates TK promoter activity through multimerized sites B and C</title><p>To determine whether the HS7 sites B and C can act as independent regulators of transcription, we constructed four luciferase reporter plasmids driven by the HSV TK minimal promoter with three tandem repeats of the wild-type and Oct-mutated site B or site C inserted upstream of the TK promoter. These four plasmids were referred to as p(Bwt)<sub>3</sub>TK, p(BmutOct)<sub>3</sub>TK, p(Cwt)<sub>3</sub>TK and p(CmutOct)<sub>3</sub>TK, respectively. To examine the response of these reporter constructs to the POU-homeodomain transcription factors Oct-1 and Oct-2, murine NIH3T3 fibroblats were transiently cotransfected with each of them and increasing amounts of either the Oct-1 or the Oct-2 expression vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A and B</xref>, respectively) and then assayed for luciferase activity. The murine NIH3T3 cell line was used in these experiments because our EMSAs performed with NIH3T3 nuclear extracts and with probes corresponding to site B or site C revealed no binding activity corresponding to complexes B1/C1, B2/C2, B3/C3 and even no binding at all (data not shown).</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, the control pTK construct was repressed by Oct-1 up to 2.22-fold (i.e. by 55%) and by Oct-2 up to 2.12-fold (i.e. by 53%). Cotransfection of the reporter construct p(Bwt)<sub>3</sub>TK with the Oct-1 or Oct-2 expression vectors resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in luciferase activity by ectopically expressed Oct-1 (up to 5.00-fold) and Oct-2 (up to 5.88-fold); thus, representing a 2.3- and 2.8-fold down-regulation when compared with the Oct-1 and Oct-2 responses of the control pTK construct devoid of upstream HS7 sites B. This effect required intact Oct motifs in site B, because mutations in these motifs [p(BmutOct)<sub>3</sub>TK] resulted in levels of Oct-1- and Oct-2-mediated repression similar to those obtained with the control pTK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A and B</xref>, respectively). Similar results were obtained when examining site C. Indeed, addition of three copies of the HS7 site C upstream of the TK promoter [p(Cwt)<sub>3</sub>-TK] resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in luciferase activity by ectopically expressed Oct-1 (up to 9.09-fold) and Oct-2 (up to 5.26-fold), thus representing a 4.1-fold and 2.5-fold down-regulation when compared with the Oct-1 and Oct-2 responses of the control pTK devoid of upstream HS7 sites C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A and B</xref>, respectively). This effect also required intact Oct motifs in site C [see p(CmutOct)<sub>3</sub>-TK in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A and B</xref>].</p><p>We conclude from these experiments that ectopic Oct-1 and Oct-2 proteins have a site B- or site C-dependent inhibitory effect on the heterologous TK promoter containing multiple upstream site B or site C, respectively. These results, thus, demonstrate that the HS7 sites B and C function as negative regulatory elements in response to ectopic Oct-1 or Oct-2 proteins in a heterologous context, suggesting that Oct-1 and Oct-2 might be negatively involved in the HS7 transcriptional activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Ectopic expression of the PU.1 transcription factor up-regulates TK promoter activity through multimerized site B</title><p>In order to define the potential role of PU.1 through the PU box of the HS7 site B, we generated a mutant derivative of the p(Bwt)<sub>3</sub>TK construct with the upstream insertion of three tandem repeats of a site B mutated in the PU box sequence. This derivative was designated p(BmutPU.1)<sub>3</sub>TK. The constructs pTK, p(Bwt)<sub>3</sub>TK and p(BmutPU.1)<sub>3</sub>TK were cotransfected with increasing amounts of the PU.1 expression vector pJ6-PU.1 into PU.1-negative NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). Transfected cells were assayed for luciferase activity. Results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref> show that the control pTK (lacking specific PU boxes) construct was moderately transactivated by PU.1 (up to 2.5-fold). This PU box-independent activation could be attributed to stimulation by PU.1 through other DNA sequences present in the pTK vector. Cotransfection of the PU.1 expression vector with the reporter construct containing three wild-type sites B [p(Bwt)<sub>3</sub>TK] resulted in a dose-dependent stimulation of the luciferase activity (up to 6.8-fold); thus, representing a 2.7-fold up-regulation when compared with the PU.1 response of the control pTK devoid of upstream site B PU boxes. This effect required an intact PU box in site B, because mutations in this motif [p(BmutPU.1)<sub>3</sub>TK] resulted in levels of PU.1-mediated transactivation similar to those obtained with the control pTK.</p><p>We conclude from these experiments that ectopic PU.1 protein has a site B PU box-dependent stimulatory effect on the heterologous TK promoter containing multiple upstream sites B. These results thus establish the functional significance of PU.1 through the PU box present in the HS7 site B and suggest that the transcriptional activity of the HS7 region is positively regulated by PU.1.</p></sec><sec><title>Ectopic expression of the Sp1 or Sp3 transcription factors up-regulates TK promoter activity through the HS7 Sp binding site</title><p>To examine whether Sp1 and/or Sp3 act through the HS7 GC-box, we produced synthetic reporter constructs in which multimerized copies of the wild-type or mutated HS7 Sp site were inserted upstream of the TK promoter into the pTK construct. The resulting plasmids were designated p(Spwt)<sub>3</sub>TK or p(Spmut)<sub>3</sub>TK, respectively. To examine the response of these reporter constructs to Sp1 and/or Sp3, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Schneider (SL2) cells (which unlike most mammalian cells lack endogenous Sp factors) were transiently cotransfected with each of them and increasing amounts of either the Sp1 or the Sp3 expression vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A and B</xref>, respectively), and then assayed for luciferase activity. The control pTK construct was moderately transactivated by Sp1 (up to 6.5-fold) and by Sp3 (up to 7.4-fold). Addition of three copies of the HS7 Sp site upstream of the TK promoter resulted in a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity by ectopically expressed Sp1 (up to 24.1-fold) and Sp3 (up to 65.1-fold); thus, representing a 3.7- and 8.8-fold up-regulation when compared with the Sp response of the control pTK devoid of upstream HS7 Sp sites. Mutations in the HS7 Sp sites reversed the activating response to Sp1 and Sp3 to the luciferase activities obtained with the control vector pTK [see p(Spmut)<sub>3</sub>TK in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A and B</xref>]. Moreover, the coexpression of Sp1 and Sp3 together in equal amounts on each TK reporter constructs had no more effect than either factor transfected alone (data not shown).</p><p>We conclude from these experiments that ectopic Sp1 and Sp3 proteins have a HS7 Sp site-dependent stimulatory effect on the heterologous TK promoter containing multiple upstream HS7 Sp sites. The ability of the concatemerized HS7 Sp site to confer transactivation by ectopically expressed Sp1 and Sp3 in a heterologous context suggests that Sp1 and Sp3 are direct contributors to the transcriptional enhancing activity of the HS7 region.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>The HS7 binding sites are critical for HIV-1 infectivity</title><p>To address the biological significance of the HS7 binding sites in the HIV-1 life cycle, we tested the effect of mutations abolishing factor binding to the different sites (sites B, C, Sp and D) on HIV-1 replication in infection experiments with wild-type and mutant HIV-1 infectious viruses. To this end, mutations of each site were introduced in combination into an infectious clone of HIV-1. <italic>In vitro</italic> site-directed mutagenesis of the DNA-binding sites was performed with a plasmid (pCV10) containing the ApaI (nt 2011)/EcoRI (nt 5743) fragment of the NL4-3 HIV-1 genome and oligonucleotides containing the mutated sites as described in Materials and Methods. After site-directed mutagenesis and confirmation of the mutations by sequencing, the fragment (ApaI/EcoRI) containing the mutations was subcloned back into the corresponding restriction sites of the pCV1 plasmid. The resulting mutant plasmid was designated pCV426 (pHIV-1*-HS7totmut). As a control, the corresponding wild-type ApaI/EcoRI fragment was similarly cloned into pCV1 to generate pCV422 (pHIV-1*).</p><p>Wild-type and mutant HIV-1 infectious proviruses were generated from the single-LTR-containing constructs pCV422 and pCV426 by BamHI digestion and self-ligation. To obtain stocks of infectious viruses, these proviruses were transfected into Jurkat cells. Transfected cells were cocultivated with SupT1 cells for 1 day after transfection. Progeny virus production in coculture supernatants was then monitored by measuring the level of p24 gag antigen over a 15 day period. Cell-free supernatants were harvested at the peak of viral production to generate virus stocks for subsequent infectivity studies. To assess the possibility of reversion to a wild-type phenotype as an explanation for the growth of the mutant virus, HIV-1 genomic RNA from HIV-1*-HS7totmut virus stock was purified and analyzed by RT&#x02013;PCR with a primer pair that amplified a 640 bp intragenic portion of the genome (nt 4342&#x02013;4982) encompassing the mutated HS7 binding sites. PCR fragments were subcloned, and three individual clones were resequenced. This analysis confirmed the presence of the original mutations in the HS7 region (data not shown).</p><p>To study the effect of the HS7 mutations on HIV-1 growth kinetics, we infected either human CD4<sup>+</sup> T-lymphoid Jurkat or human promonocytic U937 cells with the wild-type (HIV-1*) and mutant (HIV-1*-HS7totmut) viral stocks. We performed at least three replication assays with the Jurkat T-cell line and with the U937 monocytic cell line by measuring p24 production over time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref> shows a representative replication curve for each cell line, which revealed differences in replication rate between the wild-type and the HS7 mutant viruses. Infection of Jurkat cells with the wild-type virus resulted in rapid and vigorous viral production, with p24 concentration reaching a peak on days 20&#x02013;25 post-infection, followed by a rapid decrease reflecting a rapid reduction in viable cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14A</xref>). Mutant virus HIV-1*-HS7totmut replicated with a replication kinetics that was similar to that of the wild-type control virus. However, infection of Jurkat cells with the mutant HIV-1*-HS7totmut virus produced lower p24 release (about two times less than the amount released from cultures infected with the wild-type HIV-1* at the peak of infection), demonstrating reduced growth properties. Similar results were obtained when the growth properties of the mutant HIV-1*-HS7totmut were assayed on the human promonocytic U937 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14B</xref>). These data are consistent with those obtained after transient expression assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><p>In order to further evaluate the effect of the HS7 mutations on HIV-1 replicative properties, we next introduced individually the mutations into the two-LTRs-containing infectious HIV-1 molecular clone pNL4-3. The wild-type and totally mutated proviruses were also generated in this context. The resulting proviruses were designated as pHIV-1, pHIV-1-HS7totmut, pHIV-1-HS7mutB/Oct, pHIV-1-HS7mutB/PU, pHIV-1-HS7mutC, pHIV-1-HS7mutSp, pHIV-1-HS7mutD and pHIV-1-HS7mutCmutB/Oct. Stocks of infectious viruses wild-type, totally mutated or containing the individual mutations were generated by transfection of 293T cells, were tested for the presence of the original muations by RT&#x02013;PCR and sequencing analyses, and were used in infection studies of Jurkat and U937 cells (see Materials and Methods). HIV-1 replication was monitored by measuring the production of p24 in the cell supernatants over a &#x0223c;15 day period. On the basis of their growth characteristics, the five individual and the double HS7 mutant viruses were classified into two replicative phenotypes.</p><p>In Jurkat cells, (i) mutant viruses HIV-1-HS7mutB/Oct and HIV-1-HS7mutC replicated efficiently with replication kinetics similar to that of the wild-type control virus HIV-1, but with levels of viral production slightly lower than that of the control virus, indicating that the individual mutations of the octamer sequence either in site B or in site C slightly affected HIV-1 replication but not as strongly as the combination of all the HS7 mutations (compare with HIV-1-HS7totmut) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14B and C</xref>); and (ii) mutant viruses HIV-1-HS7mutB/PU, HIV-1-HS7mutCmutB/Oct, HIV-1-HS7mutSp and HIV-1-HS7mutD also replicated with a replication kinetics that was similar to that of the wild-type control virus. However, infection with these mutant viruses produced p24 release as low as the totally mutated virus, demonstrating reduced growth properties similar to those observed with HIV-1-HS7totmut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14C</xref>).</p><p>In U937 cells, (i) mutant viruses HIV-1-HS7mutB/Oct, HIV-1-HS7mutC, HIV-1-HS7mutCmutB/Oct and HIV-1-HS7mutD replicated efficiently with replication kinetics and levels of viral production that were similar to those of the wild-type control virus HIV-1, indicating that the individual mutations of the octamer sequence either in site B or in site C, the individual mutation of site D and the double mutation of the octamer sequences in both site B and site C did not affect HIV-1 replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14E</xref>); and (ii) mutant viruses HIV-1-HS7mutB/PU and HIV-1-HS7mutSp also replicated with a replication kinetics that was similar to that of the wild-type HIV-1. However, infection with these mutant viruses produced lower p24 release than the wild-type HIV-1, demonstrating reduced growth properties similar to those observed with HIV-1-HS7totmut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14F</xref>).</p><p>Further infection of target cells in a second round with supernatants collected 15 days after the first infection indicated that all the HS7 mutant viruses were not impaired in terms of infectivity (data not shown).</p><p>Thus, the integrity of the HS7 DNA-binding sites located 5 kb downstream of the HIV-1 transcription start site is important for HIV-1 replication in human CD4<sup>+</sup> cell lines, indicating a positive regulatory function for this region. Our findings strongly suggest a crucial role of the HS7 Sp and PU.1 sites on HIV-1 replication.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutations in the HS7 binding sites do not affect the integrity of the viral particles</title><p>Although mutations in the HS7 region are not expected to impair HIV-1 RNA packaging, we performed RNase protection assays to quantify viral RNA from equal amounts of viral particles from the wild-type and each HS7 mutant virus stocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15A</xref>). This experiment showed that the wild-type and mutant viruses contained the same amount of packaged genomic RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15A</xref>). Moreover, we also analyzed the amount of HIV-1-specific proteins in the wild-type and each HS7 mutant virus stock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15B</xref>). To this end, lysates from equal amounts of p24 from the wild-type and mutant virus stocks were prepared, and western blot analyses were performed with purified human anti-HIV-1 IgG as a source of antibody. Similar levels of the HIV-1 proteins (including the integrase which is partially encoded by the HS7 region) were detected in all lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15B</xref>).</p><p>These results demonstrate that the reduced replication phenotypes we observed with the HIV-1 HS7 mutant viruses are due neither to a defect in RNA packaging nor to a defect in the protein content of viral particles. Thus, mutant and wild-type HIV-1 particles from the viral stocks used in the infection studies are structurally undistinguishable at both the genomic RNA and the protein levels, suggesting an effect of the mutations in the HS7 <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements at the level of HIV-1 transcription.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have previously identified and physically characterized a new positive transcriptional regulatory element associated with a DNase I-hypersensitive site (HS7) present in the <italic>pol</italic> gene of HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). A fragment encompassing this hypersensitive site positively regulates transcription from the HIV-1 5&#x02032;-LTR in transient transfection experiments. Several recognition sites for nuclear proteins (sites B, C, D and a GC-box) have been identified by <italic>in vitro</italic> binding studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). In this study, we have further physically characterized each of these four binding sites located in the HS7 region and have shown that the transcription factors Oct-1, Oct-2, PU.1, Sp1 and Sp3 interact <italic>in vitro</italic> with this region. Other <italic>in vitro</italic> binding studies have also shown that Tat expression does not affect the binding of the nuclear factors to the HS7 binding sites. Furthermore, ChIP assays have revealed that Sp1, Sp3, Oct-1 and PU.1 are recruited <italic>in vivo</italic> to the HS7 intragenic region of HIV-1 proviruses integrated in several infected cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16</xref>). For each of the four sites (sites B, Sp, C and D), we have identified point mutations abolishing binding of the nuclear factors to their cognate DNA sites without altering the underlying amino acid sequence of the integrase. By transient transfection assays, we have demonstrated the functional involvement of the HS7 binding sites in the transcriptional enhancing activity of the <italic>pol</italic> gene region. We have next examined the functional transcriptional role of each site separately in a heterologous context. Our results with multimerized wild-type and mutated HS7 binding sites in isolation (i.e. in the absence of the other DNA-binding sites) have demonstrated that the PU.1, Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors, on one hand, and the Oct-1 and Oct-2 transcription factors, on the other hand, up- and down-regulate, respectively, the transcriptional activity of the minimal TK promoter. Finally, we have addressed the biological significance of the HS7 binding sites in the HIV-1 replication cycle by mutating these sites individually or in combination in the context of infectious clones of HIV-1. These mutations do not affect the integrity of the viral particles both at the genomic RNA and the protein levels. Our infection studies have demonstrated that the HS7 sites located 5 kb downstream of the HIV-1 transcription start site are important for HIV-1 replication in human CD4<sup>+</sup> cell lines, indicating a positive regulatory function for <italic>pol</italic> intragenic region.</p><sec><title>Functional role of the HS7 transcription factor binding sites</title><sec><title>Octamer binding sites</title><p>By <italic>in vitro</italic> binding studies, we have demonstrated that the HS7 sites B and C specifically bind the octamer proteins Oct-1 and Oct-2. In addition, we have shown by ChIP assays the binding of the Oct-1 protein to the HS7 region <italic>in vivo</italic> both in the HIV-1 latently infected T-lymphoid cell line ACH2 and in the monocytic cell line U1. Octamer binding proteins belong to the POU homeodomain transcription factor family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Two of the best characterized octamer binding proteins are Oct-1 and Oct-2. Whereas the Oct-1 protein is ubiquitously expressed, Oct-2 is expressed predominantly in the B-cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). However, Oct-2 expression can be induced by antigenic stimulation of T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>), suggesting that the Oct-2 protein may play a role in gene expression during T-cell activation. Oct-1 is a broadly expressed and versatile transcription factor performing many divergent roles in cellular and viral transcriptional regulation and acting both as a repressor and as an activator of transcription [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>)].</p><p>Using transient transfection assays, we have shown that ectopically expressed Oct-1 and Oct-2 repress the transcriptional activity of the minimal TK promoter through the HS7 sites B and C. However, our infection experiments using viruses mutated in the octamer sequences of site B and/or site C are not consistent with a repressive effect mediated by these sites. Indeed, in U937 cells, the individual mutations of the octamer sequences either in site B or in site C as well as the double mutation of the octamer sequences in both site B and site C do not affect HIV-1 replication. In Jurkat cells, the individual Oct mutations slightly reduce the levels of viral production relative to those observed with the wild-type virus, whereas the mutant virus containing the double Oct mutation demonstrates more severely reduced growth properties similar to those observed with the totally mutated virus HIV-1-HS7totmut. Different hypotheses can be drawn to explain these discrepancies between our <italic>ex vivo</italic> transfection and <italic>in vivo</italic> infection results. First, assays using synthetic reporter constructs with multimerized binding sites may not be representative of the regulation, which takes place in the complete regulatory HS7 region and involves interactions between proteins binding to adjacent elements. A second possible explanation is that, in our <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies, the vectors containing the mutations in the octamer sequences are transfected in cells which do not express Oct-1/Oct-2, the nuclear T-lymphoid factors B3/C3 or the PU.1 protein. In contrast, the Jurkat or U937 cells used in the infection studies contain Oct-1 and B3/C3 or Oct-1 and PU.1, respectively, thereby representing a more complex biological system. Third, transient transfection experiments may not reflect the regulation found <italic>in vivo</italic> with the intact provirus since transiently transfected DNA is not assembled into physiological chromatin. Similar discrepancies between transient transfection studies and <italic>in vivo</italic> functional studies have been previously reported for HIV by different groups including our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). More specifically, regarding the HS7 Oct binding sites, the functional effect of the individual mutations in site B/Oct or site C/Oct could compensate each other; and the functional effect of the combined mutation site B/Oct+site C/Oct could be compensated by other factors binding to the HS7 region and still unidentified. In Jurkat cells, mutation of the octamer sequence of site B or site C does abolish not only the binding of Oct-1, but also the binding of the T-cell-specific factor B3/C3, which makes impossible to functionally distinguish in infection studies between the role of Oct-1 and the role of the T-cell factor. In U937 cells, mutation in the octamer sequence of site B abolishes the binding of Oct-1 but not the binding of PU.1. However, we can not exclude the possibility that the mutation of the Oct sequence might affect the binding of PU.1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Indeed, our <italic>in vitro</italic> binding studies suggest that the binding of these two proteins to site B is mutually exclusive.</p><p>We have demonstrated that the PU.1 protein, which binds to site B, activates the transcriptional activity of the TK promoter through the HS7 site B. Therefore, in monocytes/macophages, the competition between Oct-1 and PU.1 both expressed in these cells for binding to their respective overlapping cognate sequences in the HS7 site B could determine the global contribution of site B to the transcriptional activity of the <italic>pol</italic> intragenic region. In T-cells, in which PU.1 is not expressed, such a competition between Oct-1 and the T-cell-specific factor (B3/C3) could similarly takes place in both site B and site C and could therefore determine the contribution of these two sites to the HS7 transcriptional activity. Previous publications have reported links between the Oct-1 protein and the HIV-1 transcriptional regulation. Indeed, Liu and Latchman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>) have previously identified four potential Oct binding sites in the HIV-1 LTR. In this latter study, Oct-1 has been shown to repress HIV-1 LTR promoter activity and its transactivation by Tat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). A more recent study contrasts with the latter one and demonstrates that Oct-1 and Oct-2 fail to bind the HIV-1 LTR, and that overexpression of Oct proteins has no effect on HIV-1 transcription or replication in primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). Interestingly, the role of Oct-1 in HIV-1 transcription has also been indirectly highlighted by Bahr and co-workers. They have demonstrated that murabutide, which is a clinically acceptable immunomodulator presenting the capacity to decrease HIV-1 transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>), presents the ability to induce Oct-1 expression and DNA-binding activity in HIV-1 infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). These results suggest that the murabutide-induced suppression of HIV-1 transcription could be mediated, at least in part, by its capacity to increase Oct-1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). In the present study, we have demonstrated that the HIV-1 HS7 sites B and C bind Oct-1 and Oct-2 and confer transrepression by ectopically expressed Oct-1 and Oct-2 in reporter gene assays. Therefore, these results suggest that the murabutide-induced repression of HIV-1 transcription reported by Darcissac <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>) could be correlated to its capacity to increase the expression of Oct-1 and its subsequent binding to the HS7 sites B and C. Thus, further exploration of the role of Oct transcription factors in the activity of the HIV-1 LTR are warranted. Moreover, it would be interesting to study the relative contribution of the debated LTR Oct sites and of the HS7 Oct sites identified in this report to HIV-1 transcriptional regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>PU box binding site</title><p>We have demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> that the HS7 site B is specifically bound by the PU.1 protein. PU.1 is an ETS family transcription factor that is highly expressed in B-lymphocytes, myeloid cells and immature erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). PU.1 binding motifs are found in a large number of B-lymphoid, myeloid and erythroid cell specific transcription elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). Using transient transfection assays, we have demonstrated that ectopic PU.1 protein has a site B PU box-dependent stimulatory effect on the heterologous TK promoter containing multiple upstream sites B. Consistently, we have demonstrated by infection studies in U937 cells that virus mutated in the HS7 site B PU box presents reduced growth kinetics when compared with a wild-type virus, thereby supporting the notion that PU.1 positively regulates the transcriptional activity of the HS7 region. The individual mutation of the site B PU box also reduces the efficiency of HIV-1 replication in the PU.1-negative Jurkat T cell line. It is worth noting that, although our EMSA experiments did not allow us to demonstrate in T-cells the binding of proteins to the PU box, we cannot exclude the possibility that this motif might be occupied by another protein <italic>in vivo</italic>. Another possible explanation is that some bases in the PU box could be important for the recruitment of co-factors for the Oct-1 protein whose binding sequence in site B is located just next to the PU box motif.</p><p>DNA regulatory regions in eukaryotic genomes frequently adopt a nuclease-hypersensitive configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). This hypersensitivity is thought to result from the disruption of the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes by DNA-bound regulatory proteins. The absence of a hypersensitive site in the <italic>pol</italic> gene of HIV-1 integrated in two chronically infected T-cell lines (ACH2 and 8E5) could be due to differences in nucleotide sequence among HIV-1 isolates or to the presence of different regulatory factors in different cell types (lymphoid versus monocyte/macrophage cells). It is also possible that the <italic>pol</italic> region is nucleosome free in ACH2 and 8E5 cells but is occupied by bound factors in such a way as to adopt a configuration resistant to nuclease digestion. The ChIP assays reported here provide additional information on this issue and support the latter possibility. Indeed, these assays demonstrate the recruitment of Oct-1, Sp1 and Sp3 to the HS7 region <italic>in vivo</italic> both in T-lymphoid (ACH2) and in monocytic (U1) HIV-1-infected cells. Moreover, we have shown by ChIP assays that, in addition to Oct-1, Sp1 and Sp3, PU.1 also occupies the HS7 region in U1 cells and could therefore be involved in the nuclease hypersensitivity of the intragenic region in these cells. Indeed, studies on the B-cell-specific &#x003bc; and &#x003ba;3&#x02032; enhancers have shown that PU.1 is involved in chromatin remodeling events by functioning in some contexts as an accessibility factor (i.e. a protein capable of binding its site in the repressive context of chromatin, thereby increasing accessibility of the region) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). Therefore, the presence in the <italic>pol</italic> gene of HIV-1 of a regulatory region containing a binding site for the macrophage and B-cell-specific factor PU.1 and associated with a monocyte-specific nuclease hypersensitive site suggests that PU.1 could act through the HS7 site B as an accessibility factor triggering the open chromatin configuration in the <italic>pol</italic> region. Further work including mutation and <italic>in vitro</italic> chromatin reconstruction studies is needed to investigate this hypothesis.</p><p>Although previous studies have demonstrated that the HIV-1 macrophage tropism is primarily determined at the level of the entry, several reports have highlighted additional determinants of macrophage tropism present at the level of transcription. Indeed, two motifs located in the HIV-1 LTR bind members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors and are required for virus replication in macrophages, but not T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). The tropism of other viruses for their target cells is determined in part at the transcriptional level. In murine leukemia viruses, a switch in tropism to T-cells was found to be caused by alterations in the U3 region of the LTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>). The enhancer element of lymphotropic papovavirus, which contains a PU box required for its activity, contributes to the restricted tropism of the virus for primate B lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>). The LTR enhancer of all known virulent strains of the equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) contains three Ets binding motifs that interact with the transcription factor PU.1 and that are necessary for viral transcription in primary macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>). Finally, our laboratory has identified a functional PU box in the bovine leukemia virus LTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Sp binding site</title><p>We have demonstrated by <italic>in vitro</italic> binding experiments that the HS7 GC-box is specifically bound by the Sp1 and Sp3 proteins. The recruitment of both proteins to the <italic>pol</italic> region was also demonstrated <italic>in vivo</italic> in the ACH2 and U1 cell lines. Using transient transfection assays, we have shown that ectopically expressed Sp1 and Sp3 have a positive effect on a luciferase reporter plasmid containing three copies of the HS7 Sp site cloned upstream of the heterologous promoter TK. <italic>In vivo</italic>, we have shown that the mutant virus containing the mutation in the HS7 Sp site demonstrates a reduced replicative phenotype similar to that observed with the totally mutated virus HIV-1-HS7totmut, thereby indicating a positive regulatory function of the Sp site.</p><p>The Sp family of transcription factors comprises eight members (Sp1&#x02013;Sp8) [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>)]. The most studied members of the Sp family, Sp1 and Sp3, are ubiquitously expressed but also fulfil distinct functions, as has been indicated by gene ablation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>). Sp1 is often described as a general activator of transcription, whereas Sp3 can act as an activator or as a repressor of Sp1-mediated activation, depending on the sequence context, the number of Sp binding sites and the availability of specific coactivators, corepressors or other transcription factors. However, the interplay between Sp1 and Sp3 in the regulation of specific promoters and the way the cells used the combination of these two related transcription factors to regulate gene expression is not clear. In this study, we have demonstrated that both Sp1 and Sp3 proteins have a HS7 Sp site-dependent stimulatory effect in the context of a heterologous promoter. In some systems including the HIV-1 LTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>), Sp3 has been shown to cause repression of Sp1-mediated transcriptional activation. However, we could not observe such an inhibitory activity for TK transcription as shown in <italic>Drosophila</italic> SL2 cells transfected with both the Sp1 and Sp3 expression vectors (data not shown). Such a lack of repression of Sp1-mediated transcriptional activation by Sp3 has been previously reported for the IL-10 promoter regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>).</p><p>The Sp1 protein has been shown to mediate the formation of DNA loops between Sp1 proteins bound at two different sites on a DNA molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>). This DNA bending induced by Sp1 may play a direct role in the activation of transcription by bringing together factors bound at non-adjacent sites or facilitating binding of factors involved in the formation of an initiation complex. The presence of three tandemly arranged Spl sites in the HIV-1 5&#x02032;-LTR and of one Spl site in the <italic>pol</italic> nuclease-hypersensitive site suggests a putative interaction between these elements. Such an association could bring in close proximity other factors bound to the 5&#x02032;-LTR and to the <italic>pol</italic> regulatory element, and this arrangement could play a role in transcriptional regulation of the HIV-1 promoter. Similarly, Sp protein interactions could take place between the <italic>pol</italic> Sp site and the two juxtaposed Sp1 binding sites previously identified by our laboratory in the leader region positive transcriptional regulatory element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Site D</title><p>We have previously published that site D specifically binds an ubiquitously expressed factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). In this report, despite many <italic>in silico</italic> and experimental attempts, we were unable to identify the factor(s) binding to site D. However, we have demonstrated that the binding of the ubiquitously expressed protein(s) to site D is Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent. This observation suggests that this (these) protein(s) could contain zinc finger domain(s). Our infection studies have demonstrated that a virus mutated in the HS7 site D replicates as efficiently as the wild-type control virus in the monocytic cell line U937. In contrast, in Jurkat T cells, the same mutant virus demonstrates reduced growth properties similar to those of the totally mutated virus HIV-1-HS7totmut, thereby demonstrating <italic>in vivo</italic> the biological significance of this site in the HIV-1 life cycle.</p><p>Since complex D is ubiquitous, this difference in terms of replication between the two cell types cannot be attributed to the presence or the absence of the D factor(s) in one cell line. However, numerous explanations have been proposed to explain how a ubiquitously expressed factor can participate in lineage-specific gene regulation. For instance, limited access of the ubiquitous factor to its cognate DNA sequence or post-translational modifications of the factors, such as phosphorylation, acetylation and glycosylation, have been reported as important for tissue-specific regulation. Moreover, protein&#x02013;protein interactions between ubiquitous and cell-specific transcription factors could also contribute to cell type-specific transcriptional control.</p><p>We have thus demonstrated an important physiological role of the <italic>pol</italic> region in HIV-1 replication. The growth properties of a virus containing combined mutations abolishing nuclear factor binding to all the HS7 sites (site B, Sp site, site C and site D) are reduced when compared with those of a wild-type HIV-1. This reduced replicative phenotype is observed both in the Jurkat T-cell line and in the U937 monocyte/macrophage cell line and is indicative of a positive regulatory function for the <italic>pol</italic> intragenic region. No defect in RNA-packaging and no defect in the protein content of viral particles could be measured for any of the mutant viruses as determined by quantification of their HIV genomic RNA (by RNAse protection assay) and as determined by western blotting analysis, respectively. Therefore, our results suggest that the reduced replicative phenotypes of the HS7 mutant viruses are due to a decreased level of transcription as the result of point mutations in the HS7 region and that the <italic>cis</italic>-acting DNA elements we identified here, within this region, are required for optimal LTR transcriptional activity. Consistent with this hypothesis, our findings indicate that the loss of transcriptional enhancing activity of the <italic>pol</italic> regulatory region and the reduced replicative phenotype of HIV-1 caused by mutations in the HS7 binding sites correlate with the loss in factor binding to these sites.</p><p>Why does HIV-1 need two enhancers? During the course of infection, HIV-1 has to replicate in different cell types which can present various activation states. The presence of different transcriptional regulatory elements in the viral genome may suggest a viral strategy to be productive across several cellular environments with large differences in the pool of transcription factors. Indeed, it is estimated that more than 2000 transcription factors are encoded by the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref>). These factors are not equally expressed in all cell types, and many can be activated at specific stages of the cell developmental programme. The transcriptional environment of HIV-1 is therefore multidimensional, as the pool of transcription factors varies both temporally and spatially. Therefore, the redundancy and overlap in the transcription factor binding sites found in the HIV-1 genome could represent a solution for the virus to ensure its replication in several cellular environments. Our results demonstrate that the HS7 region is composed of multiple factor binding sites; some of these factors are ubiquitously expressed (Oct-1, Sp1/Sp3 and complex D), whereas others are cell-specific factors (PU.1, T-cell complexes B3/C3), supporting the notion that the HS7 transcriptional activity is determined by a combinatorial control: the combined action of tissue-restricted and ubiquitously expressed proteins. The HS7 regulatory region described in this report could either bring additional cellular specificity, or increase the strength of the promoter/enhancer unit located in the HIV-1 LTR, or allow viral responses to a broader variety of exogenous stimuli. Other viruses have been shown to possess intragenic regulatory regions. For example, the presence of two enhancer regions contributing to transcriptional regulation by adding a cellular specificity has been previously reported for the human hepatitis B virus and the closely related woodchuck hepatitis virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">74</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the <italic>pol</italic> positive <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory element located in the transcribed region of the HIV-1 genome brings an additional factor in an already complex network of regulators affecting the level of HIV-1 replication. Such a complexity could allow a finer-tuned regulation than a simple &#x02018;On/Off&#x02019; switching mechanism; this fine-tuning might find its purpose when HIV-1 transcription needs to be moderately and/or transiently modified.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Guntram Suske (Philipps-Universitat, Marburg, Germany), Dr Winship Herr (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York, USA), Dr Ron Prywes (Columbia University, New York, USA) and Dr John Schwarz (University of Texas Medical School, Houston, USA) for reagents used in this study.

NIH3T3 cells were transiently cotransfected with 500 ng of either pTK, or p(Bwt)<sub>3</sub>TK or p(BmutPU.1)<sub>3</sub>TK and with increasing amounts (0, 100, 250 and 500 ng) of the PU.1 expression vector, pJ6-PU.1. To maintain the same amount of transfected DNA and to avoid squelching artifacts, the different amounts of PU.1 expression vector cotransfected were complemented to 500 ng of DNA by using the empty pJ6 vector. Luciferase activities were measured in cell lysates 44 h after transfection and were normalized with respect to protein concentrations of the lysates. Results are presented as histograms indicating the induction by PU.1 (in fold) with respect to the activity of each TK reporter construct in the absence of PU.1, which was assigned a value of 1.
