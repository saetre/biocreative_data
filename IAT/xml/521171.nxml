To investigate the role of DJ-1 in the oxidative stress response in vivo, DJ-1-deficient knockout and heterozygous ES cell clones were analyzed for cell viability in the context of increasing concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Heterozygous cells were used as controls because the knockout subclones were derived from these.

Therefore, we quantified the accumulation of ROS in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment in knockout and heterozygous cells using the ROS-sensitive fluorescent indicator dye dihydrorhodamine-123 (DHR) and FACS analysis. Initial ROS accumulation (at 15 min after stimulation) appeared unaltered in the DJ-1-deficient cells in comparison to control heterozygous cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020327-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). Consistent with this, accumulation of protein carbonyls, an index of oxidative damage to proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020327-Sherer1">Sherer et al. 2002</xref>), appeared normal initially (at 1 h after toxin exposure; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020327-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). However, at 6 h after toxin exposure, a point at which knockout cells already display increased apoptosis (as indicated by PARP cleavage; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020327-g001">Figure 1</xref>G), protein carbonyl accumulation was robustly increased in the DJ-1-deficient cells. These data suggest that initial ROS accumulation is not altered by DJ-1 deficiency, but that the mutant cells are unable to appropriately cope with the consequent damage. Consistent with this result, no antioxidant or peroxiredoxin activity with purified DJ-1 protein in vitro was detected (S.S. and A.A., personal communication).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>DJ-1 Is Required for Survival of ES Cell&#x02013;Derived DNs</title><p>Several methods have been established for the differentiation of ES cells into DNs in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020327-Morizane1">Morizane et al. 2002</xref>).

Production of DNs appeared to be significantly reduced in knockout ES cell cultures compared to parental heterozygous cultures at 18 days in vitro (DIV) as determined by both dopamine uptake and TH immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020327-g003">Figures 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020327-g003">3</xref>C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020327-g004">4</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020327-g004">4</xref>L).

To investigate whether the reduction in DNs in DJ-1-deficient cultures is due to defective generation or survival, a time course analysis was performed. At early time points (8 and 12 DIV), dopamine uptake activity was comparable in WT and DJ-1-deficient cultures, whereas subsequently the DJ-1-deficient cultures appeared defective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020327-g003">Figure 3</xref>F). Consistent with this, intracellular dopamine accumulation (as quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography) was significantly reduced in DJ-1-deficient cultures (6.4 &#x000b1; 1.5 ng dopamine/mg protein) relative to control heterozygous cultures (66.0 &#x000b1; 17.4 ng/mg) at 35 DIV. These data strongly suggest that DJ-1 deficiency leads to loss of DNs, rather than simply to downregulation of cell marker expression.</p><p>We hypothesized that DJ-1-deficient DNs may be sensitized to oxidative stress, akin to DJ-1-deficient undifferentiated ES cells. To test this, DN cultures from DJ-1-deficient or heterozygous control ES cell cultures at 9 DIV were exposed to oxidative stress in the form of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), a DN-specific toxin that enters DNs through the dopamine transporter and leads to oxidative stress and apoptotic death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020327-Dauer1">Dauer and Przedborski 2003</xref>). DJ-1-deficient DNs displayed an increased sensitivity to oxidative stress in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020327-g003">Figure 3</xref>G). Post-hoc analysis of the data indicates that the difference among genotypes is maximal at an intermediate dose of toxin (50 &#x003bc;M); at the highest dose of 6-OHDA employed (100 &#x003bc;M), the difference is lessened (because the heterozygote is increasingly affected as well), indicating that DJ-1-mediated protection is limited. Although we cannot exclude a role for DJ-1 in the late-stage differentiation of DNs, these data suggest that DJ-1 deficiency leads to reduced DN survival and predisposes these cells to endogenous and exogenous toxic insults.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>RNAi &#x0201c;Knockdown&#x0201d; of DJ-1 in Midbrain Embryonic DNs Leads to Increased Sensitivity to Oxidative Stress</title><p>To confirm the role of DJ-1 in primary midbrain DNs, DJ-1 expression was inhibited by RNA interference (RNAi) in embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) murine primary midbrain cultures by lentiviral transduction of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020327-g005">Figure 5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020327-Rubinson1">Rubinson et al. 2003</xref>).

After 7 DIV, cultures were exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 24 h and then evaluated for DN survival as quantified by immunostaining for TH and dopamine transporter (DAT).</p><p>Midbrain cultures transduced with <italic>DJ-1</italic> shRNA virus and with control vector displayed similar numbers of TH-positive neurons in the absence of exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020327-g005">Figure 5</xref>A&#x02013;D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020327-g005">5</xref>I&#x02013;L, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020327-g005">5</xref>R&#x02013;S). In contrast, in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, DJ-1-deficient cultures displayed significantly reduced DN survival as quantified by immunohistochemistry for TH or DAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020327-g005">Figure 5</xref>E&#x02013;H, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020327-g005">5</xref>M&#x02013;P, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020327-g005">5</xref>R&#x02013;S). These studies were repeated three times with similar results. The reduction in DAT immunoreactivity appears to be more robust than the reduction in TH-positive cell number in the context of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>; this may reflect the differential localization of DAT to DN processes, whereas TH is primarily in the cell body. As we described in a previous manuscript, nondopaminergic cells in the E13.5 primary midbrain cultures are predominantly GABAergic neurons (90&#x00025;&#x02013;95&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020327-Staropoli1">Staropoli et al. 2003</xref>). Total embryonic midbrain neurons transduced with either <italic>DJ-1</italic> shRNA or vector displayed comparable survival in the context of toxin exposure, suggesting that DJ-1 deficiency leads to a relatively specific alteration in DN survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020327-g005">Figure 5</xref>T). These data are consistent with the analyses of ES cell&#x02013;derived DNs above and indicate that DJ-1 is required for the normal survival of midbrain DNs in the context of toxin exposure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we present evidence that DJ-1 is an essential component of the oxidative stress response of DNs. DJ-1-deficient cells display an apparently normal initial burst of ROS in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, but they are unable to cope with the consequent toxicity, culminating in apoptosis. Additionally, we find that DJ-1 deficiency sensitizes cells to the proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin but not other toxic stimuli such as tunicamycin. Proteasomal inhibition induces the accumulation of short-lived and misfolded cytoplasmic proteins, leading to oxidative stress and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020327-Demasi1">Demasi and Davies 2003</xref>). ROS and proteasomal inhibition have previously been correlated with PD pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020327-Dauer1">Dauer and Przedborski 2003</xref>), and it is therefore tempting to hypothesize that <italic>DJ-1</italic> mutations lead to PD because of an increased sensitivity to such stressors.</p><p>The apparent cell-type specificity of DN impairment in patients with the Parkinsonism-associated <italic>DJ-1</italic> mutation is not predicted by the ubiquitous expression of DJ-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020327-Nagakubo1">Nagakubo et al. 1997</xref>). In this study, we find that DJ-1 protects both dopaminergic and nondopaminergic cells from oxidative insult. However, DJ-1-deficient DNs appear to be especially sensitive to oxidative insult, suggesting relative cell-type specificity to the consequences of DJ-1 deficiency. Similar results are observed in DJ-1-knockout ES cell&#x02013;derived DNs (which are devoid of any detectable DJ-1) and in primary DNs with DJ-1 levels reduced by RNAi &#x0201c;knockdown.&#x0201d; However, we find that even in the absence of exogenous toxin exposure, the knockout ES cell&#x02013;derived DNs display reduced survival, whereas survival of the primary embryonic midbrain RNAi knockdown DNs appears to be similar to WT cells. We hypothesize that this discrepancy reflects the activity of residual DJ-1 (approximately 10&#x00025;&#x02013;20&#x00025;) in the RNAi knockdown cultures. Alternatively, the knockout ES cell&#x02013;derived DNs may be exposed to a greater degree of oxidative stress in vitro than are the knockdown-derived DNs even in the absence of added toxin. The mechanism by which DNs are preferentially targeted for destruction in the absence of DJ-1 is unclear. It has been proposed that DNs are subject to high levels of endogenous oxidative stress that may relate to dopamine metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020327-Jenner2">Jenner and Olanow 1998</xref>).</p><p>DJ-1 is structurally modified in the context of cellular oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020327-Mitsumoto1">Mitsumoto and Nakagawa 2001</xref>), suggesting a possible function. Two recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020327-Yokota1">Yokota et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020327-Taira1">Taira et al. 2004</xref>) investigated the role of DJ-1 in the oxidative stress response of neuroblastoma tumor cells. Both studies used RNAi to perturb the expression of DJ-1 in neuroblastoma tumor cell lines, and suggested that DJ-1 deficiency sensitizes cells to oxidative stress; these results are consistent with our data. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020327-Taira1">Taira et al. (2004)</xref> further reported that overexpression of DJ-1 in neuroblastoma cells leads to a reduction in ROS accumulation and hypothesized that DJ-1 may harbor antioxidant activity in vivo. In contrast, we find that ES cells that are deficient in DJ-1 display a normal initial burst of ROS in the context of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Consistent with this, we fail to detect DJ-1 antioxidant activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020327-Shendelman1">Shendelman et al. 2004</xref>).</p><p>Finally, this study presents a novel, ES cell-based genetic approach to the study of neurodegenerative disorders. Mouse genetic models of disease are often limited by the inherent variability of animal experiments, the limited mouse life span, and the difficulties in manipulating whole animals. For instance, genetic rescue experiments and toxicological dose-response studies are impractical in whole animals. Furthermore, genetic cell models are more readily amenable to molecular dissection of disease mechanisms than are whole animals. Thus, genetically altered, ES cell&#x02013;derived neurons are likely to be generally useful as cellular models of neurodegenerative disorders. Future studies may also utilize available human ES cells to investigate species differences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Cell culture.</title><p>Undifferentiated ES cells were cultured using standard techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020327-Abeliovich1">Abeliovich et al. 2000</xref>).
