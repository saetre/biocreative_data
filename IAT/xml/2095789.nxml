To understand how Sox10 expression is regulated during development, we analysed the potential of evolutionary conserved non-coding sequences in the <italic>Sox10</italic> genomic region to function as enhancers. By linking these sequences to a &#x003b2;-galactosidase marker gene under the control of a minimal promoter, five regulatory regions were identified that direct marker gene expression in transgenic mice to Sox10 expressing cell types and tissues in a defined temporal pattern. These possible enhancers of the <italic>Sox10</italic> gene mediate Sox10 expression in the otic vesicle, in oligodendrocytes and in several neural crest derivatives including the developing peripheral nervous system and the adrenal gland. They furthermore exhibit overlapping activities and share binding sites for Sox, Lef/Tcf, Pax and AP2 transcription factors. This may explain high level and robustness of Sox10 expression during embryonic development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The transcription factor Sox10 is an important, pleiotropic regulator of neural crest and oligodendrocyte development in all vertebrate species so far analysed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7">1&#x02013;7</xref>). It functions in stem cell maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), in several specification events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and during later phases of cell lineage progression including terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>).</p><p>Much sparser is the information about the factors that determine the spatiotemporal expression pattern of Sox10. In the neural crest, Sox10 expression is under the control of several extrinsic signals, such as BMPs, Wnts and FGFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). With regards to intrinsic signals, there is evidence that the related transcription factor Sox9 as well as FoxD3 are genetically upstream of Sox10 in the neural crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), while Sox9 and Olig2 appear to be involved in Sox10 gene induction in cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16">14&#x02013;16</xref>). Whether these transcription factors influence Sox10 expression directly, is not clear at the moment and requires the identification of <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequences in the <italic>Sox10</italic> genomic region.</p><p>BAC transgenic studies have shown that a genomic region encompassing &#x0223c;65 kb upstream as well as 55 kb downstream of the Sox10 gene are sufficient to reproduce the main features of Sox10 expression during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Most of the important <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements furthermore appear to be localized in enhancers rather than the promoter region as the promoter failed to direct marker gene expression to most of the typical Sox10 expression sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>The fact that coding exons and intervening introns could be removed from the <italic>Sox10</italic> locus without significant alterations of the embryonic Sox10 expression pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) argues that the major enhancers are localized to extragenic rather than intragenic regions. The existence of at least two such enhancers was recently proven in transgenic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Fortuitous deletion of genomic sequences from a <italic>Sox10</italic>-containing BAC transgene showed that important enhancer activity was localized in a 20&#x02013;30 kb genomic interval upstream of the <italic>Sox10</italic> promoter sequences and that this enhancer activity was strengthened by a second activity located in a 25&#x02013;35 kb region further upstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The latter region overlaps with a 16 kb deletion 47 kb upstream of the Sox10 gene which was generated by random insertion of a transgene into the <italic>Sox10</italic> genomic region and had been found to cause partial depigmentation and colonic aganglionosis in the corresponding mouse mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Using bioinformatics, both studies have also detected several highly conserved sequence elements within the respective genomic intervals and postulated that these elements may possess enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). None of these elements has, however, been tested for its activity in the developing mouse embryo, and only one (alternatively named DCHCS-1 and MCS6) has been experimentally studied in cell culture and found to have enhancer activity in cultured melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use mouse transgenesis to identify enhancer activity of evolutionary conserved non-coding sequences in the <italic>Sox10</italic> genomic region <italic>in vivo</italic>. We have focused on those non-coding sequences that are conserved among amniotes and at the same time located in the genomic interval previously shown to be sufficient for the major aspects of Sox10 expression. Some of these sequences indeed functioned as cell type-specific enhancers and are good candidates for <italic>bona fide cis</italic>-acting gene regulatory elements of the <italic>Sox10</italic> gene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Construction of transgene and generation of transgenic animals</title><p>Evolutionary conserved sequences U1, U2, U3, U4, U5, D6 and D7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) were amplified with &#x0223c;0.15 kb flanking sequences on each side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) from 129 Sv mouse genomic DNA and inserted between SpeI and NotI sites of pBKS-hsp68-lacZ such that the evolutionary conserved sequences were placed immediately upstream of the hsp68-lacZ cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).

Many of these regions are located in the vicinity of genes that code for important developmental regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Taking into account that Sox10 is such an important regulator and that its functions are highly conserved in vertebrate embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), comparative genomics should be suited to identify the gene's regulatory regions.</p><p>We concentrated on the genomic interval previously shown by BAC transgenesis to reproduce the main features of embryonic Sox10 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Using the ECR browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ecrbrowser.dcode.org">http://ecrbrowser.dcode.org</ext-link>) and the human sequence as the base genome, we identified seven regions around the <italic>Sox10</italic> gene that exhibited a greater than 70% sequence identity over at least 100 bp in comparison with the chicken genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Five, termed U1&#x02013;U5, were localized in front of the <italic>Sox10</italic> gene, two, called D6 and D7, were behind the gene. U1 corresponds to MCS6/DCHCS-1 in previous studies, U2 to MCS4, U3 to MCS3 and U4 to MCS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). U5, D6 and D7 have not been described so far. Their length varied between 150 and 400 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). In comparisons between the mouse and chicken genome, these regions exhibited at least 67% identity over their whole length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6">Figures 1&#x02013;6</xref>). Between mouse and human genome, the sequence identity was greater than 89% and there was additional strong sequence conservation in the flanking sequences. Both the lower sequence conservation and the shorter length in evolutionary distant species as compared to evolutionary close species has similarly been observed in a previous whole genome study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). In contrast to this strong sequence conservation among mammals and between mammals and chicken, none of these regions exhibited a significant degree of conservation in Xenopus laevis, Danio rerio or Fugu rubripes. The conservation of the identified regions is thus restricted to amniotes. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Detection of &#x003b2;-galactosidase transgene expression in embryos at 9.5 and 11.5 d.p.c. &#x003b2;-Galactosidase activity was detected colorimetrically using X-gal substrate at 9.5 dpc (<bold>A</bold>&#x02013;<bold>H</bold>) and at 11.5 d.p.c.

(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). For all other Sox10 expressing tissues, &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining was visible in U3 transgenic embryos. In the trunk region, it appeared more intense than the corresponding staining for U1 transgenic embryos (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D with B). The frontonasal process was only weakly stained by &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity in U3 transgenic embryos. Notably, U3 transgenic embryos also exhibited &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining at several sites where Sox10 expression does not normally occur, including cells in the heart. However, even this ectopic &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining was highly reproducible between the different U3 transgenic lines.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene regulatory activities of the ECR in the Sox10 genomic region converge during mid-embryogenesis</title><p>At 11.5 d.p.c., expression of the various transgenes had undergone a number of significant changes. &#x003b2;-Galactosidase staining in the branchial arches and the frontonasal process was no longer visible in transgenic embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>J&#x02013;P).

This was particularly strong throughout the developing peripheral nervous system including ganglia as well as nerves. Intriguingly, the staining pattern for the U1, U2, U3 and D6 transgenic embryos resembled each other much more than they did at earlier times arguing that these four evolutionary conserved non-coding sequences overlap significantly in their gene regulatory activity at this embryonic age.</p><p>Nevertheless, closer inspection revealed minor, but clear differences among U1, U2, U3 and D6 transgenic embryos. Compared to U1, U3 and D6 transgenic embryos, U2 transgenic embryos had consistently lower &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining in the cranial ganglia (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>K with J, L and O). U1 and U2 transgenic embryos furthermore exhibited intense &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining in both DRG and nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>J and K), whereas staining in U3 transgenic embryos was more pronounced along the nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>L). D6 transgenic embryos in contrast showed preferential &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining in DRG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>O). Significant expression in cells of the enteric nervous system was only observed for the U1 and U3 transgenes.</p><p>Expression in the otic vesicle was consistent with observations on 9.5 d.p.c. in that U2 and U3 transgenic embryos did not exhibit &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining in this structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>K and L). For U1 transgenic embryos, &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining in the otic vesicle was still detectable but much less pronounced than at 9.5 d.p.c. arguing that U1 activity is already downregulated at 11.5 d.p.c. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>J). D6 activity, in contrast, was still high according to the strong &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining in D6 transgenic embryos at 11.5 d.p.c.

Additional U5 expression was observed in the dorsal spinal cord. Although also detected in D6 transgenic embryos (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>N with O), the dorsal spinal cord is not a main expression site of Sox10.</p><p>U4 and D7 transgenic embryos, in contrast, failed to produce any &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining under standard staining procedures. Even under significantly prolonged staining times, no &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity was detectable in D7 transgenic embryos at 11.5 d.p.c. or any other earlier or later time during embryonic development including 18.5 d.p.c. This was also the case for embryos derived from five out of seven U4 transgenic lines. In contrast, embryos from one U4 transgenic line developed weak midline staining, whereas embryos from yet another U4 founder showed blood vessel staining upon extended staining times (data not shown). We believe that this weak staining is rather indicative of the site at which transgene integration occurred in the respective U4 line than of <italic>bona fide</italic> gene regulatory activity of U4. In embryos, in which the hsp68-lacZ cassette was under the simultaneous control of U3 and U4, transgene expression was both quantitatively as well as qualitatively identical to U3 transgenic embryos (data not shown). This corroborates the absence of any enhancer activity in U4 and at the same time argues against a general silencer activity of this evolutionary conserved sequence element. In summary, we failed to detect any consistent gene regulatory activity for the non-coding regions U4 and D7 despite their evolutionary conservation.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene regulatory activities of the ECR in the Sox10 genomic region diverge again during later stages of embryogenesis</title><p>&#x003b2;-Galactosidase expression in the various transgenic lines had not changed dramatically from 11.5 to 12.5 d.p.c. Within the developing peripheral nervous system, the U1, U2 and U3 transgenes were all still expressed in peripheral nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A&#x02013;C), whereas DRG expression was detected for U1, U2, U5 and D6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A&#x02013;D). Those cells that expressed the &#x003b2;-galactosidase transgene under control of the U1, U2 or U3 element in peripheral nerves or ganglia also contained Sox10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>A&#x02013;C and 4A, B) and the early glial marker BFABP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E, F and data not shown), but not the neuronal marker Brn3.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>I and J) indicating that transgene expression reflects expression of the endogenous Sox10 even at the cellular level. In contrast, &#x003b2;-galactosidase-positive cells in DRG of U5 or D6 transgenic lines did not colabel with Sox10 or glial markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, D, G and H), but rather with neuronal markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>K and L).</p><p>At 16.5 d.p.c., &#x003b2;-galactosidase-positive cells had completely disappeared from DRG in D6 transgenic embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref>P, U, Y and 5F). Although a fraction of sensory neurons within DRG still expressed the U5 transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>X), the overall &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining intensity had also dramatically decreased in DRG of U5 transgenic embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref>O, T, X and 5E). Only DRG from U1 and U2 transgenic embryos still exhibited significant &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining at 16.5 d.p.c. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B and C).

Whereas U1, U2 and U3 transgenes were already expressed in the peripheral nerve at 12.5 d.p.c., D6 transgene expression had been absent at these earlier times (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A&#x02013;C with D). For all four transgenic lines, &#x003b2;-galactosidase was furthermore found in cells that express Sox10 as well as Oct6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E&#x02013;L) arguing that the transgene in all four lines is properly expressed in Schwann cells.</p><p>By &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining, sympathetic ganglia were found to still express U1, U2 and D6 transgenes at 16.5 d.p.c., whereas the differentiating enteric nervous system and the medulla of the adrenal gland expressed &#x003b2;-galactosidase predominantly in the U1 and U3 transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D and data not shown).</p><p>Very little &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining was observed for most transgenic lines in the spinal cord at 16.5 d.p.c. In particular, the dorsal spinal cord expression observed for the U5 and D6 transgenic lines at 11.5 d.p.c. had mostly disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E and F). Only U2 and U3 transgenic embryos exhibited significant spinal cord expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C and D). In case of the U2 transgenic line, &#x003b2;-galactosidase-positive cells were scattered throughout the spinal cord parenchyma at 16.5 d.p.c. as expected for oligodendrocyte progenitors and observed in the age-matched <italic>Sox10<sup>lacZ/+</sup></italic> embryos (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C with A). Co-immunohistochemistry with Sox10 and Olig2 confirmed that the &#x003b2;-galactosidase expressing cells in the U2 transgenic line were oligodendroglial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B). In contrast, &#x003b2;-galactosidase-positive cells in the U3 transgenic line were predominantly localized in the dorsal horn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D) and expressed interneuron markers such as Lmx1b, but not Sox10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 5</xref>D and 6C, D). U2 is therefore the only identified evolutionary conserved non-coding sequence with regulatory activity in oligodendroglia.</p></sec><sec><title>Overlapping gene regulatory activities are reflected by shared patterns of transcription factor binding in the ECR</title><p>Despite the fact that several of the evolutionary conserved sequences exhibited overlapping enhancer activities in the early neural crest and several neural crest derivatives, we failed to detect any meaningful sequence similarities between these sequences by various bioinformatics approaches (data not shown). However, we found common binding motifs for transcription factors. Using the rVista2.0 program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rvista.dcode.org">http://rvista.dcode.org</ext-link>), numerous, well-conserved transcription factor binding sites were detected in all putative enhancers (Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1 F2 F3 F4 F5">Figures 1&#x02013;5</xref>). Those for U1, U2 and U3 have already been listed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Among them, binding sites for caudal-type homeodomain proteins, Sox proteins, Tcf/Lef proteins and Stat proteins were present in all enhancers with strong neural crest activity, i.e. U1, U2, U3 and D6. U1 and U3 as enhancers with particularly high expression in the early neural crest additionally carried potential binding sites for forkhead domain proteins, ikaros-type zinc finger proteins and engrailed-type homeodomain proteins. However, the relative arrangement of shared transcription factor binding sites was different in each enhancer.</p><p>We also tested several transcription factors with known roles in neural crest development directly for their ability to bind to the evolutionary conserved non-coding sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). For EMSA, evolutionary conserved non-coding sequences were divided in subfragments that still allowed a good resolution of protein complexes after gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). The tested transcription factors were Sox9, Sox10, Pax3, AP2&#x003b1;, Lef1, FoxD3 and Slug. With exception of the hind part of U2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>E), all fragments bound at least one of the analysed transcription factors.

U2 which has also significant activity in the neural crest and its derivatives similarly has multiple Sox protein and Lef1 binding sites, but only a single Pax3 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D). In case of the Sox binding sites, some bound Sox protein dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B&#x02013;D, F, G, I, L and M), others bound monomeric Sox9 or Sox10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D and H) in accord with previous observations on other regulatory regions controlled by these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>U5, in contrast, exhibits only weak neural crest expression.

Thus, it appears that the evolutionary conserved non-coding sequences bind a similar set of neural crest-related transcription factors and that the number of binding sites within each element corresponds to the activity of each region within neural crest cells and their derivatives.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Over the last couple of years, a number of studies have shown that evolutionary conserved non-coding sequences in the vicinity of a gene are good candidates for the gene's regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). By applying this strategy to the <italic>Sox10</italic> chromosomal region, we here identify five regions that have the capacity to direct transgene expression in tissues of mouse embryos in which Sox10 is normally expressed. Taking furthermore into account that <italic>Polr2f</italic> and <italic>Pick1</italic>, the two genes flanking the <italic>Sox10</italic> genomic region, exhibit ubiquitous expression, these five evolutionary conserved non-coding sequences are good candidates for <italic>Sox10</italic> gene enhancers. Similar to its close relative <italic>Sox9</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), the <italic>Sox10</italic> gene thus appears to be regulated by numerous enhancers that are distributed over large genomic regions.</p><p>The regulatory activity of the identified Sox10 enhancers and their relative position to the <italic>Sox10</italic> gene are also consistent with previous BAC transgene deletion studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). These studies found that deletion of most sequences upstream of the <italic>Sox10</italic> promoter only leaves a weak residual Sox10 expression. On the basis of our study, most of this residual expression is likely mediated by D6 which was still present in the BAC deletion mutant, whereas U1, U2, U3 and possibly U5 were absent. The presence of 20&#x02013;30 kb of additional upstream sequences in two further BAC deletion mutants led to the recovery of Sox10 expression, albeit at reduced levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). This interval contained U3 and possibly U5 so that the enhancer activities of these two elements are likely responsible for the observed recovery. Not contained, however, were U1 and possibly U2 arguing that the absence of these two enhancers in the BAC deletion mutants caused the quantitative difference to wildtype Sox10 expression levels.</p><p>In contrast to many other genes for key developmental regulators including <italic>Sox9</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), non-coding sequences in the vicinity of the <italic>Sox10</italic> gene are not conserved in all vertebrate species. The evolutionary most distant conservation is between mammals and chicken. No obvious sequence homologies in the <italic>Sox10</italic> chromosomal region were obtained with Xenopus or zebrafish, although Sox10 similarly functions as a key regulator of neural crest development in all vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7">1&#x02013;7</xref>). Interestingly, expression of the group B1 Sox genes <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Sox3</italic> is also regulated by enhancer regions that are conserved in amniotes but not other vertebrates despite the crucial roles of these two genes in early embryogenesis and neurogenesis of all vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p><p>The absence of evolutionary conserved <italic>Sox10</italic> gene enhancers between mammals and fish agrees with previous experimental data. Whereas few kilobases of the zebrafish <italic>Sox10</italic> upstream region allowed efficient expression in melanoblasts and oligodendroglial cells, this was not the case in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Our results thus argue that there is not always a strict correlation between the conservation of a gene's function during development and the conservation of its regulatory elements. This has also been observed for a few other genes, most prominently for <italic>c-Ret</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to many other published cases where each regulatory element contributes a highly specific temporal or spatial aspect to the overall expression pattern of a gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), the regulatory elements of the <italic>Sox10</italic> gene have overlapping activities. U1, U2, U3 and D6 are all simultaneously active at 11.5 d.p.c. in the developing peripheral nervous system or at 16.5 d.p.c. in Schwann cells of peripheral nerves. These overlapping activities are also reflected by the fact that similar combinations of transcription factors bind to U1, U2, U3 and D6. In particular, the presence of multiple binding sites for Sox proteins, Pax3 and Lef1 appears to be a hallmark of these enhancers. These sites may mediate effects of canonical Wnt signalling on Sox10 expression, Sox9-dependent induction and Sox10 autoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>Sox10 expression in a particular tissue or cell type during embryonic development thus very often is the result of the composite activity of many enhancers. In this respect, regulation of Sox10 expression resembles closely the regulation of Sox2 expression in the developing neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p><p>Despite overlapping activity, there are also clear differences between the various enhancers. In Schwann cells, U1, U2 and U3 are, for instance, continuously active over a prolonged period, whereas D6 activity in peripheral nerves is interrupted. The fact that some regulatory regions show a continuous activity in a certain cell type, whereas others exhibit a more dynamic pattern may indicate that these regulatory regions are at least partly under control of different signals. Nevertheless, the simultaneous activity of many enhancers in the same cell type may be valuable as a fail-safe mechanism that guarantees continued Sox10 expression even upon inactivation or deletion of a particular regulatory region.</p><p>In case of <italic>Sox10</italic>, each regulatory region determines multiple aspects of the expression pattern. U2, for instance, drives Sox10 expression in satellite glia and oligodendroglial cells at the same time when it directs expression in Schwann cells. This contrast with other genes where the activity of a defined enhancer often correlates with expression in a certain cell type or tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).</p><p>Several evolutionary conserved non-coding sequences also exhibited ectopic expression in our study. Some of this ectopic activity was clearly due to integration site effects as in the case of U4 where weak blood vessel or midline activity was detected selectively in the progeny of a single founder. In other cases, ectopic activity was reproducibly observed in all available founders. Thus U3 activity was present in the heart, and the dorsal spinal cord exhibited U3 and U5 activity at distinct phases of embryonic development. Additionally, some of the evolutionary conserved non-coding sequences were found to direct neuronal expression, although glia are the only differentiated cells in the nervous system that normally express Sox10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). These sites of ectopic activity very often correspond to cell types or tissues that originate from Sox10 expressing precursors (e.g. cardiac neural crest, progenitors to sensory neurons in DRG) or exhibit a very transient expression of low amounts of Sox10 (e.g. the dorsal spinal cord). It thus appears that the activity of some of the identified regulatory regions is not properly turned off when they are studied outside their normal genomic context.</p><p>The <italic>Sox10</italic> genomic region therefore likely contains additional elements that help to restrict Sox10 expression during embryonic development in time and in space. Due to the design of our study, these regulatory activities would have escaped our detection. As a consequence, we should have found evolutionary conserved non-coding sequences in our study without apparent activity. This was indeed the case for U4 and D7 which may therefore function as negative regulatory elements. Whether these elements really function as silencers, has to be tested in future experiments. Our failure to detect U4-dependent silencing of U3 activity certainly argues that these elements could also have other less obvious functions.</p><p>The composite activity of the five identified evolutionary conserved non-coding sequences accounts for many aspects of the Sox10 expression pattern, although this does not exclude that there are more enhancers with similar and redundant activity yet to be discovered. Not reflected in the activity of the five evolutionary conserved non-coding sequences is the normally observed expression of Sox10 in the melanocyte lineage and in the early neural crest when cells change from a premigratory to a migratory state. Deal <italic>et al.</italic> reported that melanocyte expression is at least in part conveyed by the promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) which was not analysed in our study. The localization of the regulatory element for the early neural crest expression in contrast remains at large.</p><p>Interestingly, U1 had previously been implicated as DCHCS-1 in the regulation of Sox10 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Pigmentation defects and partial aganglionosis of the colon in a mouse model of Waardenburg/Hirschsprung disease had been attributed to random transgene insertion 47 kb upstream of the <italic>Sox10</italic> gene and concomitant deletion of 16 kb. As U1 is present in the deleted region and exhibited enhancer activity in transfected melanocytic cell lines, U1 was postulated to be the melanocyte enhancer and possibly the enteric nervous system enhancer lost during transgene insertion. Our results support the role of U1 as an enteric nervous system enhancer. The link between the loss of U1 and the observed pigmentation defect in the mouse mutant is not as straightforward. Our results rather argue for a more complex scenario in which other regions deleted during transgene insertion, the rearrangement itself, or functional interactions between U1 and other regulatory regions contribute to the observed melanocyte defect. In future studies, it will be interesting to search for mutations or deletions in any of the identified enhancers in patients who do not carry mutations in the <italic>Sox10</italic> coding region, but nevertheless exhibit the typical symptoms such as Waardenburg/Hirschsprung disease, peripheral neuropathies or central leukodystrophies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm727_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkm727_nar-01656-w-2007-File002.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkm727_nar-01656-w-2007-File004.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkm727_nar-01656-w-2007-File006.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkm727_nar-01656-w-2007-File008.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkm727_nar-01656-w-2007-File010.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkm727_nar-01656-w-2007-File012.tif"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank C.
