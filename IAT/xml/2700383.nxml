However, its physiological roles are still poorly understood. Herein, we show that <italic>Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> male mice are infertile and display several defects in spermatogenesis, demonstrating an essential role for Sam68 in male fertility. <italic>Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice produce few spermatozoa, which display dramatic motility defects and are unable to fertilize eggs. Expression of a subset of messenger mRNAs (mRNAs) is affected in the testis of knockout mice. Interestingly, Sam68 is associated with polyadenylated mRNAs in the cytoplasm during the meiotic divisions and in round spermatids, when it interacts with the translational machinery. We show that Sam68 is required for polysomal recruitment of specific mRNAs and for accumulation of the corresponding proteins in germ cells and in a heterologous system. These observations demonstrate a novel role for Sam68 in mRNA translation and highlight its essential requirement for the development of a functional male gamete.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian spermatogenesis is a striking example of posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schafer, et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braun 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Walker et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elliott, 2003</xref>). Because de novo transcription is not always possible during germ cell differentiation, the mRNAs for several proteins involved in spermatogenesis need to be synthesized and stored well before their translation is needed. Chromatin becomes unavailable for transcription during homologous recombination in the first meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Turner, et al., 2005</xref>). It follows a wave of intense transcription at the pachytene stage until the onset of chromatin condensation that precedes the first division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Monesi, 1964</xref>). Later, when round spermatids differentiate into elongated spermatozoa, the nucleus is rendered transcriptionally inactive due to extensive nuclear remodeling, replacement of histones with the highly basic protamines, and compaction of the chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sassone-Corsi, 2002</xref>). As a consequence of these processes, several mRNAs synthesized during the transcriptionally active stages of spermatogenesis are stored and protected by a profusion of ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), which preserve them until their translation begins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geremia, et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schafer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kleene, 2001</xref>). In particular, it was found that &#x0003e;700 transcripts are differentially shifted from the RNPs to the polysomes in a developmentally regulated manner during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iguchi et al., 2006</xref>). However, the mechanisms and the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that participate to their translational control in male germ cells are still largely unknown.</p><p>A class of RBPs that play essential roles in development is represented by the signal transduction and activation of RNA (STAR) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lukong and Richard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Volk et al., 2008</xref>). A prototype STAR protein, the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> GLD-1, functions as translational regulator during female gametogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Francis, et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee and Schedl, 2001</xref>). The mammalian STAR protein QUAKING (QKI) has been shown to regulate mRNA stability, mRNA export, and pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chenard and Richard 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Volk et al., 2008</xref>). Another mammalian STAR protein, Src-associated substrate in mitosis of 68 kD (Sam68 or KHDRBS1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fumagalli et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taylor and Shalloway, 1994</xref>), plays a role in several aspects of RNA metabolism, from alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matter et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng and Sharp, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paronetto, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chawla et al., 2009</xref>) to nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2002</xref>) and cytoplasmic utilization of viral mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coyle, et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, Sam68 was found associated to the polysomes in depolarizing neurons and meiotic germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grange et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paronetto et al., 2006</xref>). Src-related kinases and mitogen-activated kinases phosphorylate Sam68 and regulate its RNA-binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tisserant and K&#x000f6;nig, 2008</xref>) and its activity in alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paronetto et al., 2007</xref>), which indicates that Sam68 is able to integrate intracellular signals and RNA processing. Mice with knockout for the <italic>Sam68</italic> gene are protected from age-related bone loss and mammary gland tumors, revealing a function of this protein in mesenchymal stem cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Richard, et al., 2005</xref>), tumorigenesis, and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lukong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richard et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, whether or not the defects observed in <italic>Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice are caused by deregulation of specific cellular mRNAs in the cell remains unknown.</p><p>In this paper, we show that male <italic>Sam68</italic> knockout mice are infertile due to aberrant differentiation of round spermatids into mature spermatozoa. We have identified a subset of testicular transcripts that are affected by Sam68 ablation and found an enrichment in mRNAs encoding proteins involved in cell proliferation and survival. Several of these mRNAs are bound by Sam68 in germ cells. Moreover, we provide evidence that upon meiotic divisions, Sam68 associates with the translation initiation complex and regulates polysomal loading and translation of the mRNAs encoding SPAG16, a cytoskeletal protein required for sperm motility and fertility; NEDD1, a centrosomal protein required for microtubule organization; and SPDYA, a cell cycle regulator. Our findings suggest that <italic>Sam68</italic> loss of function leads to male infertility by restricting translation of a selected group of mRNA transcripts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Sam68 is required for male fertility</title><p>Sam68 expression is strongly expressed in meiotic and postmeiotic male germ cells of the testis, which suggests a role in spermatogenesis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811138/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>).

The seminiferous tubules of adult <italic>Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice had a thinner epithelium than the wild-type tubules due to a strong reduction in postmeiotic haploid cells, which affected both the early round spermatids and the more differentiated elongated spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). A developmental analysis of testicular histology revealed that the defects in spermatogenesis of <italic>Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice first appeared at the time when the bulk of meiotic divisions occurs (25 days postpartum [dpp] in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811138/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>). The reduction in postmeiotic cells was maintained throughout the first spermatogenic wave (45 dpp in Fig. S3).

The defects in germ cell differentiation were accompanied by increased apoptosis and a large reduction in haploid spermatids, which failed to differentiate into correctly shaped and fully motile spermatozoa.</p><p>The defective spermatogenesis observed in <italic>Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice is unlikely to be caused by androgen imbalance, as testosterone levels in the serum were normal, and a comparison of the mRNAs altered in <italic>Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> testis with those affected by deletion of the androgen receptor (Gene Expression Omnibus profiles found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>) revealed no overlap (unpublished data). Our microarray analyses identified the first mRNAs affected by Sam68 ablation in a physiological setting. The changes in mRNA expression were not caused by the altered germ cell population (i.e., a decrease in haploid cells) because transcripts for well-defined markers of postmeiotic differentiation, such as those encoding protamine 2 and transition protein 2, were not altered in <italic>Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> testis. Remarkably, the top represented categories among the mRNA down-regulated in <italic>Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> testis were cell cycle and cell death. Because the first obvious defect in spermatogenesis appears at the time when the meiotic divisions occur and correlate with increased apoptosis, our analyses suggest that these phenotypes might be due to the lower levels of expression of several genes involved in these processes. We also found an enrichment of genes involved in cancer, in line with the recently discovered role of Sam68 in prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Bus&#x000e0; et al., 2007</xref>), breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richard et al., 2008</xref>), and mixed lineage leukaemia (<italic>MLL</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheung et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, our microarray data provide a first list of genes potentially involved in the function of Sam68 in cancer cells. Moreover, the identification of mRNAs physiologically affected by Sam68 in testis might also provide valuable information for transcripts regulated by this RBP in other tissues in which its ablation caused a phenotype, such as bone and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Richard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lukong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chawla et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Although we have investigated the regulation of mRNAs down-regulated in the Sam68 knockout testis, other transcripts were up-regulated. The mechanism leading to these increased levels is likely different from the translational regulation of selected targets described herein. Sam68 is nuclear in premeiotic germ cells, and it is possible that nuclear events are causing the observed up-regulation. For instance, Sam68 might stabilize target transcripts during their storage in the nucleus of meiotic cells. Alternatively, because Sam68 was found to repress viral and cellular promoters in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lukong and Richard, 2003</xref>), it is possible that some of the observed up-regulations are caused by the relief of such transcriptional inhibitory function of the protein.</p><p>Our results suggest that Sam68 is implicated in the regulation of translation of its target mRNAs in germ cells. First, we observed that Sam68 associates with mRNAs that are down-regulated in the knockout testis, which suggests that these represent its mRNA targets in germ cells. Moreover, we provide strong evidence that Sam68 interacts with the translational machinery in germ cells and favors translation of specific mRNAs. Sam68 binds to the translation initiation complex eIF4F and remains associated with polyadenylated mRNAs in the polysomal fraction, which strongly suggests its stable interaction with mRNAs engaged in translation. In line with this hypothesis, we demonstrate that Sam68 is required for efficient polysomal loading of three target mRNAs (<italic>Spdya</italic>, <italic>Nedd1</italic>, and <italic>Spag16</italic>) and that the corresponding proteins are not accumulated in <italic>Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> germ cells undergoing meiotic divisions or early spermatid differentiation. The effect on translation appears direct because it can be recapitulated in a heterologous system by adding the 3&#x02032; UTR region of a Sam68 target mRNA to the luciferase reporter gene. Remarkably, Sam68 function requires ERK-dependent phosphorylation both for the association with polysomes and the enhancement of luciferase mRNA translation, similar to what was observed in meiotic germ cells. Thus, our results highlight a novel role of Sam68 in translational regulation and indicate that the binding of Sam68 to its target mRNAs in the cytoplasm favors their translation during the meiotic progression of mouse spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). Remarkably, SPAG16 deficiency leads to defects in sperm motility and male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>), which closely resembles the phenotype of Sam68 knockout mice. These observations suggest that the strong reduction in SPAG16 translation observed in <italic>Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> germ cells contributes to the infertility of the knockout mice and provides functional support for the role of Sam68 in the cytoplasm of male germ cells. A role for Sam68 in mRNA translation might also be envisioned in biological contexts in which Sam68 translocates to the cytoplasm, such as in the course of viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McBride et al., 1996</xref>), when it favors cytoplasmic utilization of viral mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coyle et al., 2003</xref>), or in response to depolarization of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ben Fredj et al., 2004</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic model of the role of Sam68 in male germ cells.</bold> Upon meiotic divisions, Sam68 is released in the cytoplasm and enhances translation of mRNAs bound to it, such as those encoding for SPAG16 and SPDYA proteins.

This RBP can strongly modulate the choice of alternative exons for the <italic>CD44</italic>,<italic> Sgce</italic>, and <italic>BCL-x</italic> pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng and Sharp, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paronetto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chawla et al., 2009</xref>). Alternative splicing is tightly connected to transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kornblihtt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bentley, 2005</xref>), and Sam68 was found to associate with the transcriptional regulatory complex SWI&#x02013;SNF and to influence the choice of exons on nascent pre-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Batsch&#x000e9; et al., 2006</xref>). Although we studied the cytoplasmic role of Sam68, we observed that this RBP is nuclear in primary spermatocytes and in round spermatids from stage III through stage VIII (Fig. S1). Thus, it is possible that Sam68 regulates alternative splicing in these stages of germ cell differentiation. The dual role of Sam68 in alternative splicing and translational regulation is not unique to this RBP. Other splicing regulators have been recently described to play a role in mRNA translation. For instance, hnRNP A1 translocates to the cytoplasm after several types of cellular stress, and can favor or inhibit translation of specific target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cammas et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, the SR protein ASF/SF2 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm in somatic cells, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner like Sam68, and associates with polysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanford, et al., 2005</xref>). More recently, it has been shown that ASF/SF2 associates with the eIF4F complex, as well as with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and the phosphatase PP2A, and that it regulates translation initiation through modulation of phosphorylation of the eIF4E-binding protein 4E-BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Michlewski, et al., 2008</xref>). Sam68 belongs to a family of RBPs known to link signal transduction with RNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Volk et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, because polysomal association of Sam68 correlates with its phosphorylation during the meiotic divisions, our results suggest a new mechanism for Sam68-mediated translational regulation of specific mRNAs during cell cycle transitions.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings identify a novel function of Sam68 in male fertility and suggest that its loss of function results in defective protein translation of selected mRNAs and might represent the cause of certain cases of human male infertility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Analyses of <italic>Sam68<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice</title><p>The <italic>Sam68</italic> colony was maintained by intercrossing <italic>Sam68<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice.
