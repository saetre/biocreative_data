The timing and lifetime of Kip1p association with the plasmid partitioning locus <italic>STB</italic> are consistent with Kip1p being an authentic component of the plasmid partitioning complex. Kip1&#x02013;<italic>STB</italic> association is not blocked by disassembling the mitotic spindle. Lack of Kip1p disrupts recruitment of the cohesin complex at <italic>STB</italic> and cohesion of replicated plasmid molecules. Colocalization of a 2 micron reporter plasmid with Kip1p in close proximity to the spindle pole body is reminiscent of that of a <italic>CEN</italic> reporter plasmid. Absence of Kip1p displaces the plasmid from this nuclear address, where it has the potential to tether to a chromosome or poach chromosome segregation factors. Exploiting Kip1p, which is subsidiary to Cin8p for chromosome segregation, to direct itself to a &#x0201c;partitioning center&#x0201d; represents yet another facet of the benign parasitism of the yeast plasmid.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The yeast 2 micron plasmid is a circular multicopy selfish DNA element in the nucleus that propagates itself without conferring any apparent advantage to its host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Velmurugan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jayaram et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ghosh et al., 2006</xref>). At its steady-state copy number of &#x0223c;40&#x02013;60 per cell, the plasmid poses no significant impediment to the host's fitness. The genetic organization of the plasmid is an efficient evolutionary design for stable persistence at a high, but regulated, copy number.</p><p>The 2 micron circle genome can be divided into a partitioning system and a copy number control system. The copy number control system is called into play only to counter rare missegregation events. The resulting drop in plasmid molecules in one of the two daughter cells is corrected by DNA amplification mediated by the plasmid coded Flp site-specific recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Futcher, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Volkert and Broach, 1986</xref>). Tight negative regulation of amplification safeguards against runaway increase in copy number.</p><p>The partitioning system consists of plasmid coded proteins Rep1p and Rep2p and a cis-acting locus <italic>STB</italic> located near the replication origin. Despite its multicopy status, the 2 micron plasmid is partitioned as one clustered entity consisting of &#x0223c;3&#x02013;5 closely knit plasmid foci. This reduction in copy number causes stable plasmid propagation to be absolutely dependent on the Rep&#x02013;<italic>STB</italic> system. The nearly chromosome-like stability of the plasmid results from the ability of the partitioning system to couple plasmid segregation to chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Velmurugan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mehta et al., 2002</xref>). A critical feature of this coupling is the Rep1p- and Rep2p-mediated recruitment of the yeast cohesin complex to <italic>STB</italic>, followed by one-to-one segregation of duplicated plasmid clusters to daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mehta et al., 2002</xref>). Single-copy plasmid derivatives reveal that cohesin recruitment results in sister plasmid cohesion in metaphase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ghosh et al., 2007</xref>). Hitherto known features of 2 micron circle segregation are accommodated by a chromosome tethering model in which sister plasmid clusters hitchhike to opposite cell poles on sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mehta et al., 2002</xref>). However, chromosome-independent, though cohesin-mediated, plasmid segregation cannot be ruled out entirely.</p><p>The integrity of the mitotic spindle is a critical requirement for plasmid segregation. The key spindle-dependent steps are: tight clustering of plasmid foci, precise nuclear positioning of the cluster in proximity to the spindle pole body, localization of the plasmid in chromosome spreads, association of the histone H3 variant Cse4p with <italic>STB</italic>, and assembly of the cohesin complex at <italic>STB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Velmurugan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mehta et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hajra et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ghosh et al., 2007</xref>). Every known step of the plasmid partitioning pathway, except for the association of the Rep proteins and components of the RSC2 chromatin remodeling complex with <italic>STB</italic>, is blocked by disrupting the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mehta et al., 2005</xref>; unpublished data). Apparently, spindle-mediated organization and localization of the plasmid cluster are early events in assembling the partitioning complex. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this spatial control have remained unclear.</p><p>The mitotic spindle is a dynamic molecular machine that, in conjunction with associated motor and nonmotor proteins, orchestrates faithful chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Manning and Compton, 2008</xref>). Five of the six kinesin-related motor proteins of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> have demonstrated roles in spindle function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hildebrandt and Hoyt, 2000</xref>). Of these, Cin8p and Kip1p (kinesin-5 family) are entirely nuclear, Kar3p (kinesin-14 family) and Kip3p (kinesin-8 or -13 family) are nuclear as well as cytoplasmic, and Kip2p (kinesin-7 family) is exclusively cytoplasmic. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> also harbors a single cytoplasmic dynein. These spindle-associated motors generate pulling and pushing forces that control spindle length as well as nuclear migration, cross-link and bundle microtubules, and regulate microtubule dynamics to promote synchronized poleward movement of sister chromatids.</p><p>All four nuclear motors of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> perform distinct functions related to kinetochore organization and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tytell and Sorger, 2006</xref>). Cin8p and Kip1p are responsible for the typical bi-lobed metaphase configuration of kinetochores. Kip3p promotes depolymerization of kinetochore microtubules during anaphase and translocation of sister kinetochores in opposite directions. Kar3p, which localizes primarily to the spindle pole, also localizes preferentially to kinetochores detached from the spindle. Kar3p facilitates the lateral movement of kinetochores toward the spindle pole after their capture by microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tanaka et al., 2005</xref>). This function is important during early S phase, when centromeres become dissociated from the spindle during their replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kitamura et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The nuclear localization of the 2 micron plasmid is similar to that of centromeres. Furthermore, the 2 micron plasmid resembles <italic>CEN</italic> plasmids or chromosomes in the dynamics and kinetics of segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Velmurugan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ghosh et al., 2007</xref>). The multiple functional contributions of motor proteins at kinetochores suggested to us that the role of the spindle in 2 micron circle partitioning may be mediated through one or more of these motors. A spindle-associated motor protein may deliver the plasmid cluster to a locale where it could tether to a chromosome and/or access host factors required for plasmid partitioning. In support of this hypothesis, we find that the Kip1p nuclear motor (1) interacts with the plasmid partitioning system, (2) associates with <italic>STB</italic> de novo during the G1&#x02013;S window of the cell cycle, (3) promotes centromere-like location of the plasmid cluster in close proximity to the spindle pole body, (4) assists recruitment of Cse4p and the cohesin complex at <italic>STB</italic>, (5) fosters cohesion between replicated plasmid sisters, and (6) promotes, likely through steps 1&#x02013;5, equal plasmid segregation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>General experimental features</title><p>The 2 micron reporter plasmids contained the replication origin and the <italic>STB</italic> locus in their native context. In [cir<sup>+</sup>] strains, Rep1 and Rep2 proteins provided by the endogenous 2 micron circles supported their segregation. In [cir<sup>0</sup>] strains (lacking the Rep proteins), they were akin to <italic>ARS</italic> plasmids, containing a replication origin but lacking <italic>STB</italic>. In several experiments, the copy number of the <italic>STB</italic>-containing plasmids was reduced close to one by introducing a centromere (<italic>CEN3</italic>) into them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ghosh et al., 2007</xref>). The <italic>CEN</italic> could be conditionally inactivated by driving transcription through it from the inducible <italic>GAL</italic> promoter. In [cir<sup>+</sup>] strains, in the presence of glucose or raffinose, the <italic>CEN</italic> and <italic>STB</italic> segregation mechanisms were active in the <italic>STB-CEN</italic> reporter plasmids. In galactose, segregation was strictly controlled by the Rep&#x02013;<italic>STB</italic> system. In [cir<sup>0</sup>] host strains, the <italic>CEN</italic> pathway was active in the presence of glucose or raffinose; in galactose, neither the <italic>CEN</italic> nor the Rep&#x02013;<italic>STB</italic> pathway was operational. None of the reporter plasmids have the requisite genomic organization for copy number amplification by Flp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Futcher, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Volkert and Broach, 1986</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>A 2 micron circle&#x02013;derived high-copy reporter plasmid missegregates in the absence of Kip1p</title><p>As noted, the mitotic spindle has a strong influence on multiple aspects of 2 micron plasmid segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Velmurugan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mehta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hajra et al., 2006</xref>). Could a motor protein mediate capture of the 2 micron cluster by the spindle and/or its localization, facilitating its functional interaction with chromosomes or a specific sub-nuclear structure? We tested whether equal plasmid segregation is affected by the absence of individual nuclear motors: Cin8p, Kip1p, Kar3p, and Kip3p.</p><p>We initially followed the segregation of a multicopy reporter plasmid pSV1 harboring the 2 micron origin, <italic>STB</italic>, and a LacO<sub>256</sub> array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mehta et al., 2002</xref>). In a [cir<sup>+</sup>] host strain expressing GFP-LacI, pSV1 revealed itself as a cluster of &#x0223c;3&#x02013;5 fluorescent foci in the nucleus. A preculture of this tester strain, grown overnight under selection for pSV1 and the GFP-LacI expression plasmid, was diluted into fresh medium and grown for two generations under conditions that induce GFP-LacI expression. Plasmid fluorescence was scored in the subset of anaphase or post-anaphase cells, namely, large-budded cells displaying two equal DAPI-staining zones separated into the mother and daughter compartments. Equal segregation of the plasmid, indicated by equal number of fluorescent foci in the two compartments (<italic>n</italic>:<italic>n</italic>), was not significantly different between the wild-type strain and its <italic>cin8</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>kar3</italic>&#x00394;, and <italic>kip3</italic>&#x00394; derivatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). However, the <italic>kip1</italic>&#x00394; strain displayed a large increase in the frequency of unequal plasmid segregation (<italic>n</italic>:&#x02260;<italic>n</italic>). For a subset of the assays, we verified that results from counting foci and measuring fluorescence intensities were concordant (unpublished data). Earlier analysis showed that total fluorescence intensity, which reflects the number of foci, gives a reliable estimate of plasmid copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Velmurugan et al., 2000</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Faithful segregation of <italic>STB</italic> reporter plasmids is dependent on the Kip1p motor protein.</bold> (A) Segregation data for a fluorescence-tagged multicopy reporter plasmid in [cir<sup>+</sup>] strains were averaged from three separate experiments (&#x02265;100 cells per experiment).

This assay, done independently of those summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, compared only the <italic>kip1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>cin8&#x00394;</italic> strains to wild type. Class III segregation (<italic>n</italic>:0) was rare in the <italic>kip1</italic>&#x00394; [cir<sup>+</sup>] strain, the segregation defect being largely of the unequal type (class II) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, middle column). The distributions of the three classes were more or less the same for the wild-type and <italic>cin8</italic>&#x00394; strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, columns 1 and 3). Within classes II and III, there was a clear mother bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Murray and Szostak, 1983</xref>) for plasmid retention in all strains. The Rep&#x02013;<italic>STB</italic> system is believed to alleviate this bias.</p><p>A <italic>CEN</italic> reporter plasmid pSV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Velmurugan et al., 2000</xref>) did not show a higher incidence of missegregation when Kip1p function was ablated (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810130/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). Chromosomes do not suffer a significantly higher loss rate in a <italic>kip1</italic>&#x00394; strain, presumably because Cin8p can functionally substitute for Kip1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hoyt et al., 1992</xref>). The reported chromosome loss frequency of &#x0223c;1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> (a loss rate of 5.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> per generation, assuming 15 generations of growth) would not have registered in our assay.</p><p>A cloned copy of <italic>KIP1</italic>, expressed in the <italic>kip1</italic>&#x00394; strain, restored normal segregation of the <italic>STB</italic> reporter plasmid (Fig. S1 B). A mutant clone, with a nonfunctional Walker A motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Walker et al., 1982</xref>), failed to do so. The mutant Kip1p caused a metaphase delay in cycling cells, perhaps due to a partially dominant &#x0201c;rigor&#x0201d; binding phenotype similar to that described for a P-loop mutant of Kar3p that shows enhanced microtubule association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meluh and Rose, 1990</xref>). The plasmid partitioning function of Kip1p apparently requires its locomotive activity or at least its dynamic interaction with the spindle.</p><p>The above findings suggest that Kip1p promotes equal segregation of the 2 micron plasmid. Because counting of closely clustered foci can be somewhat subjective, the segregation assay was revised using a single-copy derivative of an <italic>STB</italic> reporter plasmid (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>A single-copy <italic>STB</italic> plasmid reporter shows a high loss rate when deprived of Kip1p</title><p>The potential impact of <italic>kip1</italic>&#x00394; on native 2 micron circle stability is expected to be mollified by high plasmid copy number coupled with the action of the amplification system. At low copy number, and in the absence amplification, lack of Kip1p should manifest a strong effect on plasmid propagation. To test this notion, we followed the transmittance of a unit copy 2 micron reporter plasmid in the <italic>kip1</italic>&#x00394; strain.</p><p>The assays were performed with the <italic>CEN</italic>-<italic>STB</italic> reporter pSG1, fluorescence tagged by LacO<sub>256</sub>&#x02013;GFP&#x02013;LacI interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ghosh et al., 2007</xref>). As pointed out, plasmid segregation could be forced to become entirely Rep&#x02013;<italic>STB</italic> dependent by galactose driven transcription through <italic>CEN</italic>. The experimental scheme for assaying plasmid segregation in cells released from G1 arrest is outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>. Note that the reporter was present within the pool of endogenous 2 micron plasmids that supplied the Rep1p and Rep2p proteins. A missegregating single-copy reporter, and the associated fluorescence signal, would be confined entirely to one cell compartment.</p><p>Absence of Kip1p caused a marked increase in 2:0 segregation frequency when pSG1 partitioning in the [cir<sup>+</sup>] host was under Rep&#x02013;<italic>STB</italic> control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>, column 2). 2:0 segregation in galactose in a <italic>KIP1</italic> [cir<sup>0</sup>] derivative of the host, lacking Rep proteins, provides a frame of reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>, column 3). Plasmid segregation was not affected by <italic>kip1</italic>&#x00394; when pSG1 centromere was maintained functional in glucose (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810130/DC1">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>). The elevated 2:0 pSG1 segregation due to <italic>kip1</italic>&#x00394; was also evident in a [cir<sup>0</sup>] host expressing Rep1p plus Rep2p in a galactose inducible fashion (Fig. S2 B, column 4). Thus, the single-copy reporter segregating on its own or as part of a plasmid cluster is subject to the Kip1p effect.</p><p>The microscopy assay was further corroborated by a plating-out assay (see Materials and methods). Aliquots from G1 cells at the start of the assay (T = 0) and after the first and second cell cycles (T = 1 and 2, respectively) were scored for plasmid-bearing and plasmid-free cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Unbudded cells accounted for 85&#x02013;90% of the population at T = 1 and 2, and their haploid DNA content was verified by FACS analysis (unpublished data). In glucose-grown cells, with an active pSG1 centromere, the plasmid loss rates per generation were quite small without functional Kip1p or in the absence of the Rep proteins ([cir<sup>0</sup>] background) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). In galactose-grown cells, with the pSG1 centromere inactivated, the plasmid loss rate per generation became significantly large in the <italic>kip1</italic>&#x00394; [cir<sup>+</sup>] strain. The loss rate was even higher in the [cir<sup>0</sup>] host strain expressing active Kip1p. In the wild-type [cir<sup>+</sup>] strain, pSG1 was less stable in galactose-grown cells than in glucose-grown cells. This result is consistent with previous observations that centromere based plasmid partitioning is more efficient than Rep&#x02013;<italic>STB</italic>-based partitioning.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Loss rates of a single-copy reporter plasmid in wild-type and <italic>kip1</italic>&#x00394; strains.</bold> (A) Plasmid loss at the end of the first two generations after release of cells from G1 arrest (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>) was estimated by scoring cells for the retention of the <italic>TRP1</italic> marker harbored by the reporter plasmid.

A spindle-associated motor protein recruited to its partitioning locus may lead the plasmid to a nuclear locale where assembly of the partitioning complex and/or potential chromosome tethering can be accomplished.</p><p>The rarity of complete segregation failure (<italic>n</italic>:0) in a <italic>kip1</italic>&#x00394; host relative to a [cir<sup>0</sup>] host (devoid of Rep proteins) is rather puzzling. Perhaps lack of Kip1p may so affect plasmid organization/localization as to mitigate constraints operating on one-to-one segregation of sister clusters. This partial alleviation of mother bias may skew the segregation defect toward <italic>n</italic>:&#x02260;<italic>n</italic> events and away from <italic>n</italic>:0 events.</p><sec><title>Kip1p is an authentic component of the 2 micron plasmid partitioning system</title><p>The absolute dependence of Kip1p recruitment at <italic>STB</italic> on the Rep proteins and the cell cycle timing and duration of Kip1p&#x02013;<italic>STB</italic> association are consistent with Kip1p being an authentic component of the 2 micron plasmid partitioning system. The transient dissociation-reassociation of Kip1p at <italic>STB</italic> during G1&#x02013;S resembles the cell cycle dynamics of the Rep proteins at <italic>STB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2004</xref>). Persistence of Kip1p&#x02013;<italic>STB</italic> interaction for nearly the entire cell cycle is at odds with biochemical evidence for Kip1p degradation during metaphase to anaphase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gordon and Roof, 2001</xref>). Our data argue that a small pool of Kip1p, bound to <italic>STB</italic>, <italic>CEN</italic>, and perhaps microtubules, escapes anaphase destruction. However, we cannot rule out that GFP or epitope tag present on Kip1p could have altered its stability.</p><p>Cin8p and, perhaps to a lesser extent, Kip1p, promote kinetochore clustering by cross-linking kinetochore microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tytell and Sorger, 2006</xref>). In principle, Kip1p tetramers may assist the Rep proteins in cross-linking (clustering) plasmid molecules via bridging interactions between their <italic>STB</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 A</xref>). Association of Kip1p-bound plasmids with microtubules followed by their bundling can confer a second level of compaction on the plasmid cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10, B and C</xref>). Spindle depolymerization, and loosening of plasmid adhesion, causes the cluster to occupy a wider residence zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Velmurugan et al., 2000</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p><bold>Possible roles for Kip1p in the 2 micron circle partitioning pathway.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) organization, spindle association, and compaction of plasmid cluster.

Note that Kip1p&#x02013;<italic>STB</italic> association requires interactions of Rep1p with Rep2p and <italic>STB</italic>. Perhaps Rep1p&#x02013;Kip1p interaction is transient or dynamic. Or, the plasmid partitioning complex may be assembled hierarchically from a set of sub-complexes. Interaction of a sub-complex containing Rep1p and Rep2p with <italic>STB</italic> may be a prerequisite for recruitment of a second sub-complex containing Rep2p and Kip1p, even though the two sub-complexes may not directly interact. For example, the former interaction could trigger remodeling of the <italic>STB</italic> chromatin to make it competent for the latter.</p></sec><sec><title>Kip1p-mediated plasmid capture by the spindle: transport of the 2 micron plasmid to its partitioning center?</title><p>We suggest the following plausible models for the action of Kip1p in 2 micron plasmid segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>). Kip1p may promote capture of the plasmid cluster by the spindle and higher-order organization of the cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10, A&#x02013;C</xref>). Spindle&#x02013;plasmid association could be augmented by interaction between independent pools of Rep1 and Rep2 proteins present on <italic>STB</italic> and on the spindle. The Rep proteins, localized primarily at or close to the spindle poles, form a decreasing concentration gradient toward the spindle midzone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Velmurugan et al., 2000</xref>). If the plasmid cluster contacts a kinetochore microtubule, the Kip1p motor can translocate it to the plus end where a chromosome is attached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 D</xref>). If contact is made with a nonkinetochore microtubule distal to the spindle pole, the cluster may be moved in the opposite direction by the minus end&#x02013;directed Kar3p motor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 E</xref>, bottom right). Cargo transfer between motors is well documented in higher systems. Fusion between endosomes and influenza virus is preceded by intermittent movement of viral particles in the perinuclear region using microtubule-based plus and minus end&#x02013;directed motilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lakadamyali et al., 2003</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that Kar3p associated with kinetochores transports chromosomes poleward laterally along microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tanaka et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kitamura et al., 2007</xref>). Alternatively, the Kip1p-associated plasmid cluster may approach the spindle pole by end-on movement through microtubule disassembly at the plus end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 E</xref>, top right). Regardless of the mechanism, localization in the immediate proximity of kinetochores would be conducive to either plasmid chromosome attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 F</xref>, right) or acquisition by the plasmid of chromosome segregation factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 F</xref>, left).</p><p>Kinetochores transiently dissociate from the spindle during replication of centromere DNA, and reattach to the spindle within a short time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kitamura et al., 2007</xref>). During recycling of the Rep1 and Rep2 proteins and of Kip1p at <italic>STB</italic> at the G1&#x02013;S transition stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>), the plasmid cluster may briefly disengage from the spindle. Reattachment of the cluster to the spindle followed by its normal localization can be accomplished by mechanisms outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Similarities and contrasts of the partitioning mechanisms of the 2 micron plasmid, bacterial plasmids, and episomal viral genomes</title><p>The 2 micron plasmid and bacterial plasmid segregation systems display similarities in organization but not function. The type I and type II bacterial systems code for two partitioning (Par) proteins which interact with a plasmid &#x0201c;centromere&#x0201d;. One of the Par proteins is a DNA binding anchor with a Walker-box ATPase or an actin-like ATPase as its partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ebersbach and Gerdes, 2005</xref>). The type III system is based on an ancient tubulin homologue TubZ and perhaps a DNA binding partner protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Larsen et al., 2007</xref>). Partitioning is accomplished through growing dynamic actin-like filaments, oscillations of Walker-ATPase filaments, or treadmilling of TubZ-GTPase filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Moller-Jensen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ebersbach and Gerdes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Campbell and Mullins, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Larsen et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Genomes of Epstein-Barr (EBV), Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes (KSHV) and bovine papilloma (BPV) viruses tether to host chromosomes for efficient partitioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Botchan, 2004</xref>). Tethering is mediated by a virally encoded protein that interacts with the viral episome and with histones, host chromatin binding proteins, or a methyl-CpG binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shire et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kapoor et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krithivas et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Viejo-Borbolla et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barbera et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">You et al., 2006</xref>). Human papilloma viruses (HPVs) use the viral E2 protein to associate with the spindle, suggesting a &#x0201c;viro-centromere&#x0201d; based segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Van Tine et al., 2004</xref>). Chromosome attachment through E2, in some cases specifically to pericentric regions, may constitute an alternative segregation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oliveira et al., 2006</xref>). E2 localization adjacent to centromeres is reminiscent of the residence of the 2 micron plasmid and Rep proteins in proximity of spindle pole bodies.</p><p>Non-stochastic distribution of EBV into daughter cells is perhaps achieved through association of duplicated EBV genomes in pairs with sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kanda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nanbo et al., 2007</xref>). This is analogous to cohesin mediated sister-to-sister segregation of the 2 micron plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ghosh et al., 2007</xref>). The cellular helicase ChlR1, which assists chromosomal loading of the papilloma E2 protein, is involved in sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Parish et al., 2006</xref>). The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> homologue of ChlR1, Chl1p, also promotes cohesion, presumably through its interaction with replication factor C (RFC) and the cohesion establishment factor Ctf7p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Skibbens, 2004</xref>). There is no evidence for pairing of duplicated viral genomes by cohesin. However, once tethered to sister chromatids, they could potentially be paired by the cohesin bridge that holds sister chromatids together.</p><p>A mitotic kinesin-like protein MKlp2 appears to assist poleward translocation of papilloma viral genomes in association with microtubule plus ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yu et al., 2007</xref>). The potential functional similarity to the role of the mitotic spindle and the Kip1p motor in 2 micron plasmid segregation is self evident.</p><p>Despite individual mechanistic distinctions, segregation of bacterial plasmids, the yeast plasmid, and viral episomes exploits actin- or tubulin-based dynamic filaments either directly or through chromosome attachment.</p></sec><sec><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Utilization of a nuclear motor for passage to a specific nuclear location reveals a novel aspect of the spatial regulation of 2 micron circle segregation.

Taking advantage of the lesser of the two motors is a shrewd strategy for a selfish DNA molecule whose propagation is inextricably linked to the host's fitness. Organizational and functional similarities and contrasts among partitioning systems of plasmids and viral episomes reveal direct or indirect reliance on a dynamic cytoskeletal structure. Whether these different systems arose as independent solutions dictated by specialized cellular contexts or share a common evolutionary descent followed by divergence under distinct host environments remains an open question.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>Yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810130/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>.
