For this reason, many ICL-inducing agents are effective therapeutic agents. For example, cisplatin and nitrogen mustards are used for treating cancer and psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) is useful for treating psoriasis. However, repair mechanisms for ICLs in the human genome are not clearly defined. Previously, we have shown that MSH2, the common subunit of the human MutS&#x003b1; and MutS&#x003b2; mismatch recognition complexes, plays a role in the error-free repair of psoralen ICLs. We hypothesized that MLH1, the common subunit of human MutL complexes, is also involved in the cellular response to psoralen ICLs. Surprisingly, we instead found that MLH1-deficient human cells are more resistant to psoralen ICLs, in contrast to the sensitivity to these lesions displayed by MSH2-deficient cells. Apoptosis was not as efficiently induced by psoralen ICLs in MLH1-deficient cells as in MLH1-proficient cells as determined by caspase-3/7 activity and binding of annexin V. Strikingly, CHK2 phosphorylation was undetectable in MLH1-deficient cells, and phosphorylation of CHK1 was reduced after PUVA treatment, indicating that MLH1 is involved in signaling psoralen ICL-induced checkpoint activation. Psoralen ICLs can result in mutations near the crosslinked sites; however, MLH1 function was not required for the mutagenic repair of these lesions, and so its signaling function appears to have a role in maintaining genomic stability following exposure to ICL-induced DNA damage. Distinguishing the genetic status of MMR-deficient tumors as MSH2-deficient or MLH1-deficient is thus potentially important in predicting the efficacy of treatment with psoralen and perhaps with other ICL-inducing agents.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Crosslinks, linking the complementary stands of the DNA double helix, can lead to cell death, because they are so effective at interfering with normal genomic transactions such as DNA replication. This property of crosslinking agents has long been utilized in cancer therapy. The purpose of our research is to understand the function of DNA repair proteins in cellular responses to DNA interstrand crosslinking agents. MSH2 is a central protein in the recognition of DNA mismatches, and we previously found that it plays an important role in protecting cells against the toxicity of crosslinks. The MLH1 protein functions in DNA mismatch repair in a later step, and we hypothesized that MLH1 may also be involved in repair of crosslinks. We were surprised to find that MLH1 function is important for DNA crosslink-induced signaling, rather than DNA repair. MLH1-deficient cells are more resistant to crosslinks and have defective signaling to processes that signal cell death. This work may have clinical consequences, as mutations in MSH2 and MLH1 are common in tumors. MSH2-deficient cells may be more vulnerable to DNA crosslink-inducing agents than normal, while MLH1-deficient cells have a greater potential to survive crosslinking treatment, which could instead potentiate further tumor initiation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) is a type of DNA damage in which both strands of the DNA are covalently linked. ICLs present formidable challenges to the cell's essential DNA metabolic processes including replication and transcription. DNA crosslinking agents, e.g., psoralens, mitomycin C (MMC), platinum drugs, and nitrogen mustards, are among the most effective anticancer agents and are commonly included in combination chemotherapy regimens. The formation of covalent crosslinks is a critical event for the cytotoxicity and antitumor activity of these ICL-inducing agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000189-Srivenugopal1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Herbs that are rich in psoralens have been used for centuries to treat vitiligo and other skin disorders; and in modern medicine, psoralen is widely used in conjunction with ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation &#x0005b;psoralen&#x0002b;UVA (PUVA)&#x0005d; for treatment of several skin disorders including psoriasis, mycosis fungoides, eczema, vitiligo and skin cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000189-Momtaz1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. UVA is ultraviolet light with a wavelength between 315&#x02013;400 nm. While PUVA-induced ICLs have been extensively studied, the mechanism(s) of ICL processing in mammalian cells is still not well defined. Current evidence suggest that proteins from several DNA repair pathways are involved in the processing of ICLs in mammalian cells, including proteins with roles in nucleotide excision repair (NER), mismatch repair (MMR), and homologous recombination (HR) mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000189-McHugh1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000189-Wu1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

To examine whether MLH1 is involved in the error-generating repair of psoralen ICLs, we transfected psoralen-crosslinked pSupFG1 mutation reporter plasmids into MLH-proficient and -deficient human cells. Psoralen conjugated TFOs were used to direct a site-specific psoralen ICL into the <italic>supF</italic> mutation-reporter gene on the pSupFG1 plasmid. pAG30 is a psoralen conjugated TFO that binds specifically to <italic>supF</italic> gene sequences and can direct formation of ICLs at a specific site upon UVA irradiation. pSCR30 is a control TFO having the same base composition as pAG30, but in a scrambled sequence and so does not induce specific ICLs in the <italic>supF</italic> gene. Forty-eight hours after the cells were transfected with the ICL-damaged plasmids, DNA was isolated and digested with DpnI.

This cell-killing capacity of ICL-inducing agents has long been utilized in cancer therapy. However, ICL-inducing agents can also cause genomic instability, which may eventually lead to tumor formation. Genetic and biochemical studies have revealed the importance of proteins from several repair pathways in processing ICL lesions; these include proteins from the NER, MMR, and HR mechanisms. It is important to understand the functional significance of these proteins in both ICL-induced cellular responses and mutagenesis. MSH2, the common protein of MMR recognition complexes, plays important roles in both the cytotoxicity of psoralen ICLs and their error-free repair in human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000189-Zhang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000189-Wu1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000189-Karran1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.

Papouli et al. (2004) have reported that MLH1-proficient and -deficient human embryonic kidney cells show a similar level of sensitivity to PUVA treatment under their conditions (53). In their study they tested one concentration of psoralen (1 &#x000b5;M 4,5&#x02032;,8-trimethyl-psoralen) and irradiated cells with 366 nm UVA at increasing doses (0&#x02013;20 J/cm<sup>2</sup>). However, increasing the UVA dose may not correspond to an increased number of ICLs. Akkari et al. (2000) have demonstrated that increasing the concentrations of HMT used to treat cells does result in increased levels of ICLs (40). Therefore, in our study we varied the HMT concentrations (from 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> to 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> M), rather than the UVA dose (constant at 1.8 J/cm<sup>2</sup>). Our experimental results show that MLH1-deficient human ovarian and cervical cancer cells are more resistant to psoralen ICLs than isogenic MLH1-proficient cells. It is interesting that deficiencies in MSH2 versus MLH1 have different effects on cell survival in response to psoralen ICLs. This suggests that MSH2 and MLH1 have separate functions in response to DNA damage in addition to their traditional roles defined in MMR. We observed that MLH1, but not MSH2, is critical for psoralen ICL-induced apoptosis, which may account for the difference in cell survival between MSH2 and MLH1-deficient cells following PUVA treatment. Our results demonstrate that MLH1 is required for efficient activation of caspase 3/7, suggesting that MLH1 plays an important role in activating these apoptosis effector proteins.</p><p>We have shown that MSH2 is involved in the recognition and processing of psoralen ICLs in human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000189-Wu1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Using triplex-directed psoralen ICL substrates and purified human recombinant proteins, we found that the human recombinant protein complex, MutS&#x003b2;, can specifically bind to triplex-directed psoralen ICLs (data not shown), which is consistent with data reported by Zhang et al. (2002) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000189-Zhang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, demonstrating that the human MutS&#x003b2; complex can recognize psoralen ICLs. The interaction between the MSH2-MSH3 complex and MLH1 may mediate the MLH1-dependent apoptotic response to psoralen ICLs. Although we observed that psoralen ICLs result in increased apoptosis in MSH2-deficient cells and decreased apoptosis in MLH1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000189-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000189-g003">3</xref>), the increased apoptosis seen in MSH2-deficient cells may be due to failure to repair the ICL damage. ICLs present a formidable challenge to DNA metabolic activities, and may activate subsequent apoptotic pathways. Unlike our results with MSH2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000189-Wu1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, here we demonstrate that MLH1 function is not required for the processing of psoralen ICLs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000189.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Given that MSH2, but not MLH1 is involved in the recognition and processing of psoralen ICLs, it is likely that a non-canonical MMR function of MSH2, that circumvents a requirement for MLH1, is employed during the repair of psoralen ICLs. This is consistent with a previous report that processing of psoralen ICLs in mammalian cell extracts is dependent upon MutS&#x003b2;, but is not dependent on the presence of MLH1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000189-Zhang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, MSH2, but not MLH1 is important for psoralen ICL repair in human cells.

In this study, we found that MLH1 is involved in psoralen ICL-induced ATR, CHK1, and CHK2 activation by phosphorylation. However, psoralen ICLs represent complex DNA lesions that differ from DNA damage induced by SN1 alkylating agents. For example, studies have shown that proteins from several repair pathways coordinately remove ICLs, including proteins from NER, MMR, and recombination mechanisms. Our results suggest that it is possible that the damage signal induced by psoralen ICLs can be passed to MLH1 in the absence of MSH2. Therefore, the cellular signaling in response to psoralen ICLs may differ from the signaling induced by SN1 alkylating agents.

The blots were washed three times with TBS containing 0.1&#x00025; Tween 20 and incubated for 1 hour with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti rabbit IgG or mouse IgG secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). After three washes with TBS containing 0.1&#x00025; Tween 20, bound secondary antibody was detected by using an ECL detection reagent (Amersham, Milano, Italy).</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Caspase 3/7 Cleavage Assay</title><p>2&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> cells were seeded in 96-well microplates in growth medium (100 &#x000b5;l) and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified, 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Eighteen hours later, psoralen ICLs were induced in the cells by PUVA treatment as described above. Triplicate cultures were established for each treatment. Forty-eight hours after UVA irradiation, the apoptotic status was evaluated by activation of caspase-3/7 using the Apo-ONE homogeneous caspase-3/7 assay (Promega, Madison, WI). The activation of caspase-3/7 is indicated by cleavage of a caspase-3/7 substrate that can be measured by fluorescence. The level of apoptosis was expressed as a percentage of mean fluorescence for each PUVA treated sample compared to the mean fluorescence for the control sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Annexin V-FITC&#x02013;Binding Assay and Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) Analysis</title><p>Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit I (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) was used to quantitatively measure apoptotic cells. Forty-eight hours after treatment with 1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> M HMT plus 1.8 J/cm<sup>2</sup> UVA irradiation, both floating and attached cells were harvested. The cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS and then resuspended in 1&#x000d7; binding buffer &#x0005b;10 mM Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.4) 140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>&#x0005d; at 1&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. 200 &#x000b5;l of the solution (2&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cells) was transferred to a 5 ml culture tube. Cells were gently vortexed and incubated with 10 &#x000b5;l of annexin V-FITC and 10 &#x000b5;l of propidium iodide (PI) for 30 min at room temperature (25&#x000b0;C) in the dark. 280 &#x000b5;l of 1&#x000d7; binding buffer was added to each tube. Samples were analyzed on Beckman-Coulter Ultra flow cytometer within one hour and analyzed with Expo32 software. The instrument was set up with an argon (488 nm) laser for excitation and a 525 nm pass filter for the FITC label and a 630 nm pass filter for PI with appropriate compensation. Annexin V-FITC is used to quantitatively determine the percentage of cells that are undergoing apoptosis, which relies on the fact that cells lose membrane asymmetry in the early phases of apoptosis. PI is a standard viability probe and is used to distinguish viable from nonviable cells in FACS analysis. Viable cells with intact membranes exclude PI, whereas the membranes of dead and damaged cells are permeable to PI. Cells that stain positive for annexin V-FITC and negative for PI are undergoing apoptosis. Cells that stain positive for both annexin V-FITC and PI are either in the end stage of apoptosis, are undergoing necrosis, or are already dead. Cells that stain negative for both annexin V-FITC and PI are alive and not undergoing measurable apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Mutagenesis Assays</title><p>Psoralen crosslinked pSupFG1 plasmid was transfected into human cells using Gene-PORTER transfection reagent (Gene Therapy System, Inc. San Diego, CA). Approximately 5 &#x000b5;g of plasmid DNA was used per 5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> human cells. The cells were incubated 48 hours prior to the isolation of the plasmid DNA. The plasmid was subjected to DpnI restriction enzyme digestion to remove unreplicated DNA, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction, and transformation into <italic>E. coli</italic> MBM7070 indicator strain, which carries an amber mutation in the <italic>LacZ</italic> gene. Mutations in the <italic>supF</italic> gene can be detected using a blue/white screen on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-&#x00392;-D-galactoside, isopropyl &#x003b2;-D-thiogalactoside, and ampicillin plates. The mutation frequency was determined as the number of mutant colonies (white colonies) to the total number of colonies (blue&#x0002b;white colonies). Experiments were performed in triplicate. DNA was isolated from randomly selected colonies for DNA sequencing analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000189.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Downregulation of MLH1 expression by siRNA treatment in HeLa cells.
