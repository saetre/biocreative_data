Under conditions of recall, fully-consolidated memories can undergo reconsolidation or extinction. These retrieval-mediated memory processes may rely on distinct molecular processes. The cellular mechanisms initiating the signature molecular events are not known. Using infusions of protein synthesis inhibitors, antisense oligonucleotide targeting brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA or tPA-STOP (an inhibitor of the proteolysis of BDNF protein) into the hippocampus of the awake rat, we show that acquisition and extinction of contextual fear memory depended on the increased and decreased proteolysis of proBDNF (precursor BDNF) in the hippocampus, respectively. Conditions of retrieval that are known to initiate the reconsolidation of contextual fear memory, a BDNF-independent memory process, were not correlated with altered proBDNF cleavage. Thus, the processing of BDNF was associated with the acquisition of new information and the updating of information about a salient stimulus. Furthermore, the differential requirement for the processing of proBDNF by tPA in distinct memory processes suggest that the molecular events actively engaged to support the storage and/or the successful retrieval of memory depends on the integration of ongoing experience with past learning.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcriptional and post-translational molecular events are required for the consolidation of information into long-term memories and are thought to lead to the synaptic structural changes that maintain the memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-McGaugh1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Routtenberg1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Individually, rats were first pre-exposed for 3 d to two experimental chambers (contexts) for 20 min/d. These contexts were designed to differ in a number of features including size, spatial location, odor, and lighting. In addition, to further distinguish the two contexts, exposure to each chamber was separated by a minimum of 4 hours. The first conditioning trial was given 24 hours later. Conditioning consisted of the rats being placed individually in a chamber for 3 min. After 2 min a single scrambled footshock (0.5 mA for 2 s) was delivered. After 24 hours the rats were returned to the other conditioning chamber for 3 min and they received a single scrambled footshock (0.5 mA for 2 s) after 2 min.

Therefore, we first established a behavioural protocol by which two different hippocampal&#x02013;dependent contextual fear memories (CFM) could be separately retrieved and manipulated by the duration of the exposure to the conditioned context during extinction training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003248-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Firstly, rats were fear conditioned to two different contexts (A and B) by presenting a short unsignalled footshock in each of the contexts on consecutive occasions. During extinction training each rat simply received a 2 min exposure to one of the conditioned contexts and a 10 min exposure to the other conditioned context. The exposures to the contexts during the behavioural training sessions were counterbalanced across the experiment. The effect of extinction training on conditioned freezing behaviour (an index of fear memory) was also measured during two series of context re-exposure recall tests 5 and 14 days later. This protocol is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003248-g001">Fig. 1</xref>. Rats showed a robust conditioned freezing behaviour in the two contexts during the first 2 min of each extinction training session indicating CFM had been established for both contexts. During the recall test 5 days later (LTM1), rats characteristically showed less freezing in the context in which they had received a 10 min exposure during extinction training (A) than in the context they were exposed to for 2 min during extinction training (B, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003248.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). We showed in a similar contextual fear conditioning procedure that a 2 min exposure to a conditioned context engaged reconsolidation processes which stabilise or maintain the fear memory for subsequent recall, as measured by high levels of conditioned freezing at all recall tests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Lee2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Here likewise, the maintenance of high levels of freezing in context B at LTM1 suggest reconsolidation of the fear memory for context B was induced by brief exposure to this particular context during extinction training. In the same animals, a longer 10 min exposure to context A at extinction training induced the extinction of fear memory for context A. Thus, two separate CFM could be independently modified by their context-selective recall and the conditions (duration of context re-exposure) of recall. There was no recovery of the extinguished fear memory at the second recall test, LTM2, 19 days after extinction training.</p><fig id="pone-0003248-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003248.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>10 min exposure to a conditioned context induced the extinction of a selectively recalled fear memory.</title><p>Repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant effects of the training and test phases on freezing behaviour (F <sub>(4.329, 47.618)</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;11.355, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.000, &#x003b5;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.481).

Therefore, the processing of BDNF was associated with the acquisition of new information and the updating of information about a salient stimulus that mediate changes in behaviour. These data generate a complete hypothesis for BDNF-associated signalling in the currently described component processes of LTM. Thus, BDNF regulates the acquisition, consolidation and extinction of fear memory, but not reconsolidation. In addition, the tPA-mediated proteolysis of proBDNF promotes new learning but opposes the extinction of established memory.</p><p>The competition between extinction and reconsolidation are governed by the precise conditions of memory reactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Eisenberg1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we show that proBDNF cleavage is selectively inhibited under conditions of recall that favour extinction (a prolonged 10 min exposure to the context CS), but not those that promote reconsolidation (a 2 min CS presentation). This clearly demonstrates the fine control of cellular responses by ongoing experience. The differential control of the proteolysis of proBDNF by salient environmental stimuli in new learning and by learning anew after recall, also indicates the integration of new and past experience at the molecular level. Determining the molecular or cellular mechanism necessary for integrating experience will be an important endeavour. That an inhibitor of BDNF processing, tPA-STOP, can attenuate new learning but potentiate extinction, further emphasises a central role for the integration of new and past experience at the molecular level in determining future behavioral responses.</p><p>This study indicates that secretion and processing of proBDNF in the adult hippocampus occurs as a consequence of memory formation. Firstly, we detected a BDNF-immunopositive signal at 35kDa (the molecular size of proBDNF) in CA1 that is specifically altered by regional infusions of ASO BDNF. This suggests that the signal is derived from the <italic>Bdnf</italic> gene. Indeed studies of CNS neurons transfected with <italic>Bdnf</italic> cDNA suggest that proneurotrophins account for a significant amount of the total neutotrophins secreted extracellularly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Farhadi1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Mowla1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Secondly, the levels of proBDNF were regulated during consolidation and extinction. Thirdly, we showed that regional administration of tPA-STOP, an upstream inhibitor of the extracellular proteolysis of precursor BDNF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Liot1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, attenuated the processing of proBDNF in CA1. Significantly, we showed that altering the ratio of precursor to mature BDNF levels with tPA-STOP and ASO BDNF has important functional consequences for LTM. Our data concurs with other studies that have shown that several forms of long-term plasticity in the adult hippocampus were correlated with changes in BDNF processing by the extracellular protease, tPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Pang1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Baranes1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Ullal1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. It should be noted that a recent study of endogenous BDNF processing in primary cell culture has shown little, if any, proBDNF is stored and secreted from hippocampal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Matsumoto1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the failure to detect proBDNF secreted from neurons derived from embryonic tissue, in which BDNF expression is comparatively low, may consequently reflect different dynamic levels of neurortrophin transport, release and processing mechanisms to those occurring in adult neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Lessmann1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The mechanism by which BDNF ASO potentiated the increase in proBDNF levels after extinction is unknown. It is possible that these effects may be caused by non-selective off-target, non-sequence specific effects of infusing oligonucleotides into the brain, such as the direct interaction with cellular protein or by activating immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Summerton1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. However, this explanation is unlikely because the manipulation of hippocampal proBDNF protein levels and extinction of fear memory were selective for ASO and not MSO. Furthermore, the ASO and MSO had no effect on the levels of &#x003b2;-Actin, the not regulated reference protein used in the above experiments (<italic>data not shown</italic>). We have also previously reported effects of the BDNF ASO, but not Zif268 ASO or MSO sequences on mBDNF activity in the CA1 and the consolidation of CFM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Lee2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore the behavioural and cellular responses to ASO are selective and are related to the targeted mRNA sequence.</p><p>Protein noncoding antisense transcripts expressed from human BDNF gene locus have been identified and may function to regulate BDNF gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Liu1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that exogenous ASO infusions may interfere with the mechanism of action of endogenous antisense-BDNF to alter BDNF levels in the hippocampus. However, this explanation for the BDNF-ASO potentiated increase in proBDNF we observed is doubtful because in contrast with the human BDNF gene locus, rodent <italic>Bdnf</italic> gene loci do not encode antisense-BDNF mRNA transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Liu1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Aid1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Evidence from several elegant studies have suggested that opposing cellular actions of mBDNF and proBDNF mediate synaptic plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Lu1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Namely, the cleavage of proBDNF to mBDNF by tPA is essential for LTP in the hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Pang1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our evidence that hippocampal-dependent extinction is mediated by an increased proBDNF/mBDNF ratio further suggests that that the synaptic and molecular events underlying extinction closely resembles LTD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Marsicano1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Chen1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Mulkey1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Chevaleyre1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Lin2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Lin3">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Our studies also show dissociable roles for mBDNF and proBDNF in the consolidation and extinction of hippocampal-dependent fear conditioning. The close correlation between the control of synaptic memory and the expression of CFM and extinction by different translational variants of BDNF, may indicate that different forms of synaptic plasticity models distinct memory processes. The precise cellular mechanism that controls the processing of BDNF by tPA required for the acquisition and extinction of long-term memory remains to be determined.</p><p>The illustration that the proteolysis of proBDNF is a key regulator of two-hippocampal dependent memory processes clearly demonstrates the significant role that post-translational protein modifications (PTM) play in LTM. Recently, a mechanistic model has proposed that PTM of synaptic proteins, maintained by endogenous brain activity, play an instructive role for LTM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Routtenberg1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. A consequent prediction in this model is that manipulations that alter the PTM of proteins crucial for maintaining LTM cause the loss of the memory. This has recently been shown for PKM&#x003b6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Shema1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. The model has some face validity for our data here because increased proteolysis of proBDNF was associated with the formation of LTM, while decreased processing was associated with the apparent loss (extinction) of LTM. However, we show that experimental interventions that alter the processing of BDNF are selective for the recently acquired or recalled memories, the so-called <italic>active</italic> memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Lewis1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. Non-recalled, <italic>inactive</italic> memories were unaffected. This implies that there is a time-limited role for PTM of BDNF in LTM. In addition, since ASO targeting BDNF has no effect memory or BDNF processing after some conditions of recall (reconsolidation) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Lee2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, this suggests that the on-going maintenance of CFM is not dependent on BDNF, or the post-translational state of BDNF. This implies that BDNF is permissive for LTM by initiating the PTM of other synaptic proteins that have an instructive role in LTM, via the activation of specific signalling pathways. Future experiments are required to address this possibility.</p><p>The requirement of BDNF dependent-processing for the extinction but not reconsolidation of LTM after recall suggests that drug or other interventions that directly target the PTM of BDNF, or the downstream signalling pathways of BDNF variants, potentially offers the therapeutic control of pathological memory in humans. For example, the memories that are considered to underlie phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder and drug addiction. Targeting BDNF may be particularly useful because only recalled, active, memories appear to be sensitive to manipulations that regulate with the cleavage of proBDNF to mBDNF. This has the advantage of leaving non-recalled memories intact. Furthermore, inhibiting the processing of proBDNF at recall would additionally prevent the acquisition of new memories that may be associated with the therapeutic environment and which may trigger the re-emergence of the memory by the process of renewal once away from the extinction environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Bouton1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, or cause the sensitization (augmentation) of the pathological memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Bisson1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003248-Mayou1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003248.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Two separate fear memories can be independently modulated by extinction training.

As described previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003248-g005">Fig. 5</xref>), rats (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;11) received two 10 min extinction-training trials (E1 and E2 24 hr apart) 3 days after contextual fear conditioning in two distinct contexts (A and B). Prior to E1 they either received tPA-STOP (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6) or PBS (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5). The same rats received these compounds prior to E2 such that each rat was infused with tPA-STOP in one of the two conditioned contexts and vehicle in the other during extinction. Rats showed more conditioned freezing in the context associated with the vehicle PBS infusions than in the extinction context associated with tPA-STOP infusions during long-term memory recall test (LTM 1) 1 day after extinction. Additionally, this data showed that there was no spontaneous recovery of the fear memory measured at a subsequent recall test 7 days later. All rats were re-conditioned in one context (A or B). A recall test was performed in both the contexts 1-2 days later (LTM3). At LTM3 rats showed significantly higher levels of conditioned freezing in the reconditioned context (C3) than in the context not associated with reconditioning (no C3). This indicates that (i) tPA-STOP has no long-term affect on hippocampal function because the rats can support anew a contextual fear memory for a specific context. (ii) There is no reinstatement of the extinguished fear memory by exposure to the US (Rescorla and Heth, 1975) because freezing behaviour was specific to the context in which the animals were reconditioned.
