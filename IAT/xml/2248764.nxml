Three functionally significant regions were detected: (i) a highly disordered C-terminal region with a putative PSD-95, Discs-large, ZO-1 (PDZ) domain-binding motif, (ii) a conserved Nudix box constituting the putative active site and (iii) a putative RNA binding domain consisting of the conserved Box B and a preceding loop region. Mutation of the putative PDZ domain-binding motif improved the stability of recombinant AtDcp2 and secondary mutants expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Such recombinant AtDcp2 specifically hydrolysed capped mRNA to produce 7-methyl GDP and decapped RNA. AtDcp2 activity was Mn<sup>2+</sup>- or Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and was inhibited by the product 7-methyl GDP. Mutation of the conserved glutamate-154 and glutamate-158 in the Nudix box reduced AtDcp2 activity up to 400-fold and showed that AtDcp2 employs the catalytic mechanism conserved amongst Nudix hydrolases. Unlike many Nudix hydrolases, AtDcp2 is refractory to inhibition by fluoride ions. Decapping was dependent on binding to the mRNA moiety rather than to the 7-methyl diguanosine triphosphate cap of the substrate. Mutational analysis of the putative RNA-binding domain confirmed the functional significance of an 11-residue loop region and the conserved Box B.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>One of the key processes in mRNA turnover is decapping, that is, the removal of the 7-methyl guanosine cap from the 5&#x02032; end of the mRNA strand. Capped mRNA is estimated to constitute 95&#x02013;97% of cellular mRNA and it has been proposed that the availability of the 7-methyl guanosine cap in mRNA is a dominant feature in competition for limited translation initiation factors, primarily eIF4E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Cap-independent translation mechanisms such as re-initiation and internal initiation generally lack the efficiency associated with cap-dependent translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Since capping is co-transcriptional and occurs in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), while decapping occurs in granules known as the mRNA processing bodies (P bodies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), decapped mRNAs are unlikely to be recapped for cap-dependent translation. Rather, deadenylation followed by removal of 7-methyl guanosine diphosphate from the 5&#x02032; end of mRNA appears to initiate degradation of mRNA by exoribonucleases in the 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). There are four primary pathways of mRNA decay in eukaryotes: two deadenylation-dependent mechanisms classified in accordance to the orientation of decay&#x02014;5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; or 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032;, endonucleolytic digestion and quality control pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Of these, deadenylation followed by decapping is the pathway gaining importance in yeast, humans and now in plants as a mechanism of controlling both gene expression and protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>In yeast, the major mRNA decay pathway involves a deadenylation-dependent decapping mechanism, where the mRNA is initially deadenylated, then decapped by an enzyme named Dcp2p and ultimately degraded by a highly processive exoribonuclease in the 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>). A similar enzyme in humans, hDcp2, is active on capped mRNA and is again deadenylation-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Although decapping by Dcp2 enzymes is a mandatory step in the degradation of capped mRNA in the 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; direction, the mechanism of action of this enzyme is still poorly understood and this enzyme is yet to be characterized in plants. Annotation of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> genome in the NCBI database includes one gene, At5g13570, with strong sequence homology to the Dcp2-type mRNA decapping enzymes. In this article, the protein encoded by gene At5g13570 is studied in detail.</p><p>Dcp2-type decapping enzymes are members of the Nudix superfamily of enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Nearly 1800 open reading frames coding for Nudix hydrolases have been identified by bioinformatics searches in over 360 species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Nudix enzymes catalyse the hydrolysis of a wide range of small nucleotide substrates composed of a <italic>nu</italic>cleoside <italic>di</italic>phosphate linked to another moiety <italic>X</italic>, hence the name Nudix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). All members of this superfamily share a conserved amino acid sequence (GX<sub>5</sub>EX<sub>7</sub>REUXEEXGU) termed the Nudix motif/box, forming the catalytic site of these enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In the Dcp2-type decapping enzymes from yeast and humans, the Nudix box has been shown to be essential for the hydrolysis of the pyrophosphate bond linking the cap to the 5&#x02032; extremity of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>It is proposed that hDcp2, the decapping enzyme from humans, binds to the RNA body first and subsequently positions the active site against the cap structure for decapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). An intact cap structure on an RNA strand of 23 nucleotides is mandatory for decapping by hDcp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The hDcp2 enzyme is unable to bind to cap analog [m<sup>7</sup>G(5&#x02032;)ppp(5&#x02032;)G] alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and decapping by hDcp2 is not regulated by the addition of cap analog competitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), again suggesting the importance of a short RNA region for preliminary binding. In addition, uncapped transcripts are efficient competitors for capped RNA, suggesting that binding of mRNA to hDcp2 is independent of the cap itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). A region essential for RNA binding by the hDcp2 protein was demonstrated by deletion mutagenesis. The deleted region was C-terminal to the Nudix motif in a region comprising an &#x003b1;-helical structure and a preceding loop region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The region corresponding to the above &#x003b1;-helix was designated as Box B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The contributions of structural motifs and individual residues to mRNA binding within this region have not been established.</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic> studies in plants suggest an important role for the Dcp2 type decapping enzyme in post-embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Heterozygous knockouts of the <italic>dcp2</italic> allele coding for the AtDcp2 protein, which resulted in small leaves and short hypocotyls and roots, and homozygous T-DNA insertions, which resulted in a lethal phenotype, demonstrate the significance of the AtDcp2 decapping enzyme for growth and elongation of plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In this article, we present studies on the enzymatic properties and structural motifs central to the mechanism of action of this Dcp2-type decapping enzyme from the plant <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and confirm that gene At5g13570 does indeed encode an active Dcp2-type decapping enzyme. We conduct in addition a mutational analysis on AtDcp2 as a full length recombinant protein. Previous biochemical studies largely used truncated Dcp2 proteins with greater inherent stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Indeed, we detected significant proteolysis of the recombinant full length AtDcp2 expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. To minimize the proteolysis of the full length AtDcp2 protein in a bacterial expression system, we first conducted bioinformatics analyses to identify the structurally disordered regions that are susceptible to proteolysis in the AtDcp2 sequence. In addition to the regions with high propensity of structural disorder, we also discovered a putative PSD-95, Discs-large, ZO-1 (PDZ) domain-binding motif in the AtDcp2 sequence. This motif could potentially target the recombinant AtDcp2 protein to the PDZ domain-containing proteases in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Thus, its mutation to abolish such interaction could minimize degradation of the recombinant AtDcp2 protein in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We found that mutation of the putative PDZ domain-binding motif did minimize degradation of recombinant AtDcp2 protein in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The adoption of such a strategy permits us to express full length AtDcp2 protein and its mutants for biochemical analysis.</p><p>Bioinformatics analysis was used to identify further structural motifs within the sequence of the full length AtDcp2 protein. The functional significance of these motifs was investigated by biochemical characterization of the recombinant AtDcp2 mutants carrying mutations of key residues in these motifs. The mechanism of hydrolysis was investigated by mutation of key residues in the consensus REXXEE found within the conserved Nudix box of this enzyme superfamily. In addition, biochemical analyses to decipher the molecular basis of substrate recognition by AtDcp2 and the ability of the reaction products to selectively suppress AtDcp2 decapping activity were conducted. Our results demonstrated the involvement of a putative loop region and the neighbouring Box B region in decapping.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bioinformatics analysis</title><p>Structural disorder prediction was performed with the DISOPRED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and DisEMBL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) disorder prediction servers.

The TLC plates were dried and the distribution of radioactivity determined using a Typhoon 8600 phosphorimager and ImageQuant 5.2 software (Amersham International, UK).

The encoded protein, a putative Dcp2-type mRNA decapping enzyme, was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> as a GST fusion protein, GST-AtDcp2. Expression at post-induction temperatures of 23&#x000b0;C and 37&#x000b0;C did not produce any soluble GST-AtDcp2 protein. Co-expression with chaperones GroES and GroEL did not significantly increase the yield of soluble GST-AtDcp2.

As all the proteins bound to glutathione agarose, we therefore conclude that the contaminating proteins retained an intact N-terminal GST moiety and were degradation products of the recombinant protein with a portion of the C-terminus end truncated. The most likely source of these contaminating proteins was either proteolysis of the C-terminal end of the proteins following expression or premature termination of translation.

The rationale is that mutation or deletion of the putative proteolysis-prone regions may allow generation of intact recombinant AtDcp2 proteins for biochemical analysis. Our analysis revealed a region of extensive structural disorder at the C-terminus of the AtDcp2 protein. Seventy-six percent of the C-terminus from residues 251&#x02013;373 was predicted by DISOPRED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) to be disordered, while only 8% of the N-terminal region spanning residues 1&#x02013;250 was disordered. The C-terminus was similarly predicted by DisEMBL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) to contain a high percentage of structural disorder in the form of loops and coils, hot loops that constitute a subset of loops comprising inherent high mobility and missing coordinates in X-ray structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). In comparison to other segments in the AtDcp2 sequence, the C-terminal extremity was predicted to exhibit the highest degree of structural disorder.

To assess the genetic basis for the presence of unique structural features at the protein level, the intron&#x02013;exon architecture of the At5g13570 gene, coding for AtDcp2, was investigated. The majority of the disordered C-terminal extremity of AtDcp2 was encoded by a longer exon (coding for 111 residues) comprising of a phase 1 intron at the 5&#x02032; end and a minor segment encoded by a smaller exon containing a phase 2 intron at the 5&#x02032; end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). In contrast, the Nudix fold contained phase 0 introns between exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Whereas the presence of phase 0 introns in the Nudix fold is consistent with its more ancient origins&#x02014;it is found in eukarya, prokarya and archaea&#x02014;the phase 1 and 2 introns found between exons forming the disordered C-terminus of the decapping enzyme are consistent with its more recent formation in the eukaryotic lineage alone.</p><p>The structural disorder within the AtDcp2 protein was consistent with its putative role as an RNA chaperone that binds to the unwound 5&#x02032; RNA backbone prior to cap hydrolysis. Large disordered regions are a characteristic feature of RNA and protein chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). In the AtDcp2 protein, this region of disorder maps outside of the region inclusive of an &#x003b1;-helix named Box B and an adjacent loop region that had previously been demonstrated to be essential for RNA binding by the human hDcp2 enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and may function separately in RNA binding. Many unfolded and misfolded regions of proteins undergo proteolysis more readily than regions that adopt well-defined secondary and tertiary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27">25&#x02013;27</xref>). Thus, the presence of such a long C-terminal segment with high propensity of structural disorder may contribute to its susceptibility to proteolysis by the endogenous proteases when expressed as a recombinant protein in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>In addition to this, we have also identified another structural feature that could potentially contribute to its susceptibility to proteolysis in <italic>E. coli</italic>&#x02014;the C-terminal GNSA motif, which is a putative PDZ domain-binding motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). The GNSA motif could further enhance proteolysis of recombinant AtDcp2 by directing the recombinant protein to bind the PDZ domain-containing proteases. PDZ domains are protein&#x02013;protein interaction domains, chiefly responsible for the binding of partner proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The protein&#x02013;protein interactions mediated by PDZ domains rely on the low-binding affinity of PDZ domains to apolar PDZ domain-binding motifs of partner proteins, in particular, those which contain a hydrophobic residue at the C-terminal extremity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Several of the cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteases in <italic>E. coli</italic> responsible for the degradation of disordered or misfolded proteins, contain PDZ or PDZ-like domains. For example, both the tail-specific protease (Tsp) and the isolated PDZ domain from the Tsp protease bind to the apolar residues of substrates with a dissociation constant K<sub>D</sub> of 1.8&#x02013;1.9 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).

We decided to mutate the PDZ domain-binding motif of AtDcp2 to minimize proteolysis of the recombinant enzyme by the endogenous proteases in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The C-terminal residues Ser-Ala were mutated to Pro-Asp to replace the apolar tail with an acidic residue to abolish any possible interaction of the recombinant enzyme with the PDZ domain-containing proteases. Indeed, the resultant mutant protein GST-AtDcp2-PD was less susceptible to degradation than the parent molecule with an intact PDZ domain-binding motif at the C-terminus. The purified GST-AtDcp2-PD preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) contains predominantly the intact recombinant enzyme of &#x0223c;69 kDa and a much smaller amount of degradation products than the GST-AtDcp2 preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Consistent with our observation, similar approaches (i.e. insertion of a polar tail motif) was adopted by other researchers to prevent proteolysis of the recombinant proteins by proteases containing PDZ or PDZ-like domains. For example, the sequence KNQHE was attached to the C-terminal extremity of the Arc repressor to abolish its rapid proteolysis by the Tsp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).

The analysis revealed a motif (VITHGVSGLKL) in this loop region of AtDcp2 that closely resembles the VIGXXGXXUK segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B) commonly found in the KH domain of several RNA-binding proteins including ERA, Fragile X protein, hnRNP K and Poly(C) binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42 B43 B44 B45">42&#x02013;45</xref>). We therefore termed this motif as KH-like motif. Homology modelling of the Nudix fold of the AtDcp2 protein (residues 98&#x02013;250) using the known structure of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> Dcp2p decapping enzyme, revealed that this KH-like motif likely resides in the loop region that extends to the start of the Box B helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C). We postulate that the KH-like motif in AtDcp2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B) contains determinants that facilitate the decapping reaction by binding to the RNA moiety of the capped mRNA substrate. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Effects of mutation of residues within the putative RNA-binding KH-like domain and Box B domain on catalytic activity of AtDcp2.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D, deletion of the KH-like motif led to a 92-fold reduction in the decapping activity.

In summary, our results suggest that the KH-like motif contains determinants essential for decapping activity. Presumably, these determinants facilitate decapping by mediating association of AtDcp2 with the RNA backbone of the capped mRNA substrate. This notion is supported by comparison of the homology model of the AtDcp2 protein with the structure of the related Nudix enzyme Ap<sub>4</sub>A hydrolase from <italic>Lupinus angustifolius</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>).

The loop region preceding helix 4 in the lupin Ap<sub>4</sub>A hydrolase was demonstrated to contribute critical substrate binding residues that lined the hydrophobic pocket, where the ATP-MgF<sub>X</sub> substrate bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). It is likely that the KH-like motif in this loop region is suitably located in the AtDcp2 structure to mediate or facilitate binding of the decapping enzyme to the RNA substrate.</p></sec><sec><title>Two lysine residues in Box B region contribute to efficient hydrolysis of capped mRNA by AtDcp2</title><p>Since the Box B region in human decapping enzyme was found to participate in RNA binding, we conducted a mutagenesis study to ascertain if the Box B region of AtDcp2 contains determinants that are important for activity.

The AtDcp2 enzyme hydrolyses the mRNA cap by substitution at &#x003b2;-phosphorus, the conserved mechanism of catalysis for the Nudix superfamily, yielding 7-methyl GDP and 5&#x02032;-monophosphate mRNA as the products. The individual conversion of both essential catalytic site glutamates, Glu-154 and Glu-158, to alanine resulted in more than 150-fold reductions in catalytic activity of the AtDcp2 enzyme, consistent with their functions as the effector of catalysis (Glu-154) and a ligand donor (Glu-158) that coordinates a divalent cation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Relevant to our findings presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, mutations of homologous glutamates in the conserved Nudix box motif of both the human and yeast decapping enzymes abolished their decapping activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Implications of product inhibition of AtDcp2 by 7-methyl GDP</title><p>Decapping was inhibited by the product 7-methyl GDP, by uncapped mRNA but not by the cap analog, 7-methyl diguanosine triphosphate. It appears that presentation of the cap to the cleavage site requires the cooperation of the mRNA body and that the catalytic site binds to the product 7-methyl GDP more strongly than to the cap in capped mRNA. The 7-methyl GDP similarly inhibits the inherent mRNA decapping activity in the L-A virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) and the activity of the nuclear Nudix small nucleolar RNA decapping enzyme X29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Such product inhibition by 7-methyl GDP constitutes a potential mechanism to prevent decapping of intact translatable mRNAs and accordingly 7-methyl GDP has a short cellular lifetime. The 7-methyl GDP formed by Dcp2 enzymes is converted rapidly to 7-methyl GMP by the scavenger mRNA decapping activity <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The lack of sensitivity to fluoride ions is a distinguishing feature of AtDcp2 within the Nudix hydrolase superfamily of enzymes</title><p>Extreme sensitivity to fluoride has been shown previously to be a widespread characteristic of Nudix hydrolases. All enzymes so far tested have shown this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Contrary to other Nudix enzymes, the AtDcp2 protein was not inhibited by fluoride ions at concentrations of up to 1 mM. Only at 25 mM, did the fluoride ions impose a minor inhibitory effect. Fluoride compounds mimic phosphate groups. It has been proposed that Nudix enzymes and ATPases are inhibited by complexes formed with the fluoride compounds and the reaction products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). Since our results demonstrate that AtDcp2 is refractory to inhibition by fluoride ions, we propose that AtDcp2 active site adopts a configuration with limited accessibility to the complexes formed by fluoride ions with 7-methyl GDP. It is likely all other Dcp2-type decapping enzymes also share such a property. In this respect, the Dcp2-type decapping enzyme appears to be distinct from many other Nudix hydrolases. Future investigations to solve the 3D structure of AtDcp2 will provide the structural basis for this distinct property.</p></sec><sec><title>The structural basis of RNA binding by AtDcp2</title><p>RNA-binding proteins interact with RNA molecules in two structurally defined modes: (i) groove binding and (ii) &#x003b2;-sheet binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). For the proteins adopting the groove-binding mode, a secondary structural element such as a helix or a loop is inserted into the groove of the RNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). It is proposed here that AtDcp2 adopts the groove-binding mode to bind RNA&#x02014;the loop region preceding Box B and/or Box B extending into grooves of the RNA molecule. Katsamba and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>) proposed a two-step &#x02018;lure and lock&#x02019; model of protein&#x02013;RNA association. In this model, electrostatic interactions are the key for the initial association (the lure step). This is then followed by rapid induced fit binding (the lock step), resulting in a stable protein&#x02013;RNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Since mutation of Lys-231 in the loop region and Lys-243 and Lys-248 in the Box B region reduces the decapping activity of AtDcp2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), we propose that they are responsible for the initial electrostatic interactions in the lure step to &#x02018;lure&#x02019; the RNA molecule to AtDcp2, the bound RNA molecule then induces conformational changes to establish additional interactions between the RNA moiety with determinants in other parts of AtDcp2 to form a stable protein&#x02013;RNA complex.</p><p>Piccirillo <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) reported that the carboxyl-terminal portion including Box B in the human decapping enzyme hDcp2 can mediate RNA binding. They also demonstrated that hDcp2 and single-stranded DNA could form stable complexes, and the ability of hDcp2 to form the complexes was significantly diminished upon deletion of the C-terminal segment containing Box B. We have attempted to use the three different methods described by Piccirillo <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and Moller <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>) and to ascertain if AtDcp2 can form stable complexes with [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]-m<sup>7</sup>Gppp-RNA. These methods include: (i) the Northwestern RNA-binding assay, (ii) cross-linking of AtDcp2 with [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]-m<sup>7</sup>Gppp-RNA by ultraviolet light irradiation and (iii) cross-linking of AtDcp2 with [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]-m<sup>7</sup>Gppp-RNA by formaldehyde treatment. In contrast to the findings by Piccirillo and co-workers, we failed to detect stable AtDcp2-[&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]-m<sup>7</sup>Gppp&#x02013;RNA complexes. A possible explanation for our failure to detect the stable complexes is that the binding of AtDcp2 to capped mRNA is transient in nature. An appropriate approach for future studies to measure the affinity of AtDcp2 for capped mDNA and to define the structural motifs critical for RNA binding is the use of surface plasmon resonance to determine the affinities of AtDcp2 and its mutants for capped mRNA immobilized on sensor chips.</p></sec><sec><title>Possible functional significance of the putative PDZ domain-binding motif at the C-terminus of AtDcp2</title><p>Bioinformatics analysis identified the &#x02018;GNSA&#x02019; motif at the C-terminus of AtDcp2 as a putative PDZ domain-binding motif. In addition, we conducted further analysis by homology searches in the NCBI database and found that similar putative PDZ domain-binding motifs also exist in almost 80% of vertebrate and plant Dcp2 decapping enzymes (data not shown). One approach to ascertain if the GNSA can indeed mediate AtDcp2 binding to PDZ domain-containing proteins is to use the recombinant GST-AtDcp2 proteins as the baits to search for binding proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> tissue lysates. Proteins that can bind the GST-AtDcp2 but not GST-AtDcp2-PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) are likely those that target the GNSA-motif. Identification of these proteins will shed light on regulatory properties of AtDcp2.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Based upon the findings described in this article, we propose a model of the catalytic mechanism and regulation of AtDcp2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). We have demonstrated that AtDcp2 catalyses the following reaction. <disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="gkm1002um2.jpg" position="float"/></disp-formula> In the reaction, AtDcp2 selectively catalyses cleavage of the diphosphate linkage between the &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-phosphates in the cap of the capped mRNA substrate (m<sup>7</sup>Gppp-RNA) to generate 7-methyl GDP and 5&#x02032;-monophosphate mRNA (p-RNA) as the reaction products. Similar to other known Nudix hydrolase superfamily members, the AtDcp2-catalysed decapping reaction involves nucleophilic attack of the pyrophosphate bond by a water molecule (Equation 1). One of the two conserved glutamates in the Nudix box is involved in polarizing and appropriately positioning the water molecule, while the other conserved glutamate coordinates a divalent cation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). It is proposed that the recognition of the substrates by AtDcp2 involves binding of the RNA moiety of the capped mRNA to the Box B region and a KH-like motif in the loop preceding the Box B region. One lysine in the KH-like motif and two lysines in the Box B region likely mediate in part the binding of AtDcp2 to the RNA moiety. Furthermore, the activity of AtDcp2 is subject to feedback inhibition by its reaction product 7-methyl GDP and uncapped RNA. <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>A model of the catalytic mechanism, regulatory domains and regulatory properties of AtDcp2. Based upon the structure of the yeast Dcp2 and the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, we postulate that the two conserved glutamates in the Nudix box in AtDcp2 are catalytically critical residues. Hydrolysis of capped mRNA (m<sup>7</sup>-Gppp-RNA) involves nucleophilic attack of the &#x003b3;-phosphate of m<sup>7</sup>-Gppp-RNA by a water molecule. The enhanced nucleophilicity and proper alignment of this water molecule are governed by electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding with a divalent cation (Mn<sup>2+</sup>) and one of the glutamates in the Nudix box. The second conserved glutamate in the Nudix box is involved in chelating the divalent cation. In addition, a second divalent cation is involved in binding the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-phosphates of the substrate. The RNA moiety of m<sup>7</sup>-Gppp-RNA interacts with Box B and the preceding loop structure (KH-like motif). Lys-231 of the loop structure, and Lys-243 and Lys-248 of Box B are the likely determinants involved in binding RNA.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm1002f8"/></fig></p><p>In spite of these findings, several important outstanding questions remain: (i) What are the exact roles of Glu-154 and Glu-158 of the Nudix box in catalysis? (ii) How does AtDcp2 selectively target the pyrophosphate bond linking the &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-phosphates but not that linking the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-phosphates and the phosphoester linkage between &#x003b3;-phosphate and the RNA moiety of the capped RNA substrate? (iii) What is the structural basis of RNA binding to the loop and Box B regions? (iv) How does the active site of AtDcp2 target the cap at the 5&#x02032;-end of the capped RNA substrates? (v) What are the upstream regulators of AtDcp2? Xu <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) recently reported that AtDcp2 interacts with Dcp1 and VARICOSE (VCS), the plant homolog of an important component called Hedls/Ge-1 of the mRNA processing bodies (P bodies) in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, they demonstrated that AtDcp2 activity is stimulated upon binding to these proteins. Exactly how these regulatory proteins modulate AtDcp2 activity is unclear. The availability of the intact recombinant AtDcp2 permits future investigation to answer these questions by biochemical and structural approaches.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are indebted to Dr Lena Burri, University of Melbourne for the pSP73-Omp clone and the Sir John and Lady Higgins Foundation for sponsoring the PhD studies of the candidate Dilantha Gunawardana.
