Analyses in mouse and zebrafish have shown that myocardial function is not required for early steps of organogenesis, such as formation of the heart tube or chamber specification. However, whether myocardial function is required for later steps of cardiac development, such as endocardial cushion (EC) formation, has not been established. Recent technical advances and approaches have provided novel inroads toward the study of organogenesis, allowing us to examine the effects of both genetic and pharmacological perturbations of myocardial function on EC formation in zebrafish. To address whether myocardial function is required for EC formation, we examined s<italic>ilent heart (sih<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>)</italic> embryos, which lack a heartbeat due to mutation of <italic>cardiac troponin T</italic> (<italic>tnnt2</italic>), and observed that atrioventricular (AV) ECs do not form. Likewise, we determined that cushion formation is blocked in <italic>cardiofunk (cfk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>)</italic> embryos, which exhibit cardiac dilation and no early blood flow. In order to further analyze the heart defects in <italic>cfk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos, we positionally cloned <italic>cfk</italic> and show that it encodes a novel sarcomeric actin expressed in the embryonic myocardium. The Cfk<sup>s11</sup> variant exhibits a change in a universally conserved residue (R177H). We show that in yeast this mutation negatively affects actin polymerization. Because the lack of cushion formation in <italic>sih-</italic> and <italic>cfk-</italic>mutant embryos could be due to reduced myocardial function and/or lack of blood flow, we approached this question pharmacologically and provide evidence that reduction in myocardial function is primarily responsible for the defect in cushion development. Our data demonstrate that early myocardial function is required for later steps of organogenesis and suggest that myocardial function, not endothelial shear stress, is the major epigenetic factor controlling late heart development. Based on these observations, we postulate that defects in cardiac morphogenesis may be secondary to mutations affecting early myocardial function, and that, in humans, mutations affecting embryonic myocardial function may be responsible for structural congenital heart disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Cardiac anomolies can result from very early defects in heart development.

We are currently witnessing an expansion in research that aims to identify the genes responsible for the structural development of organs and their later function. Among the organs of the body, the heart is unique because it begins to function mechanically before structural development is complete, begging the important question of whether myocardial function is required for the morphogenetic events that occur after the heart begins beating. One of the late steps of heart development is the formation of the endocardial cushions (ECs), which are tissue swellings that develop in characteristic locations along the anterior&#x02013;posterior (AP) extent of the heart tube and contribute to valves and, in four-chambered hearts, to septae. Because of the clinical significance and prevalence of EC defects in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020129-Hoffman1">Hoffman 1995</xref>), an understanding of the genetic and epigenetic factors controlling cushion and valve formation is critical.</p><p>During the process of EC and valve development, specific endocardial cells undergo multiple poorly understood specification, differentiation, and migration events en route to becoming functional heart valves. The genes involved in one substep of this process, epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transformation (EMT), are gradually being identified. Analysis of EMT during cardiac-cushion development has implicated molecules such as Fibronectin, Transferrin, ES-130, hLAMP-1, TGF-&#x003b2;2, TGF-&#x003b2;3, BMP-2 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020129-Nakajima1">Nakajima et al. 2000</xref>), Alk-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020129-Gaussin1">Gaussin et al. 2002</xref>), and hyaluronic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020129-Camenisch1">Camenisch et al. 2000</xref>) as being required for this process. However, many other molecules are likely to be involved in the complex process of EMT, and little is known about the events leading to heart-valve formation that precede or follow EMT, prompting us to take a forward genetic approach to this question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020129-Stainier1">Stainier et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>To examine the role of epigenetic factors involved in EC formation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020129-Hove1">Hove et al.

Because <italic>sih<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos do not have a heartbeat and therefore no blood flow, it is unclear from this observation whether the defect in EC formation is due to lack of myocardial function or lack of shear stress on endocardial cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title><italic>cfk</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Embryos Lack ECs Subsequent to Impaired Function</title><p>Through genetic screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020129-Alexander1">Alexander et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020129-Stainier1">Stainier et al. 2002</xref>) we have identified a new mutant, <italic>cardiofunk (cfk)</italic>, that fails to accumulate tie2::GFP-positive cells at the AV boundary by 48 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020129-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). We further examined EC development in <italic>cfk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos histologically. By 72 hpf, wild-type embryos have developed AV ECs that are more than one cell-layer thick (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020129-g001">Figure 1</xref>D), while <italic>cfk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos show no evidence of cushion formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020129-g001">Figure 1</xref>E).

Thus, EC formation appears to be defective from an early stage, and not simply delayed, in <italic>cfk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos. The lack of EC development in these mutants leads to toggling of the blood between the atrium and ventricle and its accumulation inside the heart by 48 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020129-g001">Figure 1</xref>H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020129-g001">Figure 1</xref>I; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">Video S1</xref>).

Following the sequencing of zC202M22, a portion of the BAC insert was assembled as a 52 kb contiguous sequence, and <italic>cfk</italic> was genetically localized to this region. Using GenScan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020129-Burge1">Burge and Karlin 1997</xref>) and BLAST analysis, we identified four genes in this 52 kb region: <italic>abc-b10</italic>, <italic>rab4a</italic>, actin (<italic>zeh0631</italic>), and <italic>fv49b10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020129-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).

Analyses of Cfk indicate that it is a sarcomeric actin by virtue of its homology to zebrafish &#x003b1;-cardiac and &#x003b1;-skeletal actins and lack of homology to zebrafish cytoplasmic actin, as well as its conservation of synteny with the human skeletal actin. Further evidence that <italic>cfk</italic> encodes a sarcomeric actin and not a cytoplasmic actin includes the presence of an extra residue at the N-terminus of Cfk, which is seen in all sarcomeric actins but no cytoplasmic actins, as well as the presence of residues that are stereotypic for sarcomeric actins at all 20 locations where sarcomeric and cytoplasmic actins have unique amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020129-Khaitlina1">Khaitlina 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020129-g003">Figure 3</xref>A).

The R177H <italic>cfk<sup>s11</sup></italic> mutation represents a less severe change in charge than the previously mentioned yeast or chick mutations. To assess the effect of the R177H mutation on actin function, we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate a haploid yeast strain in which the R177H mutant actin was the only actin expressed in the cell. These cells were readily obtained and showed no significant altered morphology or growth characteristics on normosmolar complete medium at 30&#x000b0;C.

The mutant actin exhibited two distinct differences in comparison to a similarly prepared sample of wild-type yeast actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020129-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). First, the extent of polymerization of a quantity of actin equal to that of the wild-type sample was significantly decreased as judged by the final plateau. Second, there was a prolonged apparent nucleation phase not seen with wild-type actin, even at concentrations of mutant actin that produced more F-actin than the wild-type sample. Samples of the polymerization solution were negatively stained with uranyl acetate and examined by electron microscopy to confirm that the increase in light scattering was caused by F-actin formation and not merely aggregation (data not shown). To define better the apparent difference between R177H and wild-type actins in regard to the critical concentration necessary for polymerization, we assessed the extent of polymerization of different amounts of actin relative to the amount of total actin using a light-scattering assay. Based on determinations with two independent preparations of actin, the critical concentration is 0.3 &#x003bc;M for wild-type actin and 1.9 &#x003bc;M for the mutant actin, confirming that this apparently mild mutation exerts a drastic effect on actin-filament stability.</p><p>During our work with <italic>cfk<sup>s11</sup></italic>, we observed that some embryos showing the <italic>cfk</italic> phenotype were <italic>cfk<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020129-g005">Figure 5</xref>A), suggesting that the R177H mutation can exert a partially dominant effect.

These data strongly suggest that lack of EC formation occurs secondarily to poor myocardial function or lack of blood flow at 36 hpf.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Myocardial Function, Not Shear Stress, Is Likely Required for EC Formation</title><p>Because <italic>cfk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>sih<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos each exhibit both a myocardial phenotype (dilation and silence, respectively) and fail to generate blood flow, it is impossible to conclusively state whether EC formation is affected in these embryos directly as a result of poor myocardial function or indirectly as a result of the perturbation in blood flow and shear stress caused by poor myocardial function. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020129-Hove1">Hove et al. (2003</xref>) attempted to address a similar question by inhibiting blood flow mechanically without affecting myocardial function. However, other aspects of cardiogenesis were disturbed in their experiments, leaving open the question of which effects of their manipulations were primary and which were secondary. We chose an alternate approach to analyze the respective roles of myocardial function and blood flow in EC development by finding doses of an inhibitor of myofibril function that would or would not affect blood flow. We treated tie2::GFP embryos with various concentrations of 2,3-butanedione monoxime (2,3-BDM), which blocks myofibrillar ATPase in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020129-Herrmann1">Herrmann et al. 1992</xref>) and decreases myocardial force. As the treatment concentration of 2,3-BDM increased, the percentage of embryos that formed endocardial rings at 48 hpf decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020129-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Importantly, blood flow was abolished in all embryos treated with 2,3-BDM at 6 mM or higher, yet 58&#x00025; of them (<italic>n</italic> = 74) formed an endocardial ring, indicating that blood flow is not required for the initial steps of cushion formation. When myofibril function was further decreased by treatment with 10 mM 2,3-BDM, the percentage of embryos with an endocardial ring decreased to 13&#x00025; (<italic>n</italic> = 68). Studies with the anesthetic tricaine confirmed the observation that ECs may form in the absence of blood flow and that the likelihood of forming cushions is inversely proportional to the concentration of tricaine (data not shown). In summary, the results from the 2,3-BDM and tricaine treatments suggest that it is poor myocardial function, and not lack of blood flow, which is primarily responsible for the loss of EC formation in <italic>cfk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>sih<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The hearts of <italic>sih<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos fail to beat yet undergo looping morphogenesis and AV boundary specification. The specific absence of EC formation in these embryos clearly demonstrates that myocardial function is required for EC formation. Precisely how myocardial function is required for EC formation is unclear. Prior work has demonstrated a requirement for AV boundary myocardium in the formation of ECs, and several signaling molecules emanating from the myocardium at the AV boundary have been identified (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020129-Eisenberg1">Eisenberg and Markwald 1995</xref>). Although we have shown that the expression of <italic>bmp-4</italic> is not affected by myocardial function defects, it is possible that myocardial function is somehow required for another aspect of this signaling event.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020129-Hove1">Hove et al. (2003</xref>) recently argued for the importance of intracardiac hemodynamics as a key epigenetic factor affecting embryonic cardiogenesis. In their experiments, blood flow into the heart was eliminated by surgical placement of a bead at the inflow tract. One of the resulting phenotypes in these embryos was lack of EC formation, leading them to hypothesize that a reduction in shear stress on endocardial cells caused this phenotype. However, it is possible that the lack of EC formation observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020129-Hove1">Hove et al. (2003</xref>) in surgically manipulated embryos was secondary to either the lack of looping observed in these same embryos, an effect on myocardial function by the surgical manipulations, or a more general arrest of cardiac development. In contrast, <italic>sih</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> embryos undergo looping morphogenesis, making them perhaps a more appropriate model to analyze, and these embryos also lack ECs. Therefore, myocardial function and/or blood flow appear to play a role in EC development. Data from 2,3-BDM and tricaine treatments, in which many embryos without blood flow still formed ECs, suggest that endocardial shear stress may not be key to EC morphogenesis.</p><p>In mouse, a number of studies indicate that mutation of a single gene, including <italic>tbx5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020129-Bruneau1">Bruneau et al. 2001</xref>), <italic>nkx2.5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020129-Schott1">Schott et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020129-Biben1">Biben et al. 2000</xref>), and <italic>has2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020129-Camenisch1">Camenisch et al. 2000</xref>), affects both myocardial function and cardiac morphogenesis. These mutations have been thought to affect cardiac structural development and function in parallel pathways or in a causal pathway with the abnormal structure of the hearts leading to abnormal function. Based on our analyses of <italic>cfk,</italic> we would like to propose an alternative interpretation, namely that some of these mutations may primarily perturb early myocardial function, which then disrupts subsequent steps of heart morphogenesis. This model is supported by studies of the <italic>ncx1</italic> null mouse, in which the heartbeat is eliminated and the EMT associated with EC development appears to be defective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020129-Koushik1">Koushik et al. 2001</xref>). The <italic>ncx1</italic>studies, together with ours, indicates that EC development may be particularly sensitive to perturbations in myocardial function. However, because of the difficulty in completely unlinking heart function and blood flow, further studies will be required to elucidate the exact contributions of myocardial function and endothelial shear stress on cushion and valve morphogenesis.</p><p>Our data show that mutations in two different sarcomeric genes lead to EC defects in zebrafish. Similar mutations affecting myocardial function may thus cause EC defects in humans. While most infants born with EC defects exhibit relatively normal myocardial function, actin-gene expression is known to undergo significant changes during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020129-Cox1">Cox and Buckingham 1992</xref>). Thus, a mutation in an actin gene expressed in the heart during embryogenesis, when control of actin-gene expression appears to be less specific than in the mature animal, could lead to an EC phenotype without apparent effects on myocardial function at birth. As shown by the <italic>cfk</italic> mutant, it is possible that genetic lesions in actin genes expressed only transiently in myocardial cells could cause embryonic cardiovascular phenotypes, particularly if those lesions act in a dominant manner. Therefore, as we seek to identify the genes responsible for human cardiac malformations, those primarily involved in myocardial function should also be considered.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Zebrafish</title><p>Zebrafish were maintained and staged as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020129-Westerfield1">Westerfield 2000</xref>).
