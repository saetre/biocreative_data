Primer extension and cloning of double-stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) into a vector designed to make full-length cDNA were used to determine the sequence of the fifteen 5'-terminal nucleotides which were not present in the original pS2 ds-cDNA clone. The mRNA sequence has a major open reading frame encoding 84 amino-acids, flanked by a 40 nucleotide 5'-untranslated region and a 198 nucleotide 3'-untranslated region preceding the polyA tail. The 3'-untranslated region contains a polyadenylation signal, AUUAAA, 14 nucleotides upstream from the polyA tail. The derived protein sequence contains a putative signal peptide region suggesting that the protein may be secreted. The nucleotide and derived amino-acid sequences were compared to previously determined sequences, particularly to those of hormone-regulated proteins and growth factors, and no obvious similarities were observed.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0278-a" xlink:role="2866"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0273.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2861"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0274.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2862"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0275.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2863"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0276.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2864"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0277.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2865"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0278.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2866"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0279.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2867"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0280.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2868"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0281.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2869"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0282.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2870"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0283.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2871"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0284.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2872"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0285.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2873"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0286.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2874"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0287.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2875"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0288.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2876"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0289.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2877"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0290.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2878"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
