Aberrant function of the CCHCR1 gene (<underline>C</underline>oiled-<underline>C</underline>oil &#x003b1;-<underline>H</underline>eli<underline>c</underline>al <underline>R</underline>od protein 1, HCR) within the PSORS1 locus may contribute to the onset of psoriasis. As CCHCR1 is expressed in certain cancers and regulates keratinocyte (KC) proliferation in a transgenic mouse model, we studied its relation to proliferation in cutaneous squamous cell cancer (SCC) cell lines by expression arrays and quantitative RT-PCR and in skin tumors by immunohistochemistry. CCHCR1 protein was detected in the pushing border of SCC and lining basal cell carcinoma islands. Different from psoriasis, Ki67 had a similar expression pattern as CCHCR1. The most intense CCHCR1 staining occurred in areas positive for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Expression of CCHCR1 mRNA was upregulated 30&#x02013;80&#x00025; in SCC lines when compared to normal KCs and correlated positively with Ki67 expression. The most aggressive and invasive tumor cell lines (RT3, FaDu) expressed CCHCR1 mRNA less than non-tumorigenic HaCaT cells. Moreover, the tumor promoters okadaic acid and menadione downregulated CCHCR1 mRNA. We conclude that both in psoriasis and the early stages of KC transformation, CCHCR1 may function as a negative regulator of proliferation, but beyond a certain point in oncogenesis cannot control this phenomenon any longer.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>We have previously shown that the CCHCR1 gene within the major psoriasis susceptibility locus PSORS1 may function as a negative regulator of KC proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006030-Suomela1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006030-Tiala2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

To further understand the function of CCHCR1 in KC transformation and skin cancer, we studied its expression in premalignant and malignant squamous lesions and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). As EGFR and its downstream target cyclin-D1 are involved in cancer development and possibly affected by the putative CCHCR1 pathways, we examined their expression in comparison to CCHCR1. The relation of CCHCR1 to KC hyperproliferation was highlighted by staining adjacent samples with the Ki67 antibody. We also studied the correlation of CCHCR1 expression level to those of Ki67 and EGFR in cultures of cells with different proliferative and invasive characteristics. CCHCR1 mRNA levels were determined in HaCaT cultures incubated with diverse bioactive agents with importance in tumor promotion, oxidative stress or psoriatic inflammation. Finally, the expression levels of CCHCR1, Ki67, and EGFR mRNAs were determined in an oligonucleotide microarray of cutaneous SCC cell lines and normal human epidermal KC cell lines. Our results suggest that CCHCR1 is expressed in non-melanoma skin cancers in association with EGFR and Ki67 in vivo. However, in cell culture the most atypic cells express CCHCR1 less than immortalized HaCaT cells, and tumor promotion and induced proliferation of HaCaT cells correlates with reduced CCHCR1 expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>CCHCR1 is expressed in SCC in association with EGFR, cyclin-D1, and Ki67</title><p>To study the role of CCHCR1 in KC proliferation and transformation, we investigated CCHCR1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry in different skin tumors in relation to EGFR, its downstream target cyclin-D1, and the hyperproliferation marker Ki67.

Activin A (18 ng/ml; 6, 24, and 48 h) was from R&#x00026;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and leptin (10 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml, 1000 ng/ml; 30 min, 60 min and 24 h) from Calbiochem. Cells were also stimulated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (0.05 mM, 0.1 mM, 0.5 mM, 1.0 mM; 2 and 4 h). The cells were lyzed and total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini-kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) as instructed by the manufacturer. Cells given fresh serum-free medium were used as controls. All treatments were carried out in triplicate, and the results were confirmed in at least two independent experiments.</p><p>Human cutaneous SCC cell lines (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;8) were established at the time of operation from five primary and three metastatic SCCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006030-Lansdorf1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

Quantitative PCR reactions to confirm microarray results were performed using the ABI 7900HT real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems), with each reaction containing 4 ng of reverse transcribed RNA in a 20 &#x000b5;l reaction. EGFR and Ki67 primers and probes were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Hs01076092_ml and Hs01032443_ml, respectively). The relative RNA levels in each sample were determined by performing standard curves for all target genes covering 0.1&#x02013;10 ng of RNA.
