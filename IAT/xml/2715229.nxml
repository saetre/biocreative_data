The Prp19 complex [nineteen complex (NTC)] can specify U5 and U6 snRNA interactions with pre-mRNA during spliceosome activation. A candidate for linking the NTC to the snRNAs is the NTC protein Cwc2, which contains motifs known to bind RNA, a zinc finger and RNA recognition motif (RRM). In yeast cells mutation of either the zinc finger or RRM destabilize Cwc2 and are lethal. Yeast cells depleted of Cwc2 accumulate pre-mRNA and display reduced levels of U1, U4, U5 and U6 snRNAs. Cwc2 depletion also reduces U4/U6 snRNA complex levels, as found with depletion of other NTC proteins, but without increase in free U4. Purified Cwc2 displays general RNA binding properties and can bind both snRNAs and pre-mRNA <italic>in vitro</italic>. A Cwc2 RRM fragment alone can bind RNA but with reduced efficiency. Under splicing conditions Cwc2 can associate with U2, U5 and U6 snRNAs, but can only be crosslinked directly to the U6 snRNA. Cwc2 associates with U6 both before and after the first step of splicing. We propose that Cwc2 links the NTC to the spliceosome during pre-mRNA splicing through the U6 snRNA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The removal of intron regions from pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) by the process of pre-mRNA splicing is an essential step during gene expression. Intron regions must be removed accurately and efficiently to produce mRNA that retains the original protein coding potential of the gene. Pre-mRNA splicing is carried out by a large RNA/protein complex called the spliceosome. The spliceosome contains five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) that are RNA/protein complexes named after the single small nuclear RNA (U1, U2, U4, U5 or U6 snRNA) that each contains. In addition to the snRNPs, there are also numerous non-snRNP protein factors that associate with the spliceosome that are essential for pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>A number of interactions take place to form the active spliceosome which is competent for intron removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). First, the U1 snRNP interacts with the 5&#x02032;-splice site region. Next, the U2 snRNP interacts with the branchpoint sequence. Following interaction of the U1 and U2 snRNPs with the pre-mRNA, the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP interacts with the pre-mRNA and the bound U1 and U2 snRNPs. After joining of the tri-snRNP, structural rearrangements follow that destabilize the association of the U1 and U4 snRNPs with the spliceosome. These structural rearrangements include changes in RNA/RNA interactions that set up the spliceosome for catalysis. Specifically the U1 snRNA base pairing at the 5&#x02032;-splice site is replaced by a U5 snRNA interaction with the 5&#x02032;-exon and a U6 snRNA interaction with the 5&#x02032;-end of the intron. In addition, U4/U6 base pairing is replaced by U6 base pairing with the U2 snRNA. These RNA/RNA interactions form the active site of the spliceosome for the first step of splicing. The second step of splicing occurs rapidly after the first step producing the mRNA molecule. The spliceosome then disassembles and the snRNPs are recycled for use in another round of splicing.</p><p>Protein factors have been implicated in mediating the RNA rearrangements required for spliceosome activation. In yeast, Prp28 is involved in the displacement of U1 from the 5&#x02032;-splice site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Brr2 catalyzes U4/U6 snRNA unwinding during spliceosome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and U2/U6 unwinding after splicing, with Brr2 activity being regulated by Snu114 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Following U1 and U4 destabilization from the spliceosome, a protein complex associated with the Prp19 protein termed the NTC (nineteen complex) is required for the stable association of the U5 and U6 snRNAs with the 5&#x02032;-splice site region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The NTC specifies and stabilizes dynamic interactions of U5 and U6 with the 5&#x02032;-splice site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The NTC is also required for dissociation of the Lsm complex from the 3&#x02032;-end of U6 allowing the 3&#x02032;-end to contact the intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The NTC then remains associated with the spliceosome during the two catalytic steps of splicing. The NTC consists of at least 10 protein components in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In addition to their role in activation of the spliceosome, proteins of the NTC have also been implicated in 3&#x02032;-splice site surveillance as a number of NTC proteins interact with second step splicing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11 B12">9&#x02013;12</xref>) and the human NTC complex is required for the second step of splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The NTC has recently been found to have an indirect role in spliceosome recycling by influencing U4/U6 stability/biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>The function of the NTC during activation of the spliceosome undoubtedly involves interactions with the snRNAs, but no NTC component has been found to bind RNA. Cwc2/Ntc40 is the only protein of the NTC complex that contains known motifs for RNA binding, namely a zinc finger and an RNA recognition motif (RRM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Cwc2 is required for splicing and has been demonstrated to interact with Prp19 by far western, <italic>in vitro</italic> binding and two-hybrid analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Two-hybrid analysis has further defined the Cwc2/Prp19 interaction domains to the C-terminal portion of Cwc2 (downstream from the zinc finger and RRM) and the C-terminal two-thirds of Prp19 including the WD40 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Cwc2 also interacts with Ntc30/Isy1, another protein of the NTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). To date, there is no information regarding whether Cwc2 interacts with the RNA components of the spliceosome.</p><p>To further define the function of the NTC in the activation of the spliceosome, we set out to investigate if Cwc2 interacts with the RNAs of the spliceosome. Depletion of Cwc2 <italic>in vivo</italic> results in the destablization of U1, U4, U5 and U6 snRNA, leading to reduced levels of the U4/U6 complex. Purified Cwc2 can bind directly to all five spliceosomal snRNAs and three different pre-mRNAs <italic>in vitro</italic>. In splicing extracts Cwc2 is not snRNP associated, but during splicing Cwc2 interacts with spliceosomes containing the U2, U5 and U6 snRNAs. Mutation of Cwc2 revealed that the zinc finger motif and the RRM are essential for Cwc2 stability. A purified RRM fragment of Cwc2, lacking the zinc finger, binds U1, U2, U4 and U6 snRNAs <italic>in vitro</italic>, but not U5 snRNA. We propose that Cwc2 displays general RNA binding properties that are mediated at least in part by the RRM and possibly the zinc finger motif. Within splicing extracts Cwc2 crosslinks directly to the U6 snRNA and we suggest that the general RNA binding properties of Cwc2 may be regulated by other NTC/spliceosomal components. Overall, we propose that Cwc2 provides the link between the NTC and the spliceosome through the U6 snRNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction and mutagenesis</title><p>The <italic>CWC2</italic> (YDL209C) gene was cloned by PCR amplification of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genomic DNA (Promega) with primers 209FG-5&#x02032;-GGTCTAGATTTCTAATATGGTTAAGAAGCG and 209BG-5&#x02032;-GGGGATCCTTGCAGGTATCTACTACAAAG containing restriction sites for XbaI and BamHI, respectively.

The RRM contains a well-conserved RNP2 motif, however, the RNP1 motif is less conserved compared with the consensus for that motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). The RNP1 of Cwc2 has an extra amino acid separating the two aromatic residues that are important for RNA binding.

It was suggested that the deficiency in U4/U6 stability/biogenesis resulted from inhibition of spliceosome recycling and may be a general effect of deletion or depletion of NTC proteins. We produced a <italic>GAL1</italic> regulated <italic>CWC2</italic> gene to investigate the levels of snRNAs and the U4/U6 snRNA complex when expression of <italic>CWC2</italic> is turned off.

Levels of U2 snRNA do not decrease. In addition, native gel electrophoresis revealed a dramatic decrease in the level of base-paired U4/U6 as well as decreased levels of free U4 and U6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). This agrees with the primer extension results, which demonstrate a reduction in total levels of U4 rather than just base-paired U4. Surprisingly, this is in contrast to depletion of other NTC proteins where the reduced levels of base-paired U4/U6 resulted in increased levels of free U4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).

Titration of the concentration of the RRM fragment revealed that it interacted with U1 and U6 more efficiently, and with U4 snRNA less efficiently, than the full-length Cwc2 (data not shown). The Cwc2 RRM may, therefore, be responsible for the binding of U6 snRNA in spliceosomes.

The NTC is known to promote the stable association of the U5 and U6 snRNAs with the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). To determine how the NTC associates with the snRNAs of the spliceosome, we have investigated the RNA interactions of Cwc2, the only putative RNA binding protein of the NTC. Here, we demonstrate that Cwc2 has the ability to bind all five snRNAs <italic>in vitro</italic>. Cwc2 can also bind three different pre-mRNAs <italic>in vitro</italic>, although with less efficiency than snRNA binding. Binding to U4, followed by U6, occurred most efficiently at the lowest concentrations of Cwc2, however, in assembled spliceosomes we find that Cwc2 interacts predominantly with U2 and U6 snRNAs and crosslinks directly to the U6 snRNA. Finally, Cwc2 depletion appears to have a more dramatic effect on snRNA levels than other NTC proteins, reducing the levels of U1, U4 and U5 as well as U6. Taken together, we propose that Cwc2 functionally links the NTC with the pre-mRNA and snRNAs of the spliceosome.</p><p>It has been shown that deletion or depletion of NTC proteins results in decreased U4/U6 stability/biogenesis as a result of inhibition of spliceosome recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Depletion of the essential NTC proteins Prp19, Ntc90 and Ntc77 or deletion of the nonessential Ntc25 and Ntc25/Ntc30 all resulted in decreased levels of U6 snRNA leading to reduced levels of the U4/U6 complex, and in turn increased levels of free U4 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). It was proposed that free U4 accumulation is a general property of NTC protein depletion or deletion. We have found that depletion of Cwc2 also results in a decrease in U6 snRNA levels and reduced levels of the U4/U6 complex as observed with depletion or deletion of other NTC proteins. However, depletion of Cwc2 also results in reduced levels of U1, U5 and, to a lesser extent, U4 snRNA. There was also a reduction in free U4 snRNA despite the reduced levels of the U4/U6 complex. This reduction in snRNA levels occurs after 8 h of Cwc2 depletion and corresponds to a strong block in pre-mRNA splicing. Depletion of Cwc2 appears to exhibit more dramatic effects on the snRNAs than depletion of other NTC proteins. It will be interesting to determine exactly how Cwc2 depletion downregulates snRNAs and the relationship this has to snRNP biogenesis.</p><p>The influence of Cwc2 on snRNA levels is accompanied by its ability to bind all five snRNAs and three different pre-mRNAs <italic>in vitro</italic>. This suggests that Cwc2 binds RNA nonspecifically; however, it does not bind the U3 or U14 snoRNAs under similar conditions. The binding assays were carried out in the presence of excess unlabeled tRNA. In the absence of excess tRNA, Cwc2 can bind the U3 and U4 snoRNAs <italic>in vitro</italic> (data not shown), therefore, it appears that Cwc2 has general RNA binding properties but with higher specificity for snRNAs and pre-mRNAs. There may be a common structural or sequence element within the snRNAs that is recognized by Cwc2 that is not present within U3 or U14 snoRNAs. Full-length Cwc2 bound to U4, followed by U6, most efficiently at the lowest concentrations of Cwc2. A fragment of Cwc2 containing the RRM was able to bind all the snRNAs except U5. Like full-length Cwc2, the Cwc2 RRM did not bind the U3 or U14 snoRNAs under the conditions used. The RRM fragment of Cwc2 is, therefore, likely to be involved in the RNA binding activity but the rest of the protein must have an important role, especially in U5 binding <italic>in vitro</italic>. Cwc2 may be able to contact more than one snRNA at once through its two different motifs. Lethal mutations in the RRM and zinc finger affected expression of the protein, probably by causing incorrect folding of these domains. Further mutagenesis is required to assess the function of these domains <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The NTC has previously been shown to join the spliceosome after the dissociation of U1 and U4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Prp19 was not found to be associated with the U4 containing spliceosome even in low ATP conditions, which inhibits U4 dissociation. Our immunoprecitation experiments agree with this timing, demonstrating that Cwc2 interacts with active spliceosomes containing U2, U6 and U5. Thus, even though Cwc2 can bind U1 and U4 by EMSA, it appears not to contact these snRNAs in snRNPs or in assembled spliceosomes. This is intriguing considering purified Cwc2 binds U4 with greatest efficiency at concentrations as low as 250 nM. However, before performing the immunoprecipitation, extracts were allowed to accumulate spliceosomes blocked just prior to the first step or after the first step of splicing, after U1 and U4 dissociation. Cwc2 immunoprecipitations contained a very small amount of U4 when spliceosomes were blocked earlier in assembly with low ATP concentrations (data not shown). Therefore, it is possible that Cwc2 does contact U4 and U1 in splicing extracts earlier in spliceosome assembly. Alternatively, while Cwc2 can bind all the snRNAs <italic>in vitro</italic>, Cwc2 RNA binding may be specified or regulated in splicing extracts by other components of the NTC/spliceosome.</p><p>Possible candidates for regulating the RNA binding activity of Cwc2 are Prp19 and Ntc30. Both Prp19 and Ntc30 interact with Cwc2 in the yeast two-hybrid assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In addition, Prp19 interacts with Cwc2 directly <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). These protein&#x02013;protein interactions could regulate the RNA binding ability of Cwc2 within the NTC. As Prp19 is in the U-box family of E3 ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), and can interact directly with Cwc2 <italic>in vitro</italic>, Prp19 may also target Cwc2 for ubiquitination. Ubiquitination can result in a number of different consequences for a protein. For example, ubiquitination can influence the stability, conformation, activity or localization of a protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Prp19 has been demonstrated to have ubiquitin ligase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and interacts with subunits of the proteosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). However, no substrates for the ubiquitin ligase activity of Prp19 are known. An attractive hypothesis is that Cwc2 is the target for the Prp19 ubiquitin ligase activity and that ubiquitination of Cwc2 may regulate its RNA binding activity in the NTC. If Cwc2 RNA binding is regulated by components of the NTC, by protein&#x02013;protein interactions or modification, Cwc2 would not be able to bind snRNAs in splicing extracts until the correct time in spliceosome assembly.</p><p>Cwc2 was found to contact the U6 snRNA directly in spliceosomes blocked both prior to the first and second steps of splicing. It has been demonstrated previously that the NTC is required for stable association of the U5 and U6 snRNAs with the active spliceosome and for specifying their interactions with the pre-mRNA before the first step of splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In order for this function to be carried out, it is expected that component(s) of the NTC will contact these snRNAs directly within spliceosomes. Until now, however, no proteins of the NTC have been demonstrated to be able to bind RNA. The fact that Cwc2 directly contacts U6 snRNA within spliceosomes suggests that it functions in this role of the NTC, stabilizing U6 snRNA association with the spliceosome. The NTC was found to specify the U6 interaction at the 5&#x02032;-splice site and to bring about Lsm dissociation from the 3&#x02032;-end of U6 enabling it to interact with the pre-mRNA intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). It will be interesting in the future to map the Cwc2 crosslink within the U6 snRNA to see if it is involved with one or both of these interactions.</p><p>The NTC remains associated with the spliceosome during the two catalytic steps of splicing. Cwc2 was also found to crosslink to U6 snRNA in spliceosomes blocked after the first but before the second step of splicing. Therefore, the NTC may be important for specifying U6 snRNA interactions at this stage, for example, during the proposed disruption of the U6-5&#x02032;-splice site interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). There appears to be a reduction in U6-Cwc2 association in both the crosslinking and immunoprecipitation experiments. This apparent reduction may represent remodeling of the Cwc2-U6 interaction, allowing U6 to form specific interactions required for the second step of splicing.</p><p>Although Cwc2 can interact with U2 and U5 <italic>in vitro</italic> and associates with active spliceosomes containing these snRNAs, we were not able to detect any crosslinks between Cwc2 and U2 or U5. This is intriguing as the NTC also stabilizes U5 association with the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). It may be that crosslinks were not selected by our method, although the U2 and U5 biotin oligonucleotides were able to hybridize to these snRNAs by native gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Alternatively, another protein of the NTC may bind U5 snRNA in spliceosomes. The ability of Cwc2 to bind to U6 snRNA in the spliceosome suggests that it may, at least in part, form the link between the NTC and the RNAs of the spliceosome. This link would allow the NTC to regulate important RNA/RNA dynamics during pre-mRNA splicing.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Wellcome Trust (082992 to R.T.O.).
