To maintain the integrity of the genetic material, cells possess multiple pathways to repair various types of DNA damage, such as the nucleotide excision and base excision repair pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c1">1</xref>). However, some damage is poorly repaired. For example, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) are one of the major DNA lesions induced by UV irradiation and &#x0003e;50&#x00025; of them are not repaired within 24 h in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c1">1</xref>). Unrepaired damage can interfere with basic cellular processes such as DNA replication and transcription and can lead to mutations and cell death. Inhibition of DNA replication by DNA lesions can be overcome by a post-replication repair pathway. This pathway has &#x02018;damage tolerance&#x02019; mechanisms of repair, including translesion synthesis, sister chromatid exchange and template switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c1">1</xref>).</p><p>Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a human autosomal recessive disease clinically associated with extreme sensitivity to sunlight and a high incidence of skin cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c2">2</xref>). XP has been classified into eight complementation groups, XP-A&#x02013;XP-G and the XP variant (XP-V). Unlike the classical XP cells (XP-A&#x02013;XP-G), XP-V cells show no defect in nucleotide excision repair; however, they are defective in replication after UV irradiation and demonstrate UV hypermutability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c4">4</xref>). Some groups have reported that extracts from XP-V cells lacked bypass replication when UV-induced CPDs were present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c7">7</xref>). From these results, the <italic>XPV</italic> gene product is suspected to be part of the post-replication repair pathway and to act as a translesion synthesis factor. The UV hypermutability of XP-V cells could be due to abnormal replication after UV irradiation. We recently identified the <italic>XPV</italic> gene product from HeLa cell extracts and found that it acts as a novel DNA polymerase which can bypass CPD damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c9">9</xref>). The XPV protein incorporated two dAMPs against the di-thymine dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c8">8</xref>), suggesting that XPV is a relatively accurate translesion polymerase. Johnson <italic>et al</italic>. (1999) reported that the yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>RAD30</italic> gene encodes a novel DNA polymerase (polymerase &#x003b7;) which can replicate past CPD damage by incorporating two dAMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c10">10</xref>). As XPV shares amino acid homology with Rad30 and has similar biochemical activity, we concluded that XPV is the corresponding human DNA polymerase &#x003b7;.</p><p>The Rad30 and XPV proteins have no obvious motifs of known DNA polymerases but share homology with the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DinB and UmuC and yeast Rev1 proteins, which are involved in translesion synthesis following damage-induced mutagenesis. Recent biochemical studies revealed that all of these proteins possess DNA polymerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c14">14</xref>). These novel polymerases belong to the UmuC&#x0002f;DinB&#x0002f;Rad30 superfamily. This family is classified into two sub-families, of relatively accurate and mutagenic polymerases, by the fidelity of the newly synthesized DNA that bypasses the lesion. As mentioned above, DNA polymerase &#x003b7; inserts only adenine bases opposite the thymine residues of CPD, which suggests that polymerase &#x003b7; belongs to the relatively accurate polymerase family. In contrast, <italic>E.coli</italic> Pol IV (DinB), Pol V (the complex of UmuC and UmuD&#x02032;; UmuD&#x02032;<sub>2</sub>C) and yeast Rev1 belong to the mutagenic polymerases. In yeast, not only Rev1 but the Rev3 and Rev7 proteins are also key elements of the mutagenic pathway. A complex of Rev3 and Rev7, designated DNA polymerase &#x003b6;, can replicate past a CPD lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c15">15</xref>). In addition, the human homologs of the <italic>dinB</italic>, <italic>REV1</italic> and <italic>REV3</italic> genes have been cloned, suggesting that both relatively accurate and mutagenic translesion pathways are present in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c20">20</xref>). In XP-V patients unrepaired lesions are more likely to be bypassed by the mutagenic pathway, because of inactivation of the relatively accurate pathway. As a result, XP-V patients suffer from a high incidence of skin cancer. However, regulation of the two sub-pathways in mammalian cells is still unclear and the mouse model of translesion synthesis may be an effective tool to understand the roles of these pathways <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In this study we have isolated a mouse homolog of <italic>XPV</italic> and examined its expression profile during cell proliferation and after UV irradiation. Moreover, we show that both human and mouse <italic>XPV</italic> can complement the defect in human XP-V cells <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Screening of a mouse cDNA library</title><p>A mouse FM3A cDNA library in &#x003bb;gt10 was screened with the coding region of human <italic>XPV</italic> (<italic>hXPV</italic>) cDNA as probe.

Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the two proteins revealed an overall 80.3&#x00025; amino acid identity and 86.9&#x00025; similarity. We found previously that the N-terminal half of the hXPV protein has seven amino acid sequences conserved among damage bypass replication proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c9">9</xref>). These regions were also well conserved in the mXPV protein. In contrast, the C-terminal portion, especially amino acids beyond residue 500, were less conserved between the human and mouse proteins, although the last 80 amino acids, including a putative nuclear localization signal, were conserved in both proteins. Thus, the N-terminal amino acids appear to be important for the translesion activity of polymerase &#x003b7;.</p></sec><sec><title>CPD bypass DNA polymerase activity of recombinant mXPV protein</title><p>To examine the properties of the mXPV protein, we expressed the recombinant protein tagged with hexa-histidine at its C-terminal end using a baculovirus protein expression system. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd389f2">2</xref>A, the mXPV and hXPV proteins were purified to near homogeneity after a three-step purification. While the mXPV protein is 20 amino acids smaller than hXPV, the recombinant mXPV migrated slightly slower than the recombinant human protein on SDS&#x02013;PAGE, suggesting that the mouse protein has unique structural sequences, perhaps in the less conserved C-terminal region.</p><p>The DNA polymerase activities of purified recombinant proteins were measured by incorporation of &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;dCMP into singly primed phagemid templates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd389f2">2</xref>B). mXPV showed DNA polymerase activity, although the activity was slightly lower than that of hXPV when equal amounts of the proteins were examined. The amounts of mouse and human proteins with the same level of DNA polymerase activity were added to reactions in the following experiments.</p><p>Damage bypass DNA polymerase activity of mXPV was assayed with a 30mer template DNA containing a lesion annealed with a labeled 13mer primer. Both hXPV and mXPV bypassed CPD damage and synthesized DNA up to 30 nt in length (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd389f2">2</xref>C, lanes 8&#x02013;11), whereas DNA polymerase &#x003b1; stopped DNA synthesis 1 nt before the CPD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd389f2">2</xref>C, lane 12). mXPV and hXPV incorporated dAMPs to bypass the CPD lesion (data not shown). On the (6&#x02013;4) photoproduct-containing template neither hXPV nor mXPV protein bypassed the lesion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd389f2">2</xref>C, lanes 14&#x02013;17). From these results we conclude that the <italic>mXPV</italic> gene we identified here encodes a mouse DNA polymerase &#x003b7;.</p><p>We also confirmed that the mouse polymerase &#x003b7; complemented the defective translesion synthesis in XP-V cell extracts <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as the human enzyme (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Correction of UV sensitivity of XP-V cells by transfection of <italic>XPV</italic> cDNA</title><p>XP-V cells are known to be slightly more sensitive to UV light than normal cells. However, the sensitivity of XP-V cells to UV light is enhanced in the presence of caffeine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c24">24</xref>). So we examined whether the sensitivity of XP-V cells to UV light was corrected by transfection of <italic>hXPV</italic> or <italic>mXPV</italic> cDNA in the presence of caffeine. The <italic>hXPV</italic> and <italic>mXPV</italic> cDNAs were subcloned into the pRC&#x0002f;CMV vector, in which the genes are expressed under the regulation of a CMV promoter, and transfected into XP7TA cells. Stably transfected mass populations were obtained as described in Materials and Methods. These transformants, untransfected XP7TA and translesion-proficient WI38-VA13 cells were examined for UV sensitivity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd389f3">3</xref>). WI38-VA13 cells demonstrated normal resistance to UV irradiation in the presence or absence of 1 mM caffeine (data not shown). On the other hand, XP7TA (XP-V) cells and the transformants containing the vector with no insert were extremely sensitive to UV irradiation in the presence of caffeine. The sensitivity of the transformants containing <italic>hXPV</italic> or <italic>mXPV</italic> cDNA to UV irradiation was corrected and the cells demonstrated normal resistance to UV irradiation, although the correction by human cDNA was not complete. This partial complementation by <italic>hXPV</italic> cDNA might be caused by instability of the mRNA or protein. It is possible that the mRNA of <italic>hXPV</italic> used in this experiment might be more unstable than that of <italic>mXPV</italic>, because <italic>hXPV</italic> cDNA in this construct contained three motifs for mRNA selective degradation (ATTTA) in its 3&#x02032;-UTR, whereas no degradation signal was included in the construct for <italic>mXPV</italic>. Although these points must be clarified in the future, we conclude here that <italic>mXPV</italic> as well as <italic>hXPV</italic> can complement the defects in XP-V cells both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of the <italic>mXPV</italic> gene in mouse tissues</title><p>Expression of <italic>mXPV</italic> in various mouse tissues was examined by northern blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd389f4">4</xref>). The <italic>mXPV</italic> mRNA was detected as an ~3.2 kb transcript, which is in agreement with the size of the cDNA, in all tissues examined except testis, where a slightly smaller transcript was observed. When the expressed level of <italic>mXPV</italic> was normalized against that of &#x003b2;-actin in each tissue, expression of the <italic>mXPV</italic> gene was higher in testis, liver, skin and thymus than other tissues, especially in non-proliferating tissues such as brain, heart and skeletal muscle.</p></sec><sec><title>Induction of <italic>mXPV</italic> transcripts in the cells stimulated to proliferate</title><p>The steady-state level of mRNA for DNA polymerase &#x003b1;, which is involved in DNA replication, is known to increase markedly when quiescent cells are stimulated to proliferate by serum addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c26">26</xref>). In contrast, DNA polymerase &#x003b2;, which is involved in the base excision repair pathway, is expressed constantly throughout cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c27">27</xref>) but is induced by DNA-damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c28">28</xref>). To determine the expression profile of <italic>mXPV</italic> (polymerase &#x003b7;) during cell proliferation, we arrested Swiss 3T3 cells in the G<sub>0</sub> phase by serum deprivation and then induced their proliferation by the addition of serum. DNA synthesis, measured by incorporation of &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;thymidine into cells, increased from 12 h after serum stimulation and reached its maximum at 20 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd389f5">5</xref>B). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c26">26</xref>), the expression level of the 68 kDa subunit of DNA polymerase &#x003b1; was suppressed by serum starvation (compare log phase with 0 h in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd389f5">5</xref>A) and increased dramatically prior to DNA synthesis following the addition of serum (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd389f5">5</xref>A with B). The mRNA level of <italic>mXPV</italic> was also suppressed by serum starvation, increased gradually after serum stimulation and rose to a maximum (~4-fold) at 20 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd389f5">5</xref>A and B). Expression of <italic>EF-1a</italic> was not affected by deprivation or addition of serum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd389f5">5</xref>A). These results suggest that <italic>mXPV</italic> might play a role in the proliferation of cells, although the stimulation profile and induction rate of <italic>mXPV</italic> were different from those of DNA polymerase &#x003b1;.</p><p>In Swiss 3T3 cells two transcripts of ~4.5 and ~3.2 kb were detected, whereas only the smaller one was detected in mRNA from various mouse tissues (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd389f4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd389f5">5</xref>A). These transcripts might arise as a result of alternative splicing or alternative use of polyadenylation signals, but we have not confirmed these possibilities. It is possible that this might reflect the differences between somatic cells and cultured cell lines, because we detected only the smaller transcript in two independent northern blots of different tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd389f4">4</xref>), whereas both transcripts were detected in northern blots of RNA extracted from FM3A and 129Sv cells as well as Swiss 3T3 cells (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>mXPV</italic> was not induced by UV irradiation</title><p>Yeast <italic>RAD30</italic>, which encodes yeast polymerase &#x003b7;, is induced by DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c30">30</xref>). To investigate whether <italic>XPV</italic> (mammalian polymerase &#x003b7;) is also induced by DNA damage, Swiss 3T3 cells in log phase were irradiated with 10 J&#x0002f;m<sup>2</sup> UV light and mRNA was isolated for northern blot analysis at the indicated times after UV irradiation. The levels of <italic>p21</italic> and <italic>EF-1</italic>&#x003b1; mRNA were measured as controls, as the former is known to be induced by DNA damage and the latter is not. As expected, expression of <italic>p21</italic> increased from 1 h after UV irradiation and rose to a maximum at 4 h, while the expression of <italic>EF-1</italic>&#x003b1; was not influenced by UV irradiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd389f5">5</xref>C). In contrast, expression of <italic>mXPV</italic> decreased at 2 h after UV irradiation but recovered gradually and returned to the level of unirradiated cells at 24 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd389f5">5</xref>D). Expression of the 68 kDa subunit of DNA polymerase &#x003b1; also decreased after UV irradiation, reached its lowest level at 4 h and then recovered gradually. There are two possible explanations for this reduction in mRNA after UV irradiation. First, the gene is down-regulated by UV irradiation, including indirect effects via cell cycle arrest. Second, the transcripts of the genes are unstable. Inhibition of <italic>de novo</italic> syntheses of the transcripts by UV irradiation or rapid degradation of the transcripts would result in a reduction in the amount of the transcripts in cells. As <italic>mXPV</italic> has a potential degradation signal for mRNA (ATTTA) in its 3&#x02032;-UTR (data not shown), the latter case is likely to occur, although we could not exclude the former possibility. In any case, we concluded from these results that the expression of <italic>mXPV</italic> was not induced by UV irradiation, in contrast to that of yeast <italic>RAD30</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In recent years novel DNA polymerases, which can bypass DNA lesions, have been identified in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans and categorized into the UmuC&#x0002f;DinB&#x0002f;Rad30 superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c34">34</xref>). XPV, human DNA polymerase &#x003b7;, belongs to this family and can replicate past UV-induced CPD lesions in a relatively accurate manner. In this paper we have isolated and characterized a cDNA of the mouse homolog of <italic>XPV</italic> (<italic>mXPV</italic>).</p><sec><title><italic>mXPV</italic> and <italic>hXPV</italic> correct the defects of XP-V cells <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Recombinant mXPV protein demonstrated CPD bypass polymerase activity, indicating that mXPV is the mouse DNA polymerase &#x003b7;. hXPV protein also demonstrated this activity. mXPV protein could correct the translesion defect of XP-V cell extracts in our cell-free system (data not shown). Moreover, transfection of <italic>mXPV</italic> or <italic>hXPV</italic> cDNA into XP-V cells resulted in complementation of the defect and loss of UV sensitivity. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that the <italic>XPV</italic> gene can correct the UV sensitivity of XP-V cells.</p><p>During DNA replication, when the replication fork is blocked by a lesion the replicative polymerases must be exchanged with a translesion DNA polymerase, i.e. polymerase &#x003b7;. Recently we found that the human polymerase &#x003b7; replicates undamaged DNA with very low fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c35">35</xref>), suggesting that the function of the polymerase is restricted to synthesis of a few nucleotides past the lesion. Thus, it would be expected that there are mechanisms for efficient and regulated polymerase switching, such as a specific protein&#x02013;protein interaction between polymerase &#x003b7; and the replication machinery. Our finding that the mouse protein substituted for the human protein indicates that the conserved N-termini of XPV proteins are responsible for these functions. Studies of the molecular mechanism of translesion DNA synthesis and identification of the functional domains in XPV proteins are required to clarify these mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression profile of the <italic>mXPV</italic> gene</title><p>The northern blot analysis revealed that expression of <italic>mXPV</italic> was not induced by UV irradiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd389f5">5</xref>C and D). In yeast, in contrast, <italic>RAD30</italic> was shown to be induced ~4-fold by UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c30">30</xref>). Thus, the transcriptional regulation of polymerase &#x003b7; is different in mammals compared to yeast.</p><p>Although <italic>mXPV</italic> was not induced by UV irradiation, expression of <italic>mXPV</italic> was elevated ~4-fold during cell proliferation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd389f5">5</xref>A and B). <italic>mXPV</italic> expression increased with the onset of DNA synthesis, whereas the level of mRNA for the DNA polymerase &#x003b1; 68 kDa subunit rose to a maximum before DNA synthesis. Not only DNA polymerase &#x003b1; but also chromosomal replicative DNA polymerases &#x003b4; and &#x0025b; are known to be induced before DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c37">37</xref>). Although the induction profile of <italic>mXPV</italic> transcription was different from those of replicative DNA polymerases, this result indicates that expression of <italic>mXPV</italic> is dependent on cell proliferation. In addition, tissue northern blot analysis showed that levels of mRNA for <italic>mXPV</italic> were elevated in testis, thymus, liver and skin compared with the levels in other tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd389f4">4</xref>). These tissues contain a significant proportion of proliferating cells, suggesting that <italic>mXPV</italic> plays a role in DNA replication, although further analyses are required to reach a firm conclusion. In yeast and humans, however, mutations in the polymerase &#x003b7; gene are not lethal to cells, indicating that polymerase &#x003b7; is not essential for the replication of chromosomal DNA. Recently we found that the human polymerase &#x003b7; can bypass spontaneously induced oxidative damage, e.g. abasic sites in addition to CPD lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c38">38</xref>). Although polymerase &#x003b7; is not involved in the basal DNA replication process, it is possible that polymerase &#x003b7; is required for efficient progression of DNA replication in cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Translesion synthesis in rodent cells</title><p>UV-induced DNA damage is known to be repaired by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. In rodent cells pyrimidine dimers in genomic DNA are known to be poorly repaired by NER compared to that in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c39">39</xref>). We have shown here that the <italic>mXPV</italic> gene carried out a function similar to the human gene in rodent cells, strongly suggesting that relatively accurate translesion synthesis is functioning in rodent cells. Additionally, the mouse homolog of <italic>REV3</italic> has been isolated, suggesting that mutagenic translesion synthesis could also function in rodent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c40">40</xref>). However, the relationship between the repair pathway and translesion synthesis and their contributions to cell survival or carcinogenesis remain unclear. In rodents, UV-sensitive mutant cells, referred to as ERCC (excision repair cross complementing) cells, have been isolated as 11 complementation groups. Cell lines representing eight of these groups have mutations in the genes responsible for XP and another UV-sensitive hereditary disorder Cockayne&#x02019;s syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd389c41">41</xref>). Although the mutations in the remaining three complementation groups (ERCC7, 9 and 10) have not been identified, our preliminary experiments demonstrate that expression of the <italic>mXPV</italic> gene in these cells is normal (data not shown). Since <italic>mXPV</italic> mutant cells have not been cloned yet, <italic>XPV</italic>-deficient mice may provide a good model to analyze these mechanisms, in addition to the function of <italic>XPV in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd389f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Alignment of deduced amino acid sequences of hXPV and mXPV proteins.
