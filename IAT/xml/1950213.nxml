TLR2 is seen as the most important receptor for gram-positive bacteria, while TLR4 is regarded as the gram-negative TLR.

We aimed to characterize the expression and function of TLRs in septic melioidosis.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Patient studies: 34 patients with melioidosis demonstrated increased expression of CD14, TLR1, TLR2, and TLR4 on the cell surfaces of monocytes and granulocytes, and increased <italic>CD14, TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, LY96</italic> (also known as <italic>MD-2</italic>), <italic>TLR5,</italic> and <italic>TLR10</italic> mRNA levels in purified monocytes and granulocytes when compared with healthy controls.

In addition, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> signals through TLR2 and not through TLR4. Mouse studies: Surprisingly, TLR4 KO mice were indistinguishable from wild-type mice with respect to bacterial outgrowth and survival in experimentally induced melioidosis.

This soil-dwelling pathogen (disease-causing organism) enters the body through cuts, by swallowed contaminated water, or by inhaled contaminated dust. Here, it can cause a severe lung infection or spread into the blood stream and around the body, where it causes widespread inflammation (sepsis) and organ failure. Untreated septic melioidosis is usually fatal. Even with antibiotic therapy, half the people who develop it in Thailand (a hot spot for melioidosis) die. <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> is a &#x0201c;gram-negative&#x0201d; bacterium. That is, it is surrounded by a membrane that stops it taking up a stain used to detect bacteria. This membrane contains a molecule called lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Proteins on immune system cells called Toll-like receptors (TLRs), of which there are many, recognize LPS and other surface molecules common to different pathogens and tell the cells to make cytokines. These cytokines stimulate the immune system to kill the pathogen but also cause inflammation, the underlying problem in septic melioidosis and other forms of sepsis. In other words, TLRs are two-edged swords&#x02014;they provide an essential first-line defense against pathogens, but cause life-threatening inflammation if overstimulated.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>It isn't known which TLRs are involved in melioidosis. TLR4 normally detects LPS, but the surface of <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> also carries molecules that interact with TLR2. Understanding how <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> interacts with TLRs might suggest new, more effective ways to treat septic melioidosis. Better remedies for this disease are badly needed because, as well as the infections it causes in the community, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> as a potential bioterrorism agent. In this study, the researchers have characterized the expression and function of TLRs in septic melioidosis using human, in vitro (test tube), and animal approaches.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers isolated monocytes and granulocytes (immune system cells involved in first-line defenses against pathogens) from patients with melioidosis and from healthy people. The patients' cells made more TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, and CD14 (a protein that enhances the activation of immune system cells by LPS) than those of the healthy controls and more of the mRNAs encoding several other TLRs. Next, the researchers tested the ability of heat-killed <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> to induce the release of TNF&#x003b1; (a cytokine produced in response to TLR signaling) from macrophages (immune system cells that swallow up pathogens) isolated from wild-type mice and from mice lacking TLR2 or TLR4. Macrophages isolated from wild-type mice made more TNF&#x003b1; than those from TLR2- or TLR4-deficient mice. In addition, a human kidney cell line engineered to express CD14/TLR2 or CD14/TLR4 but not the parent cell line released IL8 (another cytokine) when stimulated with heat-killed <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content>. Other experiments in these human cell lines showed that LPS purified from <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> signals through TLR2 but not through TLR4. Finally, the researchers tested the ability of TLR2- and TLR4-deficient mice to survive after infection with live <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content>. Compared with TLR4-deficient or wild-type mice, the TLR2-deficient mice had a strong survival advantage, a lower bacterial load, reduced lung inflammation, and less organ damage.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings show that people with melioidosis have increased expression of several TLRs, any one of which might cause the sepsis associated with <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> infection. The in vitro findings indicate that TLR2 and TLR4 both contribute to the responsiveness of immune cells to <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> in test tubes, but that only TLR2 detects the LPS of this bacterium. This unexpected result&#x02014;TLR4 normally responds to LPS&#x02014;might indicate that there is something unique about the LPS of <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content>. Finally, the survival of TLR2-deficient mice after infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> suggests that TLR2-mediated dysregulation of the immune system in response to invasive <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> might cause septic melioidosis. Although these results need confirming in people, they suggest that inhibition of TLR2 in combination with antibiotic therapy might improve outcomes for people with melioidosis.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040248">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040248</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Information is available from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/melioidosis_g.htm">melioidosis</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The UK Health Protection Agency provides information for the public and health professionals on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/melioidosis/menu.htm">melioidosis</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>Wikipedia has pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melioidosis">melioidosis</ext-link> and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor">Toll-like receptors</ext-link> (note: Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit; available in several languages)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The MedlinePlus encyclopedia contains a page on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000666.htm">sepsis</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Wiersinga WJ, Wieland CW, Dessing MC, Chantratita N, Cheng AC, et al.

In general, the immune activation that follows the interaction between TLRs and PAMPs is sufficient to eliminate the wide variety of pathogens that daily invade the human body.

We made the following key observations. (1) Patients with septic melioidosis have increased expression of CD14, TLR1, TLR2, and TLR4 on the cell surfaces of circulating monocytes and granulocytes and increased levels of mRNAs encoding CD14, LY96, TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR8, and TLR10 in peripheral blood cells. (2) Both TLR2 and TLR4 contribute to cellular responsiveness to <italic>Burkholderia</italic> in vitro, as reflected by reduced TNF&#x003b1; release by alveolar macrophages and whole blood from TLR2 KO and TLR4 KO mice and by activation of HEK293 cells stably transfected with either TLR2 or TLR4 upon incubation with <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content>. (3) The LPS of <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> signals through TLR2 and not through TLR4. And (4) TLR4 is not important for protective immunity against experimentally induced melioidosis, whereas TLR2 is associated with the growth and dissemination of the infection, significantly contributing to distant organ injury and lethality.</p><p>Our study is, to our knowledge, the first to provide insights into the relative gene expression of all TLR family members in peripheral blood monocytes and granulocytes in patients with severe sepsis. In blood samples obtained from 34 prospectively enrolled patients with sepsis caused by <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content>, we showed that a whole repertoire of TLRs is up-regulated at the mRNA level in both monocytes and granulocytes. Of note, patients showed enhanced monocyte and granulocyte expression of three of four TLR4 splice variants. TLR4 variant R02 remained undetectable, which is consistent with our earlier study examining alveolar macrophages from healthy humans challenged with LPS via the airways &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. TLR4 variant R01 is involved in LPS binding and triggering of intracellular signal transduction cascades, while variants R03 and R04 lack residues 24&#x02013;34, which are essential for LY96 (MD2) binding and LPS signaling &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. The expression of TLR3 mRNA was very low in both patients and healthy controls, which can be explained by the fact that this intracellular receptor is primarily expressed by dendritic cells and to a lesser extent B and T cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b032">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, we could not detect <italic>TLR9</italic> mRNA in monocytes or granulocytes, which is in line with studies showing that <italic>TLR9</italic> mRNA in particular is expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B cells. The increase in mRNAs encoding CD14, TLR1, TLR2, and TLR4 was accompanied by enhanced surface expression of the respective proteins circulating neutrophils and granulocytes. This is in accordance with two earlier clinical reports, which found increased expression of TLR2 and TLR4 on neutrophils and monocytes from septic patients &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Humans usually acquire melioidosis by inoculation through skin abrasions or inhalation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Pneumonia with bacterial dissemination to distant body sites is a common presentation of melioidosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. We decided to develop a mouse model in which <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> was administered via the airways, since this route may be more clinically relevant than the intraperitoneal route used in several previous studies. We reproduced the major clinical characteristics of melioidosis, with rapid spread of bacteria to distant organs, multiple organ failure and abscess formation. Among the TLRs with enhanced expression in patients with melioidosis, we considered TLR2 and TLR4 most interesting with respect to the impact of their loss of function in experimentally induced melioidosis in mice. Indeed, of the other TLRs that showed increased expression, TLR1 has been implicated as a co-receptor together with TLR2 in the recognition of bacterial triacyl lipopeptides, whereas TLR8 senses single-stranded viral RNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, although TLR5, as the receptor that recognizes flagellin, in theory may be involved in host defense against <italic>B. pseudomallei,</italic> a recent report suggests that TLR5 especially or exclusively senses pathogenic flagellated bacteria present in the intestinal lumen, whereas the expression of this receptor was low in the mouse lung &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>A remarkable and unexpected finding was that, although TLR4 appeared very important for cellular responsiveness to <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040248-g002">Figure 2</xref>), this receptor does not significantly contribute to host defense against melioidosis in vivo. In line with these in vivo observations, we demonstrated that purified LPS from <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> 1026b (the strain also used in the in vivo infection studies) activates HEK293 cells via TLR2, not via TLR4. The evidence that TLR4 has an important role in gram-negative infections is exclusively derived from models using bacteria that express LPS recognized by TLR4 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Indeed, TLR4-deficient mice are more susceptible to gram-negative sepsis due to <named-content content-type="genus-species">Salmonella typhimurium</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> and to gram-negative pneumonia due to <italic>Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae,</italic> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Acinetobacter baumannii</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b038">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. Of note, <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> LPS differs in several aspects from the LPS of other gram-negative organisms: <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> LPS exhibits weaker pyrogenic activity in rodents compared with enterobacterial LPS &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;, and LPS-mediated activation of mouse macrophages in vitro is slower for LPS from <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> than for <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> LPS &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. In this respect it is of interest that our laboratory previously established that TLR4 is not involved in host defense against pulmonary infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species">Legionella pneumophila</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;, a gram-negative bacterium of which the LPS, like <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> LPS, is a weak inducer of proinflammatory cytokine production by mononuclear cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. Hence, it is conceivable that absent or insufficient LPS sensing by TLR4 makes this receptor redundant during infection in vivo with <italic>Legionella</italic> or <italic>Burkholderia</italic>. In addition, the recent finding that TLR4 does not mediate resistance against acute lung infection due to <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> suggests that for some gram-negative pathogens signaling to other pattern recognition receptors may compensate for the loss of LPS&#x02013;TLR4 signaling &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>TLR2 is a promiscuous pattern recognition receptor recognizing multiple ligands expressed by a variety of microorganisms such as <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> (diacyl lipopeptides), mycobacteria (triacyl lipopeptides, lipoarabinomannan), fungi (zymosan, phospholipomannan), parasites (tGPI-mutin), and viruses (hemagglutinin protein from measles virus and unidentified structures of herpes simplex virus) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.

We here found that TLR2 contributes to the responsiveness of cells to <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> using two complementary approaches: TLR2 KO macrophages and blood produced less TNF&#x003b1; upon stimulation with <italic>Burkholderia</italic>, whereas TLR2 transfected HEK293 cells released large amounts of IL8 upon incubation with this bacterium. In addition, we identified <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> LPS as a TLR2 ligand. Conceivably, <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> expresses more TLR2 ligands, with peptidoglycan and lipopeptides being possible candidates. The interaction between <italic>Burkholderia</italic> and TLR2 clearly impairs the protective immune response against this bacterium, as reflected by the fact that TLR2 KO mice displayed a strongly reduced mortality during experimental melioidosis, which was associated with a diminished bacterial growth and dissemination, and reduced distant organ injury. Previously, TLR2 KO mice were found to be less susceptible to lethal infections with <named-content content-type="genus-species">Yersinia enterocolitica</named-content> or <named-content content-type="genus-species">Candida albicans</named-content> through a mechanism that likely involved a stronger type 1 cytokine response due to diminished production of the prototypic type 2 cytokine IL10 during infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;. In the case of <italic>Candida</italic> infection, TLR2 induced proliferation and survival of regulatory T cells, which appeared largely responsible for the increased IL10 release induced by TLR2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;.

First, the differences in IL10 concentrations between TLR2 KO and WT mice were minor and much less profound than the concurrent differences in the proinflammatory cytokine TNF&#x003b1;. Second, the concentrations of the prototypic type 1 cytokine interferon gamma remained very low or undetectable throughout the entire observation period (unpublished data). Finally, antibody-mediated depletion of regulatory T cells did not influence the outcome of melioidosis in our model (unpublished data). More studies are warranted to dissect the exact mechanism by which TLR2 facilitates the growth and spread of <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> in vivo.</p><p>Melioidosis is a debilitating disease with an unacceptably high mortality rate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040248-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. We here demonstrate that the expression of multiple TLRs is up-regulated in peripheral blood leukocytes in septic patients with melioidosis. Most remarkable, although our results show that both TLR2 and TLR4 contribute to cellular responsiveness to <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> in vitro, TLR2 detects the LPS of <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content> and only TLR2 impacts on the immune response of the intact host in vivo. Of note, TLR4 does not contribute to protective immunity in this severe gram-negative infection. Taken together, these findings suggest that septic melioidosis can be seen as the clinical manifestation of a TLR-mediated dysregulation of the immune response to invasive <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. pseudomallei</named-content>. In addition, this report further undermines the paradigm regarding TLR4 as &#x0201c;the gram-negative receptor&#x0201d; and TLR2 as &#x0201c;the gram-positive receptor.&#x0201d; Inhibition of TLR2 may be a useful adjunctive therapy for melioidosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0040248-sa001"><label>Alternative Language Abstract S1</label><caption><title>Translation of the abstract into Thai by Direk Limmathurotsakul</title><p>(74 KB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0040248.sd001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to the staff of Sappasitiprasong Hospital, especially Professor Wipada Chaowagul.
