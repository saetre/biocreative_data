While a majority of the methylated residues are in the symmetrical (meC)pG:Gp(meC) configuration, a smaller, but significant fraction is found in the CpA, CpT and CpC asymmetric (non-CpG) dinucleotides. CpG methylation is reproducibly maintained by the activity of the DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) on the newly replicated hemimethylated substrates (meC)pG:GpC. On the other hand, establishment and hereditary maintenance of non-CpG methylation patterns have not been analyzed in detail. We previously reported the occurrence of site- and allele-specific methylation at both CpG and non-CpG sites. Here we characterize a hereditary complex of non-CpG methylation, with the transgenerational maintenance of three distinct profiles in a constant ratio, associated with extensive CpG methylation. These observations raised the question of the signal leading to the maintenance of the pattern of asymmetric methylation. The complete non-CpG pattern was reinstated at each generation in spite of the fact that the majority of the sperm genomes contained either none or only one methylated non-CpG site. This observation led us to the hypothesis that the stable CpG patterns might act as blueprints for the maintenance of non-CpG DNA methylation. As predicted, non-CpG DNA methylation profiles were abrogated in a mutant lacking Dnmt1, the enzymes responsible for CpG methylation, but not in mutants defective for either Dnmt3a or Dnmt2.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the key mechanisms of epigenetic modification of vertebrate genomes is the methylation of cytosine residues in the DNA sequence.

Methylation in the symmetric dinucleotides CpG:GpC is an important determinant of chromatin structure, playing a role in gene silencing and in the control of imprinted genes.

The enzymes required for non CpG DNA methylation in mammals have been analyzed in ES cells where, by contrast to somatic cells, a high percentage of non CpG DNA methylation has been found. Although the Dnmt1 protein is not required for their presence, the <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and/or Dnmt3b are thought to be mainly responsible for the CpA and CpT methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001136-Ramsahoye1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001136-Dodge1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. However, while most of the studies performed on non CpG DNA methylation in mammals, accounts for the presence of this modification at specific sites of the genome, neither the maintenance of this type of epigenetic modification over large number of generations nor the signals leading to the inheritance of this epigenetic modification have been investigated in details.</p><p>Starting from our previous observation of defined CpG and non-CpG methylation patterns induced by Cre-LoxP interaction in meiotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001136-Rassoulzadegan1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, we investigated the mechanisms of inheritance of these epigenetic marks. We performed a systematic analysis of one of these patterns involving both CpG and non-CpG methylations in a mutant <italic>Rxr</italic>&#x003b1; locus. Three distinct methylation profiles were evidenced at each generation, in constant ratios in all somatic tissues, were found stable over more than 15 generations. Non-CpG DNA methylation was strictly allele-specific, never affecting the wild type locus in heterozygotes. One half of the DNA molecules in this complex, at each generation and in every organ including sperm, were exclusively methylated at CpG sites, thus raising the question of the nature of the epigenetic signal transmitted with the unique copy of the sperm genome to regenerate in the next generation the constant ratio of three distinct profiles.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Hereditary maintenance of a complex pattern of non-CpG methylation</title><p>We previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001136-Rassoulzadegan1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> that interaction of the Cre recombinase with a <italic>LoxP</italic> element in meiotic cells leads to the establishment of defined patterns of DNA methylation, extending into the neighboring sequences and involving both CpG and non-CpG sequences. To further investigate their mode of inheritance, mouse families were independently derived from parents in which such a methylated complex had been initiated at a <italic>LoxP</italic> element in intron 3 of the <italic>AF1</italic> mutant of the <italic>Rxr</italic>&#x003b1; gene.

Three classes of methylated molecules were identified, in constant ratios in somatic organs (tail, kidney, liver) and testes at the successive generations and in distinct families. In addition to a constant pattern of CpG methylation, half of the amplified molecules were free of non-CpG methylation, one third showed one methylated CpT, and 15 per cent contained three to five methylated non-CpG cytosines, always at the same positions in the sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001136-g001">Fig 1</xref>).The modified locus was transmitted with equal high efficiencies by the male and the female parents. Families were bred in the B6D2 F1 hybrid genetic background, but the results were not dependent on this genetic set up, as the same observations were made after crosses with either C57BL/6 or 129/SV mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001136-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0001136-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001136.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Allele-specific maintenance of a complex methylation pattern.</title><p>A.

First, artificial protection of a cytosine residue never occurs at constant sequence positions and never follows defined patterns. Secondly, non-CpG DNA methylation was specific to the mutant allele since we never evidenced such methylation in the allelic region of the wild type allele in heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001136-g001">Fig 1</xref>).

Inheritance via the male gamete would seem to exclude such a possibility, since histones are replaced by protamines in a generalized highly compact state of the sperm chromatin. Since, however, a minor fraction of the genome was reported to remain in the form of nucleohistones, we checked whether this might be the case of the <italic>Rxr</italic>&#x003b1; locus by fractionating histone and protamine associated DNA according to the published procedures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001136-GardinerGarden1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001136-Pittoggi1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

Among the four mammalian DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt1 has been considered as the main enzyme responsible for the maintenance of CpG methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001136-Hermann1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. To determine whether this enzyme might be involved in the maintenance of non-CpG methylation profiles, we analyzed the status of this region in mice homozygous for a <italic>Dnmt1</italic> null mutation. The necessary crosses were performed to generate the methylated <italic>Rxr</italic>&#x003b1;<italic><sup>AF1</sup></italic>, <italic>Dnmt1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> genotype.

If, as expected, CpG methylation was disturbed in <italic>Dnmt1</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> homozygotes, although not completely suppressed, it was unexpectedly observed that the non-CpG profiles were abolished. The majority of the amplified molecules were either not at all or only partially methylated. Importantly, even in the latter class, none of the profiles followed the reproducible pattern of <italic>Dnmt1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> animals.</p><fig id="pone-0001136-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001136.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>DNA methylation analysis in the modified Rxr&#x003b1; locus of Dnmt1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</title><p>Bisulfite sequencing analysis at the <italic>LoxP</italic> site in 8.5 <italic>dpc</italic> embryos either heterozygous or homozygous for the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> null mutation, including representative examples of partially methylated molecules.

Still, the mechanisms leading to the establishment and maintenance of methylation patterns are largely unknown. Most of the currently available information concerns methylation in the symmetrical CpG dinucleotides. Much less is known of the somatic and germ line maintenance of the non CpG methylation pattern observed in animal and plant cells. We previously described experimental conditions under which both CpG and non-CpG methylations are established de novo in the mouse. Dependent on an initial heterologous recombination event (Cre-LoxP) in a meiotic cell, they are subsequently maintained in the absence of the recombinase. Our original observations included two loci of the mouse genome, namely the <italic>Rxr</italic>&#x003b1; and ROSA26 genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001136-Rassoulzadegan1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, and further studies were concentrated on the well-defined <italic>Rxr</italic>&#x003b1; site. As the initiation event was repeatedly reproduced from naive unmethylated mice, and families subsequently established and propagated, we were in a position to ascertain their somatic stability and heritability.</p><p>We determined that a unique CpG methylation profile is associated with a complex pattern of non-CpG methylation constituted by three distinct profiles, present in constant proportions and inherited in successive generations. Several criteria indicated a strictly controlled process. First, methylation is allele-specific, never involving the wild type allele in heterozygotes. Second, cytosines at the same positions were found methylated in animals independently generated from unmethylated parent. Third, once established, this dynamic pattern was identically reproduced in the progeny.</p><p>Substantiating a previous suggestion by Imamura et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001136-Imamura1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, our results suggest that non-CpG methylation depends on the prior establishment of a CpG methylation pattern, the only feature that seems to be common to all the sperm nuclei of modified males. On the other hand, based on our current understanding of the activity of Dnmt1 being primarily, if not exclusively the methylation of CpG sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001136-Hermann1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, it seems unlikely that other cytosines could be directly recognized as substrates of the enzyme. Our results exclude Dnmt3a (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001136-t002">Table 2</xref>), at least as the only effector, and the involvement of either Dnmt3b or 3l, as well as other chromatin-associated protein(s) able to recognize the methylated regions might also be involved, will have to be the subject of further studies. Such a model would also agree with our previous observation that, in the initial process of establishment of DNA methylation upon Cre-LoxP interaction, non-CpG methylation occurred only after the establishment of CpG methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001136-Rassoulzadegan1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>While CpG methylation has been associated with well defined regulatory processes such as parental imprinting and X chromosome inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001136-Bird2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and the compact chromatine structure generated by DNA methylation is generally thought to be associated with transcriptional silencing. This is not, however, the case of the modified <italic>Rxr</italic>&#x003b1; locus. A comparative analysis of the transcripts did not evidence any interference of the epigenetic modifications with <italic>Rxr</italic>&#x003b1; transcription (data not shown). Rather than gene silencing, we favour the hypothesis that non-CpG patterns are marking genomic regions that underwent heterologous recombination, a dangerous event for a genome, as it often indicates that transposons or viral genomes are moving around. This hypothesis is coherent with the observation that Cre-LoxP recombination as well as other non homologous recombination types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001136-Rassoulzadegan1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001136-Cherry1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> are strongly inhibited in methylated regions.
