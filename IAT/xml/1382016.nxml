The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome contains ten nAChRs, of which three (D&#x003b1;5, D&#x003b1;6, and D&#x003b1;7) are more homologous to vertebrate &#x003b1;7 receptors than to other insect nicotinic receptors &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. These receptors have unique properties that set them apart from other nicotinic subunits: They can form homomeric channels consisting of only the &#x003b1; subunit, have high permeability to calcium, and desensitize rapidly in the continued presence of agonist &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b002">2</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Despite the prevalence of acetylcholine in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> central nervous system, to our knowledge so far no studies have analyzed the function of these receptors in vivo. Here we have investigated the role of the D&#x003b1;7 receptor in behaviorally relevant circuits. </p><p>In many invertebrates and vertebrates, intense selection pressure has led to dedicated reflex circuits that continuously monitor the environment for danger and trigger escape behaviors when presented with a specific set of stimuli. These circuits must be able to detect potentially threatening stimuli and respond within a minimal time frame to prevent capture. In dipteran insects the giant fiber system serves this function &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. The rapid approach of a predator produces an expanding shadow at the retina. Although in wild-type flies stereotypical visual stimuli may be necessary to cause spiking in the giant fiber, rapid dimming of ambient light is sufficient to activate this interneuron in white-eyed mutants &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b006">6</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. One explanation, suggested by Wyman et al. &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;, is that because of the screening pigments in the eyes of wild-type flies, only a small number of ommatidia are activated by the light-off stimulus, while in white-eyed mutants the same stimulus can activate a much larger number of ommatidia, hence increasing the stimulus input to the giant fiber. </p><p>Two of the cell types that are immediately presynaptic to the giant fiber have been identified anatomically. Visual input arrives via a subtype of the lobula columnar neurons (Lcn neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;) called the Col A neurons &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Additionally, mechanosensory afferents from the antennal chordotonal organs found between the first and second antennal segments also make monosynaptic connections onto the giant fiber. The visual and mechanosensory projections make both electrical and chemical synapses with the giant fiber, but the primary excitatory drive to the giant fiber has been proposed to be mediated exclusively by electrical synapses, while chemical synapses are thought to have an inhibitory role &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. However, no direct evidence indicates that this is the case, and the transmitter of Col A neurons has not yet been identified. Furthermore, chordotonal organs of the antenna have been shown to be cholinergic &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>The giant fiber integrates sensory input and activates flight motor neurons in a precise temporal order. Based on electrophysiological and anatomical data from the giant fiber circuit, the following model has been proposed for the sequence of muscle activation underlying the escape jump. First, the tergotrochanteral muscle (TTM) is triggered through electrical synapses, causing the mesothoracic leg to extend and initiate the jump. A second consequence of the activation of this muscle is the compression of the thorax, leading to stretch activation of the dorsal lateral muscle (DLM), which in turn stretches and activates the antagonistic dorsal ventral muscles and causes a self-perpetuating oscillation of the thorax that powers the wings &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. The timing of DLM activation is delayed relative to TTM activation to precisely control the initiation of flight. The delay in DLM activation is achieved through an interneuron, the peripherally synapsing interneuron (PSI), that is specialized to activate all six DLMs simultaneously via a cholinergic synapse &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>The DLMs are stretch-activated muscles that, during normal flight, receive nervous system input only once every 20 cycles to prime them with calcium. The central rhythm for this nervous input is generated by synaptic interactions between the dendrites of the DLM motor neurons (DLMmns) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the rapid start of the flight motor during the escape jump requires synchronized activation of the DLMs, which bypasses the dendritic structure of the DLMmns. Although synchronized DLM activation is an integral part of the escape flight initiation program and is required for flight, it does not directly play a role in jumping. Mutant animals that specifically lose DLMs through degeneration while retaining the TTM are still able to jump, although they are unable to fly &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>Here, using genetic, immunohistochemical, behavioral and electrophysiological techniques we describe the role of the D&#x003b1;7 nAChR in the giant fiber mediated escape response of flies.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cloning of the cDNA and Mutational Analysis of D&#x003b1;7</title><p>To assess the in vivo role of D&#x003b1;7 we cloned and created mutations in its gene. <italic>D&#x003b1;7</italic> is located on the X chromosome at cytological band 18C &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. We generated a full-length cDNA by ligation of two partial cDNAs, RE30878 and GH16126, obtained from the BDGP EST collection. A comparison of the cDNA with the genomic sequence showed that the gene consists of 16 exons that span &#x0223c; 20 kb ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The first two exons are mostly 5&#x02032;UTR, while the last two exons code for the 3&#x02032;UTR. Since the protein predicted from our sequence differed from the one recently reported by Lansdell and Millar &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, we performed RT-PCR from two wild-type strains, Canton-S and Hikone-R, and confirmed our protein sequence ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>A). During sequencing we noticed that the protein predicted by our RT-PCR sequence had a substitution of valine for isoleucine 295 when compared with the protein predicted by the published genomic sequence ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>B). This is a consequence of a basepair difference from A in the genomic sequence to a G in the cDNA, indicating the presence of RNA editing, as reported for other nAChRs from <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. Sequencing the genomic region from Canton-S flies confirmed this hypothesis. </p><p>To create mutations in <italic>D&#x003b1;7</italic> we identified three P-element insertions: KG3295 maps 25 bp upstream of the 5&#x02032;UTR, EY10801 maps to exon 8 &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;, and NP515 maps 580 bp downstream of the 3&#x02032;UTR ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. We generated several additional alleles by carrying out imprecise excisions of each P-element. None of the KG3295 excisions disrupted the open reading frame (ORF), since it is approximately 5 kbp upstream of the translation start site. However, we were able to recover two deletions, <italic>D&#x003b1;7 <sup>P&#x00394;14G</sup></italic> (abbreviated to <italic>P&#x00394;14G</italic>) and <italic>D&#x003b1;7 <sup>P&#x00394;D5</sup> (P&#x00394;D5), </italic> that result in a small and a large reduction in protein levels (see below), respectively. The location and the breakpoints of the excisions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g001">Figure 1</xref>A. Excisions of NP515 also resulted in a hypomorphic allele (as judged by protein levels, see below), <italic>D&#x003b1;7 <sup>P&#x00394;41</sup> (P&#x00394;41), </italic> although it lacks the entire 3&#x02032;UTR and several amino acids from the C terminus ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Imprecise excision of the EY10801 P-element yielded the allele <italic>D&#x003b1;7 <sup>P&#x00394;EY6</sup> (P&#x00394;EY6), </italic> which showed loss of almost the entire ligand-binding domain, the transmembrane domain M1, and part of the pore-lining helix M2 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). This deletion also removed a splice site in M2 and hence has a larger lesion than predicted by analysis of the breakpoints. In the remainder of the paper, the precise excision of KG3295, <italic>D&#x003b1;7 <sup>P&#x00394;L1</sup> (P&#x00394;L1), </italic> which completely removed the P-element and reverted the insertion site to wild-type sequence, is used as a control for mutants from the KG3295 and NP515 excisions, while the precise excision of EY10801, <italic>D&#x003b1;7 <sup>P&#x00394;EY5</sup> (P&#x00394;EY5), </italic> is used as a control for <italic>P&#x00394;EY6</italic>. </p><p>Using an antibody that we generated against the variable cytoplasmic loop between M3 and M4, we tested for presence of protein in our mutant alleles with immunohistochemistry. The three alleles <italic>P&#x00394;14G, P&#x00394;41,</italic> and <italic>P&#x00394;D5</italic> retained signal, with <italic>P&#x00394;14G</italic> showing the strongest staining followed by somewhat weaker staining in <italic>P&#x00394;41,</italic> and still weaker staining in <italic>P&#x00394;D5</italic> (unpublished data) <italic>.</italic> As shown for the medulla, a synapse-rich region in the optic lobe ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), in <italic>P&#x00394;EY6</italic> the staining was reduced to background levels almost everywhere. This antibody recognizes numerous synapses in specific regions throughout the brain and in the ventral ganglion in wild-type animals, most notably in the vicinity of the giant fiber dendrites, where the staining is 10&#x02013;100 times stronger than anywhere else (see below). However, some synapses in the lamina also stained positively in mutants. These data suggest that the antibody recognizes an epitope on D&#x003b1;7, that D&#x003b1;7 is widely expressed (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>), and that the antibody also recognizes another epitope whose expression is restricted to the lamina (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">Protocol S1</xref> for antibody expression pattern and discussion of its specificity). Additionally, to identify the cells that express D&#x003b1;7 protein, we generated an enhancer trap GAL4 line by replacing the KG3295 P-element with a GAL4 P-element using P-element conversion &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. The staining pattern of this enhancer trap matched the immunostaining observed with the D&#x003b1;7 antibody (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>). </p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title><italic>D&#x003b1;7</italic> Mutants Are Defective in a Visually Mediated Escape Behavior </title><p>Flies mutant for D&#x003b1;7 are viable and not readily distinguishable from wild-type flies by cursory observation. To establish whether there are behavioral deficits in flies carrying D&#x003b1;7 mutations, we tested mutant flies in assays that allowed us to assess the function of brain regions in which D&#x003b1;7 is expressed (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">Protocol S1</xref>). </p><sec id="s2b1"><title>Flight</title><p>We tested the flight ability of the mutants in a version of the Sparrow test &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. In this assay, single flies are released from an Eppendorf tube into a 30-cm high cylinder. Good fliers fly horizontally toward the walls of the cylinder and land close to the level at which they were dropped. The lower the fly lands, the worse it is considered at flying. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, we found no significant difference between mutant and control flies. </p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Olfactory trap assay</title><p>The D&#x003b1;7 receptor is expressed in various elements of the olfactory neuropil, including the antennal lobes and the mushroom bodies.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, while the two control lines <italic>P&#x00394;L1</italic> and <italic>P&#x00394;EY5</italic> showed a robust response to a 20-ms pulse of darkness, all of the mutant flies failed to respond ( <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). </p></sec><sec id="s2b4"><title>Visual tests</title><p>Since D&#x003b1;7 is expressed in the optic neuropil, it is possible that the mutant flies are blind and unable to sense light.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g002">Figure 2</xref>D, all of the mutants responded to light with a depolarization and on- and off-transients. </p><p>Since D&#x003b1;7 is expressed in the optic neuropil, it is possible that the mutant flies are unable either to sense light or to transmit this signal to the locomotor areas.

In this assay flies are tested in seven different trials and are sorted into eight classes according to the number of trials in which they walk toward the light source.

Although two alleles, <italic>P&#x00394;41</italic> and <italic>P&#x00394;D5,</italic> showed differences compared to wild-type flies, all mutant alleles moved toward light, indicating that no substantial problem in light sensation can be linked to deletions in <italic>D&#x003b1;7</italic> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g002">Figure 2</xref>E).

The giant fiber circuit mediates escape behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and is named for the largest interneuron in the fly brain, the giant fiber, which connects the visual neuropil to the flight circuit in the thoracic ganglion (for review see &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, the giant fiber terminates in two branches. One branch makes an electrical connection with the motor neuron of the TTM, or jump muscle, while the other branch makes an electrical connection with an interneuron called the PSI. The PSI in turn makes a chemical synapse with the five motor neurons supplying the six DLMs ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). By electrical stimulation through electrodes in the eyes, it is possible to activate the giant fiber directly and assess the synapses that connect the giant fiber to the flight motor neurons by using activation of the flight muscles as a readout &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>Using this assay we noticed a deficit in the DLM response to giant fiber stimulation that correlated with the strength of the alleles as estimated by protein levels ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g003">3</xref>C). The DLMs of wild-type and control flies were able to follow stimulation of the giant fiber at frequencies of up to 100 Hz. <italic>P&#x00394;14G</italic> responded robustly to giant fiber stimulation at frequencies of 1 and 10 Hz, but started to fail when stimulated at 100 Hz. <italic>P&#x00394;41</italic> followed reasonably well at 1 Hz, although it had an abnormally long latency ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g003">Figure 3</xref>C top panel). At 10 Hz this mutant started to fail, and it had little response at 100 Hz. <italic>P&#x00394;D5</italic> showed little response in the DLMs even at a stimulation frequency of 1 Hz, while the null mutant <italic>P&#x00394;EY6</italic> did not respond at all at this frequency in most animals ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). The defects are specific to the synapses between the PSI and the DLMmn (encircled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), since the TTMs were able to follow the giant fiber stimulation at 100 Hz without any problem in the most severe mutation, <italic>P&#x00394;EY6</italic> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). Furthermore, there is no defect at the DLM neuromuscular junction, because direct stimulation of the DLMmn through electrodes in the thorax drove the DLM without failure at 100 Hz ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). When we reintroduced the wild-type <italic>D&#x003b1;7</italic> transgene into the mutant <italic>P&#x00394;D5</italic> or <italic>P&#x00394;EY6</italic> background by using OK307-GAL4 &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;, a driver with expression in several elements of the giant fiber circuit (including the giant fiber, DLMmn, TTMmn and PSI), we were able to fully rescue the activation of the DLM by giant fiber stimulation ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g003">3</xref>C). This experiment confirms that the observed defect is due to lesions in the <italic>D&#x003b1;7</italic> gene. Using these data, we can now put the alleles in the following order according to the strength of the phenotype: wild type = <italic>P&#x00394;L1</italic> = <italic>P&#x00394;EY5</italic> &#x0003e; <italic>P&#x00394;14G &#x0003e; P&#x00394;41</italic> &#x0003e; <italic>P&#x00394;D5</italic> = <italic>P&#x00394;EY6.</italic> This order also agrees with the strength of immunostaining. </p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title><italic>gfA <sup>1</sup></italic> Is a Dominant Allele of D&#x003b1;7 </title><p>The defect in the giant fiber in <italic>D&#x003b1;7</italic> deletion mutants is reminiscent of the phenotype described by Thomas and Wyman &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d; for the <italic>gfA <sup>1</sup></italic> mutants.

We found two nucleotide changes.

This amino acid maps to loop 2 of the ligand-binding domain and is implicated in gating by providing a bridge between the ligand-binding domain and the pore-lining transmembrane helix M2 &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g004">Figure 4</xref>F shows the location of the analogous amino acid (drawn in red as a van der Waals atomic representation to emphasize the location of the residue) on the structure of the nAChR from the electroplax of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Torpedo marmorata</named-content> &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;.

One possible explanation is that, due to changes in the nAChR properties, the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) generated at the PSI-DLMmn synapse in <italic>gfA <sup>1</sup></italic> mutant animals is faster and decays so rapidly that it is not able to trigger an action potential, similar to the effect of nAChR mutations in fast channel myasthenic syndrome &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. An alternative possibility is that the amplitude of the EPSP is reduced in <italic>gfA1</italic> mutants so that it is insufficient to drive the cell to threshold. In order to directly test this possibility, we developed a novel preparation for performing whole-cell patch clamp recordings from one of the DLM motor neurons, MN5, that supplies two muscles, DLMa and b. MN5 is located on the dorsal surface of the thoracic ganglion and is prominently labeled with CD8-GFP under the control of D&#x003b1;7-GAL4 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). </p><p>The basic methodology for recording from these neurons is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g005">Figure 5</xref>B. In spite of their large size and characteristic location, MN5 neurons are not readily detectable under Nomarski optics. Therefore, we backfilled these neurons by injecting Texas red dextran into the thorax in the vicinity of the DLMa/b muscles and waiting 18&#x02013;22 h to allow transport of the dye into the motor neuron. To access these neurons for recording, we removed the indirect flight muscles and the gut to expose the thoracic ganglion. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g005">Figure 5</xref>C, following the backfill procedure, the cell body of the motor neuron was clearly visible, as were the primary neurite and some of the dendritic structure. By locally applying protease, we were able to gain access to the cell body for whole cell patch recording without damaging the giant fiber, which was activated through insulated tungsten stimulating electrodes placed in the eyes. Protease treatment can affect electrophysiological measurements by cleaving molecules such as certain ion channels. While we cannot rule out these effects in our experiments, neurons in the DLM branch of the giant fiber circuit appeared healthy, as judged by the input resistance of MN5 as well as its ability to generate action potentials in response to current injection and EPSPs in response to giant fiber stimulation. </p><p>We recorded potentials from these cells using whole-cell patch clamp. Since no differences in basic passive properties of the cells were found between Canton-S controls and mutant flies, the average of the combined datasets is reported. In keeping with the large size of these cells, the capacitance of these cells was 43 &#x000b1; 2 pF ( <italic>n</italic> = 22), and their average input resistance was 102 &#x000b1; 12 M&#x003a9; ( <italic>n</italic> = 22). Unlike other insect neurons, current injection into MN5 cell bodies can generate large action potentials of 50 to 60 mV ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). In a few preparations we observed spontaneous rhythmic activity at &#x0223c; 1 Hz consisting of plateau potentials with large spikes, suggesting that these cells receive patterned input close to the cell body and are able to generate action potentials close to this site (unpublished data). </p><p>Since the primary role of the giant fiber circuit is to initiate escape behavior, the PSI bypasses the entire dendritic structure of MN5 and makes multiple synaptic contacts that span 50 &#x003bc;m and follow the axons out into the posterior dorsal motor nerve &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. This specialization minimizes the delay to DLM activation by generating a suprathreshold EPSP distally in the axon, which leads to a spike that travels rapidly to the DLM. In wild-type animals, when we activated the giant fiber at 1 Hz, the action potential generated at the distal PSI-DLMmn synapse on the axon appeared small and broad in somatic recordings ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g005">Figure 5</xref>E). This differed considerably from the narrow, large action potential evoked in the soma by current injection ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g005">Figure 5</xref>D), suggesting that the peripherally generated action potential fails to propagate antidromically into the dendrite and therefore is filtered by the passive membrane properties of the dendritic and/or axonal structure ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g005">Figure 5</xref>E, top). As we increased the frequency of eye stimulation, the action potential failed to fire, revealing an underlying EPSP ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g005">Figure 5</xref>E middle). The EPSPs are shown at a higher magnification in the bottom panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g005">Figure 5</xref>E to emphasize their amplitude and shape. </p><p>In order to measure the amplitude of the EPSP, we used three different strategies that all gave approximately the same values when compared in the same preparation. The first was to directly measure the amplitude of the EPSP at high frequencies when the spike fails. The second was to measure the amplitude to the inflection point where the spike takes off from the EPSP in cases where it is clearly visible. The third was to trigger an action potential by current injection in the MN5 soma just before giant fiber activation to force an absolute refractory period at the PSI-DLMmn synapse, causing the spike to fail thereby revealing the EPSP &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. The mean amplitude of the synaptic potential underlying the spike measured at the soma using these three methods was 4.71 &#x000b1; 0.35 mV ( <italic>n</italic> = 10) in wild-type animals. </p><p>In <italic>gfA1 <sup>1</sup></italic> animals, we observed considerable failures even at 1 Hz, similar to what we observed in muscle recordings from the intact animal ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g005">Figure 5</xref>E). The spikes showed a considerable amount of jitter and began at different points of the EPSP. The underlying EPSP is significantly smaller than the EPSP generated in wild-type animals ( <italic>p</italic> = 0.00001, Student's t-test), with a mean amplitude of 1.5 &#x000b1; 0.32 mV ( <italic>n</italic> = 7). However, while smaller, the EPSP in <italic>gfA1</italic> animals followed without failure and did not show significant changes in shape or jitter. This suggests that the inability of the DLMmn to follow and the increase in jitter in <italic>gfA1</italic> mutants is most likely due to reduced synaptic drive at the PSI-DLM synapse. This observation also rules out the possibility that a slow, alternative pathway is being activated in <italic>gfA1</italic> mutants during electrical stimulation through the eyes. </p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>D&#x003b1;7 Is Present in the Dendrites of the Giant Fiber</title><p>The electrophysiological results presented so far show a defect downstream of the giant fiber but do not explain the behavioral data.

Projections of confocal images of the dendrites show that the strongest D&#x003b1;7 staining in the brain indeed colocalizes with the VLD and PLD dendritic arbors.

While the colocalization with antibody staining is almost complete for the PLD, the anti-D&#x003b1;7 label is present in a broader field relative to the VLD.

In order to test this hypothesis we took advantage of the observation that, in contrast to strong stimulation, which directly activates the giant fiber, low-strength electrical stimulation activates the elements presynaptic to the giant fiber, which in turn activate the giant fiber &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. We therefore recorded from the TTM and stimulated the eyes at low strength ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g007">Figure 7</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040063-g007">7</xref>C, low-strength stimulation, which activates the presynaptic elements of the giant fiber, results in a significantly longer latency to activation of the TTM (3.5&#x02013;4.0 ms) compared with high-strength stimulation, which activates the giant fiber directly (&#x0223c; 1 ms). These values are comparable to long-latency values reported in the literature, which vary from &#x0223c; 3&#x02013;4.2 ms &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b042">42</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. Since the TTMmn is electrically coupled to the giant fiber, activation of the TTM serves as a readout of giant fiber activity. When we tested the <italic>D&#x003b1;7</italic> mutant alleles in this paradigm, we discovered that only the weakest allele, <italic>P&#x00394;14G,</italic> showed a long-latency response (upon low-strength stimulation), as well as a short-latency response (upon high-strength stimulation), while all other mutant alleles responded only with short latency (see Discussion for <italic>P&#x00394;14G</italic>). These data suggest that there is a defect in synaptic transmission somewhere in the pathway either upstream of the giant fiber or at the input of the giant fiber itself. In order to distinguish between these possibilities, we carried out a rescue experiment using a giant fiber-specific driver, c17-GAL4 &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. Reintroducing a wild-type copy of <italic>D&#x003b1;7</italic> into the giant fiber using this driver completely rescued the long-latency response, indicating that the lack of D&#x003b1;7 in the giant fiber itself is responsible for the mutant phenotype. Furthermore, since absence of D&#x003b1;7 prevents activation of the giant fiber, these experiments provide strong evidence that the defect in jump behavior is due to the loss of D&#x003b1;7 in the giant fiber neuron. </p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using anatomical, behavioral and physiological techniques to analyze mutant alleles of a nAChR, D&#x003b1;7, we show that this receptor is essential for the giant fiber-mediated escape response in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

Charge reversal mutations in K46 of bovine &#x003b1;7 nAChRs, the homolog of D&#x003b1;7K46, show diminished responses to acetylcholine and can act in a dominant-negative fashion when coexpressed with wild-type receptors &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;, similar to what we observed for the <italic>gfA1</italic> mutation.

In most deletion mutations of <italic>D&#x003b1;7,</italic> the giant fiber did not respond to electrical stimulation of its presynaptic components, and this phenotype could be rescued by overexpressing a transgene coding for <italic>D&#x003b1;7</italic> specifically in the giant fiber. These data indicate that the behavioral defect in the visually mediated jump in most deletion mutants of <italic>D&#x003b1;7</italic> can be explained by a failure of activation of the giant fiber. The sole exception is the weak hypomorphic mutation <italic>P&#x00394;14G;</italic> the affected animals respond to electrical stimulation of the elements presynaptic to the giant fiber, and yet fail to jump in response to a &#x0201c;lights off&#x0201d; stimulus. One possible explanation is that electrical stimulation through the eyes may activate both the mechanosensory and visual inputs to the giant fiber, while the behavioral assay relies on a strictly visual input. Therefore, activation by presynaptic electrical stimulation of the giant fiber in <italic>P&#x00394;14G</italic> mutants may reflect the simultaneous activation of neurons presynaptic to the giant fiber that does not occur during normal visual system function. </p><p>Our rescue of the long-latency component by expression of a <italic>D&#x003b1;7</italic> transgene in the giant fiber shows that the chemical synapses onto the giant fiber are cholinergic, and this component provides a significant proportion of the synaptic drive. The sensory projections to the giant fiber in three different dipteran species, <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>Musca</italic> &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, and <italic>Calliphora</italic> &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, make mixed chemical and electrical synapses onto specific dendrites of the giant fiber: The mechanosensory projection synapses onto the PLD, while the lobula projection synapses onto the VLD. Strausfeld and Bassemir &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d; hypothesized that the electrical synapses from the Col A and mechanosensory projections provide the excitatory drive to the giant fiber, while the chemical component is inhibitory. Our data clearly show that chemical synapses mediating visual and mechanosensory inputs onto the giant fiber are excitatory in nature and play an essential role in the giant fiber-mediated jump response. </p><p>It is probable that additional behavioral defects are present in these mutants that were missed because we performed only a limited number of assays. It is nevertheless surprising, given the widespread expression of this receptor, that the mutant animals did not show many obvious defects and were relatively healthy. One possible explanation is that the large number of nicotinic subunits can functionally compensate for each other. Although all ten nAChRs from <italic>Drosophila</italic> have been cloned, a detailed description of localization exists for only two of these proteins, ALS and ARD, which colocalize in most regions of the brain &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. Although these two receptors are localized to many of the same regions as the D&#x003b1;7 protein, analysis of specific neuropils showed some differences in expression patterns. Furthermore, although a number of screens have been carried out in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to find genes implicated in behavior, the only nicotinic receptor that has so far been isolated to our knowledge is <italic>gfA</italic>. Given that ACh is considered the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of insects, there may be much functional redundancy among the receptors, and only in the few instances when a synapse relies mostly or entirely on a particular nicotinic receptor, such as the visual and mechanosensory inputs on the dendrites of the giant fiber or the PSI-DLM synapse, is it possible to see a phenotype. Functional redundancy has also been observed in nAChR mutants in vertebrates, where some phenotypes are observed only when multiple nicotinic receptors are deleted &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040063-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;. It is remarkable that redundancy does not extend to the circuit underlying one of the most important behaviors for the day-to-day survival of the fly, the giant fiber-mediated escape circuit. This fact suggests that particular properties of D&#x003b1;7 may be selected for during evolution to endow certain qualities to the circuit. Further characterization of the biophysical properties of D&#x003b1;7 both in vivo and in vitro should shed some light on how specializations at the synaptic level are implemented in the choice of neurotransmitter receptor. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cloning of D&#x003b1;7</title><p>In order to obtain the full-length cDNA for D&#x003b1;7, we scanned the BDGP EST database and found four clones that mapped 5&#x02032; of the predicted gene for D&#x003b1;7.
