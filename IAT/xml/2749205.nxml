We previously reported that pancreatic cancer patients have a selective Th2 skew in the anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell immunity, which correlates with the presence of a predominant GATA-3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> tumor lymphoid infiltrate. This has negative effects in both effective anti-tumor immunity and further favoring fibrinogenesis. Aim of this study was to evaluate whether the Th2 polarization of CEA-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from pancreatic cancer patients is stable or can be reverted by immunomodulating cytokines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We first evaluated the influence of IL-12 and IL-27, as single agents and in association, on the polarization of CEA-specific Th2 CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell clones from a pancreatic cancer patient. We found that only the combination of IL-12 and IL-27 modified the polarization of Th2 effectors by both reduction of IL-5, GM-CSF and IL-13 and induction of IFN-&#x003b3; production, which lasted after cytokine removal. Second, we evaluated the effect of the combined treatment on polyclonal CEA-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in short-time re-stimulation assays. In agreement with the data obtained with the clones, we found that the combined treatment functionally modulated the Th2 polarization of CEA-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and enhanced pre-existing Th1 type immunity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Collectively, our results demonstrate that tumor antigen specific Th2 CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in pancreatic cancer are endowed with functional plasticity. Hence, loco-regional cytokines delivery or targeted therapy based on antibodies or molecules directed to the tumor stroma might improve anti-tumor immunity and ameliorate fibrosis, without systemic toxicity.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a very aggressive disease with dismal prognosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007234-Warshaw1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

We found that anti-CEA CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell immunity was present in a significantly lower number of PC patients compared to normal donors. Most importantly, while CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from normal donors produced mainly granulocytes macrophages colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and the pro-inflammatory (<italic>i.e.</italic>, Th1) cytokine interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;), CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from the patients produced mainly interleukin(IL)-5 and IL-13, demonstrating a skew towards an anti-inflammatory (<italic>i.e.</italic>, Th2) type. On the contrary, the extent of anti-viral CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell immunity was comparable between the two groups and showed a Th1 type. In agreement with the Th2 skew observed in circulating CEA specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, immunohistochemical analysis of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes showed a significantly higher number of GATA-3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (Th2) compared to T-bet<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (Th1) lymphoid cells, supporting a Th2 skew also at the tumor site.</p><p>It has been shown that fibrosis, which is a hallmark in PC, is strongly linked to the development of Th2 responses through activation by Th2 cytokines of collagen synthesis by fibroblasts and concomitant reduced collagen degradation in the absence of Th1 cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007234-Wynn1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Modulation of the cytokines' production was, at least in the case of the clones, mostly functional with the induction of a rather peculiar phenotype where CCR4, CRTH2 and CCR5 expression coexisted (<italic>i.e.</italic>, not typical of either Th1 or Th0 cells). Preliminary experiments (data not shown), in which we evaluated cytokines' production at single cell level by intracellular staining, indicated that: <italic>i</italic>) IL-27 alone did not affect the percentage of IL-5 and IL-13 or IFN-&#x003b3; producing cells both as single positive and double positive; and <italic>ii</italic>) IL-12 alone or the combination of the two cytokines induced a percentage of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells producing both Th2 cytokines and IFN-&#x003b3; without reduction in the number of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells producing Th2 cytokines. These results along with the previous ones on cytokine secretion in the supernatants exclude that the effect of IL-12 on IFN-&#x003b3; up-regulation is due to a subpopulation of Th1 cells that becomes preferentially expanded and suggest that the combination of IL-27 and IL-12 induces a reduction of Th2 cytokines secretion per single cell and reverts a small population of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th2 cells, which then produce also high levels of IFN-&#x003b3;, to a Th0 type.

modulation of the tumor microenvironment not only through their known effect on resident antigen presenting cells (and therefore on the <italic>de-novo</italic> priming of new Th1 effectors in the draining lymph nodes) but also directly on the modulation of the cytokines secreted by Th2 GATA-3&#x0002b; infiltrating T cell effectors already present in the tumor by diminishing their negative effects on fibrinogenesis and recruitment of immunosuppressive myeloid dendritic cells, in the absence of systemic toxicity.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Paolo Dellabona and Matteo Bellone
