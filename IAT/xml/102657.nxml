However, DNA repair often cannot remove all lesions from the genome due to limited cellular repair capacity, inefficiently repaired regions of the genome or poorly recognized damage. During DNA replication, unrepaired DNA lesions could pose a serious problem for the replication machinery, since many lesions block the replication polymerases. In response, cells have evolved a sophisticated system called lesion bypass to overcome such replication blockage.</p><p>In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, lesion bypass consists of error-free and error-prone mechanisms, both of which require the <italic>RAD6</italic> and <italic>RAD18</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c2">2</xref>). Rad6 is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c3">3</xref>) and it forms a complex with Rad18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c6">6</xref>). Rad18 is a zinc finger protein with single-stranded DNA binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c6">6</xref>). It has been proposed that Rad18 may act to load Rad6 onto sites of DNA damage where its ubiquitin-conjugating activity could subsequently modify the stalled replicative DNA polymerase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c4">4</xref>). This model postulates that Rad6 and Rad18 act at an early step of lesion bypass and their interaction is critical for subsequent processes to bypass a lesion. Supporting this hypothesis, the Rad6&#x02013;Rad18 interaction is indispensable for the function of Rad18 in UV resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c5">5</xref>).</p><p>The damage-induced mutagenesis pathway is a major mechanism of error-prone lesion bypass. This mutagenesis pathway requires at least the following genes: <italic>RAD6</italic>, <italic>RAD18</italic>, <italic>REV1</italic>, <italic>REV3</italic>, <italic>REV6</italic>, <italic>REV7</italic> and <italic>NGM2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c13">13</xref>). Rev1 is a dCMP transferase capable of inserting a dCMP opposite a template apurinic&#x0002f;apyrimidinic (AP) site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c14">14</xref>) and it likely plays an additional role in error-prone lesion bypass (D.K.Rajpal, X.Wu and Z.Wang, submitted for publication). Rev3 is the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase &#x003b6; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c15">15</xref>) and Rev7 is a small subunit of this polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c15">15</xref>). <italic>REV6</italic> and <italic>NGM2</italic> have not yet been cloned.</p><p>It has been suggested that yeast error-free lesion bypass is composed of two mechanisms: the Rad5 mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c16">16</xref>) and the Rad30 mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c18">18</xref>). Very little is known about the Rad5 error-free mechanism. Rad5 is a member of the DNA helicase family, and its ATPase activity has been experimentally confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c16">16</xref>). Rad30 was recently identified as DNA polymerase &#x003b7; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c19">19</xref>). It is capable of error-free translesion synthesis opposite a template TT dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c19">19</xref>). Thus, Rad30 functions as an error-free lesion bypass mechanism in response to UV radiation. However, recent biochemical studies with purified yeast Rad30 suggest that this polymerase could also function as an error-prone mechanism in response to certain DNA lesions such as AP sites in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c20">20</xref>).</p><p>Much less is known about lesion bypass in humans. Two closely related homologs of yeast Rad6 have been identified in humans as HHR6A and HHR6B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c21">21</xref>). More recently, human <italic>REV1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c22">22</xref>), <italic>REV3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c24">24</xref>) and <italic>REV7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c25">25</xref>) genes have been isolated. Thus, a damage-induced mutagenesis pathway similar to that in yeast is probably operational in humans. Additionally, the human counterpart of yeast Rad30 has been identified as the XPV (xeroderma pigmentosum variant) gene product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c27">27</xref>). These observations strongly suggest that a lesion bypass system may have been well conserved from yeast to humans in response to unrepaired DNA damage during replication. Since Rad18 is indispensable for both error-free and error-prone lesion bypass in yeast, we asked whether humans possess a counterpart to this protein. In this report, we describe the human <italic>RAD18</italic> gene, its chromosomal localization and its ubiquitous expression in various tissues. Furthermore, we show that human RAD18 protein interacts and forms stable complexes with HHR6A and HHR6B.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Human EST clones EST182472 (GenBank accession no.

Upon searching GenBank with the putative protein sequence, we identified yeast Rad18 as its homolog (<italic>P</italic><sub>N</sub> &#x0003d; 1 &#x000d7; e<sup>&#x02013;13</sup>). Hence, we conclude that this cDNA clone codes for a human homolog of the yeast lesion bypass protein Rad18. Accordingly, this gene is referred to as human <italic>RAD18</italic> (GenBank accession no. AF169796).</p><p>Comparison of the RAD18 proteins between human and yeast showed significant sequence conservation, with 26&#x00025; identity and 59&#x00025; similarity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd425f1">1</xref>). Furthermore, several structural features of yeast Rad18 are also present in the human protein, including an N-terminal C3HC4 zinc finger motif, also known as the RING finger motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c33">33</xref>), a C2HC zinc finger motif, a basic region near the C-terminus and a C-terminal acidic region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd425f1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Chromosomal localization of the human <italic>RAD18</italic> gene</title><p>We searched the non-redundant database of GenBank STS division with the human <italic>RAD18</italic> cDNA sequence and identified a human STS (WI-13593). The location of this STS was assigned to 55.8 cR from the top of the chromosome 3 linkage group by Radiation Hybrid Mapping (Whitehead Institute&#x0002f;MIT Center for Genome Research, Cambridge, MA). On GeneMap&#x02019;98 it was mapped to a physical position between reference intervals D3S3591 and D3S1283. Therefore, we conclude that the human <italic>RAD18</italic> gene is located on chromosome 3 between D3S3591 and D3S1283.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of the <italic>RAD18</italic> gene in various human tissues</title><p>Apparently, lesion bypass mechanisms exist in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c27">27</xref>). However, it is not known whether hRAD18 functions in various human tissues. As an indication of the importance of the human <italic>RAD18</italic> gene in response to DNA damage, we examined its expression in different human tissues. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd425f2">2</xref>, <italic>RAD18</italic> expression was detected by RT&#x02013;PCR in all of the 16 human tissues examined. Therefore, we conclude that the <italic>RAD18</italic> gene is ubiquitously expressed in humans.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction of human RAD18 protein with HHR6A and HHR6B</title><p>Based on the yeast Rad6&#x02013;Rad18 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c6">6</xref>), we asked whether human RAD18 protein interacts with the human Rad6 counterparts, HHR6A and HHR6B. This question was initially addressed using the yeast two-hybrid assay. Human <italic>RAD18</italic> (<italic>hRAD18</italic>) was cloned into the vector pAS2, yielding pAS2-hRAD18. HHR6A and HHR6B were cloned into the vector pACT2, yielding pACT2-HHR6A and pACT2-HHR6B, respectively. Expression of pAS2-hRAD18 in yeast cells produced a RAD18 fusion protein containing the Gal4 DNA binding domain. Expression of pACT2-HHR6A and pACT2-HHR6B produced the respective fusion proteins containing the Gal4 activation domain. Interactions between human RAD18 and HHR6A or HHR6B would physically bring the Gal4 DNA binding and activation domains close together to activate Gal4-dependent promoters. One Gal4 target is the &#x003b2;-galactosidase gene, whose activation in yeast is indicated by blue colonies in the presence of X-Gal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c29">29</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd425f3">3</xref>G and H, yeast cells containing both pAS2-hRAD18 and pACT2-HHR6A or both pAS2-hRAD18 and pACT2-HHR6B activated the &#x003b2;-galactosidase gene as evidenced by the appearance of blue colonies following &#x003b2;-galactosidase filter lift assays. In control experiments using yeast cells transformed with pAS2-hRAD18, pACT2-HHR6A or pACT2-HHR6B alone, the &#x003b2;-galactosidase gene was not activated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd425f3">3</xref>A&#x02013;C).</p><p>Similarly, when human <italic>RAD18</italic> was cloned into the pACT2 vector (pACT2-hRAD18) and HHR6A or HHR6B were cloned into the pAS2 vector (pAS2-HHR6A and pAS2-HHR6B, respectively), these plasmids alone did not activate the &#x003b2;-galactosidase gene in yeast cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd425f3">3</xref>D&#x02013;F). In contrast, plasmids pACT2-hRAD18 and pAS2-HHR6A together or pACT2-hRAD18 and pAS2-HHR6B together activated the &#x003b2;-galactosidase gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd425f3">3</xref>I and J). These results suggest that human RAD18 protein interacts with both HHR6A and HHR6B.</p><p>To further test the proposed hRAD18&#x02013;HHR6B interaction, we performed an immunoprecipitation experiment. First, we tagged human RAD18 with the HA epitope (HA&#x02013;hRAD18) and HHR6B with 6&#x000d7;His (His&#x02013;HHR6B) at their N-termini using yeast expression vectors. Then, the tagged human RAD18 and HHR6B were expressed individually or together in yeast cells, which was confirmed by western blot analysis using antibodies specific to the HA or the 6&#x000d7;His tag (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd425f4">4</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;3). Cell-free extracts containing both human RAD18 and HHR6B were subsequently prepared for <italic>in vitro</italic> immunoprecipitation. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd425f4">4</xref> (lane 5), the monoclonal antibody against the HA tag precipitated HA&#x02013;hRAD18 from the cell extract, as expected. With human RAD18 precipitation, the HA antibody additionally co-precipitated the His-tagged HHR6B (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd425f4">4</xref>, lane 5). Without HA&#x02013;hRAD18 in the cell extract, His&#x02013;HHR6B was not detected following immuno&#x000ad;precipitation with the HA antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd425f4">4</xref>, lane 4). These results indicate that human RAD18 and HHR6B form a protein complex when co-expressed.</p><p>The immunoprecipitation experiment was extended to test the proposed hRAD18&#x02013;HHR6A interaction. HA&#x02013;hRAD18 and the His-tagged HHR6A (His&#x02013;HHR6A) were co-expressed in yeast and cell-free extracts were then prepared for immuno&#x000ad;precipitation. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd425f5">5</xref> (lane 2), HA&#x02013;hRAD18 protein was precipitated by the anti-HA monoclonal antibody from extracts containing HA&#x02013;hRAD18 as the only human protein. Without HA&#x02013;hRAD18 in the cell extract, His&#x02013;HHR6A was not detected following immunoprecipitation with the HA antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd425f5">5</xref>, lane 3). However, in the presence of human RAD18, the HA antibody precipitated both HA&#x02013;RAD18 and His&#x02013;HHR6A from the cell extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd425f5">5</xref>, lane 4). These results indicate that human RAD18 and HHR6A form a protein complex when co-expressed.</p></sec><sec><title>Stable protein complexes of hRAD18&#x02013;HHR6A and hRAD18&#x02013;HHR6B</title><p>To examine whether human RAD18 interactions with HHR6A and HHR6B result in stable protein complexes that can be isolated and studied, we fractionated yeast cell extracts containing the co-expressed human proteins by liquid chromatography. Cell-free extracts containing hRAD18 and HHR6B were sequentially fractionated on Ni&#x02013;Sepharose, FPLC Mono S and FPLC Mono Q columns. Human RAD18 was co-purified with HHR6B to near homogeneity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd425f6">6</xref>A). Cell-free extracts containing hRAD18 and HHR6A were then sequentially fractionated on Ni&#x02013;Sepharose and FPLC Mono Q columns. During purification we noticed that HHR6A was poorly stained by silver. As a result, the HHR6A protein band was barely detectable in the most pure Mono Q fraction following silver staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd425f6">6</xref>B). The presence of the His-tagged HHR6A in this fraction, however, was clearly revealed by western blot analysis using the specific anti-His antibody (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd425f6">6</xref>C). Thus, human RAD18 was also co-purified with HHR6A to near homogeneity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd425f6">6</xref>B and C). To provide further evidence that the purified hRAD18 and HHR6A were in a complex, we loaded this Mono Q fraction onto a FPLC Superdex 200 gel filtration column. Human RAD18 and HHR6A were identified by western blotting. Again, human RAD18 was co-purified with HHR6A and eluted at a position corresponding to 86&#x02013;105 kDa. In contrast, pure HHR6A alone eluted at a position corresponding to &#x0223c;14 kDa from this gel filtration column under identical chromatographic conditions. Due to the small size of HHR6A and the possibility of non-globular hRAD18 and&#x0002f;or HHR6A, we were unable to estimate a stoichiometry between these two proteins in the complex. These results show that human RAD18 forms a stable protein complex with HHR6A and another stable protein complex with HHR6B.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have identified and sequenced a human EST clone coding for full-length RAD18. In addition to sequence homology, several structural features of yeast Rad18 are also conserved in the human protein. However, the Walker type A nucleotide binding motif (GKS) found in yeast Rad18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c8">8</xref>) is not present in the human protein. As a result, we were unable to detect an ATPase activity of the purified human RAD18&#x02013;HHR6B protein complex. RAD18 homologs have been identified in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (SPBC1734.06, <italic>pombe</italic> genome sequencing project), <italic>Emericella nidulans</italic> (uvsH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c34">34</xref>), <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> (uvs-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c35">35</xref>) and mouse (Van der Laan <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, GenBank Accession no. AF205278). We examined protein sequences of these RAD18 homologs and found that none of them contains the GKS Walker type A nucleotide binding motif. Thus, this nucleotide binding motif and weak ATPase activity are most likely unique features restricted to yeast Rad18 protein. This raised the possibility that the ATPase activity of yeast Rad18 may not be important to its lesion bypass function.</p><p>Genetic analyses in yeast have indicated the importance of lesion bypass in responding to DNA damage. As demonstrated by yeast <italic>rad6</italic> mutants, complete loss of this lesion bypass function results in extreme sensitivity of cells to many DNA damaging agents, such as UV radiation. The effect on cell survival is as dramatic as the loss of nucleotide excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c11">11</xref>). Since yeast Rad6 and Rad18 counterparts exist in humans, we strongly believe that lesion bypass mechanisms dependent on RAD18, HHR6A and&#x0002f;or HHR6B are operational in humans. Consistent with the notion that lesion bypass is also a fundamental response to DNA damage in mammals, we observed ubiquitous expression of the <italic>RAD18</italic> gene in various human tissues. Different mRNA levels were apparent in some tissue samples as revealed by RT&#x02013;PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd425f2">2</xref>). However, due to the commercial nature of these samples, we were unable to rigorously control the mRNA preparations. This limitation prevented us from conducting a more quantitative comparison of the hRAD18 expression levels in different tissues.</p><p>In yeast, complex formation between Rad18 and Rad6 is thought to be important during lesion bypass, as mutations that abolish such an interaction lead to a severe cellular sensitivity to UV radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c5">5</xref>). This feature is likely of functional importance in humans as well. Supporting this notion, we observed interactions between human RAD18 and the two human homologs of Rad6, HHR6A and HHR6B. The inter&#x000ad;actions result in the formation of stable protein complexes, hRAD18&#x02013;HHR6A and hRAD18&#x02013;HHR6B. Since Rad18 and Rad6 are required for both error-free and error-prone lesion bypass in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c2">2</xref>), it is likely that hRAD18&#x02013;HHR6A and hRAD18&#x02013;HHR6B may also participate in both modes of lesion bypass. At present, however, it is not known how these two complexes participate in different lesion bypass mechanisms.</p><p>The importance of DNA lesion bypass in human physiology is underscored by the recent discovery that XPV disease is caused by inactivation of the lesion bypass DNA polymerase &#x003b7; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c27">27</xref>). Clinically, XPV is characterized by photosensitivity and a predisposition to skin cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd425c36">36</xref>). Since damage-induced mutagenesis is an important factor in carcinogenesis, the REV3 mutagenesis pathway is also expected to play an import&#x000ad;ant role in human health. Our results in yeast demonstrate that high levels of DNA polymerase &#x003b6; encoded by the <italic>REV3</italic> and <italic>REV7</italic> genes lead to enhanced mutagenesis following UV radiation (D.K.Rajpal, X.Wu and Z.Wang, submitted for publication). Thus, mutations that activate human DNA polymerase &#x003b6; are expected to stimulate damage-induced mutagenesis and may consequently lead to a higher risk of human cancers. Based on our understanding of the yeast model system, it is predicted that hRAD18, HHR6A and HHR6B likely play important roles at an early step in the REV3 mutagenesis pathway and the polymerase &#x003b7; lesion bypass mechanism. Isolation of the human <italic>RAD18</italic> gene and purification of the hRAD18&#x02013;HHR6A and hRAD18&#x02013;HHR6B protein complexes should facilitate future studies on both error-free and error-prone lesion bypass in humans.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd425f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Conserved sequence features of RAD18 from yeast to humans.
