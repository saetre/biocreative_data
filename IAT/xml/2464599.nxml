In more detail, the expression of <italic>PNAS-4 </italic>tends to decrease gradually from prenatal day 33 to day 90, an important period for development of muscle fibers and determination of muscle fiber numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].

However, the expression profiles of Tongcheng pigs and Landrace pigs were not complete similar in early embryonic development, and this kind of difference may be related to breed difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The <italic>PNAS-4 </italic>mRNA expression decreased faster in early Landrace pig development, and this result may be correlated with the high number of primary fibers found in Landrace compared with Tongcheng pigs and other indigenous Chinese breeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In other words, there might be a positive correlation between the decrease speed of <italic>PNAS-4 </italic>mRNA expression level in embryonic stage and porcine muscle fiber number. Muscle fiber number is an important determinant of postnatal growth such that pigs with a high fiber number tend to grow faster than pigs with a lower fiber number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This is also supported by the carcass weight of Landrace compared to Tongcheng pigs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. After birth, the expression of <italic>PNAS-4 </italic>mRNA in muscle tissue was increased, which could be attributed to an increase in length and girth of the muscle fibres and/or muscle function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Consistent with this, the highest expression of the gene was recorded in skeletal muscle of mature pigs. The protein was found to localize in the Golgi complex. It was thus deduced that <italic>PNAS-4 </italic>protein acted more possibly as a regulator than as a structural protein, which was generally in agreement with the opinion that <italic>PNAS-4 </italic>may be a pro-apoptotic gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title><italic>PNAS-4 </italic>as a candidate gene or QTL for fat deposition</title><p>Porcine <italic>PNAS</italic>-4 gene mapped to q11&#x02013;16 of SSC10, closely linked to marker SW497. It showed that several quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to growth and carcass traits, such as average daily gain (ADG), Backfat Thickness (BFT), Carcass Weight (CCWT), Ham Weight (HAMWT), are located on this chromosome region in the Pig QTL Database release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Consistent with this, significant associations between A1813C SNP genotypes of <italic>PNAS-4 </italic>and three fat-related traits were found in our experimental pig populations. Moreover, the three fat traits values of pigs with homozygous CC were higher than that of the pigs with other genotypes (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05). Our findings have also revealed that allele C of SNP A1813C was prevalent in four Chinese indigenous breeds whereas allele A had higher frequency in Landrace and Large White. Interestingly, western commercial pig breeds (Duroc, Large White and Landrace) are well known for their high growth rate and lean meat percentage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. These correlated results suggest that the pigs with allele C in SNP A1813C will have higher fat content. In order to confirm it, further investigations in the use of the gene for commercial breeding are recommended.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We cloned and characterized the full-length cDNA of porcine <italic>PNAS-4 </italic>gene. Expression profiles and gene structure suggest that this gene was regulated negatively at the post-transcriptional level, both temporal and spatial. It might play a negative role in modulating muscle fiber numbers, and act as an important factor affecting the muscle mass efficiency. Unexpectedly, association analysis revealed that allele C of SNP A1813C was prevalent in four Chinese indigenous breeds whereas allele A had higher frequency in Landrace and Large White, and the pigs with allele C in SNP A1813C will have higher fat content. It is a potential genetic marker for animal breeding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>cDNA isolation and sequence analysis</title><p>BLAST in the pig expressed sequence tags (ESTs) database using the human <italic>PNAS-4 </italic>mRNA sequence [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM 016076">NM 016076</ext-link>] as probe, revealed three porcine ESTs [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CN156918">CN156918</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CV877591">CV877591</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AJ665351">AJ665351</ext-link>].

Three pig embryos were collected from every pregnant female during three embryonic periods (33, 65, and 90 dpc) and three postnatal periods (2, 28 days and adult (160 days)). The longissimus dorsi muscle were harvested, mixed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80&#x000b0;C. Furthermore, three Landrace pigs were employed to determine expression differences between western and Chinese pig breeds in prenatal stages. All animal procedures were performed according to guidelines developed by the China Council on Animal Care and protocol approved by Animal Care and Use Committee of Hubei Province, PR China.</p><p>QPCR was performed with the Chromo4&#x02122; Real-Time PCR Detector (Bio-Rad) using gene-specific primers and Taqman probes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Total RNA (4 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g), extracted from tissues using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and treated with RNase-free DNase (MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). RNA quality was assessed with agarose gel electrophoresis and the ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, USA), and was discarded if the 260/280 ratio was not between 1.8 and 2.1. It was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA). cDNA synthesis was performed in duplicate. Both beta-actin gene (<italic>ACTB</italic>) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<italic>GAPDH</italic>) were consistently expressed in all tissues of this assay, so we selected the <italic>ACTB</italic>, one of the two housekeeping genes, as an internal control for normalization purposes. The minus RT control with primers for <italic>ACTB </italic>was performed to test if products were derived from DNA. Relative transcript quantification was performed using standard curves generated for <italic>ACTB </italic>and <italic>PNAS-4 </italic>gene from a 10-fold serial dilution of cDNA. Pooled cDNA from a subset of the gastrocnemius samples examined in this study was used to generate the standard curves. In this assay, the efficiency of <italic>ACTB </italic>and <italic>PNAS-4 </italic>gene primers were 96.5% and 96.95%, respectively. The cycling conditions consisted of an initial, single cycle of 95&#x000b0;C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 15 s at 94&#x000b0;C and 1 min at 60&#x000b0;C.
