We have explored the possibility that this protein is associated with telomeres and participates in their maintenance. Rat brain hnRNP A2 was shown to have two nucleic acid binding sites. In the presence of heparin one site binds single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides irrespective of sequence but not the corresponding oligoribonucleotides. Both the hnRNP A2-binding <italic>cis</italic>-acting element for the cytoplasmic RNA trafficking element, A2RE, and the ssDNA telomere repeat match a consensus sequence for binding to a second sequence-specific site identified by mutational analysis. hnRNP A2 protected the telomeric repeat sequence, but not the complementary sequence, against DNase digestion: the glycine-rich domain was found to be necessary, but not sufficient, for protection. The N-terminal RRM (RNA recognition motif) and tandem RRMs of hnRNP A2 also bind the single-stranded, template-containing segment of telomerase RNA. hnRNP A2 colocalizes with telomeric chromatin in the subset of PML bodies that are a hallmark of ALT cells, reinforcing the evidence for hnRNPs having a role in telomere maintenance. Our results support a model in which hnRNP A2 acts as a molecular adapter between single-stranded telomeric repeats, or telomerase RNA, and another segment of ssDNA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The ends of linear chromosomes pose a problem for the DNA replication machinery. During replication, the lagging strand is left with a region that cannot be replicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). In the absence of any compensatory mechanism, successive replications lead to the loss of potentially essential DNA from the ends of the chromosomes. This shortening is minimized by capping the chromosome ends with repetitive sequences, TTAGGG in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) of expendable DNA. These telomeric regions are 3&#x02013;15 kb long in human somatic cells. Progressive telomeric shortening limits the number of divisions a human cell can undergo: telomere attrition is associated with chromosome instability and cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>).</p><p>In cells of the germ line and in most cancer cells, telomere length is preserved by the action of a reverse transcriptase, telomerase, which consists of a protein catalytic component, other protein subunits and an essential RNA subunit (hTR) that acts as a template for the synthesis of the telomeric repeat DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Some immortalized mammalian cell lines and tumors maintain their telomeres in the absence of telomerase activity by one or more mechanisms referred to as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) that may involve recombination and copy switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). ALT cell lines are also characterized by the presence of novel nuclear structures, the ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs), which contain the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), telomere repeat binding factors 1 and 2 (TRF1 and TRF2), several proteins involved in DNA repair and recombination, and extrachromosomal telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>).</p><p>The double-stranded segment of telomeres, like the rest of the genome, is wrapped up into nucleosomes formed with histones and non-histones, and additional telomere-specific proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). The end portion, which includes a 30&#x02013;200 nt single-stranded 3&#x02032; overhang, may not be contained within this structure, but rather bound and protected by a different set of proteins. The proteins bound and the conformation of the 3&#x02032; overhang may vary depending on whether or not the DNA is being actively extended by telomerase. When not being extended, the DNA is thought to be looped back with the overhang displacing a portion of the double-stranded telomere and thereby forming D- and t-loops. Loop formation is promoted by TRF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) which, with TRF1, has been characterized as a negative regulator of telomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p><p>A number of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), including C1/C2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) and K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), have been reported to bind either the telomere repeat (<italic>in vitro</italic>) or hTR (<italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>). hnRNP A1 and UP1, its proteolytic derivative comprising the tandem RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), bind the telomeric repeat sequence-specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) and protect it from nuclease digestion <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Both hnRNP A1 and UP1 also bind hTR <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), and UP1 (but not hnRNP A1) binds the telomerase holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). hnRNP A1 and UP1 can bind telomerase RNA and telomeric DNA simultaneously <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), suggesting that hnRNP A1/UP1 not only protects the single-stranded telomeric DNA but also recruits telomerase to telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>).</p><p>Mouse and human hnRNP A2 also bind the telomeric repeat sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>), as do their alternatively spliced isoforms, B1 and B0b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) [the latter renamed A2b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>)]. A2b also promotes telomerase-mediated extension of a template oligonucleotide <italic>in vitro</italic>. It was proposed that because the expression of hnRNP B1 is upregulated in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>), the unusually high levels of this protein may provide a mechanism by which telomere length could be maintained, and telomerase activity promoted inappropriately, thus allowing rapid and ongoing division of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Recent experiments in which small interfering RNAs were used to lower the levels of hnRNPs A1 and A2 in several cancer cell lines, transformed cells and normal cells reinforce the concept that these proteins function as telomeric capping factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>).</p><p>We show here, using pull-down and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), that hnRNPs A2 and A3 are the predominant single-stranded telomere repeat binding proteins in the rat brain. hnRNP A2 was found to possess two oligonucleotide binding sites. One site binds ssDNA with little or no nucleotide sequence preference whereas the second binds oligoribonucleotides or oligodeoxyribonucleotides sequence-specifically. Mutational analysis has identified a consensus nucleotide sequence for binding to the latter site that is consistent with the association with the human single-stranded TTAGGG telomere repeat and the A2RE11 cytoplasmic RNA trafficking element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). Using purified hnRNP A2 domains, we have established that both RRMs are required for association with the telomeric repeat, whereas the RRM1 alone, of hnRNP A1, has been reported to suffice for repeat binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Intact hnRNP A2 protein, but neither individual or concatenated RRMs nor the Gly-rich domain (GRD), is able to protect telomeric DNA from DNase. In contrast, the concatenated RRMs of hnRNP A1 are sufficient for protection from DNase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). hnRNP A2 and its RRM concatamer also bind the telomerase RNA, with only weak binding to the isolated RRM1, and none to RRM2, in contrast to hnRNP A1. Thus hnRNP A2 can potentially bind the telomeric DNA repeat and the RNA component of telomerase simultaneously, or it may bind ssDNA in both sites thus acting as an intramolecular or intermolecular cross-link. Finally, we show for the first time that hnRNP A2 is colocalized with TRF2 and PML in the subset of APB nuclear bodies. These data are consistent with a role for hnRNP A2 in protecting telomeric DNA <italic>in vivo</italic> against nuclease digestion, and in recruiting hTR to the telomere.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Human hnRNP A2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>) and domains of this protein, residues 1&#x02013;89 (RRM1), 101&#x02013;179 (RRM2), 1&#x02013;189 (RRM1+2&#x02032;) and 189&#x02013;341 (GRD), were expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>).

However, the other three oligodeoxyribonucleotides also bound this protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which taken together with earlier observations indicates that it has a site that binds ssDNA more tightly than the corresponding RNA with little or no nucleotide sequence preference. Such a site was earlier detected on recombinant hnRNP A2 expressed in bacteria, but binding of oligoribonucleotides or oligodeoxyribonucleotides to this non-specific site was eliminated on addition of heparin, which minimizes non-specific interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>).

These proteins were identified from their apparent molecular masses on SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gels and by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) as hnRNPs A1, a minor component as judged by Coomassie Blue R250 staining, and A2 and their less abundant isoforms, and four isoforms of hnRNP A3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). These three proteins share high sequence identity and notably the residues of hnRNP A1/UP1 identified by X-ray crystallography as participating directly in telomeric DNA&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>) are conserved between hnRNPs A1 and A3 and, with one conservative (basic to basic) change, between hnRNPs A1 and A2. The observed binding of the telomeric DNA repeat to both hnRNPs A1 and A2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) is consistent with the conservation of the RNA-binding residues on these proteins.</p><p>As noted above, hnRNPs A2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>) and A3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>) were previously shown to possess two sites for binding a <italic>cis</italic>-acting cytoplasmic RNA trafficking element, A2RE or A2RE11, one specific for this oligonucleotide sequence and the other with very weak sequence dependence. The binding of the deoxyribonucleotide analog of A2RE11 (dA2RE11) and the telomeric DNA repeat to the same sites on hnRNP A2 was demonstrated in UV-cross-linking EMSAs. In these experiments an excess of unlabeled competitor was added with a fixed amount of purified recombinant hnRNP A2 to labeled dA2RE11, dNS1 [a scrambled A2RE11 sequence, CAAGCACCGAA; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>)] or telomeric repeat-containing sequences. An excess of a single telomeric repeat (Telo1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) or a trimer (Telo3, (TTAGGG)<sub>3</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) abolished binding of both dA2RE11 and dNS1. dNS1 partly competed with dA2RE11, but less effectively with Telo1 or Telo3; and dA2RE11 eliminated dNS1 binding but did not outcompete either telomeric repeat sequence for the specific site. Thus, excess of dA2RE11, Telo1 or Telo3 displace dNS1 from the non-specific site and the telomeric repeats eliminate dA2RE11 association with both the specific and non-specific sites. Although formally it is possible that telomeric repeat binding to hnRNP A2 acts as an allosteric inhibitor of binding, it is likely that they compete directly for the same site with even the single 6-nt Telo1 binding more tightly than the A2RE11 oligodeoxyribonucleotide. Although the single and triple telomeric repeats compete effectively with dA2RE11, the oligoribonucleotide A2RE11 binds more tightly than all three oligodeoxyribonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mutational analysis identifies a consensus hnRNP A2-binding sequence that matches both A2RE11 and the telomeric repeat</title><p>Binding of A2RE11 and the telomeric repeat to what appears to be the same sequence-specific site on hnRNP A2 led us to investigate the molecular requirements for association with this site. Using competition UV-cross-linking EMSAs we examined the ability of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled dA2RE11 mutated in single positions, dA2RE11 and dNS1 to compete with the radiolabeled dA2RE11 probe. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows representative data. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> presents the consensus sequence for binding. One nucleotide, G6, is absolutely required and a further four may be one of two nucleotides. There is no discrimination between nucleotides for 4 of the 11 positions. Parallel experiments with truncated dA2RE11 molecules had indicated that for this oligodeoxyribonucleotide only one nucleotide could be deleted from either end without weakening binding to hnRNP A2 (data not shown).</p><p>The sequence TTAGGGT matches the consensus sequence exactly and the remaining four positions in the 11mer may be filled by any deoxynucleotide or are possibly not bound to the protein. Given the multi-functional nature of hnRNP A2&#x02014;e.g. in RNA packaging, alternative RNA splicing, telomere maintenance, RNA transport and translation&#x02014;it is anticipated that it will bind other ssDNA and ssRNA motifs specified by this consensus sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>Telomeric DNA repeat binds the concatenated RRMs</title><p>Previous experiments showed that A2RE binding to hnRNP A2 was recapitulated with the tandem RRMs with an additional 10 C-terminal residues (i.e. residues 1&#x02013;189 of the rat or human protein, RRM1+2&#x02032;), with little binding to the isolated RRMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). A parallel result was obtained with Telo3: no binding of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide to RRM1 was observed, with some binding to RRM2 and much stronger association with the concatenated RRMs and the whole protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This reinforces the conclusion that the telomeric repeat oligonucleotides and A2RE11 most likely recognize the same sites, both specific and non-specific, on the protein and that the C-terminal glycine-rich region is not needed for tight (nM) binding. These results for the individual RRMs differ from previous observations with hnRNP A1, which showed strong binding of a decameric telomere repeat to RRM1, weaker binding to RRM2 and the strongest association with the RRM concatamer (UP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>hnRNP A2 protects the telomeric DNA repeat against endonuclease digestion</title><p>The <sup>32</sup>P-labeled telomeric repeat DNA and an oligonucleotide with the complementary sequence were added to hnRNP A2 at several different protein concentrations before digestion with the endonuclease DNase I. The effects of the added protein on the oligonucleotide stability were monitored by gel electrophoresis. In the absence of the hnRNP A2 both oligonucleotides were largely degraded, but with increasing protein concentrations Telo6, but not the complementary oligonucleotide (Anti6), showed increasing levels of protection from DNase action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The protection of this 36-nt molecule suggests that either multiple copies of hnRNP A2 bind or the DNA structure is such that all potential cleavage sites are obscured by one protein molecule.</p><p>Experiments with different protein modules suggest that the role played by hnRNP A2 in DNase protection is more complex than simple binding of the oligonucleotide. The RRM1+2&#x02032; concatamer appears to bind almost as effectively as the whole protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>) and might therefore be expected to confer protection against degradation. However, protection was afforded only by the intact protein and not by this concatamer or the individual RRMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), thus implicating the glycine-rich region as a factor promoting the stability of the oligonucleotide. But the GRD alone appeared not to protect the oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>hnRNP A2 binds the RNA template of telomerase</title><p>In addition to binding telomeric ssDNA repeats, hnRNP A2 also binds the first 71 nt of human telomerase RNA, the segment known to bind hnRNP A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). This 5&#x02032; segment of hTR was <sup>32</sup>P-labeled, incubated with increasing amounts of recombinant hnRNP A2 and separated by PAGE. In the absence of hnRNP A2 the 71-nt RNA segment migrates in two bands with apparent sizes of &#x0223c;139 nt (the anticipated size, including the vector T7 sequence) and &#x0223c;280 nt (possibly arising through dimerization or formation of secondary structures): the former is unchanged but the latter is absent at high hnRNP A2 concentrations, suggesting that the more slowly migrating form of the RNA interacts preferentially with the protein. At higher protein concentrations, the RNA was retarded, indicating interaction of the protein with the RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, arrow on the right). The marked difference in RNA binding between the samples with 2 and 5 pmol of hnRNP A2 suggests cooperative binding: a similarly abrupt shift in binding with increasing protein concentration has been observed for the binding of hnRNP A1 RRM1 to the (TTAGGG)<sub>10</sub> DNA oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>).</p><p>The specificity of the protein&#x02013;RNA interaction was demonstrated by the lack of protein binding to the heat-denatured RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The denatured RNA was almost entirely the faster, possibly monomeric, form shown not to bind to the protein. The small amount of the slower migrating RNA remaining after denaturation was retarded by hnRNP A2: this is faintly visible in the right-hand track of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> (arrow on the left). Little RNA binding to RRM2 was evident in UV-cross-linking EMSAs performed with the expressed modules of hnRNP A2, but binding to RRM1 matched that of the tandem RRMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>hnRNP A2 is preferentially localized with PML and TRF2 in APBs</title><p>To date, there have been no reports of colocalization <italic>in vivo</italic> of hnRNP proteins and telomeric DNA although hnRNP C1/C2 has been demonstrated to colocalize with TRF1 and TRF2, both of which are primarily telomere-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Examination of metaphase spreads of telomerase-positive and telomerase-negative human fibroblast lines by immunostaining with antibodies to hnRNP A2 followed by fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization for telomeric DNA frequently showed localization of hnRNP A2 at telomeres (data not shown), but the protein could not be detected consistently, possibly indicating that the amount of protein is at the limit of detection with these antibodies. Immunofluorescence staining of human fibroblasts with antibodies to hnRNP A2, TRF2 and PML showed that these proteins colocalized in APBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). These structures are found only in telomerase-negative cell lines and tumors that use the ALT mechanism of telomere maintenance, and are a subset of the PML nuclear bodies that are characterized by the presence of extrachromosomal telomeric DNA, telomere binding proteins, such as TRF1 and TRF2, and other proteins involved in recombination and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). These <italic>in vivo</italic> observations thus support our <italic>in vitro</italic> demonstration of specific interactions between hnRNP A2 and the telomeric DNA repeat sequence.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Many proteins are involved in the synthesis and maintenance of telomeres. They include Pot1, which binds the G-rich telomere end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>), and TRF1 and TRF2, which bind double-stranded telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). These proteins are negative regulators of telomere extension. Loss of TRF2 leads to cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>) and end-to-end ligation of telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>). Other proteins associated with TRF1, TRF2 or the ssDNA repeats have been identified, including several members of the hnRNP family. The roles of the hnRNPs in telomere biology are not well established but if, as proposed, some recruit telomerase to the chromosome ends they would be expected to support telomere extension, with diminished protein expression resulting in telomere shortening.</p><p>The hnRNP A/B proteins are abundant in many cell types. They are localized primarily to the nucleus where they may bind the telomeric DNA repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) and participate in telomere maintenance. They are also involved in packaging nascent mRNA, in alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>), and in cytoplasmic RNA trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>), translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>) and stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>). In each role they presumably interact with sets of molecules that incorporate different RNA or DNA elements.</p><p>All the major proteins in the hnRNP A/B family, A1, A2 and A3, and their isoforms, were isolated in our pull-down experiments with the telomeric repeat. In the rat brain, hnRNPs A2 and A3 are the predominant binding proteins. These proteins share high sequence identity, with hnRNPs A3 and A1 being more closely related than hnRNPs A2 and A1. Over the tandem RRM region they have &#x0223c;80% sequence identity and hence hnRNPs A2 and A3 are likely to share the typical RRM &#x003b2;&#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b2;&#x003b1;&#x003b2; fold of hnRNP A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>). The crystal structure of the UP1 proteolytic fragment of hnRNP A1 (residues 1&#x02013;196 of the human protein) complexed to the single-stranded telomeric repeat [d(TTAGGG)<sub>2</sub>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>) shows that the amino acid residues of hnRNP A1 that interact with the oligodeoxyribonucleotide are present in hnRNP A2, with the exception of a single Lys to Arg substitution. Because only the main chain atoms of this residue, K183, interact with G11, it is unlikely that substitution with arginine would interfere with the interaction between hnRNP A2 and the telomeric repeat. Despite this conservation of interacting residues, there are differences in the binding of the telomeric repeats by hnRNPs A1 and A2, as discussed below.</p><p>In an earlier study we presented evidence from EMSA and biosensor data that recombinant hnRNP A2 has two sites that bind oligoribonucleotides or oligodeoxyribonucleotides, but with this protein only the sequence-specific site was occupied in the presence of heparin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). In contrast, we discovered in this study that rat hnRNP A2 also has two sites but binds oligodeoxyribonucleotides at the non-specific site even in the presence of heparin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Possession of two sites raises the possibility of the protein acting as a non-covalent cross-linker of nucleic acids. DNA or RNA molecules (containing e.g. the telomere repeat or A2RE11) occupying the specific site may be linked to any other ssDNA. The ability to bind the telomeric repeat at both sites may also be important for protection of the ssDNA from nuclease activity.</p><p>Although the telomere repeat binds the isolated RRM1 of hnRNP A2 weakly (if at all) and isolated RRM2 somewhat more strongly, the tandem extended RRMs (residues 1&#x02013;189) are needed for binding that matches the whole protein. This binding pattern deviates from that for hnRNP A1, the first RRM of which was found to bind more tightly than RRM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). RRM1 is sufficient for A1/UP1binding to a telomeric DNA oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). This difference points to the divergence in the mode of interaction for hnRNPs A1 and A2, with the latter possibly not mimicking the anti-parallel dimeric molecular arrangement observed in the crystalline state, in which oligonucleotides bind RRM1 of one hnRNP A1 molecule and RRM2 of the other.</p><p>The requirements in the nucleic acid for binding to the sequence-specific site of hnRNP A2 were established by mutational analysis, starting with A2RE11. This led to a consensus sequence that includes the telomeric sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and the hnRNP A1-binding d(GGCAG) tandem repeats of the mouse hypervariable minisatelite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Changes in a single nucleotide have been shown to markedly alter oligonucleotide binding to hnRNP A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and UP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). As a consequence of the redundancy at several positions in the consensus sequence, it can give rise to many different oligonucleotides. hnRNP A2, a recognized multi-tasking protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>), may therefore potentially interact with numerous different RNA or DNA elements, thereby influencing many metabolic or signaling pathways. Moreover, it could act as the link between pathways utilizing nucleic acids that compete for binding to its RRMs.</p><p>UP1 binds the telomeric repeat sequence specifically <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>), protecting it from degradation by nucleases, and demonstrates helix-unwinding ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>). UP1 also binds the telomerase holoenzyme <italic>in vitro</italic>, promoting telomere extension at low concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), but inhibiting it at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). In addition, both hnRNP A1 and UP1 bind telomerase RNA and telomeric DNA simultaneously <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), and may thus be capable of recruiting telomerase to form part of the protective complex on telomere ends.</p><p>The segment of hnRNP A2 equivalent to UP1, UP1-B (which is contained within RRM1+2&#x02032;), is necessary and sufficient to bind the telomeric sequence <italic>in vitro</italic> but it did not mirror the behavior of UP1: in our experiments it did not protect the telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Protection against endonuclease-catalyzed degradation required the whole protein, suggesting that the glycine-rich C-terminal domain of hnRNP A2 plays a critical role in this action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Protection <italic>in vivo</italic> is also provided by other telomere-associated molecules that bind to multiple sites, such as Pot1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>).</p><p>hnRNP A2 retarded the 5&#x02032; 71-nt segment of hTR in an EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This includes the template region which is within the single-stranded region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>) that is most likely to bind hnRNP A2. The apparent binding of hnRNP A2 to dimers, rather than monomers, of the 5&#x02032; 71-nt hTR segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) may not faithfully recapitulate the molecular interactions <italic>in vivo</italic>, but functional telomerase is dimeric and includes two RNA molecules that cooperate functionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>).</p><p>Fiset and Chabot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>) earlier proposed that hnRNP A1 could simultaneously bind telomerase, through interaction with its RNA, and the telomeric DNA repeat, thus providing a mechanism for recruitment of telomerase to the chromosome ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Our observation that hnRNP A2 has two binding sites for single-stranded oligonucleotides leads to a parallel conclusion but, based on current evidence, the molecular mechanisms differ for these two proteins. The sites on hnRNP A1 for the telomeric DNA repeat and telomerase RNA were identified as residing on RRM1 and RRM2, respectively, whereas both RRM modules of hnRNP A2 are needed for tight binding to the repeat. RRM1 and the tandem RRMs of hnRNP A2 bind the 71-nt RNA segment, whereas no binding of RRM2 was apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The telomerase RNA is therefore unlikely to be bound to the non-specific hnRNP A2 site, which appears not to bind oligoribonucleotides strongly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), nor does it bind the entire sequence-specific site, which spans the tandem RRMs. Further investigation is needed to establish whether its association with RRM1 makes use of part of the sequence-specific site.</p><p>In the mouse erythroleukemic cell line CB3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>), there is no measurable hnRNP A1 expression and the terminal repeat DNA fragments are markedly shorter than those in the similar cell line, CB7, which expresses hnRNP A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). But even after multiple passages of CB3, the mean terminal repeat fragment length did not change significantly, indicating that although hnRNP A1 may be required for full telomerase-mediated extension, in its absence another protein (or proteins) can prevent degradation of the telomere. On the basis of the results reported here, it is possible that the closely related hnRNP A2 protein can fulfill some or all of these functions.</p><p>Interestingly, hnRNP A2 and TRF2 are both present at higher than background levels in APBs. These intranuclear domains, which contain extrachromosomal telomeric DNA and telomere-specific binding proteins together with PML proteins, are specific for ALT-positive cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Their function is unknown, but it has been proposed that they might be depots of telomeric DNA and associated proteins required for ALT, or function as platforms for the ALT process. Telomeric DNA is not associated with the PML bodies of telomerase-positive cell lines and it is absent from many PML bodies within ALT cell nuclei, i.e. APBs are a subset of the PML bodies in ALT cells. The presence of hnRNP A2 in APBs (but not in PML bodies that do not contain telomeric DNA) suggests that telomeric chromatin is sufficient for the localization of hnRNP A2, and that hTR and telomerase activity are not required. hnRNP A2 was not present in every APB, consistent with the possibility that some aspect of the state of the telomeric chromatin is responsible for hnRNP A2 localization. It will be of interest to determine whether there are interactions among the hnRNPs and other proteins, such as Pot1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>), that protect the telomere ends from degradation.</p><p>In conclusion, from our studies it is evident that hnRNP A2 binds in a complex fashion to ssDNA and ssRNA. We found that rat brain hnRNP A2 has two sites for binding oligonucleotides. One binds oligodeoxyribonucleotides in preference to oligoribonucleotides and shows little discrimination between diverse sequences. The second, which requires both RRMs, has been shown to bind to sequences defined by the consensus sequence N(A,C,T)(C,T)(A,T)(A,G)G(C,G,T)(A,T)NNN: this sequence encompasses the telomeric repeat sequence. In addition, the template-containing segment of telomerase RNA binds to RRM1, raising the possibility that it completes with the ssDNA telomeric repeat for the hnRNP A2 sequence-specific site. As the G-rich overhanging strand lengthens, it may compete more effectively with telomerase RNA for binding to RRM1, displacing the RNA and thus limiting the telomerase-mediated strand extension. Although hnRNP A2 binds telomerase RNA, the preferential localization of hnRNP A2 with TRF2 in APBs suggests that telomerase is not needed for association with telomeric DNA. Combined with our <italic>in vitro</italic> binding data, the localization in APBs suggests an important role for this protein in telomere maintenance.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Dr Adrian Krainer for generously supplying the hnRNP A2 plasmid.

In deriving the consensus sequence it has been assumed that substitution at each position is without direct effect on the binding of the non-mutated nucleotides.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gki203f4"/></fig><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Both RRM domains of recombinant hnRNP A2 are required for binding the telomeric sequence. (<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the recombinant proteins used. RRM, RNA recognition motif; GRD, glycine-rich domain. The prime indicates the presence of the additional 10 residues (179&#x02013;189) beyond the C-terminal end of RRM2 that markedly increase the affinity of the concatenated RRMs for A2RE and A2RE11.

Free Telo3 probe is indicated at bottom left. Although the telomeric sequence does not appear to bind RRM1, it binds RRM2 and associates more tightly with the concatenated RRMs and the whole protein.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gki203f5"/></fig><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Recombinant hnRNP A2 protects telomeric DNA against DNase digestion. (<bold>A</bold>) Increasing concentrations of recombinant hnRNP A2 (1, 4 and 10 &#x003bc;M) were incubated with the <sup>32</sup>P end-labeled hexameric telomeric DNA repeat [Telo6, (TTAGGG)<sub>6</sub>], or the complementary sequence [Anti6, (CCCTAA)<sub>6</sub>], before adding the endonuclease DNase I. Breakdown products of the oligonucleotides were separated on a 20% polyacrylamide/7 M urea gel. Both oligonucleotides are extensively degraded in the absence of hnRNP A2. In the presence of this protein the telomeric sequence (left panel), but not the complementary sequence (right), is resistant to endonuclease digestion. (<bold>B</bold>) The GRD of hnRNP A2 is necessary but not sufficient for DNase I protection. Each recombinant protein (10 &#x003bc;M of RRM1, RRM2, RRM1+2&#x02032; or hnRNP A2) was assessed for its ability to protect the telomeric DNA. The proteins were incubated with <sup>32</sup>P end-labeled Telo6 or Anti6 before adding DNase I. Breakdown products of the oligonucleotides were separated on a 20% polyacrylamide/7 M urea gel and visualized by autoradiography. The individual or concatenated RRMs provided no protection: the intact protein was required, suggesting that the glycine-rich region is involved in protecting the telomeric sequence against enzymatic degradation. The telomeric sequence, but not its complement, is protected. (<bold>C</bold>) DNase I protection assay performed as described above, using 1, 4 and 10 &#x003bc;M of the recombinant GRD protein. This domain appears to be necessary but not sufficient for RNA protection.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gki203f6"/></fig><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>hnRNP A2 binds the first 71 nt of human telomerase RNA.
