It is highly expressed in developing heart and fetal gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]; and re-expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells in vivo after vascular injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], suggesting that it plays an important role in cardiovascular growth and differentiation. Recently by a number of investigators, HDGF was found to be tumorigenic and a prognostic factor for a number of cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We have discovered that HDGF functions as a transcriptional repressor, suggesting that HDGF may physiologically regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation by repressing the genes governing terminal differentiation (submitted). However using NMR structural analyses, it is unclear if HDGF is a direct DNA binding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and controversial if the conserved N-terminal PWWP domain in HDGF is involved in DNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, using a modified chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we found that HDGF bound a conserved ~200 base pair sequence common to an HDGF target gene promoter. EMSA and DNase I footprinting analysis revealed that HDGF-DNA interaction is specific. In EMSA mapping studies, we found HDGF bound a minimal 37 bp long oligonucleotide and DNA binding required the HDGF N-terminal PWWP domain. Furthermore, this DNA sequence is functionally significant as HDGF represses a reporter gene which was controlled by the identified DNA element.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>HDGF binds to DNA</title><p>HDGF is a nuclear protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and we recently have shown that it functions as a transcriptional repressor (submitted). However, whether HDGF binds DNA directly and if so, it's DNA binding specificity are both unknown. To functionally identify the HDGF DNA binding sequence we used a modified ChIP assay to identify homologous sequences, if any, as potential DNA binding motifs. After 100 clones were sequenced, sequence alignment analysis found that there was a group of 10 sequences that shared a ~200 bp highly conserved sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). No homologous sequences were identified in 50 clones which were immunoprecipitated by a GFP control antibody. A highly conserved copy was found within the promoter of SMYD1, a HDGF target gene through database searching of the human genome (NCBI BLAST). We found this conserved element located at the promoter -600 to -880 bp proximal to the start codon. Alignments of the ChIP sequences with the SMYD1 promoter identified a highly conserved 80 bp motif (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). By ChIP-PCR, we successfully amplified this specific region (-702 to -565) from immunoprecipitated chromatin DNA using a HDGF specific antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). As a control, no amplification was observed for a proximal site (-375 to -215). We then verified HDGF DNA binding using an in vitro competition EMSA assay. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, the labeled 80 bp probe bound tightly to GST-HDGF. The binding was specific as 100 fold of the non-labeled 80 bp probe totally abolished the binding; however 100 fold of a nonspecific oligonucleotide competitor had no effect on the binding. Salmon sperm DNA is known as a strong competitor for DNA binding. However, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, the binding of the 80 bp probe to HDGF could be blocked only when the concentration of salmon sperm DNA reached 2 ug, which is approximately a 30,000 molar fold excess to the input labeled oligo (0.25 pmol). In addition, HDGF binding was not an artifact of using GST tagged HDGF as an EMSA using another tagged protein, His-HDGF, or non-tagged in vitro translated HDGF, all demonstrated equivalent tight binding to the EMSA probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). From these results, we conclude that HDGF binds an 80 bp DNA sequence conserved within the promoter of the HDGF target gene SMYD1.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Alignment of ChIP clones identify a HDGF binding motif consensus with the SMYD1 gene promoter</bold>.

(A) HDGF binds DNA in vivo. ChIP was carried out as described in method. A specific HDGF polyclonal antibody was used to precipitate Hela chromatin, GFP antibody was used as negative control. Recovered DNA was amplified by PCR using specific primers. The PCR primers were derived from the human SMYD1 promoter as described in methods. The PCR products were analyzed by ethidium bromide staining of a 2% agarose gel. A primer set targeting a proximal site (-375 to -215) of the SMYD1 promoter was used as a negative control.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, the binding was completely lost with a probe shorter than 50 bp. To further narrow down the DNA recognition motif, we first took out another 4 bp at the 3' end of this 50 bp probe in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, then made another serial deletion set from the 5' end based on the 46 bp probe. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, incremental deletion of the 5' end of the 46 bp probe, identified a 37 bp motif that is required for HDGF binding. A 37 bp DNA motif required for DNA binding is relatively long. In fact we could not detect any HDGF DNA binding when we used 5 short DNA probes which are all 15 bp long with a 5 bp overlap, covering the central part of the 80 bp oligo (Data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>HDGF requires a minimal 37 bp DNA sequence for binding</bold>.

The DNA fragment used in footprinting analysis is the same as the probe used in EMSA. The protected region starts from 34 bp from the 3' end (which correlates to the -642 bp in SMYD1 gene promoter) to 5' end. We could not get a clear footprint of 5' end because it is too close to the 5' of the DNA fragment we used. However, the result is consistent with the data of EMSA, that the 5' of the 80 bp DNA fragment is critical for HDGF-DNA interaction. These data indicated that HDGF binds DNA specifically, but the binding requires a large DNA molecule.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>HDGF protect DNA from DNase I digestion</bold>.

Co-transfection of HDGF with this reporter (Hcis-SV40-LUC) significantly repressed the reporter gene activity in a dose dependent manner (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). As a control, overexpression of HDGF had no effect on the reporter without the HDGF binding element (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).

Although controversial, the PWWP domain is reported to have the capability of binding DNA as has been shown for DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3b) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In order to study whether the HDGF PWWP domain is responsible for DNA binding, we made several truncated HDGF fusion proteins to test for DNA binding in EMSA experiments. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, only the truncated proteins which contain the whole PWWP domain can bind to DNA (&#x00394;1&#x02013;110, &#x00394;1&#x02013;140, &#x00394;1&#x02013;146), whereas proteins lacking the complete PWWP domain can not bind to DNA. Importantly the entire PWWP domain is required as fusions containing a portion of the PWWP domain could not bind (&#x00394;70&#x02013;237) or bound weakly (&#x00394;35&#x02013;237).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>PWWP domain is required for HDGF DNA binding</bold>.

Because of these attributes, it has been hypothesized that HDGF, especially considering it contains a PWWP domain, is a DNA regulatory protein. In this study, we found that HDGF binds directly to DNA via a specific element contained in the promoter of a HDGF target gene, SMYD1. Functionally this DNA binding element also confers transcriptional repression activity. SMYD1 gene is essential for cardiomyocyte differentiation and cardiac morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], the regulation of SMYD1 by HDGF is in accord with the functional importance of HDGF in the development of cardiovascular system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], likely playing a role in preventing terminal differentiation.</p><p>We found that HDGF prefers to bind a large DNA molecule, requiring a minimum 37 bp DNA fragment. It is surprising that HDGF binds such a long DNA fragment. In a recent structural study on the interaction of the HDGF PWWP domain with DNA, we identified unique alterations in the structure of the HDGF PWWP domain with the addition of DNA. However we could not confirm whether these interactions with DNA were specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This was due to the technical requirements of both SAAB and NMR for oligonucleotides shorter than 30 bp. In the present study, with EMSA and longer oligonucleotides we found that the length of DNA fragment is critical for HDGF binding. HDGF tightly binds DNA only when the DNA is &#x02265;37 bp, suggesting that this HDGF/DNA interaction may require a unique DNA structure.</p><p>Transcription factor binding sites are usually short, highly degenerate, and often require specific tertiary structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. For example estrogen receptor response element (ERE) is a palindromic motif. However when we analyzed the 37 bp core sequence for HDGF binding using EXTRACTFEAT program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], we could not identify any special structure such as palindromes or repeated structures within this 37 bp core HDGF binding sequence. It is of interest that the 37 bp HDGF DNA binding element is a component of an Alu DNA repeat. The Alu DNA family is the most abundant members of the short interspersed repeated DNA elements (SINEs) which are found in the genomes of primates exclusively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Alu sequences are approximately 300 bp in length, have a bipartite structure with left and right arm monomers which are derived from the 7SL RNA gene. The overall function of these repeats is unclear, but of interest to the present study, these repeats containing the HDGF binding sequence are found within the promoters of all HDGF target genes identified so far [see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>].</p><p>HDGF is evolutionary relative new. Besides mammals, HDGF homologs also exist in other organisms, such as xenopus and rodents. Although Alu DNA is found exclusively in primates, there is homologous SINE DNA in rodents such as the B1 and B2 DNA elements of the mouse. More interestingly, the mouse genome is estimated to contain 10,000 copies of a retroposon family that is closely related to human Alu repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Comparative study of the DNA binding in both human and mouse will give us more information on the conservation of this binding element.</p><p>The N-terminus of HDGF contains a PWWP domain, a weakly conserved 90 amino acid motif, originally identified in the WHSC1 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and as the HATH (homologous to the amino terminus of HDGF) region in the HDGF family of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], it has been found in more than 60 eukaryotic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Functionally, most of the PWWP family proteins are involved in chromatin remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However the role of the PWWP domain in this function is unknown. We demonstrate the first functional significance of the PWWP domain as it is necessary and sufficient for binding to the HDGF DNA binding element. The PWWP domain was hypothesized to be a site for protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, the PWWP domain of DNMT3b was shown to interact with DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In a more detailed investigation, the PWWP domain of DNMT3b was found to bind major satellite DNA nonspecifically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, the PWWP in its closest homologue gene, DNMT3a (60.3% identity) had no DNA binding activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This suggests that small changes in the PWWP domain may have a significant impact on its DNA binding ability. As the PWWP domain in HDGF is only 25.9% homologous with DNMT3a, it is not surprising that HDGF could have a different DNA binding behavior.</p><p>A recent structural study found that under physiological conditions, both PWWP modules and full length human HDGF could form dimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Using the SPR method, the authors found that PWWP dimer binds to heparin with higher affinity than that of a monomeric PWWP module. Several sequence specific DNA binding protein such as C/EBP, c-Myc, c-Jun and fos form hetero/homo dimers. Their leucine-zipper motifs do not face with the DNA. Rather, they form three-dimensional "scaf-carboxylfolds" that match the contour of DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Whether HDGF dimerizes on DNA and utilizes the similar mechanism of DNA recognition remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown that HDGF is a DNA binding protein; specifically binds a DNA element in the promoter of SMYD1 gene. This DNA/HDGF interaction is unique in that the minimum required binding element was 37 bp in length. Importantly the poorly understood N-terminal PWWP domain of HDGF was responsible for DNA binding. Taken together HDGF functions in the nucleus as a direct DNA binding protein to repress the expression of specific target genes to likely regulate cell proliferation and differentiation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids Construction</title><p>HDGF expression construct (pK7-GFP-HDGF) was described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].

Briefly, 1 ug purified recombinant HDGF or truncated HDGF protein was incubated with 0.25 pmol 5' end biotin labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide in the reaction buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 5% glycerol, 0.05% NP-40, 0.1 ug sheared salmon sperm DNA) for 30 min on ice. The reaction mixture was loaded onto a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was run in 0.1 &#x000d7; TBE buffer at 200 V for 2 hours. DNA-protein complex were transferred to a nylon membrane in 0.5 &#x000d7; TBE buffer and UV crosslinked. The biotin end-labeled DNA probe was detected using a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and the chemiluminescent substrate. The 80 bp double stranded oligo probe is located at -688 to -609 of SMYD1 promoter (+1 is the start codon), the sequence of biotin labeled sense strand is 5'-Bio-CAGGCTGGTCTTGAACTCCTGACCTCAGATGATCCATGTGCCTCGGCCTCCCAAGGTGGGGATTACAGGCGTGAGCCACC-3'. The sequence of sense strand of non-specific competitor is 5'-TGCTGTTGACAGTGAGCGCGGCCAGCTTATAGTCATATATTAGTGAAGCCACAGATGTAATATATGACTATAAGCTGGCCTTGCCTACTGCCTCGGA. All of the DNA probes were synthesized by IDT DNA Inc.</p></sec><sec><title>DNase I footprinting analysis</title><p>We used a non-radioactive detection method for DNase I footprinting analysis. DNA fragment covers -688 to -609 of SMYD1 promoter (+1 is the start codon) was used in this experiment, the sequence is the same as the 80 bp oligo probe used in EMSA. Binding reactions (100 &#x003bc;L) comprised 1 ug purified recombinant HDGF protein, 0.25 pmol double-stranded oligonucleotide (5' end of sense strand was labeled by biotin), 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 5% glycerol, 0.05% NP-40, 0.1 ug sheared salmon sperm DNA, the reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min. One volume of 10 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>5 mM CaCl<sub>2 </sub>was added. Each reaction mixture was then treated with increasing amounts of DNase I, from 0.01 to 0.1 Kunitz units (Worthington) for 120 seconds and stopped by adding 200 &#x003bc;L stop solution (1% sodium dodecyl sulphate, 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 40 mg/mL yeast tRNA). Reactions were extracted once with one volume of phenol-chloroform, and precipitated with two volumes of ethanol at -80&#x000b0;C for 60 minutes. Reactions were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 13,200 g. DNA pellets were washed with 80% ethanol and air dried. Pellets were resuspended in 5 &#x003bc;L of loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.05% Bromophenol Blue, 0.05% Xylene Cyanol FF). Reactions were loaded on a 6% (19:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide) polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 7 M urea and 1 &#x000d7; TBE (89 mM Tris base, 89 mM boric acid, 2.5 mM EDTA). The gel was run at 50 watts in 1 &#x000d7; TBE buffer. The DNA fragments were transferred to a charged Nylon membrane and detected using Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module (Pierce, 89880).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell Culture and Transient Transfection</title><p>G7 myoblast cells were purchased from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum and 10% horse serum (ATCC). Transient transfection assays were performed using FuGENE6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instruction. G7 cells in 6 well plates were transfected with 0.5 ug of Hcis-SV40-LUC reporter construct and 0.1&#x02013;0.5 ug of pK7-GFP-HDGF or pK7-GFP vector as control, 0.1 ug of pRL-CMV was cotransfected as internal control, the total DNA concentration was held constant by adding empty vector. 24 hours after transfection, Luciferase assays were performed using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay Systems (Promega). 20 ul of cell lysate was measured in a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratories) as described in the manufacturer's manual. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized for Renilla luciferase activity. All transfection data are represented as the mean &#x000b1; SEM of at least 3 independent experiments performed in duplicate.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AE and JY participated in the design of the study, drafting and revising the manuscript.
