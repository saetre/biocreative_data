Using fluorescent reporters for the expression of Nanog, we observed that a population of ES cells is best described by a dynamic distribution of Nanog expression characterized by two peaks defined by high (HN) and low (LN) Nanog expression. Typically, the LN state is 5&#x00025;&#x02013;20&#x00025; of the total population, depending on the culture conditions. Modelling of the activity of Nanog reveals that a simple network of Oct4/Sox2 and Nanog activity can account for the observed distribution and its properties as long as the transcriptional activity is tuned by transcriptional noise. The model also predicts that the LN state is unstable, something that is born out experimentally. While in this state, cells can differentiate. We suggest that transcriptional fluctuations in Nanog expression are an essential element of the pluripotent state and that the function of Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog is to act as a network that promotes and maintains transcriptional noise to interfere with the differentiation signals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Embryonic stem (ES) cells are a pluripotent cell population derived from early mammalian embryos. An intrinsic feature of ES cells is their phenotypic heterogeneity: they display promiscuous activation of lineage-specific genes and exhibit a fluctuating flow of differentiating cells. A gene regulatory network (GRN) centred around the transcription factors Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog is essential for the establishment and the maintenance of the pluripotent state. Previous studies had suggested that ES cells can reversibly change their state of Nanog expression without losing pluripotency. Here, we extend these studies by quantifying and monitoring the expression of Nanog in a Nanog-GFP reporter cell line. We show that Nanog levels undergo slow, random fluctuations in ES cells, giving rise to heterogeneous cell populations. We identify two states, one stable, characterized by high levels of expression (HN), and another with low levels of Nanog expression (LN), which is highly unstable. While in the LN state, cells are more likely to differentiate depending on the culture medium. Mathematical modelling shows that a simple excitable system driven by transcriptional noise can account for the observed distributions and behaviours in gene expression. Our study suggests that rather than a discrete state dependent on the fixed expression of a small set of genes, pluripotency is best represented by a state of dynamic heterogeneity of a population driven by transcriptional noise, and that the function of the gene regulatory network centred around Nanog might be to generate dynamic heterogeneities at the population level.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Embryonic stem (ES) cells are cultured pluripotent cell populations derived from the epiblast of mammalian embryos, which can be induced to differentiate into a variety of cell types under controlled conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000149-Evans1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000149-Smith1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

In ES cells, variability resulting from transcriptional noise would serve a related function: to keep a subpopulation of ES cells continuously primed for differentiation without a single cell being precommitted to a particular fate for a long period of time. Such priming would be advantageous in situations in which cells must be ready to respond to a diverse range of external signals within a short period of time and commit rapidly to one of several potential fates. A dynamical mechanism that could provide for such transient and stochastically driven priming is excitability.</p><p>A nonlinear dynamical system is called excitable if it responds to small perturbations (beyond a certain threshold) with a large pulse, for example, of gene expression, whose shape is mostly independent of the perturbation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000149-Lindner1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>. In what follows, we introduce a mathematical model based on the concept of excitable dynamics that aims to interpret the experimental results presented earlier and generates new predictions that are tested experimentally.

The movement of a cell in phase space is determined by the relative concentration of Nanog and Oct4, and shows that the system has a single stable steady state (white circle), corresponding to high levels of both Nanog and Oct4. The topology of the phase space, as dictated by the location of the N (green) and A (red) nullclines and the slope field (grey vectors in the background), allows that small perturbations of the steady state generate excursions in phase space towards regions where the level of Nanog is low. Since there is no proper steady state in this region, after a deterministic time, the cell is forced to return spontaneously to the state in which Nanog is high, driven by the structure of the network (blue line). A consequence of this dynamical behaviour is that Oct4 levels are more variable in the low-level Nanog state, where trajectories fluctuate strongly along the left branch of the N nullcline, than in the high-level Nanog state, where the cell spends most of the time near the steady state.

This would account for the observed unequal distribution, and imply that at any given time, there will be a pool of LN cells that will exhibit a rapid (deterministic) gain of Nanog expression. We tested this prediction first in a population of P19 OTOY cells by sorting subpopulations of cells expressing different levels of Nanog-YFP and monitoring their ability to interconvert into each other over a period of time. After 24 h, a LN population exhibits a bimodal distribution with about 20&#x00025;&#x02013;30&#x00025; of the cells in a peak centred around the mode value of the HN population of the starting distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000149-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast with this unstable behaviour, cells from the HN peak hardly change after 24 h, with about 99&#x00025; of cells detected in the HN region. We made similar observations in the TNGA cells; in this case, the shift after 24 h is clearer because the dynamic range is larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000149-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), but the essence of the behaviour is the same: a rapid transition from the LN to the HN state. It is noticeable that LN cells do not approach the HN state progressively but rather appear to be choosing between two states. These observations support the prediction from the model that the LN state is unstable and that cells in this state have a high tendency to move to the HN state.</p><fig id="pbio-1000149-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000149.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Different behaviour of subpopulations with different levels of Nanog.</title><p>Dynamics of Nanog-GFP expression in subpopulations of EC (P19OTOY) and ES (TNGA) cells and in embryoid body (EB) expressing different levels of Nanog-FP (A&#x02013;C).

This onset spreads throughout the population. Interestingly, the buildup of fluorescence is not progressive, and cells appear to gain GFP expression rapidly, as would have been predicted from the dynamics of the profiles. An important element of the model that is implicit in the observed behaviour is that the decision to express GFP is stochastic, i.e., there is no spatial nor temporal pattern to the onset of GFP expression. To test this further, we sorted cells from the plateau between the LN and the HN states, which we anticipated might be in an intermediate state of the decision-making process.

It suggests that in the excursions to the LN state, the expression of Oct4 should be more variable than in the HN state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000149-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Observation of Oct4 expression reveals variability, albeit with a smaller dynamic range than that of Nanog, which is also reflected in the expression of GFP under the control of Oct4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000149-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). To test whether there is a correlation between this variability and the state of Nanog expression, we sorted LN and HN cells and stained them for Oct4 expression. Whereas the HN cells have fairly uniform high levels of Oct4 expression, the LN cells show a wide range of Oct4 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000149-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>). This observation is in agreement with the model and is likely to be correlated with the observation that the LN state is a differentiation-prone state that will require instability of Oct4 expression and function. Furthermore, this observation could be interpreted in terms of our proposal that the LN state arises from excitability rather than as a second stable state, since in the latter situation, one would expect much less variability in the expression of Oct4 in the LN state.</p><fig id="pbio-1000149-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000149.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Expression of Oct4 in sorted HN and LN TNGA cells.</title><p>(A) Expression of Oct4 in TNGA cells sorted for HN (green line) and LN (blue line).

This suggestion captures many of the properties of the pluripotent state and is based on our observation that, in the steady state, an ES cell population can be represented by a dynamic distribution of cells with varying levels of Nanog-GFP expression, whose characteristics are resistant to fluctuations and are stable over time, and which can be established by individual cells independently of their origin within the distribution. This last observation indicates the existence of a cell-autonomous mechanism for the generation of the distribution and of attractor states in the system.</p><p>Simulations of a simple model of a dynamical excitable system based on known interactions between members of the SON network and driven by transcriptional noise yields the observed distribution of Nanog expression. This suggests that an interplay between deterministic transcriptional interactions and noise are important elements of pluripotency. In our model, the system has a stable attractor in the HN state, but noise-driven fluctuations lead individual cells to stochastic excursions into a transient LN state, from which they are driven back to the HN state in a deterministic manner dictated by the topology of the network. The accumulation of cells in the LN region of the distribution is a consequence of the dwell time of the cells in the low Nanog-GFP expression state, i.e., of the time the network takes to react to the excitable pulse, and does not represent a stable state per se. In an alternative view, the LN state could be construed as metastable, and the system would be characterized by dynamic bistability between a strongly stable (HN) and a weakly (meta)stable (LN) state. However, although we cannot rule out this possibility, in noisy conditions, the LN would not appear as a stable state, and the difference between a bistable and an excitable system would be purely formal. Nonetheless, it is of interest to devise experimental tests of these possibilities because they might have different practical consequences. For the moment, we favour the excitable model whose essence is the dynamic noisy state of the system, which contrasts with other views that have sought to represent the biology of ES cells as a bistable system with self-renewal and differentiation as alternate stable and incompatible states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000149-Woolf1">&#x0005b;81&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000149-Chickarmane1">&#x0005b;82&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Silva and Smith have suggested that the pluripotent state represents a ground developmental state, determined by default, which serves as a platform for multilineage decisions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000149-Silva2">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results are consistent with this view and provide a formulation for its possible molecular representation in the form of a dynamic equilibrium of the fluctuating levels of Nanog expression. Furthermore, in this equilibrium, the HN and LN states are functionally significant, because in the LN state, but not in the HN state, cells appear to be prone to differentiate (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000149-Chambers3">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>). This is underscored by the lower and more variable levels of Oct4 characteristic of this cell population. Thus, rather than being defined by a specific cohort of genes or a landscape of epigenetic marking, stemness/pluripotency might be a state of dynamic cellular heterogeneity whose engine is the activity of the SON network. The function of this network might not be to regulate specific cohorts of pluripotency-specific genes to create a discrete and static state, but rather to use the fluctuating patterns of its elements to generate periodic interferences of continuous differentiation signals that exist in the medium or that might be intrinsic to the ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000149-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In this view, the main function of Sox2, Oct 4, and Nanog is to prevent the stabilization of differentiation signals. The signature of an ES cell would thus be a dynamical state driven by transcriptional noise, and exhibiting transient excursions into the LN state in which cells have an opportunity to differentiate, if the conditions allow. If this is indeed the case, it will be difficult to pinpoint a signature transcriptome for a population of ES cells, as such a transcriptome would depend on the culture conditions, which will determine the relative occupancy of the HN and LN states, the dynamics of the distribution, and also the complexity of the LN state.

Canham and J. Brickman, personal communication) in ES cells do indicate that fluctuations in gene expression are indeed a hallmark of these cells. However, at the moment, it is not clear what the correlations are between the different fluctuations nor whether all of them play a role in defining pluripotency.</p><p>The situation we have described here for ES cells is reminiscent of that in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> in which, under conditions of environmental stress, cells can either sporulate or enter into a competent state in which they can uptake DNA to mutagenise themselves and so increase their fitness in harsh conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000149-Suel1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000149-Suel2">&#x0005b;84&#x0005d;</xref>. The generation of the competent state is mediated by a noise-driven excitable system in the fashion suggested for the SON network. It might be that these networks provide a robust mechanism to generate cells that must be ready to respond to a diverse range of external signals within a short period of time and commit rapidly to one of several potential fates. This is consistent with the classical role of excitability in neural systems, which is to provide neurons with information-processing capabilities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000149-Koch1">&#x0005b;85&#x0005d;</xref>. Within a developing embryo, pluripotent cells must be ready to respond, quickly and in a very reliable way, to a variety of signals coming from neighbouring cells according to the spatiotemporal developmental program of the organism, in the same way that neurons in the brain must respond reliably to multiple electrical signals from their neighbours. We conjecture here that, just as in neurons, excitability might provide a very efficient signal-processing mechanism in pluripotent cells. Accordingly, signals propagating through the developing embryo would lead to the necessary chain of differentiation transitions. ES cells in vitro, on the other hand, would lack the developmental signals, but they would still reveal the excitable program through the Nanog excursions described in this paper, that would only lead to differentiation in a random fraction of cells. In that way, the behaviour of ES cells in vitro shows a glimpse of their capabilities within the embryo.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Perspectives and Conjectures</title><p>Recently, Chang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000149-Chang1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref> have reported a dynamic distribution of states for haematopoietic progenitors with very similar properties to the one we have described here for Nanog. Furthermore in that system, different subpopulations of the distribution also have distinct developmental potential. This, together with our finding that a simple GRN can model the distribution that we observe, suggests that cells have intrinsic state variables that can be measured reliably and which are likely to be related to the activity of specific GRNs. The nature of these state variables will require further analysis, but one could assume, in analogy with statistical physics, that they might be associated with some biochemical &#x0201c;free-energy&#x0201d; potential intrinsic to the underlying networks, and the distributions that we observe might be their reflection (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000149-Huang1">&#x0005b;86&#x0005d;</xref>). A conclusion from these observations is that transcriptional noise might be an essential element in the generation of heterogeneity in cell populations and that this forms a basis for pattern formation and regulation. This conclusion leads us to propose two conjectures.</p><p>Conjecture 1: Cells, particularly in multicellular organisms, have evolved mechanisms dedicated to the generation, maintenance, and filtering of cellular heterogeneity. In the case of ES cells, we surmise that the main and perhaps sole function of the SON network is to generate dynamic heterogeneity and that it does so by operating within a transcriptionally noisy regime driven by excitability: noise generates heterogeneity in a genetically homogeneous population. A corollary of this proposal is that different populations of stem cells might have networks made up of different component elements but with a similar function, the maintenance of stemness by periodically short-circuiting differentiation signals, and thus keeping the system poised for differentiation.</p><p>Conjecture 2: The position of a cell in a distribution of stem or progenitor cells is a measure of its developmental potential. This is clear in the case of Sca-1 in progenitor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000149-Chang1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000149-Hoffmann1">&#x0005b;87&#x0005d;</xref> and Nanog in ES cells, and suggests that, at least for these types of cells, the trajectories within phase space that determine their distributions are used to limit the number of cells available for differentiation at any given time, ensuring that in the long term, all cells have the same probability of differentiating, thus providing developmental flexibility.</p><p>A practical conclusion from these studies is that distributions of key markers as shown here and in Chang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000149-Chang1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref> can and should be used as quantitative phenotypes that can provide insights into the activity of GRNs and the state of cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>ES and EC Cell Culture</title><p>E14IVc and TNGA ES cells were a kind gift from Austin Smith's lab and have been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000149-Chambers3">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

Parental E14IVc ES or P19 EC cells were used as the negative control because they display a level of autofluorescence; this was used to calibrate the laser intensities so that they were within the range of 10<sup>0</sup> to 10<sup>1</sup>. Cells with fluorescence levels (GFP, YFP, or RFP) within this range were considered to be negative (e.g., low Nanog/LN), and the converse is true for levels beyond this (e.g., high Nanog/HN).</p><p>The sorted cells were reanalysed to check purity of sorting (which was above 98&#x00025;).</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Induction of Differentiation</title><p>TNGA ES cell population was sorted as LN and HN subpopulations and subjected to differentiation conditions with a reduced amount of serum (5&#x00025;), no added LIF, added FGF2 (20 ng/ml), and retinoic-acid (RA) (10 &#x000b5;M)) for 3 d.

Single cells were then left to grow for 7 d, during which time the clones reached a reasonable size, but necrosis was not visible in the centre of the colony. Clones were expanded further in a gelatinised six-well plate for 5 d before FACS analysis. Capacity to reform undifferentiated colonies was estimated by counting the number of colonies that were recovered from each single cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Embryoid Body Differentiation</title><p>TNGA cells were harvested by PBS-based cell dissociation buffer and stained for E-cadherin (Eccd2) antibody and 7AAD before sorting.

RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent. Duplicate reverse transcription reactions using SuperScriptIII, either random hexamer or anchored oligo dT primers, were set up; the products from these reactions were then mixed. Analysis of transcript expression levels was undertaken by semiquantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). PCR reactions were set up and divided into 10 equal aliquots; after the first 21 PCR cycles, an aliquot was removed every two cycles. Shown are PCR products from a reaction four cycles after the product was first visible.

The treatment selects for cells expressing high levels of Nanog-GFP and results in the elimination of cells that do not express Nanog-GFP. After three passages, puromycin selection was removed, and Nanog-GFP expression was monitored in the population over eight consecutive passages by flow cytometry. Notice that following the puromycin treatment, the majority of the cells in the culture are in the HN peak (99.96&#x00025;) and that the relative ratio of LN cells progressively increases until the third/fourth passage, when the distribution stabilizes with a LN population between 15&#x00025;&#x02013;25&#x00025; of the total.

Periodically, FACS profiles of the samples were taken. Two days after culture, the LN population exhibited a clear bimodal distribution. Over time, it is possible to see how the population evolves towards the original distribution in which the LN peak is diffused by the tail of the HN peak, perhaps reflecting the existence of an occupied transition state between the HN and the LN peaks. By day 8 and certainly by day 10, one can see the population has equilibrated. We do observe some variability in the definition of the LN peak in the P19 cells, highlighting that the dynamic range is an important variable in the definition of the states.</p><p>(0.34 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.1000149.s004.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.1000149.s005"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p><bold>Details of the continuous (deterministic) and stochastic (discrete) models.</bold></p><p>(0.07 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.1000149.s005.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.1000149.s006"><label>Video S1</label><caption><p><bold>Stochastic transitions from the LN to the HN states.</bold> All previously sorted LN TNGA cells are initially negative for GFP, but over the course of filming, individual cells with increased level of GFP expression have been observed.
