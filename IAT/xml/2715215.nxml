In the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the transmembrane PGN Recognition Protein LC (PGRP-LC) is a receptor of the Imd signaling pathway that is activated after infection with bacteria, mainly Gram-negative (Gram&#x02212;). Here we demonstrate that bacterial infections of the malaria mosquito <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> are sensed by the orthologous PGRPLC protein which then activates a signaling pathway that involves the Rel/NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factor REL2. PGRPLC signaling leads to transcriptional induction of antimicrobial peptides at early stages of hemolymph infections with the Gram-positive (Gram&#x0002b;) bacterium S<italic>taphylococcus aureus</italic>, but a different signaling pathway might be used in infections with the Gram&#x02212; bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The size of mosquito symbiotic bacteria populations and their dramatic proliferation after a bloodmeal, as well as intestinal bacterial infections, are also controlled by PGRPLC signaling. We show that this defense response modulates mosquito infection intensities with malaria parasites, both the rodent model parasite, <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>, and field isolates of the human parasite, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. We propose that the tripartite interaction between mosquito microbial communities, PGRPLC-mediated antibacterial defense and infections with <italic>Plasmodium</italic> can be exploited in future interventions aiming to control malaria transmission. Molecular analysis and structural modeling provided mechanistic insights for the function of PGRPLC. Alternative splicing of <italic>PGRPLC</italic> transcripts produces three main isoforms, of which PGRPLC3 appears to have a key role in the resistance to bacteria and modulation of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infections. Structural modeling indicates that PGRPLC3 is capable of binding monomeric PGN muropeptides but unable to initiate dimerization with other isoforms. A dual role of this isoform is hypothesized: it sequesters monomeric PGN dampening weak signals and locks other PGRPLC isoforms in binary immunostimulatory complexes further enhancing strong signals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Recognition of peptidoglycan on the bacteria cell wall triggers insect immune responses. The fruit fly PGRPLC receptor protein senses the presence of peptidoglycan and activates a pathway that mediates resistance to bacterial infections, mainly Gram-negative. We show that the PGRPLC receptor of the malaria vector mosquito <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> can also sense infections of the hemolymph (the mosquito blood) or the gut with bacteria of both Gram types and thereby activate a pathway that confers resistance to these infections. PGRPLC and its downstream responses also control the numbers of symbiotic bacteria that are mostly found in the mosquito gut where they drastically proliferate after a female mosquito takes a bloodmeal. Importantly, when the bloodmeal is infected with malaria parasites, the defense reaction that the mosquito mounts against proliferating bacteria also eliminate a large number of parasites. These mechanisms are largely elucidated using a rodent malaria parasite, but we also show that they significantly affect the intensities of mosquito infections with <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasites found in the blood of children in sub-Saharan Africa.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Immune signaling is triggered by recognition of molecular patterns that are common in microbes but absent from the host.

Here, we investigate the role of PGRPLC in mosquito infections with bacteria and malaria parasites. Theoretical structural modeling indicates that PGRPLC can recognize PGN from both Gram&#x0002b; <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and Gram&#x02212; <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> bacteria, and experimental results demonstrate that indeed PGRPLC mediates resistance against such infections. PGRPLC3 is a key modulator of these reactions. The structural modeling data suggest that, upon monomeric PGN binding, PGRPLC3 may lock other PGRPLC isoforms in binary immunostimulatory complexes, through a mechanism that differs significantly from that employed by <italic>Drosophila</italic> PGRP-LCa. PGRPLC3 can also sequester monomeric PGN perhaps to prevent unnecessary immune activation during low infections. Importantly, PGRPLC signaling modulates the intensity of mosquito infections with human and rodent malaria parasites. We also demonstrate that PGRPLC initiates responses against microbiota and bacterial infections of the midgut. In female mosquitoes, the size of the midgut bacterial communities substantially increase after a bloodmeal, causing further activation of PGRPLC signaling that appears to consequently affect the parasite infection intensities.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>PGRPLC</italic> is required for resistance to bacterial infections</title><p>We injected dsRNA into newly emerged adult female <italic>A. gambiae</italic> to silence by RNAi the expression of corresponding <italic>PGRP</italic> genes.

However, when the resulting <italic>Ag</italic>PGRPLC3/x-PGN models were positioned in heterodimers with LC1/a or LC2/a, D61 and S62 of the PD-loop clashed severely with residues at the inter-helical interface in the beginning of &#x003b1;2 helix/a, mainly at positions 42 and 44. These clashes could not be relieved by manual adjustment or energy minimization as they involved main-chain and C<sub>&#x003b2;</sub> atoms, suggesting that AgPGRPLC3/x heterodimers are highly unlikely.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Recognition of conserved microbial structures is essential for activation of insect innate immunity. Sensing bacterial cell wall PGN by <italic>Drosophila</italic> PGRPs triggers one of two signaling pathways. Circulating PGRP-SA and PGRP-SD sense primarily Lys-type PGN that is mostly found in Gram&#x0002b; bacteria, activating the Toll pathway that culminates with nuclear translocation of Dif or Dorsal. DAP-type PGN found mainly in Gram&#x02212; bacteria and bacilli is principally sensed by the transmembrane PGRP-LC. This binding induces PGRP-LC dimerization and downstream initiation of Imd signaling that triggers activation and nuclear translocation of the Rel/NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factor Relish.</p><p>The <italic>A. gambiae</italic> ortholog of Relish, REL2, is required for resistance to infections with bacteria, both the Gram&#x02212; <italic>E. coli</italic> and the Gram&#x0002b; <italic>S. aureus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000542-Meister1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Acting in concert with the IMD adaptor protein, REL2 confers resistance to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections, but resistance to <italic>E. coli</italic> infections appears to be IMD-independent. Here we show that PGRPLC is essential in both these reactions, possibly acting as a common recognition receptor of these two branches of the REL2 antibacterial pathway. The first pathway resembles the conventional Imd pathway of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, consisting of PGRPLC, IMD and REL2-F, a form of REL2 that has an inhibitory ankyrin domain and a death domain. The second pathway appears to involve PGRPLC and REL2-S, a form of REL2 that lacks the ankyrin and death domains. The latter resembles a pathway proposed by Kaneko and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000542-Kaneko1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, where IMD is dispensable for Imd pathway activation in response to DAP-type PGN. It has been speculated that an unknown factor interacts with an intracellular domain of PGRPLC other than the IMD interacting domain. Henceforth we will distinguish between these two REL2 pathways as IMD-dependent and IMD-independent, respectively.</p><p>Research in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has mainly used infection-dependent transcriptional induction of AMPs as diagnostic readout for defining pathways. Here, using survival of infected insects as the readout, we demonstrate the importance of <italic>Drosophila</italic> PGRP-LC in the defense against <italic>S. aureus</italic>, especially in the first days after infection; thereafter PGRP-SA becomes indispensable. These data indicate that the two pathways may act simultaneously and/or consecutively to maximize effectiveness: PGRP-LC and its downstream Imd signaling could effectively control low <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections, but persisting infections require PGRP-SA and Toll pathway responses. Vice versa, <italic>Drosophila</italic> PGRP-SA appears to also play a role in the defense against <italic>E. coli</italic> infections, but PGRP-LC is the principal receptor. This direct comparison of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic> indicates a putative divergence in PGRP-mediated antibacterial defenses between these two insects, as the mosquito PGRPLC seems to be the main receptor for both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>. This is consistent with our working hypothesis that adaptation of the evolutionary conserved signaling pathways is enabled by differences in recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000542-Waterhouse1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The <italic>Anopheles</italic> PGRPLC-mediated response to <italic>E. coli</italic> may not be the only defense against this bacterium. In contrast to the response to <italic>S. aureus</italic>, early transcriptional induction of AMPs in response to <italic>E. coli</italic> infections is not regulated by PGRPLC. An as yet unidentified PGRPLC-independent pathway may mediate this early response, but we cannot exclude that AMPs other than those tested here are induced via the IMD-independent REL2 pathway. The possibility that the PGRPLC requirement in <italic>E. coli</italic> infections relates to phagocytosis is unlikely, as blockade of phagocytosis appears not to have an effect equivalent to that of PGRPLC on mosquito survival following infections with this bacterium; however, further research is needed before this possibility can be entirely ruled out.</p><p>The mosquito gut is habitat to large and diverse microbial communities. Several species of bacteria have been identified in the gut of field-collected anophelines, mostly Gram&#x02212; proteobacteria and enterobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000542-Favia1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000542-Lindh1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000542-Straif1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data reveal that PGRPLC signaling controls the size of symbiotic bacteria populations and intestinal bacterial infections in laboratory reared <italic>A. gambiae</italic>. It also controls the proliferation of gut bacteria after a mosquito bloodmeal, which can be as drastic as several thousand folds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000542-Pumpuni1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> and coincides with robust PGRPLC-mediated AMP induction.</p><p>The importance of this reaction extends beyond mechanistic understanding of the mosquito immune system. <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes are vectors of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites that cause malaria, a disease that infects 300&#x02013;500 million people annually killing over one million of them. Within 24 h after a mosquito bloodmeal, a period that coincides with the proliferation of gut bacteria, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> gametocytes ingested with the blood undergo sexual development and reproduction, and the resulting zygotes become motile ookinetes that cross the midgut epithelium. The PGRPLC response against proliferating bacteria appears to be responsible, at least in part, for the drastic drop in parasite infection intensities during that period.</p><p>Importantly, we demonstrate that PGRPLC controls the intensity of <italic>A. gambiae</italic> infections by <italic>P. falciparum</italic> gametocytes found in the blood of children in sub-Saharan Africa. This is the first time that a gene of the classical mosquito immune system is shown to have an effect on <italic>P. falciparum</italic> field isolates. A similar effect is detected in infections with the common laboratory model parasite, <italic>P. berghei</italic>. These findings lead us to postulate that the tripartite interaction between symbiotic bacteria, the mosquito immune system and invading <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites may play an important role in the mosquito susceptibility vs. resistance to infection with malaria parasites. Since the various mosquito habitats or laboratory rearing conditions can have a direct impact on the mosquito gut microbiota, we speculate that the mosquito responses to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> may vary between different settings.</p><p>The combination of genetic, molecular and structural modeling data revealed a history of convergent evolution between the fruit fly and mosquito PGRPLC. Like its <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog, <italic>Anopheles PGRPLC</italic> gene produces three main isoforms via alternative splicing. However, these isoforms have evolved independently in the two lineages, via exon re-duplications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000542-Christophides1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000542-Waterhouse1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. All isoforms share a common first part of the PGRP ectodomain; the remainder is distinct and encoded by two isoform-specific exons, separated by an intron at identical relative positions. This modular architecture allows generation via alternative splicing of a PGRPLC2/3 hybrid domain isoform, which is expressed at low levels and thus may have a modulatory function or be expressed in specific cell types or conditions.</p><p>An intriguing finding is that isoforms exist as short and long versions that differ by an alternative 25-aa cassette, laying immediately after the transmembrane domain and before the PGRP domain, an observation also made independently by Lin and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000542-Lin1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. A similar 17-aa cassette exists in <italic>Drosophila</italic> PGRP-LC. Both cassettes encode flexible structures and could be envisaged as providing long &#x0201c;necks&#x0201d; to membrane-bound PGRPLCs and hence flexibility to interact with ligands inaccessible to the rigid short-necked isoforms, e.g. PGN polymers shed by Gram&#x0002b; bacteria. An alternative hypothesis derives from a study showing <italic>Drosophila</italic> PGRP-LC down regulation in response to live bacteria and suggesting its proteolytic cleavage by bacterial proteases as a sensing mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000542-Schmidt1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. We propose that this cassette may be targeted for cleavage by host or pathogen proteases, resulting in immune response activation, down-regulation or evasion.</p><p>Our data suggest that PGRPLC3 is the most important of the three main isoforms in the response against bacterial infections. PGRPLC3 is essential for resistance to <italic>E. coli</italic>, whereas PGRPLC1 and LC2 play less important roles. PGRPLC3 is also central in defense to <italic>S. aureus</italic>, as is PGRPLC1 albeit less important.

The specificity of PGRPs to these two bacteria is thought to be determined largely by the third aminoacid in the peptide bridge connecting their PGN glycan strands: DAP in <italic>E. coli</italic> and Lys in <italic>S. aureus</italic>. <italic>Drosophila</italic> PGRP-LCx is shown to bind DAP-type PGN, while PGRP-LCa is deficient for PGN binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000542-Chang2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000542-Mellroth1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Our structural models reveal a potential of all <italic>Anopheles</italic> PGRPLC isoforms to bind both DAP- and Lys-type PGNs. These data suggest a remarkable structural flexibility of PGRPLCs in PGN recognition and provide mechanistic support to genetic data reported herein and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> studies, where PGRP-LC mediates resistance to Lys-type PGN Gram&#x0002b; bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000542-Werner1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. However, they do not explain the observations that <italic>Anopheles</italic> PGRPLC3 is the most important isoform in antibacterial defense.</p><p>Our PGRPLC dimerization models have provided important insights into this putatively unique role of PGRPLC3. Molecular contact analysis suggests that binary complexes, such as those formed between <italic>Drosophila</italic> PGRP-LCx and LCa upon TCT binding on the former <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000542-Chang3">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, can exist between <italic>Ag</italic>PGRPLC1 or LC2 at the /x position and any of the three <italic>Ag</italic>PGRPLCs at the /a position. However, <italic>Ag</italic>PGRPLC3 cannot initiate dimerization with other isoforms, as a two-residue insertion obstructs its binding surface. Moreover, unspliced <italic>PGRPLC3</italic> transcripts are never detected, as opposed to all other splice variants, and PGRPLC3 is the dominant isoform in EST and cDNA sequences. These data could indicate a unique dual role of <italic>Ag</italic>PGRPLC3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000542.s015">Figure S10</xref>): (a) it locks PGRPLC complexes induced by monomeric PGN binding on the other two isoforms in binary or oligomeric modes, preventing the formation of multimers and adopting a role similar to <italic>Dm</italic>PGRP-LCa; (b) it down regulates the response by removing from the environment monomeric PGN, since it cannot initiate formation of immunostimulatory dimers. The former role would maximize the response during high PGN concentrations, whereas the latter role would serve in dampening the immune signal in low PGN concentrations. This may justify the absence of PGRPLC-mediated induction of AMPs in early stages of <italic>E. coli</italic> infection and could also suggest a mechanism of immune tolerance to symbiotic bacteria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Research involving humans was approved by the WHO and Cameroon National Ethics Committees.
