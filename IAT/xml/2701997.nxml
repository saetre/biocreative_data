Two functional groups of mammalian aquaporins are now recognised: aquaporins (AQP1, AQP2, AQP4, AQP5 and AQP8) which are primarily water selective and aquaglyceroporins (AQP3, AQP7, AQP9 and AQP10) which are permeable to small uncharged solutes such as lactate, glycerol and urea in addition to water <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006167-Verkman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The characterization of the organization of aquaporin genes and identification of their position within the human and mouse genomes have established a primary role for some aquaporins in clinical disorders such as congenital cataracts and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
