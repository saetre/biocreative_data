Here, we demonstrate that the expression pattern of the transcription factor <italic>Rest</italic> mirrors those of pluripotent genes during neural development from embryonic stem (ES) cells and an early abrogation of Rest in ES cells using a combination of gene targeting and RNAi approaches causes defects in this process. Specifically, Rest ablation does not alter ES cell pluripotency, but impedes the production of Nestin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> neural stem cells, neural progenitor cells and neurons, and results in defective adhesion, decrease in cell proliferation, increase in cell death and neuronal phenotypic defects typified by a reduction in migration and neurite elaboration. We also show that these Rest-null phenotypes are due to the dysregulation of its direct or indirect target genes, <italic>Lama1</italic>, <italic>Lamb1</italic>, <italic>Lamc1 and Lama2</italic> and that these aberrant phenotypes can be rescued by laminins.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>During mouse embryo development, the blastocyst differentiates into pluripotent primitive ectoderm and gives rise to a structure known as the epiblast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003656-Coucouvanis1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

During neurulation, the ectoderm gives rise to the neuroectoderm in the form of a neural plate, which subsequently folds to generate the neural tube, composed of a single layer of neuroepithelial cells or neural stem cells (NSCs), where a series of ring-like constrictions mark the boundaries between the primordia of the major brain regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003656-Lawson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003656-Rubenstein1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. This process of neural development is orchestrated and accompanied by wholesale changes in transcriptional programmes and patterns of gene expression. However, due to the difficulties in accessing and manipulating early embryos, the transcriptional network that regulates neural development is poorly understood, especially in mammals. Embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from blastocysts retain the ability to recapitulate neural development <italic>in vitro</italic>, and offer an invaluable model to study early events in embryogenesis. The RE1 Silencing Transcription Factor / Neuron Restrictive Silencer Factor (Rest/Nrsf) is a zinc finger transcription repressor that has been postulated to act as a master regulator of neuronal gene expression in both the developing and mature nervous systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003656-Schoenherr1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003656-Chen1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. We and others have shown that Rest is highly expressed in blastocysts and ES cells, but that expression decreases as neural development proceeds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003656-Sun1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003656-Ballas1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Taken together, these observations suggest that Rest may play a crucial role at several stages of neural development. Here, we determine the function of Rest during neural development from ES cells through NSCs and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to mature neurons using an <italic>in vitro</italic> ES cell-derived neural differentiation model.</p><p>Rest exerts its function by binding to both canonical and non-canonical RE1-sites identified at over 2000 loci in the mammalian genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003656-Johnson1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003656-Otto1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and is implicated in the regulation of both coding and non-coding genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003656-Johnson1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003656-Johnson2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, many of which represent neuron-specific transcriptional units. The observation that many of these target genes are expressed by differentiated neurons, including ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, neurotrophins, synaptic vesicle associated proteins, cell adhesion molecules, growth-associated and cytoskeletal proteins, gave rise to the initial perception that Rest acted as a silencer of neuron-specific genes in NPCs and non-neural cells to prevent precocious expression of neuronal characteristics. However, recent studies emerge that Rest has more versatile roles and can regulate its target genes either by activation, repression or silencing, depending upon the developmental stage and cell type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003656-Sun1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003656-Ooi1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Constitutive expression of Rest in chick spinal cord does not cause defects in neurogenesis but does result in axon pathfinding errors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003656-Paquette1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in Xenopus, disruption of Rest function disturbs ectoderm patterning and expands the neural plate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003656-Olgun1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that Rest is indeed required for normal neural plate formation and neurogenesis. Collectively, these studies paint a somewhat ambiguous picture of the role of Rest in the development of NSCs and neurons. We have sought to address this issue by using a combination of gene targeting and RNAi to create ES lines expressing a range of Rest concentrations, which we have used to investigate the effect of Rest deficiency during ES cell-derived neural development. Importantly, in contrast to a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003656-Singh1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, we find that deletion of a single <italic>Rest</italic> allele does not result in any change in neural differentiation. Instead, we find that Rest levels have to be decreased by more than 92&#x00025; to precipitate any phenotype. Rest ablation impairs the extracellular matrix (ECM) components and impedes the production of Nestin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NSCs, NPCs and neurons. Furthermore, neurons derived from REST-null ES cells are devoid of elaborate processes, have defects in migration and undergo increased cell death. Importantly, all of these phenotypic effects of Rest ablation were rescued by treatment with laminins, a key component of the ECM that has been implicated in neuronal migration and more latterly in development of the neural plate. We propose a novel mechanism by which Rest regulates development of both NSCs and mature neurons by controlling expression of key components of the ECM.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>Rest</italic> expression during NSC and Neuron Development</title><p>We investigated the role of Rest in neural development using an <italic>in-vitro</italic> ES cell-derived neural differentiation model, which recapitulates events during neural development in vivo.

In this paper, we refer to early NSCs as NSCs and late more restricted NSCs as NPCs.

In conclusion, reduction of Rest levels by 50&#x00025; has no effect on neurogenesis in terms of the time course, sequence or production of neurons.

Thus, we further examined the causes of defective adhesion seen in the REST-null mutant. We and others have previously reported that several Rest target genes encode cell adhesion molecules or components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), particularly laminin subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003656-Sun1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003656-Otto1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Accordingly, we considered the notion that dysregulation of the ECM by Rest ablation might be responsible for this aspect of the phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether we could rescue the adhesion defect and any other phenotypic effects caused by Rest ablation by pre-treatment with ECM components. We plated ES cells from all groups on to either plastic or glass pre-treated with EHS laminins (which contain predominantly Laminin 1 (&#x003b1;1&#x003b2;1&#x003b3;1)) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003656-Ekblom1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> and subsequently subjected them to neural differentiation. On the glass surface pre-treated with laminins, but not those pre-treated with gelatin, the Rest mutant ES cells behaved like control ES cells, both of which adhered firmly and proliferated well. After 4-days of differentiation (NSC stage), cells from all groups plated onto glass surfaces pre-treated with laminins showed greater survival and significantly less apoptosis than those on untreated surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003656-g004">Fig. 4K&#x02013;4O</xref>). There was no significant difference in cell growth among the treated groups (the control and mutants). The surviving cells were highly proliferative as adjudged by BrdU incorporation (data not shown). Laminin pre-treatment had an even more profound effect after 14-days of differentiation (neuronal stage). No, or very few, apoptotic cells were detected in either the laminin-treated or control cells without laminin-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003656-g004">Figs. 4F and 4P&#x02013;4T</xref>), whereas significant cell death was found in the Rest mutants in the absence of laminin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003656-g004">Fig. 4H&#x02013;4J</xref>). These data suggested that laminins prevented cell death in the REST-null cells. Intriguingly, the laminin rescue also extended to the specification of NSCs. We reported above that the REST-null ES cells were able to generate early Sox1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/Nestin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> NSCs but were unable to produce normal numbers of late Sox1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/Nestin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NSCs when they were differentiated on a gelatinised glass surface in the absence of laminins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003656-g003">Fig. 3C&#x02013;3D</xref>). This deficiency was rescued by laminin-treatment.

This may be secondary to the diminished NSC population since there are no detectable differences in proliferation or cell death during derivation of NSCs from either the control or REST-null ES cells.

The REST/KD-50 ES cells were then used to create REST-null ES cells by stably expressing a Rest shRNA (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GTGTAATCTACAATACCAT-3&#x02032;</named-content>) in the presence of puromycin (2 &#x000b5;g/ml) using a pSuper-Rest-shRNA vector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003656-Loh1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The <italic>Rest</italic> levels expressed from REST-100, REST/KD-50 and REST-null ES cells were 100&#x00025;, 50&#x00025; and 1&#x00025;, respectively as adjudged by quantitative Real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003656.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>), and confirmed by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003656.s001">Fig. S1D</xref>). In our Western blot analysis, the level of Rest in REST-100 (lane 1) is approximately double that seen in REST/KD-50 (lane 2) when normalised to levels of the house-keeping gene, Gapdh (lower panel) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003656.s001">Fig. S1D</xref>).
