The N-terminal domain is a 60 A long arm-like coiled coil structure built of 2 long antiparallel a-h helices, whereas the C-terminal domain is a alpha-beta structure. A deletion of the N-terminal arm of the enzyme does not affect the amino acid activation step of the reaction, but reduces dramatically amino-acylation activity. The Kcat/Km value for the mutant enzyme is reduced by more than 4 orders of magnitude, with a nearly 30 fold increased Km value for tRNA(ser). An only slightly truncated mutant form (16 amino acids of the tip of the arm replaced by a glycine) has an intermediate aminoacylation activity. Both mutant synthetases have lost their specificity for tRNA(ser) and charge also non-cognate type 1 tRNA(s). Our results support the hypothesis that class II synthetases have evolved from an ancestral catalytic core enzyme by adding non-catalytic N-terminal or C-terminal tRNA binding (specificity) domains which act as determinants for cognate and anti-determinants for non-cognate tRNAs.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00039-0113-a" xlink:role="2967"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00039-0114-a" xlink:role="2968"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00039-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2963"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00039-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2964"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00039-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2965"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00039-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2966"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00039-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2967"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00039-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2968"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00039-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2969"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
