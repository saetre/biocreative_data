The DNA polymerase &#x003b6; (Pol&#x003b6;) mutagenesis pathway is a major error-prone translesion synthesis mechanism requiring Pol&#x003b6; and Rev1. In addition to its dCMP transferase, a non-catalytic function of Rev1 is suspected in cellular response to certain types of DNA lesions. However, it is not well understood about the non-catalytic function of Rev1 in translesion synthesis. We have analyzed the role of Rev1 in translesion synthesis of an acetylaminofluorene (AAF)-dG DNA adduct. Purified yeast Rev1 was essentially unresponsive to a template AAF-dG DNA adduct, in contrast to its efficient C insertion opposite a template 1,<italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-ethenoadenine adduct. Purified yeast Pol&#x003b6; was very inefficient in the bypass of the AAF-dG adduct. Combining Rev1 and Pol&#x003b6;, however, led to a synergistic effect on translesion synthesis. Rev1 protein enhanced Pol&#x003b6;-catalyzed nucleotide insertion opposite the AAF-dG adduct and strongly stimulated Pol&#x003b6;-catalyzed extension from opposite the lesion. Rev1 also stimulated the deficient synthesis by Pol&#x003b6; at the very end of undamaged DNA templates. Deleting the C-terminal 205 aa of Rev1 did not affect its dCMP transferase activity, but abolished its stimulatory activity on Pol&#x003b6;-catalyzed extension from opposite the AAF-dG adduct. These results suggest that translesion synthesis of AAF-dG adducts by Pol&#x003b6; is stimulated by Rev1 protein in yeast.

Translesion synthesis leads to replication of the damaged regions of the genome. It requires a specialized DNA polymerase (Pol) to directly copy the damaged site on the DNA template. Since DNA damage can change the coding property of the bases, alter DNA structure or render the site non-coding, an incorrect nucleotide is often inserted opposite the lesion during translesion synthesis. This is referred to as error-prone translesion synthesis. It is also possible that the correct nucleotide is inserted opposite the lesion, resulting in error-free translesion synthesis.</p><p>The major translesion synthesis polymerases are Pol&#x003b6; and the Y family DNA polymerases in eukaryotes. In addition, Pol&#x000b5; has also been shown to possess robust translesion synthesis activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c2">2</xref>). Whether Pol&#x000b5; contributes significantly to translesion synthesis as a damage tolerance mechanism <italic>in vivo</italic>, however, remains to be determined. In humans, the Y family of DNA polymerases consists of Pol&#x003b7;, Pol&#x003b9;, Pol&#x003ba; and REV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c3">3</xref>). In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Pol&#x003b9; and Pol&#x003ba; are not found. Genetic studies in yeast have indicated that Pol&#x003b6; (the Rev3&#x02013;Rev7 complex) operates in a biochemical pathway that involves additional proteins including Rev1 (reviewed in refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c5">5</xref>), which is also referred to as the Pol&#x003b6; mutagenesis pathway. Unlike other members in the Y family of DNA polymerases, Rev1 is a dCMP transferase, rather than a typical DNA polymerase. Rev1 is able to insert a C opposite a template G and several types of DNA lesions, including apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site, 8-oxoguanine, (&#x0002b;)-<italic>trans</italic>-<italic>anti</italic>-benzo&#x0005b;<italic>a</italic>&#x0005d;pyrene-<italic>N</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>-dG, (&#x02013;)-<italic>trans</italic>-<italic>anti</italic>-benzo&#x0005b;<italic>a</italic>&#x0005d;pyrene-<italic>N</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>-dG and 1,<italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-ethenoadenine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c9">9</xref>). At least in the case of cellular response to AP sites in DNA, the Rev1 dCMP transferase directly participates in nucleotide insertion opposite the lesion during translesion synthesis <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c10">10</xref>).</p><p>Error-prone translesion synthesis is largely responsible for DNA damage-induced mutagenesis. In yeast, the vast majority of mutations induced by UV radiation, acetylaminofluorene (AAF), AP sites and benzo&#x0005b;<italic>a</italic>&#x0005d;pyrene diol epoxide are generated by the Pol&#x003b6; mutagenesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c14">14</xref>). The Pol&#x003b6; mutagenesis pathway also exists in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c17">17</xref>) and is shown to be the major mechanism for UV- and benzo&#x0005b;<italic>a</italic>&#x0005d;pyrene diol epoxide-induced mutagenesis in cultured human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c18">18</xref>). Thus, it appears that the Pol&#x003b6; pathway constitutes a major mechanism of error-prone translesion synthesis and DNA damage-induced mutagenesis in eukaryotes. Although Rev1 is required for the Pol&#x003b6; mutagenesis pathway, very little is known about the role of Rev1 in the mutagenesis process. The dCMP transferase of Rev1 is unable to respond to a template TT dimer and a template TT (6&#x02013;4) photoproduct <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c10">10</xref>), two major DNA lesions of UV radiation. Yet Rev1 is required for UV-induced mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c20">20</xref>). Thus, it has been proposed that Rev1 may play another non-catalytic function in the Pol&#x003b6; mutagenesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c20">20</xref>). However, it is not well understood about the non-catalytic function of the Rev1 protein in translesion synthesis.</p><p>To better understand Rev1 functions, we have analyzed the role of this protein in translesion synthesis of an AAF-dG DNA adduct. Whereas the dCMP transferase of purified yeast Rev1 was essentially unresponsive to a template AAF-dG DNA adduct, this protein strongly stimulated the Pol&#x003b6;-catalyzed translesion synthesis of AAF-dG DNA adducts. These results suggest a non-catalytic function of Rev1 in the bypass of AAF-dG adducts.

To avoid potential contamination by yeast proteins, we purified yeast Rev1 from <italic>E.coli</italic> cells following its expression from a plasmid construct. The Rev1 preparation contained two bands of &#x0223c;120 and 90 kDa, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f1">1</xref>A). Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against the N-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tag confirmed that both bands are yeast Rev1 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f1">1</xref>B). While the larger band is consistent with the calculated molecular mass of yeast Rev1 (112 kDa), thus representing the full-length protein, the smaller band is probably a C-terminal truncated product of Rev1. The eukaryotic Y family DNA polymerases, including Rev1, are relatively unstable and protein truncation is a common feature among them. To determine whether the truncated Rev1 protein retains activity, we deleted 205 aa from its C-terminus, yielding Rev1&#x00394;C (94 kDa). Rev1&#x00394;C was similarly expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> and purified (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f1">1</xref>C), yielding a protein of approximately the size of the &#x0223c;90 kDa band in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f1">1</xref>A. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f1">1</xref>D, both Rev1 and Rev1&#x00394;C preparations were similarly active in dCMP transferase in response to a template AP site. Thus, the C-terminal truncated protein of &#x0223c;90 kDa retains the Rev1 dCMP transferase activity.</p><p>To examine the response of yeast Rev1 to an AAF-dG adduct, we annealed a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled 17mer primer to the damaged template with the primer 3&#x02032; end terminating right before the lesion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f2">2</xref>A), and performed standard dCMP transferase assays. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f2">2</xref>A, purified yeast Rev1 was unable to effectively catalyze nucleotide insertion opposite the AAF-dG adduct. In contrast, it efficiently inserted a C opposite a template 1,<italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-ethenoadenine adduct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f2">2</xref>B). These results show that the yeast Rev1 dCMP transferase is essentially unresponsive to a template AAF-dG adduct.</p></sec><sec><title>Synergistic effect of Pol&#x003b6; and Rev1 combination during bypass of a template AAF-dG adduct <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Since purified yeast Pol&#x003b6; alone is inefficient in performing translesion synthesis across from a template AAF-dG adduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c22">22</xref>), we suspected that accessory factor(s) might be required to stimulate lesion bypass by Pol&#x003b6; <italic>in vivo</italic>. To test whether Rev1 could play such a role, we performed DNA synthesis reactions with the AAF-damaged template by combining purified yeast Pol&#x003b6; and Rev1 together. In the reaction, a 13mer <sup>32</sup>P-labeled primer was annealed to the damaged template, terminating 4 nt before the lesion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f3">3</xref>). Consistent with our previous finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c22">22</xref>), the AAF-dG adduct strongly blocked DNA synthesis by yeast Pol&#x003b6; right before the lesion, as evidenced by the strong 17mer DNA band (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f3">3</xref>, lane 3). Only very small amounts of the damaged templates were bypassed (longer than 18mer DNA bands), and the 30mer full-length product or near full-length products were not detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f3">3</xref>, lane 3). When purified yeast Rev1 protein was added to the reaction, much higher levels of the damaged templates were bypassed and the 30mer full-length product was readily detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f3">3</xref>, lane 4). These results show that combination of yeast Pol&#x003b6; and Rev1 has a synergistic effect on the bypass of AAF-dG DNA adducts.</p><p>We consistently observed that the last template base was inefficiently copied by Pol&#x003b6; even from undamaged templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c22">22</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f3">3</xref>, lane 1). Surprisingly, addition of yeast Rev1 protein greatly stimulated DNA synthesis at the end of the undamaged template (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f3">3</xref>, lane 2). The 30mer full-length product migrated at the same position in the absence or presence of Rev1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f3">3</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2). Therefore, the last nucleotide copied at the very end of the template is consistent with Pol&#x003b6;-catalyzed G addition, rather than C addition catalyzed by the Rev1 dCMP transferase. C addition would have resulted in a 30mer product that migrated significantly faster than the 30mer DNA band in lane 1 of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f3">3</xref>.

Yeast Pol&#x003b6; alone inserted 14 fmol C and 12 fmol G opposite the AAF-dG adduct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f4">4</xref>, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). In the presence of purified Rev1 protein, C insertion opposite the lesion was increased to 23 fmol (1.6-fold increase), while G insertion was increased to 18 fmol (1.5-fold increase) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f4">4</xref>, compare lanes 3 with 8, and 4 with 9). These results show that while Rev1 stimulates Pol&#x003b6;-catalyzed nucleotide insertion opposite the template AAF-dG adduct, it does not alter the specificity of nucleotide insertion by Pol&#x003b6; opposite the lesion.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of Rev1 on Pol&#x003b6;-catalyzed extension DNA synthesis from opposite the AAF-dG adduct</title><p>To determine whether Rev1 affects extension DNA synthesis from opposite the AAF-dG adduct, we annealed a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled 18mer primer to the damaged template, terminating with an A opposite the lesion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f5">5</xref>). DNA synthesis assays were then performed with purified yeast Pol&#x003b6; in the absence or presence of purified yeast Rev1 protein. Rev1 alone was unable to perform extension synthesis from opposite the AAF-dG adduct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f5">5</xref>A, lane 1). Pol&#x003b6; alone extended the primer only by 1 nt from opposite the AAF-dG adduct, and further extension synthesis was strongly blocked by the lesion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f5">5</xref>A, lane 2). In the presence of Rev1 protein, longer extension synthesis by Pol&#x003b6; was greatly stimulated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f5">5</xref>A, lanes 3&#x02013;7). Furthermore, the 30mer full-length extension product was readily detected and its production increased with increasing concentrations of Rev1 in the reaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f5">5</xref>A, lanes 3&#x02013;7). Prior heat inactivation of the Rev1 protein abolished its activation activity (data not shown). Thus, stimulation of Pol&#x003b6;-catalyzed extension synthesis depends on a properly folded Rev1 protein. In contrast, the inefficient extension synthesis by Pol&#x003b7; from opposite the AAF-dG adduct was not affected by Rev1 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f5">5</xref>B). Moreover, human REV1 protein had no effect on extension synthesis by the yeast Pol&#x003b6; from opposite the AAF-dG adduct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f5">5</xref>C).</p><p>High level of stimulation on Pol&#x003b6;-catalyzed extension synthesis required relatively high concentrations of the purified Rev1 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f5">5</xref>A). This raised the possibility that the &#x0223c;90 kDa truncated Rev1 in the protein preparation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f1">1</xref>A) may not be able to stimulate Pol&#x003b6; in extension synthesis. To test this possibility, we performed the extension DNA synthesis assay again using the purified 94 kDa Rev1&#x00394;C. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f6">6</xref> (lanes 4&#x02013;7), even at very high concentrations of the Rev1&#x00394;C protein, stimulation on Pol&#x003b6;-catalyzed extension from opposite the AAF-dG adduct was not observed. Thus, whereas deleting the C-terminal 205 aa of Rev1 does not affect its dCMP transferase, this C-terminal truncation abolishes the stimulating activity of Rev1 on Pol&#x003b6;-catalyzed extension from opposite the AAF-dG adduct.</p><p>To determine whether or not the Rev1 stimulatory effect on Pol&#x003b6;-catalyzed extension synthesis is specific to the A-terminated primer, we performed additional assays using four different DNA substrates containing an 18mer primer terminating with a C, A, T or G, respectively, opposite the AAF-dG adduct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f7">7</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f7">7</xref>A&#x02013;D (compare lane 1 with lane 6), Rev1 stimulated extension synthesis by Pol&#x003b6; from opposite the lesion in every case. With or without Rev1, Pol&#x003b6; predominantly incorporated the correct G opposite the undamaged template C immediately 5&#x02032; to the lesion (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f6">6</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh279f7">7</xref>A, lanes 4 and 9). Thus, the specificity of nucleotide incorporation during extension synthesis by Pol&#x003b6; from opposite the AAF-dG adduct was not affected by Rev1 protein. These results show that Rev1 protein strongly and specifically stimulates Pol&#x003b6;-catalyzed extension DNA synthesis from opposite the AAF-dG adduct, and that Rev1 does not alter the Pol&#x003b6; specificity of nucleotide incorporation during extension synthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Both Pol&#x003b6; and Rev1 are required for AAF adduct-induced mutagenesis in yeast cells</title><p>Since Rev1 is able to strongly stimulate Pol&#x003b6;-catalyzed extension synthesis from mismatched primer end opposite the AAF-dG adduct, it is likely that both Pol&#x003b6; and Rev1 are critical to AAF-induced mutagenesis in cells. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of inactivating Pol&#x003b6; and Rev1 on AAF adduct-induced mutagenesis in yeast cells, using a plasmid-based <italic>in vivo</italic> mutagenesis assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c14">14</xref>). In this assay, the pCLU plasmid was first damaged by 10 &#x000b5;M AAAF <italic>in vitro</italic> and purified by centrifugation in a linear 5&#x02013;20&#x00025; sucrose gradient. Then, the damaged plasmid was transformed into yeast cells. The plasmid contains the yeast <italic>LEU2</italic> gene as the selection marker and the yeast <italic>URA3</italic> gene as the mutagenesis target. Transformed cells were plated on leucine-lacking minimal medium plates with or without 5-FOA. Plates without 5-FOA allowed cells that had replicated the damaged pCLU plasmid to grow to colonies, thus measuring replication of the damaged plasmid (plasmid &#x02018;survival&#x02019;). Plates with 5-FOA allowed only those cells that contained inactivating mutations at the plasmid <italic>URA3</italic> gene to grow to colonies, thus measuring mutagenesis of the plasmid <italic>URA3</italic> gene. The chromosomal <italic>URA3</italic> gene had been deleted from all yeast strains used. Once inside cells, AAF adducts on the plasmid DNA are subject to removal by nucleotide excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c27">27</xref>). In order to effectively detect induced mutagenesis at a relatively low AAAF concentration, we inactivated the nucleotide excision repair pathway by deleting the <italic>RAD14</italic> gene from yeast strains used in this study.</p><p>Untreated pCLU plasmid DNA was used in the assay as the control for spontaneous mutagenesis. In cells proficient in mutagenesis (<italic>rad14</italic>), a spontaneous mutation frequency of 3.2 &#x000d7; 14<sup>&#x02013;4</sup> was obtained (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh279tb1">1</xref>). A similar spontaneous mutation frequency was observed with cells lacking Rev1 (<italic>rad14 rev1</italic>) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh279tb1">1</xref>). In cells lacking Pol&#x003b6; (<italic>rad14 rev3</italic>), the spontaneous mutation frequency was slightly increased (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh279tb1">1</xref>). After treatment of the plasmid DNA with 10 &#x000b5;M AAAF, the induced mutation frequency of the plasmid <italic>URA3</italic> gene was increased by 10-fold, as compared with the spontaneous mutation frequency (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh279tb1">1</xref>). Without Rev1 or Pol&#x003b6;, AAF adduct-induced mutation was largely abolished to levels of only 2.1- and 1.6-fold above the spontaneous mutation frequency, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh279tb1">1</xref>). These results show that both Pol&#x003b6; and Rev1 are required for AAF adduct-induced mutagenesis in yeast cells. Since the induced mutation frequencies in cells lacking Rev1 or Pol&#x003b6; were reduced to similar levels of 8.2 &#x000d7; 14<sup>&#x02013;4</sup> and 8.9 &#x000d7; 14<sup>&#x02013;4</sup>, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh279tb1">1</xref>), we conclude that both Rev1 and Pol&#x003b6; are equally important for error-prone translesion synthesis across from AAF-dG DNA adducts <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In yeast cells, Pol&#x003b6; is clearly required for error-prone translesion synthesis across from AAF-dG DNA adducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c13">13</xref>). However, the purified yeast Pol&#x003b6; is rather inefficient in performing translesion synthesis across from a template AAF-dG adduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c22">22</xref>). Thus, effective bypass of AAF-dG adducts in cells may require accessory factor(s). Supporting this notion, much more efficient bypass of the AAF-dG adduct was achieved by combining purified yeast Pol&#x003b6; and Rev1. Rev1 alone is unable to catalyze either nucleotide insertion opposite the AAF-dG adduct or extension synthesis from opposite this lesion. Furthermore, the Rev1 C-terminal truncation of 205 aa abolished its stimulatory activity but retained its dCMP transferase activity. Therefore, Rev1 most likely plays a non-catalytic function by stimulating the Pol&#x003b6;-catalyzed translesion synthesis across from the lesion. Indeed, both the Pol&#x003b6;-catalyzed nucleotide insertion step and the extension synthesis step were stimulated by Rev1. Further supporting its non-catalytic role, Rev1 did not alter the Pol&#x003b6; specificity of nucleotide incorporation at both the nucleotide insertion and extension synthesis steps. If the dCMP transferase activity of Rev1 were involved in synergistic bypass by the Rev1&#x02013;Pol&#x003b6; combination, C incorporation during nucleotide insertion opposite the AAF-dG adduct and extension from opposite the lesion would have been significantly elevated. This was not the case. However, whether the dCMP transferase active site is required for the stimulatory function of Rev1 on Pol&#x003b6; remains to be determined.</p><p>If the stimulatory function of Rev1 is important <italic>in vivo</italic>, mutagenesis induced by AAF-dG DNA adducts in yeast cells would depend on both the Rev1 and Pol&#x003b6; proteins. This was shown to be the case. Without Pol&#x003b6; or Rev1, AAF-induced mutagenesis was reduced by &#x0223c;4-fold in yeast cells. Hence, Rev1 is equally important as Pol&#x003b6; for error-prone translesion synthesis across from AAF-dG DNA adducts <italic>in vivo</italic>. Missing either Rev1 or Pol&#x003b6; will inactivate the major mechanism of error-prone translesion synthesis, thus, underscoring the importance of the functional interaction between these two polymerases in response to AAF-DNA adducts. Using a plasmid containing a site-specific AAF-dG adduct, Baynton <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c13">13</xref>) also observed that Rev1 is required for non-slipped translesion synthesis at the two sequence contexts, 5&#x02032;-GGG<sup>AAF</sup>-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-GGCG<sup>AAF</sup>CC-3&#x02032;, in yeast cells.</p><p>Recently, it has been observed that multiple DNA polymerases are involved in translesion synthesis of TT (6&#x02013;4) photoproducts, AAF-dG adducts and benzo&#x0005b;<italic>a</italic>&#x0005d;pyrene diol epoxide in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c29">29</xref>). However, it is not clear how such a multiple-polymerase mode of translesion synthesis takes place in cells. Are these polymerases recruited to the lesion site simultaneously, cooperatively or independently? Does the <italic>in vivo</italic> lesion bypass reflect a two-polymerase two-step mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c31">31</xref>)? Are there functional interactions among Pol&#x003b6; and the Y family DNA polymerases? Our studies suggest that there exists a functional interaction between two DNA polymerases for translesion synthesis. Thus, functional interactions between two polymerases may represent an important feature for translesion synthesis during cellular response to certain types of DNA lesions.</p><p>The precise mechanism of the functional interaction between Rev1 and Pol&#x003b6; is unknown at the present time. One possibility is that Rev1 may somehow facilitate the binding of Pol&#x003b6; to its DNA substrate and/or decrease the dissociation of Pol&#x003b6; from the DNA template. Consistent with such a mechanism, Rev1 also strongly stimulated the deficient synthesis by Pol&#x003b6; at the very end of undamaged DNA templates. Since human REV1 could not substitute for the yeast Rev1 for its stimulatory activity on the yeast Pol&#x003b6;, the Rev1 effect could not have simply resulted from the Rev1&#x02013;DNA interaction. It is not surprising that human Rev1 could not stimulate yeast Pol&#x003b6;, because even the four most conserved regions of the two proteins share only 21&#x02013;35&#x00025; sequence identity and 43&#x02013;59&#x00025; sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c7">7</xref>). More likely, the functional interaction between Rev1 and Pol&#x003b6; during synergistic bypass of the AAF-dG DNA adducts may be mediated by physical interactions between them. Physical interaction between human REV1 and human REV7, the non-catalytic subunit of Pol&#x003b6;, has indeed been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c32">32</xref>). Whether the yeast Rev1 similarly interacts with the yeast Rev7, however, remains to be determined.</p><p>Although Rev1 acts as a DNA polymerase on repeating template G sequences and has therefore been suggested as a specialized DNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c9">9</xref>), its dCMP transferase activity is remarkable. With respect to its catalytic function, Rev1 recognizes various damaged and undamaged template bases with very different affinity, but it preferentially inserts dCMP without an exception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c33">33</xref>). Hence, the rules of geometry constraints and hydrogen bonding that governs nucleotide selection during normal DNA synthesis simply do not apply to Rev1. The structural basis for the unique C insertion opposite the various undamaged and damaged template bases is a mystery. Clues about the structural basis of the Rev1 dCMP transferase activity would have to wait for the crystal structural studies of the protein. Like its human counterpart, yeast Rev1 also efficiently inserts a C opposite a template 1,<italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-ethenoadenine adduct. The essentially unresponsiveness of human REV1 to a template AAF-dG adduct was also observed with the yeast Rev1. Thus, although the protein sequences of yeast Rev1 and human REV1 are not overwhelmingly conserved, their biochemical properties appear to be highly conserved. So far, direct participation of the Rev1 dCMP transferase activity at the nucleotide insertion step has been demonstrated in only one case in cells: translesion synthesis of AP sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh279c10">10</xref>). It is of great interest to determine in the future whether such an involvement of the Rev1 dCMP transferase is only limited to cellular response to AP sites or constitutes a more general mechanism in the Pol&#x003b6; mutagenesis pathway. Regardless of the extent to which the catalytic dCMP transferase function is employed during <italic>in vivo</italic> translesion synthesis of various types of DNA lesions, a non-catalytic role appears to be an important and may well be the predominant function of Rev1 in the Pol&#x003b6; mutagenesis pathway. Our studies suggest one such non-catalytic function for Rev1 in the translesion synthesis of AAF-dG DNA adducts. Extended studies into other types of DNA lesions could bring in more insights into our understanding of this fascinating member of the Y family DNA polymerases in translesion synthesis.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh279f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Analyses of purified yeast Rev1.
