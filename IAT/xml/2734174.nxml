In budding yeast, the acetyltransferase Eco1/Ctf7 establishes cohesion during DNA replication in S phase and in response to DNA double strand breaks in G2/M phase. In humans two Eco1 orthologs exist: ESCO1 and ESCO2. Both proteins are required for proper sister chromatid cohesion, but their exact function is unclear at present. Since <italic>ESCO2</italic> has been identified as the gene defective in the rare autosomal recessive cohesinopathy Roberts syndrome (RBS), cells from RBS patients can be used to elucidate the role of ESCO2. We investigated for the first time RBS cells in comparison to isogenic controls that stably express V5- or GFP-tagged ESCO2. We show that the sister chromatid cohesion defect in the transfected cell lines is rescued and suggest that ESCO2 is regulated by proteasomal degradation in a cell cycle-dependent manner. In comparison to the corrected cells RBS cells were hypersensitive to the DNA-damaging agents mitomycin C, camptothecin and etoposide, while no particular sensitivity to UV, ionizing radiation, hydroxyurea or aphidicolin was found. The cohesion defect of RBS cells and their hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents were not corrected by a patient-derived ESCO2 acetyltransferase mutant (W539G), indicating that the acetyltransferase activity of ESCO2 is essential for its function. In contrast to a previous study on cells from patients with Cornelia de Lange syndrome, another cohesinopathy, RBS cells failed to exhibit excessive chromosome aberrations after irradiation in G2 phase of the cell cycle. Our results point at an S phase-specific role for ESCO2 in the maintenance of genome stability.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Roberts syndrome (RBS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by growth retardation and congenital abnormalities.

Survival is generally poor, as most cases of RBS end in spontaneous abortion, still-birth, or neonatal death.

As a negative control, a patient-derived mutation in the acetyltransferase domain of GFP-ESCO2 was generated (GFP-ESCO2 (W539G)). Upon neomycin selection, several clones were obtained, which expressed the V5-ESCO2 or GFP-ESCO2 proteins at levels much higher than endogenous ESCO2 in wild type fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006936-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). As expected from their molecular weights GFP-ESCO2 ran more slowly in the SDS-PAGE gel than V5-ESCO2; Western blotting with a GFP-specific antibody was used to demonstrate that the GFP signal was exclusively derived from the GFP-ESCO2 fusion protein, since no uncoupled GFP molecules were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006936-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0006936-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006936.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Functional complementation of Roberts syndrome fibroblasts by epitope tagged ESCO2.</title><p>Stable VU1199-F SV40 cell lines expressing V5- or GFP-tagged ESCO2 were obtained by transfection and neomycin selection.

Since overexpression and/or the V5 or GFP tags may interfere with the activity of ectopically expressed proteins, we tested functional complementation by cytogenetic analysis. Metaphase spreads revealed a strong reduction in the number of railroad chromosomes in cell lines stably transfected with wild type ESCO2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006936-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), demonstrating that the V5- and GFP-tagged ESCO2 proteins are indeed functional, in spite of their relatively high expression levels. The occurrence of railroad chromosomes was not corrected by GFP alone nor by the mutant ESCO2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006936-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Given the relatively normal subcellular distribution of the mutant ESCO2 protein compared to the ectopically expressed wild type protein, our data indicate that the pathogenic character of missense mutation W539G is not due to mislocalization or instability of ESCO2, but most likely through its effect on the acetyltransferase activity of the protein.</p><p>These stable cell lines can now serve as isogenic controls for the characterization of the cellular phenotype of RBS fibroblasts and can be used to study the function of ESCO2 and its acetyltransferase domain in more detail.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>ESCO2 is regulated during the cell cycle by proteasomal degradation</title><p>A striking intercellular variation in ESCO2 protein expression was observed during long-term culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006936-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), which suggested a cell cycle-dependent regulation of ESCO2. To test this possibility, we synchronized V5-ESCO2-expressing RBS cells with the replication inhibitor aphidicolin and followed ESCO2 expression after release from this cell cycle block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006936-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). At three hours post-treatment, when many cells were in S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006936-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), ESCO2 levels were high, while nine hours after release most cells were in G2/M phase and ESCO2 expression was barely detectable. Also in M phase cells obtained by mitotic shake-off V5-ESCO2 expression was very low. Flow cytometery of RBS cells expressing either wild type or mutant GFP-ESCO2, again showed a high ESCO2 expression in S phase cells, although the mutant appeared to be less stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006936-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Furthermore, time-lapse movies demonstrated a cell cycle regulated expression of GFP-ESCO2, with a very strong accumulation in the nucleoli in both untreated cells (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006936.s001">Video S1</xref>) and cells treated with the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006936.s002">Video S2</xref>). Although so far we have not observed any other ectopically expressed protein to accumulate in the nucleolus, including GFP, we can not rule out that overexpression of tagged ESCO2 underlies its nucleolar localization, since our ESCO2 antibody is unable to detect endogenous ESCO2 protein by immunofluoresence. These data show that, despite of the CMV promoter-driven expression of ESCO2, protein levels vary during the cell cycle, possibly by posttranslational modification.</p><fig id="pone-0006936-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006936.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Ectopic ESCO2 expression during the cell cycle.</title><p>VU1199-F SV40 cells stably expressing V5-ESCO2 were synchronized by a double aphidicolin block and mitotic shake-off and samples were analyzed for (A) ESCO2 expression on Western blot and (B) DNA content by flow cytometry.

One possible way to vary ESCO2 protein levels during the cell cycle is by regulated protein degradation through the proteasome. To explore this possibility, GFP-ESCO2 transfected RBS cells were treated with the proteasomal inhibitors MG-132 and bortezomib.

These data indicate that ectopic ESCO2 levels are regulated by proteasomal degradation, which is independent of its acetyltransferase activity.</p><fig id="pone-0006936-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006936.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>ESCO2 levels are regulated by proteasomal degradation.</title><p>(A) Fluoresence microscopy showing stabilization of ESCO2 protein by proteasome inhibitors in VU1199-F SV40 cells stably expressing wild type or mutant ESCO2.

The production of ESCO2 preceded that of cyclin B1, which starts to rise during G2 phase and this is in agreement with a role for ESCO2 in S phase. ESCO2 is down-regulated in mitotic cells characterized by heavily phosphorylated APC3/cdc27, and this precedes a decrease in securin levels. Securin is a known target of the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), which is involved in the degradation of proteins during mitosis and these data suggest that ESCO2 and securin are regulated in different manners. Indeed, we did not observe stabilization of ESCO2 levels in mitotic extracts of cells treated with siRNA targeting APC/C subunits (data not shown). However, proteasome inhibitor MG-132 stabilized ESCO2 levels in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006936-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), indicating that also endogenous ESCO2 levels are regulated by proteasomal degradation.

Also for this agent, colony survival assays revealed a hypersensitive phenotype in RBS fibroblasts, which was completely rescued by ectopic expression of V5-ESCO2 when compared to VU1199-F SV40 cells or fibroblasts expressing the ESCO2 acetyltransferase mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006936-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, in this particular instance the GFP-ESCO2 protein appeared as inactive as the acetyltransferase mutant, suggesting that the GFP-tag may interfere with the ability of ESCO2 to assist in the handling of etoposide-induced DNA damage. Although these data suggest a role for ESCO2 in the response to replication fork stalling, we did not find an increased sensitivity to the more general replication inhibitors aphidicolin or hydroxyurea, which inhibit replicative polymerase alpha or deplete the dNTP pool by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006936-g004">Figure 4D and 4E</xref>). This indicates that ESCO2 is specifically involved in a response to DNA-damaging agents that physically block DNA replication forks.</p><p>To test whether cells from Roberts syndrome patients have a more general DNA repair defect we created double strand breaks by exposing the cell lines to several doses of X-rays.

Similar results were found after UV treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006936-g004">Figure 4F and 4G</xref>). The lack of ionizing irradiation sensitivity may be explained by the fact that the exposure time is short and that only cells in a specific phase of the cell cycle are X-ray sensitive. Recently, it has been shown that, despite a lack of X-ray sensitivity in clonogenic survival, cells from Cornelia de Lange syndrome patients, another cohesinopathy, show a 2&#x02013;4-fold increase in X-ray induced chromosomal aberrations than control cells when irradiated in the G2 phase of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006936-Vrouwe1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

The homology between the ESCO1 and ESCO2 protein is remarkably restricted to the zinc finger and acetyltransferase domain. The similarity between ESCO1 and ESCO2 reaches 77&#x00025; (59&#x00025; homology) within this C-terminal domain, while no significant homology can be detected outside of this region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006936-Hou1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Although both proteins have acetyltransferase activity, the diversity of their N-terminal domains suggests that they may perform distinct functions in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. This idea is supported by the differences in protein expression patterns seen throughout the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006936-Hou1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. ESCO1 is present during the entire cell cycle, while ESCO2 expression is high during S phase and disappears in G2/M phase. This may imply that ESCO1 is involved in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion in S, G2 and M phase, whereas ESCO2 may have a specific function in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion during S phase. In our stable cell lines, ectopic ESCO2 protein levels also varied during the cell cycle, with high expression during S phase. Since in these cells ESCO2 mRNA expression is not under the control of its normal promoter, but driven by the CMV promoter, it is very likely that ESCO2 protein levels are regulated by posttranslational modification. The protective effect of proteasome inhibitors on ESCO2 levels strongly suggests that proteasomal degradation is indeed involved in this process.</p><p>We have used our stable cell lines to confirm that ESCO2 deficiency leads to cohesion defects and in addition demonstrated that this sensitizes cells for MMC, camptothecin and etoposide. These DNA-damaging agents interfere with DNA replication by covalently linking bases on opposite DNA strands (MMC) or by creating complex single strand (camptothecin) or double strand (etoposide) breaks. This indicates that ESCO2 functions in the repair process at the stalled replication fork. The lack of sensitivity to the replication inhibitors hydroxyurea and aphidicolin suggests that it is not the inhibition of DNA replication, but the replication-blocking DNA damage <italic>per se</italic> which causes a problem that RBS cells are less well able to handle.</p><p>ESCO2 seems to have a minor role in the repair of UV-C and X-ray induced DNA damage; however, this result could be misleading due to the fact that only cells in a specific phase of the cell cycle may be sensitive to these agents and that relatively few sensitive cells are hit if exposure is only of short duration such as with UV- and X-irradiation. To further investigate this we looked at X-ray induced chromosomal aberrations in cells irradiated in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. In Cornelia de Lange syndrome cells, which have a defect in cohesin loader SCC2, G2 cells show an increase in irradiation-induced chromosomal aberrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006936-Vrouwe1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> as expected from the involvement of Scc2 in damage-induced cohesin loading in the G2 phase of yeast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006936-Strom1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006936-Unal1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, ESCO2-deficient cells do not show significantly more chromosomal damage in cells irradiated in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. This again underlines the S phase-restricted role for ESCO2 and suggests that ESCO1 may be the Eco1 ortholog that plays a role in damage-induced cohesion establishment during G2 phase. The lack of X-ray sensitivity in our fibroblasts is in conflict with previous data in lymphoblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006936-VanDenBerg2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The discrepancy could be due to differences between cell types, but phenotypic heterogeneity in the lymphoblastoid cell lines could also explain this dissimilarity, since isogenic controls were not used in the lymphoblast study.</p><p>During S and G2 phase homologous recombination is the preferred pathway for double strand break repair and the formation of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) or the appearance of Rad51 foci after DNA damage can both serve as indicators for intact homologous recombination repair. SCEs reflect sites of homologous recombination that are associated with crossing-over between sister chromatids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006936-Sonoda1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, while Rad51, a central player in homologous recombination, shows a punctuated nuclear localization at sites where homologous recombination takes place <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006936-Haaf1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006936-Raderschall1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. RBS cells were able to form SCEs at similar levels as corrected control cells. Also, Rad51 foci after DNA damage were formed to similar extents in RBS and control cells. These results suggest that the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion by ESCO2 is not essential for homologous recombination in general. Our data do not exclude a role for ESCO2 in regional or site-specific regulation of the homologous recombination process. We detected a strong accumulation of ESCO2 in the nucleolus upon replication fork stalling, which may indicate a role for ESCO2 at repetitive sequences like rDNA. This may not be reflected in an overall decrease in SCEs or Rad51 foci, but may become critical when replication is disturbed by DNA-damaging agents. Of note here is that RBS fibroblasts were less sensitive to MMC than fibroblasts from a PALB2 deficient Fanconi anemia patient, which has a more general defect in crosslink repair and shows a disturbance in the formation of Rad51 foci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006936-Xia1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Regional or site-specificity of ESCO2's role during S phase may also explain the apparent hyper-phosphorylation of Chk1 in untreated RBS cells.</p><p>Based upon our results and previously published studies a model can be put forward, in which ESCO2 is essential for the cohesion establishment at the replication fork through acetylation of substrates that remain to be identified. Acetylation of SMC3 by ESCO1 is also important in this process, but how this modification relates to ESCO2-mediated acetylation remains to be established. In the G2 phase cohesion loading by SCC2 and SMC3 acetylation through ESCO1 may be involved in a replication-independent process of cohesion establishment.
