Here we show that both murine and human progenitor cell populations express this receptor subtype on transcriptional and protein levels and respond to its agonists by reduced growth factor-induced cell cycle progression that leads to decreased myeloid, erythroid and lymphoid colony formation. H4R activation prevents the induction of cell cycle genes through a cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway that is not associated with apoptosis. It is mediated specifically through H4R signaling since gene silencing or treatment with selective antagonists restores normal cell cycle progression. The arrest of growth factor-induced G1/S transition protects murine and human progenitor cells from the toxicity of the cell cycle-dependent anticancer drug Ara-C <italic>in vitro</italic> and reduces aplasia in a murine model of chemotherapy. This first evidence for functional H4R expression in hematopoietic progenitors opens new therapeutic perspectives for alleviating hematotoxic side effects of antineoplastic drugs.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Histamine is one of the most versatile biogenic amines with pleiotropic activities, including regulatory functions during the immune response and hematopoiesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006504-Schneider1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006504-Jutel1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

The H4R is functional in hematopoietic progenitor cells since its stimulation inhibited both myeloid and lymphoid colony formation, suggesting a relatively broad distribution among different progenitor subsets identified by their distinct clonogenic potential.</p><p>The signal transduction pathway leading from H4R engagement to cell cycle arrest is initiated by G<sub>i/o</sub> protein coupling followed by a decrease of cAMP levels. Further downstream, it entails downregulation of PKA activity since a specific inhibitor of this enzyme mimicked the effect of CB.

Indeed, murine progenitor-enriched bone marrow cells recovered after injection of CB were less prompt to enter the cell cycle in response to growth factor cocktail than saline-injected controls. This cell cycle arrest was revealed only when progenitors were induced to proliferate in response to growth factors.

The reversibility of the cell cycle arrest, the lack of apoptosis and <italic>in vivo</italic> toxicity qualified H4R agonists as potential pharmacological tools to protect clonogenic cells from the hematotoxicity of anti-cancer drugs, which remains a major drawback of chemotherapy.

These studies have produced numerous and often conflicting results, probably because histamine exerts different effects depending on its binding sites and their distribution on target cells. Although it is generally acknowledged that H4Rs are mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells, some H4R<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> tumor cell lines and colorectal cancer biopsies have also been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006504-Cianchi1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006504-Medina1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006504-Medina2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006504-Boer1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. We failed to confirm this result in the colon carcinomas, HT29 and HCT116, and the mammary carcinoma MDA-MB-231. In accordance with the lack of expression, we found that the H4R agonist CB affected neither the proliferation of these malignant cells nor did it decrease their sensitivity to <italic>in vitro</italic> treatment with the antineoplastic drug 5-FU, which raises the question of the reliability of results obtained with long-established cell lines.</p><p>It is obvious that in a clinical setting H4R expression in cancer cells should be assessed in each patient before treatment and avoided when positive. Note that the studies investigating the effect of H4R activation on cancer cell cycle progression have given rise to conflicting results so far. For example, in MDA-MB-231 cells H4R activation has been shown to result in G0/G1 cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006504-Medina1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, while in another report histamine receptor-mediated cell cycle arrest occurred in G2/M, once again followed by apoptosis and enhanced radio-sensitivity, which would increase the therapeutic efficiency rather than protect malignant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006504-Medina2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. It has also been proposed that H4R expression is downregulated in colorectal tumour cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006504-Boer1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, as compared with healthy tissue, which underscores once again the requirement of individual tests.</p><p>In conclusion, our data provide evidence for a new site of intervention of histamine, through which it can specifically slow down cell cycle progression in hematopoietic progenitors. At this point, we can only speculate on the physiological relevance of this interaction in patho-physiological situations generating increased histamine levels in hematopoietic organs. Nonetheless, this new function of the H4R provides an original therapeutic strategy to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy by preventing clonogenic progenitors from entering the cell cycle, rendering them less susceptible to the toxicity of anti-cancer drugs. We have not established so far whether the H4R is functional in hematopoietic stem cells with long-term repopulation activity, which in any case would be irrelevant in this particular context, because this quiescent population is not affected by cell cycle-dependent drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006504-Bertolini1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. The purpose of our approach is to limit the period of aplasia by accelerating short-term reconstitution from more lineage-restricted clonogenic progenitors without impairing the sensitivity of cancer cells to the treatment. These clinical perspectives, which might eventually facilitate chemotherapy dose and schedule intensification, call for the development of new, selective H4R agonists.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Animal experiments were performed according to the French Institutional Committee.</p><p>CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were purified from cord blood recovered with the parents' written consent, in accordance with the recommendations and approval of the Belgian Ethical Committee (Comit&#x000e9; &#x000e9;thique hospitalo-facultaire universitaire Li&#x000e8;ge 707).

Mice received three i.p. injections of CB at a dose of 20 mg/kg, at 24 and 4 h before, as well as 24 h after chemotherapy. AraC and cyclophosphamide were given i.p. at a dose of 350 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg, respectively. Mice were sacrificed on day 2 post-chemotherapy, when white blood cells were counted and colony-forming cells were evaluated in methylcellulose in response to IL-3.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Western blotting, cell cycle microarray and H4R silencing</title><p>Whole-cell extracts for Western blot analysis were prepared from freshly sorted c-kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells after a 5-h incubation in StemSpan medium with growth factors alone or together with CB. 30 &#x000b5;g extracts were prepared from washed cells in 100 &#x000b5;l extraction buffer. They were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose sheets (Hybond C, Amersham Biosciences). Protein transfer was ascertained by Ponceau red coloration. Membranes were then washed with PBS and blocked with PBS-Tween 0.1&#x00025;-gelatin 0.5&#x00025; for 1 h at room temperature. Blotting with monoclonal anti-cyclin E antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The same membranes were then stripped and reprobed with monoclonal antibodies against p21<sup>Waf1/Cip</sup>, p-Erk1/2, Erk 1/2, actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or p27<sup>Kip1</sup> (Pharmingen). Oligo GEArray&#x000ae; assays were performed with freshly isolated sorted c-kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> BM cells or after a 3-h incubation in the presence of growth factor cocktail with or without CB. RNA was extracted and amplified with the TrueLabeling-AMP<sup>TM</sup> Linear RNA Amplification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The array OMM-20 contains 128 oligonucleotide probes representing genes associated with the cell cycle. H4R silencing was performed with freshly sorted c-kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells and expanded CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells. For transfection, 3 &#x000b5;l of HiPerFect reagent (Qiagen; Courtaboeuf, France) and 4 &#x000b5;l (40 pmol) of human and 8 &#x000b5;l (80 pmol) of murine H4R siRNA, scrambled FITC-labeled or unconjugated control siRNAs (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were incubated in 50 &#x000b5;l x-vivo medium (Cambrex; East Rutherford, NJ) for 20 min at room temperature. The mixture was then added to 50 &#x000b5;l of cell suspension at a final concentration of 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml and incubated for 20 h, when transfection efficiency was verified with scrambled FITC-conjugated siRNA. Cells were then centrifuged and resuspended at a concentration of 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml in StemSpan medium with growth factor cocktail for c-kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells. The extinction of H4R protein expression was ascertained by FACS analysis after 24 h. After 3 days of culture with or without CB, cells were counted and their viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. The cell cycle status was assessed after an overnight incubation.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical significance was established by Student's and Mann-Whitney's two-tailed t test.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006504.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Dose response curve of cell cycle arrest induced by CB.</p><p>(6.01 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0006504.s001.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006504.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>Apoptosis was evaluated by Annexin-V/PI staining after a 3-day incubation of progenitor-enriched Lin- BMC in the presence of growth factor cocktail, with or without CB (10&#x02013;5 M).
