Of the recombinants isolated, 30 contained cDNA that corresponded to a single mRNA species of 2.1 kb that was induced between 10 and 15 fold by oestradiol treatment. The sequence of the entire open reading frame and 3' non-coding region of the mRNA was determined and shown to encode the aspartyl protease cathepsin D. The induction of cathepsin D mRNA is specific for oestrogen and is maximal at 3 X 10(-10) M. Cathepsin D mRNA levels were increased by oestrogen in 3 oestrogen responsive breast cancer cell lines. Cathepsin D mRNA was expressed but not regulated in an oestrogen receptor negative breast tumour cell line, BT 20, and in 2 other malignant cell lines, Hela and A431.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0146-a" xlink:role="3775"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0147-a" xlink:role="3776"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0151-a" xlink:role="3780"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0152-a" xlink:role="3781"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0153-a" xlink:role="3782"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0144.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3773"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0145.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3774"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0146.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3775"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0147.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3776"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3777"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0149.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3778"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0150.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3779"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0151.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3780"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0152.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3781"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0153.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3782"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0154.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3783"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0155.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3784"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0156.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3785"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0157.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3786"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
