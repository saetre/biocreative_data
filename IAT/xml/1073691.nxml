The liver receives nutrient-rich blood from the gut via the portal vein and oxygenated blood from the hepatic artery. It processes blood to remove toxins, synthesizes the majority of serum proteins and lipids, stores glycogen, and performs extensive lipid, cholesterol, and vitamin chemistry and storage. The liver is thought to provide a unique environment for lymphocytes, favoring tolerogenic immune system responses, possibly to prevent reactivity to harmless food antigens &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b01">1</xref>&#x0005d;. However, in response to certain stimuli, acute inflammatory reactions can occur, and result in hepatocyte death (hepatitis) and subsequent regeneration, with progressive fibrosis when stimuli are sustained. Several progressive liver diseases that can lead to liver failure have an autoimmune component &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b02">2</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The liver is an important site of visceral infection. The low-pressure circulation and high surface area of contact between blood and parenchymal cells and the high phagocytic capacity of multiple cell types in liver provide pathogens with an easy route of access. The tolerizing environment may additionally contribute to immune avoidance. The World Health Organization estimates that approximately 5&#x00025; and 3&#x00025; of the world's population carry hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus, respectively &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b03">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Many of these cases result in chronic infections that can lead to fatal complications, including hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhosis, or hemorrhage. Malaria and leishmania also display important liver tropisms &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b05">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, immune surveillance of the liver for pathogens is an important, but poorly understood, process.</p><p>The profile of steady-state hepatic immune cells differs markedly from that in secondary lymphoid organs and in other non-lymphoid tissues, with abundant Kupffer cells and natural killer T cells (NKT cells) supplemented with &#x003b1;&#x003b2; T cells, &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, and few, if any, B cells. NKT cells, present at trace levels (&#x0003c;1&#x00025;) in many organs, are highly enriched in the liver, where they represent up to 30&#x00025; of lymphocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b06">6</xref>&#x0005d;. These lymphocytes co-express NK receptors (e.g., NK1.1) and T cell antigen receptors (TCRs). The largest subset of NKT cells includes thymus-derived CD1d-reactive cells, most of which express a semi-invariant TCR containing V&#x003b1;14&#x02013;J&#x003b1;18 and V&#x003b1;24&#x02013;J&#x003b1;15 rearrangements in mouse and human, respectively, and a restricted V&#x003b2; repertoire &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b07">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Nearly all of these lymphocytes react with the marine-sponge-derived glycolipid &#x003b1;-galactosyl ceramide (&#x003b1;GalCer) presented by CD1d. The CD1d-specific NKT cells are required for Concanavalin A (ConA)&#x02013;induced hepatitis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b10">10</xref>&#x0005d;, a model of autoimmune hepatitis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b11">11</xref>&#x0005d;, and are implicated in a variety of other hepatic immunological reactions, including tumor rejection, inhibition of hepatitis B replication, and anti-malarial responses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b07">7</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Lymphocyte trafficking to and within lymphoid organs and also to extra-lymphoid organs such as inflamed gut and skin is governed in large part by the interactions of selectively expressed adhesion receptors and chemokine receptors on the surface of diverse lymphocytes with ligands on the endothelium &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b12">12</xref>&#x0005d;. This is followed by extravasation of the adherent lymphocytes across the endothelium. This paradigm of lymphocyte homing has emerged mainly from studies of high-velocity vascular beds with continuous endothelium and post-capillary venules in lymphoid tissues and some inflamed non-lymphoid tissues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b13">13</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the dynamic behavior of lymphocytes in peripheral non-lymphoid tissue such as the liver is largely unknown.</p><p>The accumulation of lymphocytes in liver sinusoids (devoid of E/P-selectins, PECAM, CD34, and VE-cadherin, and low in VCAM-1) appears to result from mechanisms distinct from those involved in multistep extravasation of intravascular lymphocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b14">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Accumulation of CD1d-reactive T cells in the liver has been shown to require LFA-1 expression on liver cells other than NKT cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b15">15</xref>&#x0005d;, which implicates hematopoietic cells such as Kupffer cells in capture of NKT cells since endothelial cells do not express LFA-1. However, all activated lymphocytes upregulate ICAM-1, so other mechanisms are needed to account for the large relative enrichment of NKT cells in liver compared to NKT cells in other sites and compared to other types of lymphocytes in the liver.</p><p>CXCR6/Bonzo/STRL33 is a chemokine receptor that can serve in conjunction with CD4 as a co-receptor for infection with some human and most simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b16">16</xref>&#x0005d; and, similarly to CCR5 and CXCR3, has an expression pattern restricted to memory/effector T cells such as NKT cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b21">21</xref>&#x0005d;. CXCR6 has one known ligand, CXCL16, a transmembrane chemokine expressed in spleen, lung, and liver, and on macrophages, dendritic cells, and some spleen sinus-lining cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In this investigation, we studied liver CD1d-specific NKT cells using mice in which the <italic>cxcr6</italic> coding region was replaced with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA. We demonstrate that CXCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD1d-reactive T cells crawl within liver sinusoids at speeds of 10&#x02013;20 &#x003bc;m/min, and stop crawling upon TCR activation, revealing a novel form of intravascular immune surveillance. Interestingly, a complete deficiency in CXCR6 results in a selective and severe reduction of hepatic CD1d-reactive NKT cells, and is correlated with a decreased susceptibility to T-cell-dependent hepatitis. We observe that CXCR6 deficiency does not detectably alter the behavior of individual hepatic CD1d-specific NKT cells as they crawl along the CXCL16-expressing sinusoidal endothelial cells, but by regulating the number of hepatic NKT cells, at least in part by enhancing their survival, CXCR6 regulates liver-based immune responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>CXCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T Cells Are Enriched in the Liver</title><p>GFP expression in <italic>cxcr6<sup>gfp/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice is restricted to subsets of activated/memory T cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b20">20</xref>&#x0005d;, including NKT cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b23">23</xref>&#x0005d;.

We also observed that while 50&#x00025; of thymic and 80&#x00025; of splenic CD1d-tetramer-positive NKT cells expressed GFP, 99&#x00025; of such cells expressed GFP/CXCR6 in liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030113-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Conventional T cells expressing CXCR6 were also found to be more frequent in liver than in other organs, and a subset of CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> NK cells expressing CXCR6 represented 20&#x00025; of NK cells in the liver, but was not observed in other organs, including spleen, thymus, lung, and intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030113-g001">Figure 1</xref>B; data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>CXCL16, the CXCR6 Ligand, Is Expressed in Liver Sinusoids</title><p>We next examined the expression of the CXCR6 ligand, the transmembrane chemokine CXCL16, by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy of fixed tissue sections.

Anti-CXCL16 staining of liver from Tie2-GFP transgenic mice, which express GFP in endothelial cells, showed membrane localization of the CXCL16 signal in tight association with the cytoplasmic GFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030113-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, lower panels), confirming that the chemokine is expressed in sinusoidal endothelial cells. A similar pattern of expression has been observed in human liver (M. Briskin, unpublished data).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>CXCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT Cells Patrol Liver Sinusoids</title><p>We initially examined the anatomical localization of CXCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the liver by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy of fixed tissue sections. Surprisingly, most GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in the liver were localized in hepatic sinusoids, separated from hepatocytes by endothelial cells that stained with antibodies against caveolin-1 and CXCL16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030113-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030113-g001">1</xref>D). Relatively few GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were found in the portal tracts. To confirm that the GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were in fact CD1d-reactive NKT cells, livers were perfused with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/2 mM ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid to release cells in the vascular lumen. The effluent contained a number of GFP<sup>hi</sup> cells similar to those obtained from the entire liver (data not shown), among which 75&#x00025; were CD1d-&#x003b1;-GalCer-specific T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030113-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). It is also notable that within liver sinusoids there is a distinct population that expresses a very high level of GFP and binds CD1d-&#x003b1;-GalCer tetramer with moderate to low efficiency despite having normal expression of TCR&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030113-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). This sub-population is unresolvable in <italic>cxcr6<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mice, possibly as a consequence of bi-allelic GFP expression. We have not characterized this population further, but believe that it is a subset of NKT cells with reduced reactivity for CD1d-&#x003b1;-GalCer, possibly the non-V&#x003b1;14 NKT cells that have been described elsewhere &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b07">7</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>To further understand the behavior of these sinusoidal NKT cells, we used fluorescence confocal imaging to observe the livers of live mice in real time (intravital microscopy). These experiments revealed that more than 90&#x00025; of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in <italic>cxcr6<sup>gfp/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice were stably attached to the sinusoidal wall. Time-lapse imaging revealed that these cells were actively crawling within the sinusoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030113-g002">Figure 2</xref>A; Videos <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv002">S2</xref>) with a mean speed of 16.5 &#x000b1; 8.3 &#x003bc;m/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030113-g002">Figure 2</xref>B; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv003">Video S3</xref>), more than 100-fold slower than typical rolling in post-capillary venules. Various examples of crawling patterns of hepatic NKT cells are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv004">Video S4</xref>. Further analysis showed that crawling NKT cells choose their direction of motion largely randomly, and independently of the location of central veins or the direction of blood flow. This analysis required imaging at relatively high speeds (approximately 1 frame/s) after injecting fluorescent dextran intravenously, allowing us to clearly identify inlets and outlets corresponding to regions proximal to portal triads and central veins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv005">Video S5</xref>). Moreover, cells were observed to pass each other in opposite directions in the same sinusoid and to reverse direction within a single sinusoid (see Videos <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv004">S4</xref>). The mean ratio of cellular displacement over actual path length was 0.44 &#x0002b; 0.31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030113-g002">Figure 2</xref>C).</p><p>The wide range of values reflects the branching nature of liver sinusoids and the chaotic nature of NKT cell migration, with some cells persisting in one direction for tens of microns, resulting in high values, and others frequently changing direction, resulting in low values. We determined whether GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells moved towards or away from central veins by plotting the radial step (the cellular displacement along the axis from the cell's initial point to the central vein) for each cell at each consecutive time point. In <italic>cxcr6<sup>gfp/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice, steps towards and away from the central vein were equally frequent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030113-g002">Figure 2</xref>D, blue solid line), and the average radial step was nearly zero (0.02 &#x003bc;m away from the central vein). We also plotted a distribution attained when the angles for the same steps were randomized, and this curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030113-g002">Figure 2</xref>D, red dashed curve) displayed a nearly perfect overlay with the experimental data (blue solid curve). A similar analysis for portal triads showed the same result (not shown). Thus, as a population, NKT cells choose their direction of motion largely randomly, and independently of the location of central veins or the direction of blood flow. We additionally conclude that there is no evidence for a haptotactic gradient of CXCL16 or any other ligand directing cells either towards or away from the central veins.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>NKT Cells Stop Patrolling upon TCR Activation</title><p>By analogy to conventional T cells, which stop migrating in response to antigen in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b24">24</xref>&#x0005d;, we hypothesized that TCR activation would modify the patrolling behavior of hepatic NKT cells.

Injection of a control anti-CD1d antibody (clone 1B1) or of several T-cell-binding antibodies, including some matched to isotype of the anti-CD3 antibody, had no effect on patrolling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030113-g003">Figure 3</xref>A; data not shown). Intravenous delivery of the surrogate NKT cell antigen &#x003b1;-GalCer also triggered the arrest of most patrolling GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, and was blocked by pre-administration of anti-CD1d antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030113-g003">Figure 3</xref>A; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv007">Video S7</xref>). These results further confirm that most patrolling GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells are CD1d-reactive T cells and indicate that these patrolling liver NKT cells undergo rapid arrest upon activation via TCRs.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>CD1d Is Expressed on Hepatic Sinusoid-Lining Cells</title><p>We sought to determine which hepatic cell types might be responsible for presenting &#x003b1;-GalCer to the intravascular NKT cells. Fluorescence microscopy of fixed tissue sections showed bright staining for CD1d in a pattern that was difficult to interpret (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030113-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). The pattern suggests high expression on hepatocytes, including an intracellular peri-nuclear compartment, but whether other cell types also express CD1d was difficult to assess by this method. Using flow cytometry, we observed that sinusoid-lining endothelial cells (CD31<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells and Tie2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells) express high levels of CD1d on their surface, and Kupffer cells (F4/80<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) and dendritic cells (CD11c-high cells) express lower, but clearly detectable, levels of surface CD1d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030113-g003">Figure 3</xref>C).

Thus, the reduced presence of CD1d-specific NKT cells in CXCR6-deficient mice was correlated with a decreased severity of acute hepatitis. Interestingly, the decrease in severity of hepatitis (an approximately 8-fold decrease in AST and ALT levels) appeared greater than the decrease in NKT density or visitation rate (3-fold). This is possibly due to cumulative effects of hepatic damage that tend to exacerbate each other, such as local damage leading to local ischemia, causing further damage.</p><p>The reduction in the number of CD1d-reactive T cells in the CXCR6-deficient mice might also be expected to decrease the efficiency of patrolling. Based on the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030113-g002">Figure 2</xref> and in the intravital videos (e.g., Videos <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv002">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv003">S3</xref>), we found little difference in the rate of surveillance of sinusoids by individual CD1d-reactive T cells in <italic>cxcr6<sup>gfp/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> and <italic>cxcr6<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mice.

Therefore, the low number of CD1d-reactive T cells in the CXCR6-deficient mice clearly decreases the efficiency of patrolling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study illuminates several important aspects of the biology of CD1d-reactive NKT cells in vivo and provides a new paradigm for effector lymphocyte action in the liver. We have shown that CD1d-reactive NKT cells patrol liver sinusoids, the vascular space of the liver, rather than extravasate like effector cells in other tissues. The recruitment of NKT cells to the vascular endothelium in the liver thus results in intravascular patrolling rather than cellular extravasation. Patrolling appears to be a search for antigen, since it ceases following antigen receptor signaling. The chemokine receptor CXCR6 regulates the number of hepatic NKT cells, at least in part by transmitting survival signals.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>CD1d-Reactive NKT Cells Patrol Hepatic Sinusoids</title><p>By replacing the murine <italic>cxcr6</italic> gene with the coding region for GFP, we were able to visualize CXCR6-expressing cells throughout the body. GFP<sup>hi</sup> cells were mainly located intravascularly in mouse liver sinusoids, and by intravital fluorescence microscopy they were found to be crawling within the sinusoids at high speeds. This patrolling behavior appears to be independent of the direction of blood flow. Activation through the TCRs delivered a rapid stop signal to these cells, indicating that the patrolling is a form of immune surveillance.</p><p>The only prior indication for patrolling in the liver was the observation of cells crawling within the sinusoids when viewed by dark-field oblique transillumination microscopy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b27">27</xref>&#x0005d;. These cells were thought at the time to be Kupffer cells (liver macrophages). However, closer examination suggests that two populations were observed: a phagocytic non-motile population, probably Kupffer cells, and a non-phagocytic, rapidly migrating cell type that probably corresponds to the CD1d-reactive NKT cells examined here, though other effector populations such as NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes may also be capable of patrolling the liver from within the sinusoids.</p><p>The finding of TCR<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells that survey tissue for antigen while located intravascularly is unprecedented. Immune surveillance within lymph nodes and the spleen occurs in specialized compartments densely packed with lymphocytes, which are shielded from the high flow rates and shear forces of blood. In contrast, within the liver, hepatocytes, sinusoid-lining endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells (Ito cells), and Kuppfer cells are all in direct contact with blood. Hence, intravascular patrolling by T cells is likely to be the most efficient means for detection of hepatic antigens.</p><p>We estimate that, at steady state, the area around each hepatocyte is visited by approximately four CD1d-reactive T cells/h. In stark contrast, dendritic cells in lymph nodes were recently estimated to be scanned by 5,000 T cells/h &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b28">28</xref>&#x0005d;. However, NKT cells have a highly restricted TCR repertoire, whereas na&#x000ef;ve T cells are extraordinarily diverse. Thus, discovery of antigen may in fact be more rapid in the liver than in the lymph nodes, despite a 1,000-fold difference in the visitation rate of antigen-presenting cells.</p><p>NKT cells may be particularly well suited for surveillance of the liver because of the extensive lipid metabolism in this organ by hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells, and the sinusoid-lining endothelial cells. CD1d is expressed on hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, hepatic dendritic cells, and sinusoid-lining endothelial cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030113-g003">Figure 3</xref>C), all of which have been demonstrated to have significant antigen-uptake capabilities &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b01">1</xref>&#x0005d;. It is unclear whether intravascular NKT cells could contact CD1d on hepatocytes, which are separated from the sinusoid by the sinusoid-lining endothelial cells. Direct contact might be achieved through the approximately 100-nm fenestrations typical of these endothelial cells. Alternatively, CD1d-reactive T cells may survey only the endothelium or Kupffer cells for inflammatory signals and/or for CD1d-bound endogenous ligands.</p><p>We have previously shown that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> effector T cells stop migrating in response to antigen in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b24">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Here we have shown that NKT cells, essentially a population of effector T cells, display rapid and sustained stopping following TCR activation. In contrast, recent studies have shown that na&#x000ef;ve T cells in lymph nodes continue to move at high speed for several hours after initial encounter with antigen-presenting dendritic cells, forming only short-lived conjugates, while only at later times after initial antigen encounter (8&#x02013;20 h) did the T cells form long-term conjugates (&#x0003e;1 h) with dendritic cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b30">30</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The cytotoxic function of NKT cells has been implicated as necessary for ConA-induced hepatitis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b09">9</xref>&#x0005d;, although the observation that ConA triggers stopping of patrolling appears to argue against direct NKT-cell-mediated killing.

It is also possible that NKT cells resume patrolling after several hours of immotility, and in this way regain access to all the hepatocytes of the liver for direct killing. Further experiments will be required to resolve these questions.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>CXCR6 Controls the Accumulation of CD1d-Reactive NKT Cells in the Liver</title><p>Our study shows that CXCR6, which is expressed on CD1d-reactive NKT cells, controls the selective accumulation of these cells in the liver. Accordingly, CXCR6 also influences the ability of CD1d-reactive NKT cells to induce hepatitis caused by ConA. According to the multistep paradigm of lymphocyte extravasation, chemokines play a key role in activating adhesion molecules that transform rolling cells to firmly adhered ones. Because we observed that CXCL16, the chemokine ligand for CXCR6, is expressed on sinusoidal endothelial cells, we initially hypothesized that CXCR6 was critical for the recruitment of blood-borne NKT cells to the hepatic sinusoids, either by initial tethering interactions or by signaling to initiate crawling and patrolling. Utilizing high-frame-rate imaging, such recruitment events were occasionally observed (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv008">Video S8</xref>). Many hours of observation showed no significant difference in the frequency of these recruitment events between <italic>cxcr6<sup>gfp/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> and <italic>cxcr6<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mice (data not shown), but the limited number of events and mouse-to-mouse variability preclude definitive conclusions regarding the role of CXCR6 in this process. In addition, we did not observe any significant deficit in hepatic recruitment of CXCR6-deficient cells after short-term transfer of T cell blasts from <italic>cxcr6<sup>gfp/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> and <italic>cxcr6<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mice and after in vivo expansion of NKT cells with &#x003b1;-GalCer treatment (data not shown). These results suggest the existence of redundant mechanisms for NKT cell recruitment to liver sinusoids. We have therefore been unable to support the hypothesis that a defect in the NKT cell recruitment process contributes to the phenotype observed at steady state in CXCR6-deficient animals.</p><p>Our results indicate that the CXCR6-deficient hepatic NKT cells patrol in the same manner as their CXCR6-expressing counterparts: they both crawl rapidly, lack directional bias, and rapidly stop in response to TCR stimulation. Thus, there is no defect in the patrolling behavior of CXCR6-deficient NKT cells that can explain their reduced numbers in the liver.</p><p>The reduced accumulation of CXCR6-deficient CD1d-reactive NKT cells in the liver is likely to result at least partially from increased cell death due to the lack of a CXCR6-mediated survival signal. Because CXCL16 is the only known ligand for CXCR6 and is expressed on liver sinusoids, it is reasonable to hypothesize that CXCR6/CXCL16 interactions result in enhanced survival of CD1d-reactive liver NKT cells. This would be a novel role for chemokines in the homeostasis of effector T cells in peripheral tissues. As CXCR6 is expressed not only on NKT cells, but also on activated and memory T cells, it is possible that this is a general mechanism by which chemokines mediate the survival of effector/memory T cells that patrol at sites of potential toxic damage and antigen entry, thus facilitating rapid and efficient memory T cell responses.</p><p>The nature of the survival signal provided by CXCR6 remains to be studied. Although unexpected, this behavior is not unprecedented, as CXCR4 and CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 have been reported to mediate survival in certain conditions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b34">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Reports have suggested that Akt activation following ligand binding to the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 results in enhanced survival of cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b33">33</xref>&#x0005d;, and it has recently been shown that CXCR6 can similarly activate Akt &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b35">35</xref>&#x0005d;. It is also noteworthy that the defect in CXCR6 expression only affects hepatic NKT cells, and not NKT cells in other locations, suggesting that either the liver is an especially inhospitable environment, or that other survival signals are provided in other NKT-rich organs such as the spleen. The former seems a particularly attractive hypothesis since there is evidence for the liver being a pro-apoptotic environment for lymphocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b01">1</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The results of this paper lead us to a model in which the number of intravascular patrolling NKT cells, which is regulated by CXCR6&#x02013;CXCL16 interactions, influences the immune response in liver in two important ways: (1) it determines the frequency of new antigen detection by affecting the visitation rate of parenchymal liver cells, and (2) it governs the total cytokine &#x0201c;power&#x0201d; (pooled secretion capacity) of the hepatic NKT cell population. In the case of the ConA hepatitis model, the first factor is non-applicable because the &#x0201c;antigen&#x0201d; is in excess. However, in infectious pathogen models in which rare hepatocytes may be infected, there are likely to be agonist glycolipids that react with only a small subset of NKT cells and thus may escape detection for hours, or even days, if NKT cell density is too low. Potential examples include the recent finding that small subsets of NKT cells recognize the mycobacterial cell-wall antigen PIM<sub>4</sub> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b36">36</xref>&#x0005d; and lipophosphoglycan of leishmania &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b37">37</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In conclusion, we have described a model that may explain how the immune system monitors the status of the liver. Future experiments will be required to identify the molecules involved in both NKT cell crawling and stopping processes and the cells that are surveyed by NKT cells, and to determine the relevance of this system for the pathogenesis of hepatitis and for various immune responses in the liver.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>cxcr6<sup>gfp/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> knock-in mice were generated as described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030113-b20">20</xref>&#x0005d; and backcrossed three to eight times onto C57BL/6.

Mice were anesthetized using a cocktail of ketamine (50 mg/kg), xylazine (10 mg/kg), and acepromazine (1.7 mg/kg) injected intraperitoneally. Beginning 45 min later, anesthesia was maintained by half-dose boosts subcutaneously every 30 min. Hair from the left subcostal region was trimmed, and the liver was exposed through a 1.5-cm horizontal incision. The hepatoform ligament was cut and the tip of the left lobe of the liver gently extruded. The mouse was inverted onto a pre-prepared plastic or aluminum tray in which a coverslip was mounted near the center and narrow strips of paper (1.5 mm &#x000d7; 1.5 cm) were glued. These strips of paper provided friction that helped to immobilize the tissue being imaged. Images were acquired using an inverted epifluorescence Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser system equipped with a 10&#x000d7;/0.3 Plan Neofluar objective, or Fluar 40&#x000d7;/1.3 objective. A warming fan blowing into an enclosure around the whole microscope was used to keep the area warm, and the microscope objective was thermostatically controlled to maintain 37 &#x000b0;C. Videos were acquired by consecutive frames using appropriate combinations of 488-nm, 546-nm, and 633-nm laser lines and GFP, Cy3, and Cy5 filter sets. Imaging speed varied between videos with a range from 1 to 30 s per time point. During all of our intravital imaging experiments, we were keenly aware of the possibility of local photo-toxicity causing time-dependent artifacts in our data. However, we were unable to detect, either by eye or by quantitative analysis, any indication of such a phenomenon.</p></sec><sec id="s4a11"><title>In vivo activation and imaging of NKT cells</title><p>Animals were imaged as described above. Antibodies and antigens were injected in 50 &#x003bc;l of PBS solution containing 100 &#x003bc;g of 70-kDa dextran conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine (Molecular Probes) to confirm intravenous delivery and healthy blood flow in the region being imaged. We injected 5 &#x003bc;g of anti-CD3&#x0025b; (2C11 clone, PharMingen), 250 &#x003bc;g of Alexa-633-conjugated ConA (Molecular Probes), or 0.05&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;g of &#x003b1;-GalCer (DB01&#x02013;1 compound, kind gift of S. Porcelli). Initial experiments utilized 5 &#x003bc;g of &#x003b1;-GalCer, but as little as 50 ng was sufficient to trigger identical amounts of NKT stopping. Doses of either 200 or 50 ng of &#x003b1;-GalCer were used in the GK1.5/CD1d blocking experiments shown here. The percentages of immobile cells before and 40 min after injection of antigen were assessed by manual observation: 6 min of video was analyzed, and cells that moved less than one cell-body-length (10 &#x003bc;m) were considered immobile.</p></sec><sec id="s4a12"><title>Analysis of intravital imaging videos</title><p>Quantitative analysis was performed only on videos in which there was no detectable whole-liver movement. Cells were tracked using Volocity software version 2.0 (Improvision, Lexington, Massachusetts, United States). Because the software lost some cells due to cells moving out of focus or coming close to one another, the resulting data were an array of cell paths ranging from single frames to the full length of the video (typically 10&#x02013;15 min). No effort was made to reassemble these partial tracks, but there appeared to be no significant difference in the distribution of track lengths between <italic>cxcr6<sup>gfp/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> and <italic>cxcr6<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mice. In total, 640 tracks were analyzed from four videos of <italic>cxcr6<sup>gfp/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice, and 574 tracks were analyzed from four videos of <italic>cxcr6<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mice. Values such as cell velocity, overall displacement, and displacement-to-path-length ratio were calculated for each track by manipulation of Volocity output in spreadsheets. To safeguard against possible flaws or biases in the Volocity software, data were analyzed according to various subsets to look for unexpected trends (such as shorter average path lengths in particular videos) that might cause the data to be biased. Furthermore, all Volocity-based conclusions, such as velocity and directedness, we confirmed by manual observation of a limited number of cells.</p><p>To calculate the visitation rate, we calculated the density of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in <italic>cxcr6<sup>gfp/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> from the intravital videos used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030113-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030113-g003">3</xref>C (see Videos <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv002">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv003">S3</xref>). Using intravital images to compare the density of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells was deemed to be inaccurate because of the relatively low number of events counted and was likely to cause a bias in the choice of fields for collecting videos. Thus, the density of cells in <italic>cxcr6<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mice was calculated from the density for <italic>cxcr6<sup>gfp/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice and the relative frequency of cells in <italic>cxcr6<sup>gfp/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> and <italic>cxcr6<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mice as quantified by flow cytometry (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030113-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Using the hepatocyte nuclear exclusion of mitochondrial autofluorescence clearly visible in the higher magnification images of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030113-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, we calculated hepatocytes to be 28 &#x003bc;m long along the sinusoids, at a density of 1,142/mm<sup>2</sup>.
