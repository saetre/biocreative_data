We determined whether increased mitochondrial oxidative stress could modulate or regulate two of the key neurochemical hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD): tau phosphorylation, and &#x000df;-amyloid deposition. Mice lacking superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) die within the first week of life, and develop a complex heterogeneous phenotype arising from mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Treatment of these mice with catalytic antioxidants increases their lifespan and rescues the peripheral phenotypes, while uncovering central nervous system pathology. We examined <italic>sod2</italic> null mice differentially treated with high and low doses of a catalytic antioxidant and observed striking elevations in the levels of tau phosphorylation (at Ser-396 and other phospho-epitopes of tau) in the low-dose antioxidant treated mice at AD-associated residues. This hyperphosphorylation of tau was prevented with an increased dose of the antioxidant, previously reported to be sufficient to prevent neuropathology. We then genetically combined a well-characterized mouse model of AD (Tg2576) with heterozygous <italic>sod2</italic> knockout mice to study the interactions between mitochondrial oxidative stress and cerebral A&#x000df; load. We found that mitochondrial SOD2 deficiency exacerbates amyloid burden and significantly reduces metal levels in the brain, while increasing levels of Ser-396 phosphorylated tau. These findings mechanistically link mitochondrial oxidative stress with the pathological features of AD.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria are a main source of potentially pathogenic reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide, particularly in highly metabolically active organs such as the brain and heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000536-Strassburger1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000536-Melov2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Here we describe a novel model for AD neuropathology, showing that mice that lack <italic>sod2</italic> express AD-like hyperphosphorylation of tau, the protein component of neurofibrillary tangles. We show that this hyperphosphorylation of tau is attributable to mitochondrial oxidative stress. We also show that mice that are both transgenic for APP, and hemizygous for <italic>sod2</italic>, incur a higher level of tau phosphorylation, higher amyloid burden and decreased copper, zinc and manganese levels, consistent with a synergistic interaction between APP and mitochondrial oxidative stress in contributing to AD-like neocortical pathology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animal husbandry</title><p><italic>Sod2</italic> nullizgyous mice of both sexes were genotyped between 2 and 3 days of age, and injected intraperitoneally with EUK189 at either 1 mg/kg (low dose) or 30 mg/kg (high dose) daily from 3 days of age until sacrifice, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000536-Melov1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000536-Melov2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Non-specific background was reduced by a 5 minute pre-incubation in 0.5X PBS, in 10&#x00025; methanol plus 3&#x00025; hydrogen peroxide for 20 to 30 minutes. Antigen retrieval was routinely used with a commercially available kit (Antigen Unmasking Solution, Vector Lab., Burlingame CA). All slides were blocked (0.01X PBS, 5&#x00025; v/v normal donkey serum, 0.1&#x00025; Triton X-100) for 2 hours at room temperature, after which the primary antibody (rabbit anti-phospho-Ser 396 tau antibody, BioSource, Camarillo, CA) was added and left over 2 nights at 4&#x000b0;C. To ensure specificity of signal, a specific phospho-blocking peptide for phospho Ser-396 was used on adjacent serial sections (BioSource), which completely blocked the signal from the primary antibody. The secondary antibody (1&#x02236;500, Biotin-SP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab, West Grove, PA) was incubated for one hour at room temperature and the resulting signal was visualized using the Vectastain ABC kit and VectaDAB kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All slides were counterstained in Mayer's Haematoxylin for 30 seconds, and then dehydrated before the application of cover-slips, and subsequent photography using a digital camera (AxioVision v3.1, Carl Zeiss Vision). Silver staining for detection of possible neurofibrillary tangles, was performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000536-Kobayashi1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, with the following modifications: immersion in the alkaline solution was 10 seconds, and the physical developer components for 25&#x000b0;C (10 mL solution A&#x0002b;5 mL solution B&#x0002b;5 mL solution C) were used immediately after mixing.

The sections were treated with 80&#x00025; formic acid for antigen retrieval before probing with monoclonal antibody 1E8 that recognizes an epitope between residues 18 and 22 of A&#x003b2; (Glaxo SmithKline, UK). All sections were imaged on a Northern Light Illuminator (Imaging Research Inc, Ontario, Canada) using a Spot RT-KE 2MP digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, MI, USA) equipped with a Nikkon 55 mm lens and 56 mm extension tube set. Each image was analyzed using ImagePro Plus 5.1 (Media Cybernetics, MD, USA). For each image an &#x0201c;area of interest&#x0201d; (AOI) line was drawn around the margins of the brain occupied by the hippocampus and cortex. The number of &#x000df;-amyloid-positive structures present in each section were then quantitated using color selection to separate the plaques from background labeling. A filter was also utilized to only include structures that were greater than 10 pixels in size. This data was expressed as the total number of &#x000df;-amyloid-positive pixels in each section and was exported to Microsoft Excel for analysis. Based upon the known size of each AOI, all values were normalized to allow comparisons between sections of different surface area and were expressed as pixels/mm<sup>2</sup>. Average A&#x000df; load was assessed in the cortex and underlying grey matter taken from two sections from each animal and all counts represent A&#x000df; found only in plaques.

We tested the hypothesis that mitochondrial oxidative stress could contribute to the two pathological hallmarks of AD, amyloid burden and hyperphosphorylation of tau. We initially evaluated the brains of 3-week old <italic>sod2</italic> null animals treated with low and high doses of the catalytic antioxidant, EUK-189. These mice would die within the first week of life unless treated with antioxidants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000536-Melov1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. We previously developed the paradigm of treating <italic>sod2</italic> null mice with differential doses of catalytic antioxidants, whereby at a low dose of treatment (1 mg/kg of catalytic antioxidant), the peripheral phenotypes are rescued and lifespan is extended, but a severe spongiform pathology with neurodegeneration develops by 3-weeks-of-age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000536-Hinerfeld1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. At high doses of catalytic antioxidant (30 mg/kg), the spongiform pathology is completely prevented, and the accompanying neurodegeneration is attenuated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000536-Melov1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000536-Hinerfeld1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, we could compare the changes in amyloid/tau in the brains of wild-type and <italic>sod2</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice treated with low and high doses of antioxidant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000536-g001">Figure 1</xref>) in order to test the hypothesis that oxidative stress from mitochondrial dysfunction promotes AD-like pathology.</p><p>We did not find evidence of increased amyloid burden in <italic>sod2</italic> nullizygous neonatal mice, possibly because endogenous mouse A&#x000df; has three amino acid substitutions that prevent mouse A&#x000df; from being precipitated by synaptic copper and zinc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000536-Bush1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. However, we did find a striking increase in the levels of hyperphosphorylated tau at 3 weeks of age, which responded to catalytic antioxidant therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000536-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>We observed a significant increase in the level of hyperphosphorylation in 4 out of 5 specific residues evaluated compared to control wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000536-t001">Table 1</xref>). We did observe one residue (Ser-214) that was hypophosphorylated in response to mitochondrial oxidative stress. The phosphorylation status of various residues in tau results from a complex interplay between the inhibition and activation of kinases and phosphatases specific for individual residues. A recent report shows that a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (Pin1) caused hypophosphorylation of Thr-231, Thr-212, Ser-396, and Ser-404 in response to an extracellular hydrogen peroxide stress in primary neuronal cultures isolated from neonatal rats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000536-Galas1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, extracellular oxidative stress can cause hypophosphorylation of specific residues in tau. In contrast, we show here that intracellular oxidative stress appears to cause hyperphosphorylation in most residues we studied (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000536-t001">table 1</xref>). Each of these hyperphosphorylated residues has been previously associated with aggregated hyperphosphorylated tau in AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000536-Augustinack1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, and in the high-dose treated <italic>sod2</italic> null animals, we observed a significant normalization of phosphorylation toward wild-type levels of phosphorylation in 3 out of 4 residues which were hyperphosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000536-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Thr-205 did not reach significance (although a trend consistent with the other three residues was apparent), possibly due to more noise in this particular group. Overall, we conclude that hyperphosphorylated tau which is caused by mitochondrial oxidative stress could be resolved with appropriate antioxidant therapy.</p><p>A number of prior studies have found associations between mitochondrial dysfunction and AD, and animal models of AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000536-Esposito1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000536-Blass1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000536-Smith2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.

Concomitant with our observations of increased hyperphosphorylation of tau as a consequence of <italic>sod2</italic> knockout as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000536-g001">Figure 1</xref>), we investigated the levels of Ser-396 phospho-tau, which is characteristically elevated in AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000536-Augustinack1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, in the brains of double mutant mice compared to controls.

This implies that there is a synergistic interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and amyloid burden that leads to hyperphosphorylation of tau. We also found a relationship between the level of oxidative stress and the level of amyloid burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000536-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

It is worth noting that Esposito et al., also found enhanced loss of microtubule-dependant protein 2 (MAP2) that was APP/A&#x000df; dependant in their <italic>sod2</italic>/APP model (which differs from the model we report here). MAP2 is involved in maintaining microtubule integrity like tau, and depletion of MAP2 is often observed in association with hypephosphorylation of tau<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000536-Li3">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>.

Collectively, these three studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000536-Esposito1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000536-Li2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, and the data we report here) confirm that the SOD2 allele impacts upon AD-like pathology, but clearly the effects vary according to the AD mouse model utilized. Our study is the first to describe an association between SOD2 knockout or antioxidant-modulated oxidative stress and tau phosphorylation, which has not been investigated previously.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that copper and iron levels in the brains of transgenic mice are lowered by expressing mutant APP or the carboxyl terminus of APP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000536-Maynard2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000536-Phinney1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with metal deficiency fostering amyloid accumulation, we have previously found that amyloid clearance induced by clioquinol is associated with an elevation of cortical zinc and copper in the brains of Tg2576 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000536-Cherny1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Our current findings indicate that brain Cu, Zn, Fe, and Mn levels are all decreased as a consequence of genetic combination of Tg2576 and <italic>sod2</italic> heterozygotes. While the significance of this finding is not clear, these metals all participate in essential cellular function. It is likely that the drop in energy that results from the mitochondrial damage leads to a loss of brain metals.

Therefore, the drop in brain copper levels induced by the Tg2576:<italic>sod2</italic> double mutation may contribute to the increased amyloid burden in double mutants.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that mitochondrial oxidative stress per se causes hyperphosphorylation of tau, and that this can be prevented through appropriate antioxidant treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000536-g008">Figure 8</xref>). We have also demonstrated that the aggregate amyloid burden in a well established mouse model of AD (the Tg2576 mouse) is influenced by mitochondrial oxidative stress. This has implications for how we view mouse models of AD, in that to our knowledge, this is the first mouse model of AD that recapitulates two of the canonical hallmarks of AD pathology: plaques, and hyperphosphorylated tau, without resorting to overexpression of both mutant human proteins. Hyperphosphorylated tau is a component of neurofibrillary tangles, the formation of which is closely associated with the dementia process in AD. These findings encourage the use of ROS-scavenging antioxidants as being of potential therapeutic utility in AD.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
