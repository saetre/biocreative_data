Among the genes analyzed, <italic>Alox15</italic> encoding the protein 12/15 lipoxygenase (LOX) was markedly up-regulated in heart failure. To determine whether increased expression of 12/15-LOX causes heart failure, we established transgenic mice that overexpressed 12/15-LOX in cardiomyocytes. Echocardiography showed that <italic>Alox15</italic> transgenic mice developed systolic dysfunction. Cardiac fibrosis increased in <italic>Alox15</italic> transgenic mice with advancing age and was associated with the infiltration of macrophages. Consistent with these observations, cardiac expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) was up-regulated in <italic>Alox15</italic> transgenic mice compared with wild-type mice. Treatment with 12-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid, a major metabolite of 12/15-LOX, increased MCP-1 expression in cardiac fibroblasts and endothelial cells but not in cardiomyocytes. Inhibition of MCP-1 reduced the infiltration of macrophages into the myocardium and prevented both systolic dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis in <italic>Alox15</italic> transgenic mice. Likewise, disruption of 12/15-LOX significantly reduced cardiac MCP-1 expression and macrophage infiltration, thereby improving systolic dysfunction induced by chronic pressure overload. Our results suggest that cardiac 12/15-LOX is involved in the development of heart failure and that inhibition of 12/15-LOX could be a novel treatment for this condition.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Heart failure is a clinical syndrome that is associated with various cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Libby and Braunwald, 2008</xref>). Comprehensive management using current therapeutic options can markedly reduce the morbidity and mortality of heart failure. Large-scale clinical trials of drugs targeting neurohormonal mechanisms, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and &#x003b2; blockers, have shown that such treatment is effective for reducing mortality in patients with heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garg and Yusuf, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McMurray, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldstein, 2002</xref>). However, heart failure is still one of the leading causes of death worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Libby and Braunwald, 2008</xref>), so it is important to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this condition and develop more effective treatments.</p><p>Arachidonic acid is a free fatty acid that, when liberated from cell membranes, can be metabolized by cyclooxygenase, cytochrome p450, and lipoxygenase (LOX) to form biologically active products such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kudo and Murakami, 2002</xref>). LOXs are a family of lipid-peroxidizing enzymes that oxidize free and esterified polyenolic fatty acids to form the corresponding hydroperoxy derivates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuhn and O'Donnell, 2006</xref>). The LOX enzymes are named according to the specific carbon atoms of arachidonic acid that are oxidized. Thus, 12/15-LOX is a member of the LOX family that catalyzes the step from arachidonic acid to 12(S)-HETE and 15(S)-HETE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 1994</xref>). 12/15-LOX was originally isolated from porcine leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yokoyama et al., 1986</xref>), but its tissue distribution is now known to be relatively wide, including blood vessels, the brain, and the kidneys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuhn and O'Donnell, 2006</xref>). Several lines of evidence have suggested that 12/15-LOX may play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Natarajan and Nadler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuhn and O'Donnell, 2006</xref>). For example, disruption of the gene for 12/15-LOX in mice significantly reduces the onset of atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cyrus et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">George et al., 2001</xref>), whereas an increase of 12/15-LOX expression in mice promotes monocyte&#x02013;endothelial cell interactions that lead to atherogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hatley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reilly et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolick et al., 2005</xref>). Several studies have shown that monocyte 12/15-LOX mediates the oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McNally et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sakashita et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhu et al., 2003b</xref>). An increase of 12/15-LOX activity in vessel walls also contributes to atherogenesis by impairing the macrophage cholesterol efflux pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nagelin et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, mice with deficiency of 12/15-LOX are resistant to the development of streptozotocin-induced diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bleich et al., 1999</xref>) and autoimmune diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McDuffie et al., 2008</xref>). However, there is currently little evidence that 12/15-LOX has a role in heart failure.</p><p>In the present study, we showed that cardiac 12/15-LOX induces inflammation that is involved in heart failure. We found that 12/15-LOX expression was markedly increased in the failing heart. Increased expression of this enzyme up-regulates monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and promotes the infiltration of macrophages into the heart, thereby causing cardiac fibrosis and systolic dysfunction. Conversely, disruption of <italic>Alox15</italic> reduces cardiac MCP-1 expression and macrophage infiltration, thereby improving systolic dysfunction induced by chronic pressure overload. These findings suggest that inhibition of 12/15-LOX could be a novel treatment for heart failure.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Increased expression of 12/15-LOX causes heart failure</title><p>To clarify the molecular mechanisms of heart failure, we performed microarray analysis using cardiac tissue samples obtained from a hypertensive heart failure model (Dahl salt-sensitive rats). Approximately 300 genes showed significant changes of expression in failing hearts compared with control hearts. For example, fetal genes, such as the natriuretic peptide genes and the &#x003b2;-type myosin heavy chain gene, were up-regulated, whereas cardioprotective genes, such as heat shock proteins, were down-regulated (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082596/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>).

Activation of this enzyme has been shown to promote neuronal death, whereas inhibition of 12/15-LOX protects against brain damage caused by oxidative stress or ischemia by inhibiting neuronal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lebeau et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Seiler et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, treatment with 12(S)-HETE does not induce the apoptosis of cultured cardiomyocytes (unpublished data). Indeed, few apoptotic cardiomyocytes were detected in the hearts of <italic>Alox15</italic> transgenic mice even after the onset of systolic dysfunction (unpublished data). Instead, these mice showed an increase of macrophages infiltrating into the myocardium, which was associated with cardiac fibrosis and systolic dysfunction. Our findings suggested that MCP-1 may have a major role in promoting cardiac inflammation in <italic>Alox15</italic> transgenic mice because its inhibition almost completely abolished the accumulation of macrophages and prevented systolic dysfunction. We also showed that 12/15-LOX induces up-regulation of MCP-1 expression in the setting of pressure overload, thereby increasing cardiac inflammation and leading to systolic dysfunction. Consistent with our findings, inhibition of MCP-1 has been reported to attenuate myocardial inflammation, fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction induced by chronic pressure overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuwahara et al., 2004</xref>). It has also been reported that transgenic animals with cardiac expression of MCP-1 develop myocardial fibrosis and systolic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kolattukudy et al., 1998</xref>). In agreement with our in vitro data, it has been reported that MCP-1 expression is up-regulated in vascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts by pressure overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuwahara et al., 2004</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that chronic pressure overload increases the expression of 12/15-LOX, which then causes heart failure by promoting cardiac inflammation and fibrosis.</p><p>Target gene disruption or overexpression of 12/15-LOX in mice with a genetic background of apolipoprotein E or low-density lipoprotein receptor deficiency has shown that this enzyme may have a role in atherogenesis. The data indirectly support a role for 12/15-LOX in the oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein. Consistent with our results, recent evidence suggests that 12/15-LOX plays a crucial role in the regulation of proinflammatory molecules and that this regulatory activity of 12/15-LOX may be important for linking 12/15-LOX activation to atherogenesis. For example, 12(S)-HETE increases the expression of MCP-1, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1;, and adhesion molecules by macrophages and vascular cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolick et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wen et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dwarakanath et al., 2008</xref>), and these changes are partly mediated by activation of nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolick et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dwarakanath et al., 2008</xref>). Disruption of 12/15-LOX has also been shown to attenuate airway allergic inflammation by modulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism of 12/15-LOX activation in the failing heart is unclear. We previously demonstrated that mismatch between the number of capillaries and the size of cardiomyocytes occurs during the development of cardiac hypertrophy, leading to myocardial hypoxia and systolic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sano et al., 2007</xref>). Because exposure of cultured cardiomyocytes to hypoxia up-regulates 12/15-LOX expression (unpublished data), a hypoxic state might be one reason for the induction of 12/15-LOX in the failing heart. This concept is supported by previous results that hypoxia up-regulates 12/15-LOX expression in the lungs and the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernaudin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhu et al., 2003a</xref>). Moreover, we have found that 12/15-LOX expression is significantly up-regulated in the heart after myocardial infarction (unpublished data). There are putative binding elements for CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins and nuclear factor &#x003ba;B within the promoter region of the <italic>Alox15</italic> gene (unpublished data), and both of these molecules are known to be activated by hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cummins and Taylor, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Inflammation has an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of many forms of heart failure, and biomarkers of inflammation have become the subject of intense investigation. In the Framingham Heart Study, an increase of C-reactive protein (as well as inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1;) was found to identify asymptomatic older persons in the community with a high risk of developing heart failure in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braunwald, 2008</xref>). Multivariate analysis has shown that an increase of C-reactive protein is an independent predictor of adverse outcomes in patients with acute or chronic heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anand et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that heart failure is closely associated with systemic inflammation. Because metabolites of 12/15-LOX may have a role in vascular inflammation, insulin resistance, and renal dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Natarajan and Nadler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuhn and O'Donnell, 2006</xref>), activation of 12/15-LOX in the failing heart could induce systemic inflammation and have a detrimental effect on other inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, and nephropathy. Conversely, inhibition of 12/15-LOX could be an attractive new strategy for the treatment of heart failure, as well as various other inflammatory conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Animal models.</title><p>All of the experimental protocols were approved by Chiba University review board.

In this model, marked cardiac hypertrophy developed and left ventricular systolic function was impaired at 17 wk of age. Accordingly, DS rats were sacrificed for gene chip analysis at 17 wk. All of the DS rats given a high-sodium diet showed signs of heart failure such as rapid and labored respiration and diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis on echocardiography at the time of sacrifice. Other DS rats were fed a low-salt diet (0.3% NaCl) as a control group.</p><p>We generated transgenic mice on a C57BL/6 background that expressed 12/15-LOX in cardiomyocytes under the control of the &#x003b1;&#x02013;cardiac myosin heavy chain (&#x003b1;-MHC) promoter.

Injection was performed every 2 wk from 10 wk until 48 wk of age. To increase the efficiency of gene transfection, 100 &#x000b5;l of the myotoxic agent bupivacaine (0.25% wt/vol) was injected into the muscles 3 d before transfection. Transfection of 7ND leads to an increase of mutant MCP-1 in the blood, as indicated by elevation of its plasma concentration after 14 d. The circulating mutant MCP-1 binds to the receptor for MCP-1 (chemokine receptor 2) on target cells and effectively blocks MCP-1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ni et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayashidani et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Physiological and histological analysis.</title><p>Echocardiography was performed with a Vevo 770 High Resolution Imaging System (Visual Sonics Inc.).
