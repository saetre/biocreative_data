Thus far, the ryanodine receptor type 2 (<italic>RyR2</italic>) and calsequestrin (<italic>CASQ2</italic>) genes have been identified to underlie the disease. Yet, many patients with clinical features comparable with CPVT harbor no apparent mutations in these genes, thus reflecting the existence of yet unidentified non-coding mutations or genetic heterogeneity of this disorder.</p><p>Mutations or variants in calstabin (<italic>FKBP1B</italic>), sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (<italic>ATP2A2</italic>) or sodium-calcium exchanger (<italic>SLC8A1</italic>) genes have until now not been reported to be associated with increased risk of human ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Although still a matter of controversy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], a number of delicate <italic>in vitro </italic>studies suggest that depletion of calstabin, which normally stabilizes the RyR2 channel complex, is related to CPVT pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. SERCA2a (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase), an ion pump located on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in a cardiac myocyte, plays a pivotal role in transporting intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>ions back to the SR in the beginning of diastole. Thus far, SERCA2a encoded by the <italic>ATP2A2 </italic>gene has been the target of extensive <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>experiments in heart failure only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], whereas a mutated cardiac sodium-calcium exchanger 1 (NCX1), the major Ca<sup>2+ </sup>ion remover in cardiac myocyte, has been shown to cause cardiac fibrillation in embryonic zebrafish hearts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>According to several investigators, circulating catecholamines cause the abnormal activation of RyR2 channels and thus an arrhythmogenic leak of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, it has been hypothesized that <italic>RyR2 </italic>mutations could lead to channel dysfunction also in the absence of sympathetic stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In this study, we aimed to broaden the knowledge of disease-causing <italic>RyR2 </italic>mutations in resting and exercise-induced VPCs and to elucidate the involvement of not only <italic>RyR2</italic>, but also three other candidate genes in the pathology of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. We hypothesized that FKBP12.6, SERCA2a and NCX1, as integral proteins in cardiac Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signaling, might play a role in the pathogenesis of human ventricular arrhythmias and which defects might manifest with clinical features resembling CPVT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and controls</title><p>We recruited 33 consecutive symptomatic patients referred to Helsinki University Hospital for genetic studies of cardiac ion channel disorders because of frequent ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) occurring during exercise and consecutive VPCs, history of syncope and/or sudden juvenile death in family. None had apparent structural heart disease or prolonged QT interval. A total of 16 patient featured arrhythmias typical of CPVT in the exercise stress test. The remaining 17 subjects had frequent VPCs and often salvos of VPCs also at rest, thus differing from CPVT phenotype. A health enquiry, a 12-lead resting ECG, an exercise stress test, a cardiac ultrasonography and 24-hour ambulatory ECG recording were registered from each index patient. If over ten VPCs were evident in the exercise stress test of patient's first degree relatives, the clinical examinations including 12-lead resting ECG, exercise stress test and cardiac ultrasonography were extended to available second-degree relatives. A total of 232 relatives were clinically evaluated in the course of the study. History regarding the age of onset, episodes of syncopal spells and occurrence of sudden juvenile (&#x02264; 40 years) death in the patient's first and second degree relatives were collected. The control DNA samples of 300 apparently healthy blood donors were provided by the Finnish Red Cross Blood Service. An informed consent was obtained from each patient and the Ethics Committee of the department approved the study.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA analyses</title><p>We sequenced all the 105 coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of <italic>RyR2 </italic>(NM_001035) gene using ABI 3730 Automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, MA, USA) provided by the National Public Health Institute of Finland. Reference sequences were obtained from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. The primer sequences, designed mainly by N. Tiso, and reaction conditions for PCR amplification are available by contacting the corresponding author. The previously reported 1.1 kb <italic>RyR2 </italic>exon 3 deletion was investigated using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis of <italic>RyR2 </italic>exon 3 (Salsa MLPA Kit P168, MRC Holland, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) and with PCR using primers CACAGAACAGGACCAAGTTAGAGG (forward) in intron 2 and CATTACCTTCCTGACACACTTCAT (reverse) in intron 3 of the <italic>RyR2 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. When present, the architecture of the deletion was investigated in more detail by DNA sequencing. A functional candidate gene approach was applied to probands that failed to present <italic>RyR2 </italic>mutations. These indexes were additionally screened for variations in the exonic regions of <italic>FKBP1B </italic>(NM_004116), <italic>ATP2A2 </italic>(NM_170665) and <italic>SLC8A1 </italic>(NM_021097) genes coding for the integral proteins in cardiac Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signaling. CPVT caused by mutations in the <italic>CASQ2 </italic>gene is proposed to follow the autosomal recessive inheritance, while the disease phenotype in our patients with a familial disorder, followed autosomal dominant pattern. In addition, sequencing of the <italic>CASQ2 </italic>gene was excluded from the study protocol because our previous study on <italic>CASQ2 </italic>failed to detect any rare variants in Finnish CPVT patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Primer sequences and the conditions for sequencing the three genes are obtainable by contacting the authors. Detection of observed allelic <italic>RyR2 </italic>variants in family members and 300 healthy controls was achieved by denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography (dHPLC, WAVE Nucleic Acid Fragment Analysis System HSM 3500A). Direct sequencing confirmed the genomic variations leading to divergent chromatogram profiles. The detection of <italic>ATP2A2 </italic>T982M in the relatives and controls was achieved by restriction analysis utilizing the Lwel enzyme (Fermentas International Inc, Burlington, Ontario, Canada).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro </italic>electrophysiological studies</title><p>RyR2 N3308S mutagenesis was performed with QuikChange II XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) using cassettes of hRyR2 subcloned into pBlueScript vector. Mutated fragments of hRyR2 were cloned back into full-length pCMV5/hRyR2 with FseI and NheI. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with 10 &#x003bc;g of pCMV5/hRyR2 and an equal molar amount of pCMV5/FKBP12.6 per T175 flask using calcium phosphate precipitation technique.</p><p>Single channel recordings were conducted in planar lipid bilayers under voltage clamp conditions. Microsomes containing the recombinant RyR2 channels were added to the <italic>cis</italic>-chamber and fused to the lipid bilayer consisting of 3:1 phosphatidyl ethanolamine/phosphatidyl serine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA). Fusion was induced by adding KCl to the <italic>cis</italic>-chamber, and the created ion gradient was eliminated after fusion by perfusing the chamber with <italic>cis</italic>-solution. The bathing solutions were as follows: <italic>cis </italic>solution, 50 mM KCl, 250 mM HEPES, 125 mM TRIS, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>; <italic>trans</italic>-solution 50 mM KCl, 53 mM Ba(OH)<sub>2 </sub>and 250 mM HEPES. All experiments were carried out in pH 7.35, and free Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentration was determined using the program CHELATOR. 20 mM CaCl<sub>2 </sub>was added sequentially to the <italic>cis</italic>-side, and the channel activity was recorded for at least 3 min in each concentrations. At the end of each experiment, ryanodine was applied to confirm the class of the channel. Data were collected using AxoScope1 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA, USA) and analyzed by pClamp 6 program (Axon Instruments).

A total of six probands (38%) in the group A had relatives featuring similar arrhythmias in the clinical evaluation, whereas in the group B, seven probands (41%) had affected relatives. In group A, there were more syncopal spells and sudden juvenile deaths in the first and second-degree relatives, but the difference to group B was not statistically significant.

Apart from the ascending aorta dilatation (up to 57 mm) in the index patient's sister, none of the affected subjects showed major structural cardiovascular abnormalities.

In the present study, two CPVT families carried a corresponding in-frame <italic>RyR2 </italic>exon 3 deletion that has recently been characterized by Bhuiyan et al in two kindred of exercise-related ventricular arrhytmias, atrial arrhythmias, conduction defects and left ventricular dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Previously, it was shown that the genomic deletion of the <italic>RyR2 </italic>exon 3 occurred as a result of a <italic>Alu</italic>-repeat mediated polymerase slippage during chromosomal replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Neither of the families in the present study featured consistent structural abnormalities suggesting that the deleted <italic>RyR2 </italic>exon 3 may underlie a spectrum of a purely electric CPVT disorder to a more complex disorders as shown previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Characterization of the large <italic>RyR2 </italic>exon 3 deletion independently in altogether four unrelated families with CPVT-related disorders thus far suggests that this region may be of notable importance in the pathogenesis of inherited arrhythmia disorders.</p><p>In the present study, four (25%) out of the 16 probands featuring typical CPVT carried a disrupted <italic>RyR2 </italic>gene. In our previous studies, a <italic>RyR2 </italic>defect has been evident in an average of 40% of CPVT patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] similarly to other patient populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. As we sequenced the 105 exons of the <italic>RyR2 </italic>gene and analyzed the DNAs for exon 3 deletions, our study suggests existence of non-coding intron mutations, other large yet unidentified genomic deletions, alterations in the regulatory units or genetic heterogeneity of the disorder. Combining present data to our previous studies, <italic>RyR2 </italic>alterations explain 35% of the CPVT phenotype in the Finnish probands (n = 26) of which 2 out of 9 (22%) appeared to be <italic>de novo </italic>mutations. The low frequency of <italic>de novo </italic>mutations calls for systematic cardiovascular examinations for all first degree relatives. In addition, the identified <italic>RyR2 </italic>S616L and R1051P missense mutations are expected to extend the N-terminal hot-spot region of the <italic>RyR2 </italic>gene which further challenges the method of targeted mutational analysis in which only previously mutation positive exons are sequenced.</p><p>Molecular genetic approaches should be applied in gaining further understanding in familial VPCs that occur also in resting conditions. Recently, several <italic>in vitro </italic>studies have questioned the occurrence of arrhythmias in CPVT merely in the presence of adrenergic stimulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In our study, only one index showing resting VPCs carried a variant in the <italic>RyR2 </italic>gene. According to the proposed criteria for high risk right ventricular outflow tract &#x02013; arrhythmias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], this phenotype with extremely frequent VPCs and a history of syncope was of malignant nature. However, the asparagine substitution to serine at position 3308 maintains the polarity of the amino acid and results in a neutral replacement. In addition, the N3308S was detected in one of the 300 apparently healthy controls. The single channel experiments carried out in planar lipid bilayers did not show enhanced sensitivity of the mutant channel to the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+ </sup>under basal conditions. Collectively, the evidence of the causal role of this variant is unconvincing and suggests that the <italic>RyR2 </italic>N3308S is an innocent variant despite its rare occurrence in the Finnish population. However, a search for the variant in patients with a similar phenotype may be justifiable in other populations.</p><p>Despite the lack of convincing disease-causing <italic>RyR2 </italic>mutations in our patients with VPCs at rest, the occurrence of syncopal spells and the proportion of familial occurrence (38% vs. 41%) did not differ between the CPVT and resting VPC phenotype. Furthermore, the similar incidence of sudden juvenile death among the first and second degree relatives of the two groups suggests that even this phenotype with resting VPCs may be malignant. Elucidating the genetic background in this heterogeneous group is fundamental so that the malignant forms of the disorder could be identified. In the present study, the limited sample size precludes any definitive statements of the occurrence of rare mutations in these candidate genes in other study populations. In addition, the lack of information concerning the <italic>in vitro </italic>functional properties of the mutant <italic>RyR2 </italic>S616L and R1051P channels remains as a limitation of the present study. We conclude that mutations in <italic>FKBP1B</italic>, <italic>ATP2A2 </italic>and <italic>SLC8A1 </italic>appear subsidiary in the pathogenesis of frequent VPCs of unknown etiology in Finnish patients. <italic>RyR2 </italic>involvement in potentially malignant frequent resting VPCs requires further clarification. Large genomic <italic>RyR2 </italic>deletions involving exon 3 provide a target for future genetic studies in disorders resembling CPVT.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AM has participated in the designing of the present survey, performed genotyping and <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments, conduced the data analysis and drafted the manuscript.
