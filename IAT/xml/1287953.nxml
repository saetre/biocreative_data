This species is a model for studies of hydrogenogens, which are diverse bacteria and archaea that grow anaerobically utilizing carbon monoxide (CO) as their sole carbon source and water as an electron acceptor, producing carbon dioxide and hydrogen as waste products. Organisms that make use of CO do so through carbon monoxide dehydrogenase complexes. Remarkably, analysis of the genome of <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> reveals the presence of at least five highly differentiated anaerobic carbon monoxide dehydrogenase complexes, which may in part explain how this species is able to grow so much more rapidly on CO than many other species. Analysis of the genome also has provided many general insights into the metabolism of this organism which should make it easier to use it as a source of biologically produced hydrogen gas. One surprising finding is the presence of many genes previously found only in sporulating species in the Firmicutes Phylum. Although this species is also a Firmicutes, it was not known to sporulate previously. Here we show that it does sporulate and because it is missing many of the genes involved in sporulation in other species, this organism may serve as a &#x0201c;minimal&#x0201d; model for sporulation studies. In addition, using phylogenetic profile analysis, we have identified many uncharacterized gene families found in all known sporulating Firmicutes, but not in any non-sporulating bacteria, including a sigma factor not known to be involved in sporulation previously.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p><italic>Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans,</italic> a bacterium isolated from a Russian hotspring, is studied for three major reasons: it grows at very high temperature, it lives almost entirely on a diet of carbon monoxide (CO), and it converts water to hydrogen gas as part of its metabolism. Understanding this organism's unique biology gets a boost from the decoding of its genome, reported in this issue of <italic>PLoS Genetics</italic>. For example, genome analysis reveals that it encodes five different forms of the protein machine carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH). Most species have no CODH and even species that utilize CO usually have only one or two. The five CODH in <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> likely allow it to both use CO for diverse cellular processes and out-compete for it when it is limiting. The genome sequence also led the researchers to experimentally document new aspects of this species' biology including the ability to form spores. The researchers then used comparative genomic analysis to identify conserved genes found in all spore-forming species, including <italic>Bacillus anthracis,</italic> and not in any other species. Finally, the genome sequence and analysis reported here will aid in those trying to develop this and other species into systems to biologically produce hydrogen gas from water.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Wu M, Ren Q, Durkin AS, Daugherty SC, Brinkac LM, et al.

Despite its deleterious effects on many species, it is also the basis for many food chains, especially in hydrothermal environments such as the deep sea, hot springs, and volcanoes. In these environments, CO is a common potential carbon source, as it is produced both by partial oxidation of organic matter as well as by multiple microbial strains (e.g., methanogens). It is most readily available in areas in which oxygen concentrations are low, since oxidation of CO will convert it to CO<sub>2</sub>. In hydrothermal environments, CO use as a primary carbon source is dominated by the hydrogenogens, which are anaerobic, thermophilic bacteria or archaea that carry out CO oxidation using water as an electron acceptor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. This leads to the production of CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>. The H<sub>2</sub> is frequently lost to the environment and the CO<sub>2</sub> is used in carbon fixation pathways for the production of biomass. Hydrogenogens have attracted significant biotechnological interest because of the possibility they could be used in the biological production of hydrogen gas.</p><p>Hydrogenogens are found in diverse volcanic environments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b002">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. The phylogenetic types differ somewhat depending on the environments and include representatives of bacteria and archaea. <italic>Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans</italic> is a hydrogenogen that was isolated from a hot spring in Kunashir Island, Russia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. It is a member of the Firmicutes Phylum (also known as low GC Gram-positives) and grows optimally at 78 &#x000b0;C. This species has been considered an unusual hydrogenogen, in part because unlike most of the other hydrogenogens, it was believed to be strictly dependent on CO for growth. The other species were found to grow poorly unless CO was supplemented with organic substrates. Thus it was selected for genome sequencing as a potential model obligate CO autotroph.</p><p>Surprisingly, initial analysis of the unpublished genome sequence data led to the discovery that this species is not an obligate CO autotroph &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. We report here a detailed analysis of the genome sequence of <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> strain Z-2901, the type strain of the species, hereafter referred to simply as <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Genome Structure</title><p>The <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> genome is a single circular chromosome of 2,401,892 base pairs (bp) with a G&#x0002b;C content of 42.0&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010065-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0010065-t001">Table 1</xref>). Annotation of the genome reveals 2,646 putative protein coding genes (CDSs), of which 1,512 can be assigned a putative function. The chromosome displays two clear GC skew transitions that likely correspond to the DNA replication origin and terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010065-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Overall, 3.0 &#x00025; of the genome is made up of repetitive DNA sequences. Included in this repetitive DNA are two large-clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR, 3.9 and 5.6 kilobases, respectively). Each cluster contains 59 and 84 partially palindromic repeats of 30 bps, respectively (GTTTCAATCCCAGA&#x0005b;A/T&#x0005d;TGGTTCGATTAAAAC). Most repeats within each cluster are identical but they differ for one nucleotide in the middle between clusters. Repeats at ends of the smaller cluster degenerate to some extent. These types of repeats are widespread in diverse groups of bacteria and archaea &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. The first one-third of the repeat sequence is generally conserved. Although the precise functions of these repeats are unknown, some evidence suggests they are involved in chromosome partitioning &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, experiments in the thermophilic archaea <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> have identified a genus-specific protein binding specifically to the repeats present in that species' genome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>One 35-kilobase lambda-like prophage containing 50 CDSs was identified in the genome. It is flanked on one side by a tRNA suggesting this may have served as a site of insertion. Phylogenetic analysis showed this phage is most closely related to phages found in other Firmicutes, particularly the SPP1 phage infecting <italic>Bacillus subtilis.</italic></p><p>As with other members of the Phylum Firmicutes, the directions of leading strand DNA replication and transcription are highly correlated, with 87&#x00025; of genes located on the leading strand. This gene distribution bias is also highly correlated with the presence of a Firmicutes-specific DNA polymerase PolC in the genome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. In <italic>B. subtilis,</italic> PolC synthesizes the leading strand, and another distinct DNA polymerase, DnaE, replicates the lagging strand &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. In other non-Firmicutes bacteria, DnaE replicates both strands. The asymmetric replication forks of Firmicutes were proposed to contribute to the asymmetry of their gene distributions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. One copy of PolC and two copies of DnaE have been identified in <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> genome. At least some of the gene distribution bias can be caused by selection to avoid collision of the RNA and DNA polymerases as well &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Despite this apparent selection, the lack of significantly conserved gene order across Firmicutes indicates that genome rearrangements still occur at a reasonably high rate.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Phylogeny and Taxonomy</title><p>Analysis of the complete genome of <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> suggests that the taxonomy of this species, as well as some other organisms, needs to be revised. More specifically, phylogenetic analysis based on concatenation of a few dozen markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010065-g002">Figure 2</xref>) reveals a variety of conflicts between the organismal phylogeny and the classification of some of the Firmicutes. For example, <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> is currently considered to be a member of the Family Peptococcaceae in the Order Clostridiales &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus it should form a clade with the <italic>Clostridium</italic> spp. to the exclusion of other taxa for which genomes are available (e.g., <italic>Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis,</italic> which is considered to be a member of Thermoanaerobacteriales). The tree, however, indicates that this is not the case and that <italic>T. tengcongensis</italic> and the <italic>Clostridia</italic> spp. are more closely related to each other than either is to <italic>C. hydrogenoformans.</italic> Thus we believe <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> should be placed in a separate Order from Clostridiales.</p><p>Perhaps more surprisingly, the concatenated genome tree shows <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> grouping with <italic>Symbiobacterium thermophilum. S. thermophilum</italic> is a strictly symbiotic thermophile isolated from compost and is currently classified in the Actinobacteria (also known as high GC Gram-positives) based on analysis of its 16s rRNA sequence &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. The grouping with Firmicutes is supported by the overall level of similarity of its proteome to other species &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. We therefore believe the rRNA-based classification is incorrect and that <italic>S. thermophilum</italic> should be transferred to the Firmicutes. Such inaccuracies of the rRNA trees are relatively uncommon and may in this case be due to the mixing of thermophilic and non-thermophilic species into one group. This can cause artifacts when using rRNA genes for phylogenetic reconstruction since the G&#x0002b;C content of rDNA is strongly correlated to optimal growth temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>CO Dehydrogenases and Life in CO</title><p>Anaerobic species that make use of CO do so using nickel-iron CO dehydrogenase (CODH) complexes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;.

Analysis of the genome reveals the presence of five genes encoding homologs of CooS, the catalytic subunit of anaerobic CODHs. These five CooS encoding genes are scattered around the genome, and analysis of genome context, gene phylogeny, and experimental studies in this and other CO-utilizing species suggests they are subunits of five distinct CODH complexes, which we refer to as CODH I-V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010065-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The CooS homologs are named accordingly. Specific details about each complex and proposed physiological roles are given in the following paragraphs.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Energy Conservation (CODH-I)</title><p>A catalytic subunit (CooS-I, CHY1824) and an electron transfer protein (CooF, CHY1825) of CODH are encoded immediately downstream of a hydrogenase gene cluster (<italic>cooMKLXUH,</italic> CHY1832&#x02013;27) that is closely related to the one found in <italic>Rhodospirillum rubrum</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.

This is consistent with the observation that key enzymes for the other known CO<sub>2</sub> fixation pathways, such as the Calvin cycle, the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle, and 3-hydroxypropionate cycle are apparently not encoded in the genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Oxidative Stress Response (CODH-IV)</title><p><italic>C. hydrogenoformans,</italic> though an anaerobe, has to deal with oxidative challenges present in the environment from time to time.

However, our phylogenetic analysis showed that the <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> homolog of CoxL does not group within the CODH subfamily. Therefore, we conclude that it is unlikely that this gene cluster in <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> encodes a CODH, although that needs to be tested. Of the available published and unpublished genomes, only <italic>R. rubrum</italic> appears to have both an anaerobic CODH and a close relative of the aerobic <italic>O. carboxidovorans</italic> CODH. Accordingly, <italic>R. rubrum,</italic> a photosynthetic bacterium, can grow in the dark both aerobically and anaerobically using CO as an energy source.</p><p>Structures of both the Mo- and Ni-containing enzymes have been published recently.

With this in mind, we set out to re-examine the morphology of <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> cells and found endospore-like structures when cultures were stressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010065-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>We then used phylogenetic profile analysis to look for other possible sporulation genes in the genome. Phylogenetic profiling works by grouping genes according to their distribution patterns in different species &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. Proteins that function in the same pathways or structural complexes frequently have correlated distribution patterns. Phylogenetic profile analysis identified an additional set of 37 potential sporulation-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010065-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Those genes are generally <italic>Bacillales-</italic> and <italic>Clostridiales-</italic>specific, consistent with the fact that endospores have so far only been found in these and other closely related Firmicutes. Most of the novel genes are conserved hypothetical proteins, whereas a few are putative membrane proteins. In support, a few of those novel sporulation genes have been shown to be involved in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> sporulation by experimental studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. The rest of the genes are thus excellent candidates for encoding known sporulation functions that have not been assigned to genes or previously unknown sporulation activities. Strikingly, within this group of genes, in addition to other known sporulation-specific sigma factors (&#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>, &#x003c3;<sup>F</sup>, &#x003c3;<sup>G</sup>, and &#x003c3;<sup>K</sup>), we identified a sigma factor (CHY1519) that was not known to be associated with sporulation previously. &#x003c3;<sup>I</sup>, its putative ortholog in <italic>B. subtilis,</italic> has shown some association with heat shock &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. It remains to be determined experimentally whether this sigma factor is involved in sporulation, and if so, the regulatory network it controls.</p><p>A search of known sporulation-related genes in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> against <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> revealed that many of them are missing in the genome. Of the 175 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> sporulation-related genes we compiled from the genome annotation and literature &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;, half have no detectable homologs in <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> using BLASTP with an E-value cutoff of 1e-5. Putative orthologs defined by mutual-best-hit methodology are present for only one third of those genes in <italic>C. hydrogenoformans.</italic> Among those missing genes are <italic>spo0B</italic> and <italic>spo0F,</italic> which encode the key components of the complex phosphorelay pathway in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> that channels various signals such as DNA damage, the ATP level, and cell density to the master switch protein Spo0A and therefore governs the cell's decision to enter sporulation. <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> hence uses either a simplified version of this pathway or an alternative signal transduction pathway to sense the environmental or physiological stimuli. A large number of genes involved in the protective outer layer (cortex, coat, and exosporium) formation, spore germination, and small acid-soluble spore protein synthesis, among a few genes in various stages of spore development, are also missing. A similar, but slightly different, set of genes are missing in the other spore-forming <italic>Clostridia</italic> species as well &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. Absence of those genes is more pronounced in non-spore-forming Firmicutes such as <italic>Listeria</italic> spp., <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp., and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp., as they lack all the sporulation-specific genes. When overlaid onto the phylogeny of Firmicutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010065-g002">Figure 2</xref>), this observation can be explained by either multiple independent gene-loss events along branches leading to non-<italic>Bacillus</italic> species or by independent gene-gain events along branches leading to <italic>Bacillus</italic> and <italic>Clostridia,</italic> or by both. Whatever the history is of the sporulation evolution, the core set of sporulation genes shared by <italic>Bacillus</italic> and <italic>Clostridia</italic> might be close to a &#x0201c;minimal&#x0201d; sporulation set, as so far only these two groups have been found to be capable of producing endospores. Alternatively, some spore specific functions may be carried out by non orthologous genes in different species, which would prevent us from identifying them by this type of analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Strictly Dependent on CO?</title><p>Until very recently, <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> was thought to be an autotroph strictly depending on CO for growth. An overview of the genome reveals features related to its autotrophic lifestyle. For example, it has lost the entire sugar phosphotransferase system and encodes no complete pathway for sugar compound degradation. However, many aspects of the gene repertoire are suggestive of heterotrophic capabilities. For example, among the transporters encoded in the genome are ones predicted to import diverse carbon compounds including formate, glycerol, lactate, C4-dicarboxylate (malate, fumarate, or succinate; the binding receptor for this has three paralogs in the genome), 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate, 2-oxoglutarate, and amino acids. In addition there is a diverse array of signal transduction pathways including chemotaxis not commonly found in the genomes of autotrophs (see below). Consistent with these observations, Henstra et al. recently showed that formate, lactate, and glycerol could be utilized as carbon source provided 9,10-anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate was used as the electron acceptor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;.

It is not known what electron acceptors are likely to be coupled to these pathways in the isolation locale of <italic>C. hydrogenoformans,</italic> however it is clear that there is a more versatile complement of energy sources than initially concluded by Svetlichny et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In terms of autotrophic lifestyle, although <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> and <italic>S. thermophilum</italic> are close phylogenetically, they have gone separate ways in their lifestyles. <italic>S. thermophilum</italic> is an uncultivable thermophilic bacterium growing as part of a microbial consortium &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, while <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> is a hot-spring autotroph that can survive efficiently on CO as its sole carbon and energy source. Accordingly, their metabolic capabilities are very different and only half of their proteomes are homologous. It is not clear why <italic>S. thermophilum</italic> is dependent on other microbes.

On the other hand, <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> has evolved to live preferably on CO, possibly by acquiring and/or expanding its complement of CODHs. As a result, it has lost many genes associated with a heterotrophic lifestyle, such as the phosphotransferase transporter system, and may be on the verge of becoming an obligate autotroph.

The genome does not encode any proteins of the LuxR family, which are usually abundant in both one-component (e.g., quorum-sensing regulators) and two-component systems.</p><p>The largest family of transcriptional regulators in <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> is sigma-54- dependent activators. Eight such regulators comprise one-component systems (CHY0581, CHY0788, CHY1254, CHY1318, CHY1359, CHY1376, CHY1547, and CHY2091) and another one is a response regulator of the two-component system (CHY1855). Seven one-component sigma-54-dependent regulators have at least one PAS domain as a sensory module. PAS domains are known to often contain redox-responsive cofactors, such as FAD, FMN, and heme and serve as intracellular oxygen and redox sensors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. Overall, there are 18 PAS domains in <italic>C. hydrogenoformans.</italic> It is a very significant number compared to only two PAS domains in <italic>Moorella thermoacetica</italic> (similar genome size) and nine in <italic>Desulfitobacterium hafniense</italic> (a much larger genome). The most abundant sensory domain of bacterial signal transduction, the LysR substrate-binding domain, which binds small molecule ligands, is present only in six copies in <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> (there are 36 copies in <italic>D. hafniense</italic>), re-enforcing the notion that redox sensing via PAS domains might be the most critical signal transduction event for this organism.</p><p>The most intriguing signal transduction protein in <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> is the sigma-54-dependent transcriptional regulator that has an iron hydrogenase-like domain as a sensory module (CHY1547). This domain contains 4Fe-4S clusters and is predicted to use molecular hydrogen for the reduction of a variety of substrates. Its fusion with the sigma-54 activator and the DNA-binding HTH&#x0005f;8 domain in the CHY1547 protein strongly suggests that this is a unique regulator that activates gene expression in <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> in response to hydrogen availability. Interestingly, it is located immediately upstream of a ten-gene cluster encoding a Ni/Fe hydrogenase (CHY1537&#x02013;46).

For each of them, an mRNA stem-loop structure, the signature of the so-called Sec Insertion Sequence (SECIS) required for the Sec insertion, is present immediately downstream of the UGA codon. Although most of the identified selenoproteins are redox proteins, as has been shown for other bacteria and archaea &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;, three are novel. Two are transporters (CHY0860, CHY0565), while the third is a methylated-DNA-protein-cysteine methyltransferase (CHY0809), a suicidal DNA repair protein that repairs alkylated guanine by transferring the alkyl group to the cysteine residue at its active site. It is striking that although this protein has been found in virtually every studied organism, only the one in <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> has selenocysteine in place of cysteine at its active site. Therefore, this selenoprotein most likely evolved very recently, probably from a cysteine-containing protein.

This is best exemplified by examination of the frameshift in the <italic>cooS</italic>-III gene (CHY1221), which as described above is predicted to encode one of the key components of the acetyl-CoA carbon fixation pathway. In cultures of another strain of this species (DSM 6008), a functional full-length (i.e., unframeshifted) version of this protein has been purified &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010065-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d; and sequence comparisons of the gene from that strain with ours revealed many polymorphisms, including a deletion in our strain that gave rise to this frameshift (unpublished data). Studies of DSM 6008 show that in cultures grown in excess CO, the acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS, CHY1222) existed predominantly as monomer and only trace amount of CODH-III/ACS complex could be detected. On the other hand, when the CO supply was limited, CODH-III/ACS complex became the dominant form. It is plausible that CODH-III is not absolutely required for carbon fixation when the CO supply is high.

Proteins were then clustered by the similarity of their profiles, thus allowing the grouping of proteins by their distribution patterns across species. Examination of the groupings showed one cluster consisting of mostly homologs of sporulation proteins. This cluster is shown with <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> proteins in rows (and the prediced function and protein ID indicated on the right) and other species in columns with presence of a ortholog indicated in red and absence in black. The tree to the left represents the portion of the cluster diagram for these proteins. Note that most of these proteins are found only in a few species represented in red columns near the center of the diagram. The species corresponding to these columns are indicated. We also note that though most of the proteins in this cluster, for which functions can be predicted, are predicted to be involved in sporulation and some have no predictable functions (highlighted in blue). This indicates that functions of these proteins' homologs have not been characterized in other species. Since these proteins show similar distribution patterns to so many proteins with roles in sporulation, we predict that they represent novel sporulation functions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0010065.g007"/></fig><table-wrap id="pgen-0010065-t001" content-type="1col" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>General Features of the <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> Genome</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0010065.t001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="pgen-0010065-t002" content-type="1col" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Orthologs of Known <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> Sporulation Genes in <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0010065.t002"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="pgen-0010065-t003" content-type="1col" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Selenoproteins Identified in <italic>C. hydrogenoformans</italic> Genome</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0010065.t003"/></table-wrap></sec><fn-group><fn id="ack1" fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing interests.</bold> The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn id="ack2" fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions.</bold> MW, FTR, and JAE conceived and designed the experiments.
