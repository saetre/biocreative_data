Peripheral oscillators are self-sustained and cell autonomous, but they have to be synchronized by the SCN to ensure phase coherence within the organism. In principle, the rhythmic expression of genes in peripheral organs could thus be driven not only by local oscillators, but also by circadian systemic signals. To discriminate between these mechanisms, we engineered a mouse strain with a conditionally active liver clock, in which REV-ERB&#x003b1; represses the transcription of the essential core clock gene <italic>Bmal1</italic> in a doxycycline-dependent manner. We examined circadian liver gene expression genome-wide in mice in which hepatocyte oscillators were either running or arrested, and found that the rhythmic transcription of most genes depended on functional hepatocyte clocks. However, we discovered 31 genes, including the core clock gene <italic>mPer2,</italic> whose expression oscillated robustly irrespective of whether the liver clock was running or not. By contrast, in liver explants cultured in vitro, circadian cycles of <italic>mPer2::luciferase</italic> bioluminescence could only be observed when hepatocyte oscillators were operational. Hence, the circadian cycles observed in the liver of intact animals without functional hepatocyte oscillators were likely generated by systemic signals. The finding that rhythmic <italic>mPer2</italic> expression can be driven by both systemic cues and local oscillators suggests a plausible mechanism for the phase entrainment of subsidiary clocks in peripheral organs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>In contrast to previously held belief, molecular circadian oscillators are not restricted to specialized pacemaker tissues, such as the brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), but exist in virtually all body cells. Although the circadian clocks operative in peripheral cell types are as robust as those residing in SCN neurons, they quickly become desynchronized in vitro due to variations in period length. Hence, in intact animals, the phase coherence between peripheral oscillators must be established by daily signals generated by the SCN master clock. Although the hierarchy between master and slave oscillators is now well established, the respective roles of these clocks in governing the circadian transcription program in a given organ have never been examined. In principle, the circadian expression of genes in a peripheral tissue could be driven either by cyclic systemic cues, by peripheral oscillators, or by both. In order to discriminate between genes regulated by local oscillators and systemic cues in liver, we generated mice in which hepatocyte clocks can be turned on and off at will. These studies suggest that 90&#x00025; of the circadian transcription program in the liver is abolished or strongly attenuated when hepatocyte clocks are turned off, indicating that the expression of most circadian liver genes is orchestrated by local cellular clocks. The remaining 10&#x00025; of cyclically expressed liver genes continue to be transcribed in a robustly circadian fashion in the absence of functional hepatocyte oscillators. These genes, which unexpectedly include the bona fide clock gene <italic>mPer2,</italic> must therefore be regulated by oscillating systemic signals, such as hormones, metabolites, or body temperature.

According to this model, the principal feedback loop is driven by the repressors PER1, PER2, CRY1, and CRY2 and the PAS-domain basic helix-loop-helix (PAS-bHLH) transcription factors BMAL1, CLOCK, and probably NPAS2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. The transcription of the repressor-encoding genes is activated by these PAS-bHLH transcription factors until the PER-CRY complexes reach critical concentrations at which they annul the transactivation potential of the PAS-bHLH proteins and thereby inhibit transcription of their own genes.

We used these mice to classify mRNAs into transcripts whose circadian accumulation in the liver do or do not require local circadian oscillators.

As mentioned above, BMAL1 is a constituent of the molecular oscillator whose loss of function immediately results in the abolishment of all manifestations of circadian physiology and gene expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. We thus thought that the conditional expression of <italic>Bmal1</italic> specifically in hepatocytes may provide such a model system. <italic>Bmal1</italic> transcription follows a high-amplitude circadian cycle, owing to the circadian accumulation of REV-ERB&#x003b1;, a nuclear orphan receptor that strongly represses <italic>Bmal1</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. We thus exploited this regulatory mechanism to produce a mouse strain with a conditionally active <italic>Bmal1</italic> gene in hepatocytes. First, a transgenic mouse strain was established in which transcription of an HA epitope-tagged REV-ERB&#x003b1; version (HA-REV-ERB&#x003b1;) is controlled by tetracycline-responsive elements (TREs). These mice were crossed with <italic>LAP-tTA</italic> mice, which express a tetracycline-dependent transactivator (tTA) specifically in hepatocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. In <italic>LAP-tTA</italic>/<italic>TRE-Rev-erb&#x003b1;</italic> double transgenic mice, HA-REV-ERB&#x003b1; accumulated to constitutively high levels and suppressed <italic>Bmal1</italic> expression throughout the day in the absence of the tetracycline analog doxycycline (Dox) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g001">Figures 1</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g001">1</xref>C &#x0005b;left panel&#x0005d;, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050034-sg001">S1</xref>). <italic>LAP-tTA</italic>/<italic>TRE-Rev-erb&#x003b1;</italic> mice thus produced HA-REV-Erb&#x003b1; in a liver-specific and tetracycline-dependent fashion. In the presence of Dox, the <italic>TRE-Rev-erb&#x003b1;</italic> transgene remained silent, and circadian oscillator function was not perturbed in liver cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g001">Figures 1</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g001">1</xref>C &#x0005b;right panel&#x0005d;, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050034-sg001">S1</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, the regulation of <italic>TRE-Rev-erb&#x003b1;</italic> transgene expression was exquisitely tight, since in Dox-fed mice, neither mRNA nor HA-REV-ERB&#x003b1; protein was detectable by Taqman RT-PCR assays and Western blot experiments, respectively. At least in part, the low levels of <italic>Bmal1</italic> mRNA and protein observed in the liver of untreated animals may have been contributed by endothelial cells, bile duct cells, or Kupffer cells, which did not express the <italic>LAP-tTA</italic> transgene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. In rat liver, nonparenchymal cells contribute about 35&#x00025; of all cells and about 10&#x00025; of the cellular hepatic volume &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, and we thus expect that around 10&#x00025; of the liver RNA is contributed by cells that do not express the <italic>LAP-tTA</italic> transgene.</p><p>We have used mice homozygous for both the <italic>LAP-tTA</italic> and <italic>TRE-Rev-erb&#x003b1;</italic> transgenes in these experiments, in order to maximize transgene expression. Double homozygous mice were born at Mendelian ratios and did not show any phenotype with regard to morphology, vigor, litter size, or circadian behavior. We also determined the integration site for both transgenes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). <italic>LAP-tTA</italic> was found to be inserted in reverse orientation into the first intron of <italic>Zfp353</italic> (Chromosome 8), more than 100 kilobases (kb) downstream of the first exon and about 200 kb upstream of the second exon. <italic>TRE-Rev-erb&#x003b1;</italic> was found to be inserted in reverse orientation into the first intron of <italic>Semaphorin3&#x0025b;</italic> (Chromosome 5), about 6 kb downstream of the first exon and more than 100 kb upstream of the second exon. We thus consider unlikely that the transgene integrations interfered with circadian clock function.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The Hepatic Expression of Putative BMAL1 Target Genes in Mice Fed with or without Dox</title><p>As would be expected for BMAL1 target genes, the expression of <italic>mPer1, Dbp,</italic> and endogenous <italic>Rev-erb&#x003b1;</italic> was low in the absence of Dox, when HA-REV-ERB&#x003b1; overexpression attenuated <italic>Bmal1</italic> transcription. Unexpectedly, however, the circadian clock genes <italic>mCry1, mCry2,</italic> and <italic>mPer2</italic> displayed milder expression differences in Dox-treated and untreated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Remarkably, the rhythmic expression of <italic>mPer2</italic> mRNA and protein levels was almost unaffected by the down-regulation of <italic>Bmal1</italic> expression. As reported previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, mCRY2 oscillated in abundance during the day despite nearly constant <italic>mCry2</italic> mRNA levels. Conceivably, the association of mCRY2 with PER proteins&#x02014;i.e., mPER2 in the absence of Dox&#x02014;affected the metabolic stability of mCRY2 in a daytime-dependent manner.</p><p>The robust circadian expression of <italic>mPer2</italic> in the liver of mice not receiving Dox is in stark contrast to the in situ hybridization experiments with coronal brain sections of <italic>Bmal1</italic>-deficient mice, which indicated that in the absence of BMAL1, <italic>mPer2</italic> mRNA accumulates to insignificant levels throughout the day in SCN neurons &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. However, it is in keeping with the relatively high constitutive <italic>mPer2</italic> mRNA concentrations observed in the liver of these <italic>Bmal1</italic> knockout mice (J. S. Takahasi, unpublished data), assuming that in liver, <italic>mPer2</italic> transcription depends less on BMAL1 than in the SCN. Nevertheless, our observation could be interpreted in two ways. Either, the residual BMAL1 levels in the liver of animals not treated with Dox were still sufficient to drive <italic>mPer2</italic> transcription, or cyclic <italic>mPer2</italic> expression was governed by oscillating systemic signals in these mice. In order to distinguish between these two scenarios, we wished to monitor temporal <italic>mPer2</italic> expression in cultured liver explants, which obviously do not receive periodic signals from a master pacemaker. To this end, we crossed <italic>LAP-tTA</italic>/<italic>TRE-Rev-erb&#x003b1;</italic> mice with <italic>mPer2::luc</italic> knock-in mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;, in which a luciferase open reading frame (ORF) was inserted by homologous recombination into the endogenous <italic>mPer2</italic> locus. The mPER2::LUCIFERASE fusion protein encoded by this knock-in allele is fully functional, since it rescues all known rhythm phenotypes of <italic>mPer2</italic> knockout mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. Tissue explants from the <italic>LAP-tTA</italic>/<italic>TRE-Rev-erb&#x003b1;</italic> transgenic mice carrying an <italic>mPer2::luc</italic> fusion allele were placed into culture medium containing luciferin, and bioluminescence was recorded in real time by photomultiplier tubes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g003">Figure 3</xref>A (top right panel), liver explants from these mice did not produce circadian luminescence cycles in normal culture medium, suggesting that overexpression of HA-REV-ERB&#x003b1; indeed arrested the hepatocyte clocks. However, when tissue pieces from the same livers were cultured in Dox-containing medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, right center and bottom panels), circadian luminescence rhythms similar to those observed for explants of <italic>mPer2::luciferase</italic> mice not carrying the <italic>LAP-tTA</italic> and <italic>TRE-Rev-erb&#x003b1;</italic> transgenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, left panels) could be observed. Interestingly, circadian luminescence cycles recorded from Dox-treated liver explants of <italic>LAP-tTA</italic>/<italic>TRE-Rev-erb&#x003b1;</italic>/<italic>mPer2::luc</italic> mice fed with normal chow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, right center panel), displayed a phase delay of approximately 6 h when compared to those obtained from liver explants of <italic>mPer2::luciferase</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, left center panel). This phase delay probably reflected the time period required for the decay of <italic>HA-Rev-erb&#x003b1;</italic> mRNA and protein, and for the consecutive accumulation of BMAL1 to levels compatible with circadian rhythm generation. In keeping with this conjecture, no significant phase differences were observed between luminescence cycles monitored for liver explants from <italic>mPer2::luc</italic> and <italic>LAP-tTA</italic>/<italic>TRE-Rev-erb&#x003b1;</italic>/<italic>mPer2::luc</italic> mice pretreated with Dox by intraperitoneal injections 48 h and 24 h before being sacrificed, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, bottom panels).

Importantly, the cyclic expression of most rhythmically active genes appeared to depend on an intact hepatocyte oscillator, as the amplitude of circadian accumulation was greatly affected in animals not receiving Dox-supplemented food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Nevertheless, using the algorithms described in Materials and Methods, we identified 31 different transcripts (represented by 41 feature sets), whose circadian accumulation was not affected by the Dox treatment. These are listed in the phase maps of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g005">Figure 5</xref>A (compare left and right panels), and the circadian expression of some of these genes in the presence and absence of Dox has been validated by Northern blot hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). As expected on the basis of the results displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <italic>mPer2</italic> mRNA was included among the transcripts whose cyclic accumulation was controlled by systemic cues. Other genes whose transcripts accumulate with phase angles similar to that of <italic>mPer2</italic> mRNA were the heat-shock protein genes <italic>Hspca</italic> (encoding HSP90), <italic>Hspa8</italic> (encoding HSP70 isoform 8), <italic>Hspa1b</italic> (encoding HSP70 isoform 1A), <italic>Hsp105</italic> (encoding HSP105), and <italic>Stip1</italic> (encoding Stress-Induced Phoshoprotein 1, also known as Hsp70/Hsp90 organizing protein), and a tubulin gene <italic>(Tuba4)</italic>. These genes were expressed in phase with <italic>mPer2,</italic> suggesting that their cyclic transcription was perhaps governed by similar systemic timing cues. <italic>Nocturnin (Ccrn4l), Fus, Chordc1,</italic> and <italic>Cirbp</italic> were additional genes whose circadian expression appeared to be system driven. However, the transcripts issued by these genes belonged to different phase clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g005">5</xref>B), and their synthesis must thus have been regulated by mechanisms different from those governing rhythmic <italic>Hsp</italic> and/or <italic>mPer2</italic> transcription. Particularly interesting was the diurnal expression of heat-shock protein genes and <italic>Cirbp,</italic> a gene encoding a cold-induced RNA-binding protein.

Hence temperature cycles oscillating by only a few degrees (35 &#x000b0;C to 38 &#x000b0;C) appeared to be translated into antiphasic <italic>Hsp</italic> and <italic>Cirbp</italic> expression cycles.</p><p>We also considered the possibility that some systemically regulated liver genes could display mRNA accumulation cycles with higher amplitudes in the absence of functional hepatocyte oscillators. For example, the accumulation of liver transcripts whose synthesis is influenced by local oscillators and systemic cues in an antiphasic manner may only be circadian in mice not containing hepatocyte clocks. However, our failure to identify such transcripts did not support such a regulatory mode (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050034-sg003">Figure S3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050034-sg003">S3</xref>B, and corresponding figure legends), we thus feel that few if any genes produce robust daily mRNA accumulation cycles only in the absence of functional hepatocyte clocks.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Temperature-Dependence of <italic>mPer2</italic> Expression</title><p>The expression of <italic>mPer2</italic> and <italic>Hsp</italic> appears to be similar with respect to systemic regulation.

Since <italic>Hsp</italic> transcription is governed primarily by heat-shock transcription factors (HSF) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;, we wondered whether <italic>mPer2</italic> transcription was also inducible by elevated temperature. In order to examine this conjecture, we incubated cultured organ explants from <italic>LAP-tTA</italic>/<italic>TRE-Rev-erb&#x003b1;</italic>/<italic>mPer2::luc</italic> mice during 150 min at 40 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g006">Figure 6</xref>) and recorded bioluminescence in real time. Although luciferase activity was somewhat decreased during the heat shock itself, presumably due to a general inhibition of translation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;, a subsequent strong increase in luciferase activity was observed in both liver and lung. Liver explants cultured in the absence of Dox showed a consistent 2-fold enhancement of luciferase activity, suggesting that the heat-dependent regulation of <italic>mPer2</italic> did not require a circadian clock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). Lung explants, in which circadian oscillators are operative under these conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g003">Figures 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050034-sg002">S2</xref>B), displayed a phase-specific induction of temperature-induced luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Thus, when the heat shock was performed at a circadian time at which luciferase activity was minimal, a strong induction was observed. On the other hand, a heat shock performed at a circadian time when luciferase activity was maximal did not result in a noteworthy increase in luciferase activity. Taken together, these results indicate that <italic>mPer2</italic> is heat inducible and that the strength of this induction is gated by circadian time.</p><p>The minimal HSF binding sites (heat-shock elements &#x0005b;HSEs&#x0005d;) consist of two or more inverted or everted repeats of the pentameric sequence 5&#x02032;-NGAAN-3&#x02032; (where N can be any nucleotide). Taking the two complementary DNA strands into consideration, the statistical frequency of HSEs is approximately 1/2,000 in random DNA, and it is thus impossible to identify functional HSEs solely by sequence inspection. Nevertheless, known functional HSEs are located within 5&#x02032;-flanking regions of heat-shock protein genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;, and the sequence analysis of <italic>mPer2</italic> revealed a cluster of five HSEs within the 1,700 base pairs (bp) located upstream of the transcription initiation site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050034-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Of note, one of these elements (centered around &#x02212;1,630) lies within a 22-bp sequence block that is 100&#x00025; identical in mouse, rat, human, and dog (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050034-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Whether this or any other HSEs displayed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050034-sg004">Figure S4</xref> are involved in the temperature-regulation of <italic>mPer2</italic> will have to be examined by site-directed mutagenesis and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We generated a mouse model system in which hepatocyte circadian oscillators can be attenuated in a conditional fashion. The system is based on the tetracycline-dependent, liver-specific overexpression of the nuclear orphan receptor REV-Erb&#x003b1;, a potent repressor of the essential clock gene <italic>Bmal1</italic>. Thus, when the tetracycline analog doxycycline was omitted from the food, REV-ERB&#x003b1; accumulated to high levels throughout the day and thereby inhibited <italic>Bmal1</italic> transcription constitutively in <italic>LAP-tTA</italic>/<italic>TRE-Rev-erb&#x003b1;</italic> mice. As a consequence, the expression of obligatory <italic>Bmal1</italic> target genes was decreased to a level that no longer supports local oscillator function. When doxycycline was added to the food, the <italic>Rev-erb&#x003b1;</italic> transgene was silenced, and hepatocyte oscillator function was reestablished in <italic>LAP-tTA</italic>/<italic>TRE-Rev-erb&#x003b1;</italic> mice.</p><p>By using this novel mouse model, we were able to discriminate between genes whose cyclic expression is driven either by local hepatocyte oscillators or by systemic circadian cues that are controlled directly or indirectly by the SCN. The transcription of liver genes whose expression displayed daily oscillations in <italic>LAP-tTA</italic>/<italic>TRE-Rev-erb&#x003b1;</italic> mice despite arrested hepatocyte clocks are likely under the control of physical and/or chemical cues whose systemic rhythms are driven by the central SCN pacemaker. Such systemically regulated genes are expected to include genes involved in the synchronization of hepatocyte clocks. Genome-wide profiling of the liver circadian transcriptome of <italic>LAP-tTA</italic>/<italic>TRE-Rev-erb&#x003b1;</italic> mice fed with Dox-supplemented chow revealed about 350 transcripts with robust circadian accumulation. Less than 10&#x00025; of these transcripts displayed rhythmic accumulation with high amplitude and magnitude in mice fed with normal chow, suggesting that the cyclic transcription of most circadian genes is influenced by local oscillators. We cannot formally exclude that the cyclic expression of some of the genes resilient to HA-REV-ERB&#x003b1; overexpression was driven by a second, yet unknown and BMAL1-independent oscillator. However, this hypothesis clearly did not apply to <italic>mPer2,</italic> since mPER2::LUC expression ceased to be rhythmic in liver explants not treated with Dox. We thus consider it more likely that the rhythmic expression of genes in the absence of Dox was governed by systemic cues, which were directly or indirectly controlled by the master pacemaker in the SCN. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g007">Figure 7</xref>, the system-driven circadian expression of <italic>mPer2</italic> is of particular interest with regard to the entrainment of the peripheral oscillators by SCN-borne timing cues. The oscillatory mechanism that is at the center of the circadian clock is thought to involve a negative feedback of CRYs and PERs on their own transcription. An externally driven <italic>mPer2</italic> transcription cycle would thus gate the phase of the peripheral clock to that of the systemic signals. Indeed, the system-driven expression of <italic>mPer2</italic> provides a direct link between circadian systemic signals and the phase of peripheral oscillators. Although the molecular mechanisms responsible for system-driven <italic>mPer2</italic> transcription remain to be identified, the observation that many heat-shock protein genes were found to be expressed in phase with <italic>mPer2</italic> suggests that the cyclic transcription of <italic>mPer2</italic> and <italic>Hsp</italic> genes shares certain regulatory mechanisms. Of note, real-time bioluminescence recordings of mPer2::luc-expressing liver and lung explants exposed to a heat shock showed that <italic>mPer2</italic> transcription can indeed be influenced by temperature. Moreover, the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of <italic>mPer2</italic> harbors five heat-shock response elements (HSEs) within 1,700 bp, of which one is 100&#x00025; identical in mouse, rat, man, and dog. The identification of the physiologically relevant HSEs within the <italic>mPer2</italic> gene will be particularly important, since the activity of HSF1 can also be influenced by chemical cues (e.g., oxidants) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. As feeding cycles are the most dominant Zeitgebers for peripheral clocks thus far identified, it is tempting to speculate that HSF1 senses rhythmic metabolism and thereby synchronizes peripheral clocks by gating <italic>mPer2</italic> expression.</p><p>Similar to certain nuclear hormone receptors, HSF1 forms functionally inert cytoplasmic complexes with chaperones and co-chaperones in the absence of activating cues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Upon exposure to elevated temperature, oxidative stress, heavy metals, or endobiotic substances (e.g., arachidonic acid), HSF1 gets activated in multiple consecutive steps &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. These comprise: release from chaperones and co-chaperones, trimerization via an unmasked coiled-coil domain, binding to its cognate DNA sequences in regulatory regions of target genes, and stimulation of the transactivation potential via the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CAMKII)-mediated phosphorylation of a serine residue within the HSF1 regulatory domain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Of note, <italic>CamkIIb</italic> mRNA is among the transcripts whose diurnal accumulation is governed by systemic cues and whose phase is in keeping with a role of CAMKIIb in the circadian activation of HSF1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). In addition, CAMKIIb might also participate in the synchronization of peripheral clocks by a more direct mechanism. Thus, in fruit fly cells, CAMKII phosphorylates CLK, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of CLOCK, and in cotransfection experiments. this enhances the stimulation of CLK-CYC target genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p><italic>Nocturnin</italic> and <italic>Cirbp</italic> are two systemically driven genes encoding proteins potentially involved in mRNA metabolism and/or activity. Nocturnin, the vertebrate homolog of yeast CCR4, is an mRNA deadenylase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d; with rhythmic expression in many mouse tissues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. As both mRNA stability and translation efficiency can depend on poly(A) length, Nocturnin could influence the rhythmic accumulation of circadian proteins by post-transcriptional mechanisms. Likewise, CIRBP, a nuclear, ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;, could affect the cyclic accumulation or translation of target mRNAs in a temperature-dependent fashion, as diurnal <italic>Cirbp</italic> expression correlates negatively with body temperature rhythms. In addition, CIRBP has been demonstrated to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in NIH3T3 fibroblasts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. Similar to CAMKII, <italic>Drosophila</italic> ERK2 can phosphorylate CLK and thereby increase the transactivation potential of this transcription factor. <italic>Cirbp</italic> mRNA and protein levels have previously been found to oscillate in brain, but not in liver &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. However, in the latter tissue, the accumulation of <italic>Cirbp</italic> transcripts has been determined only for two time points, and the cyclic accumulation of <italic>Cirbp</italic> mRNA in liver (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g005">Figure 5</xref>B) may thus have escaped this analysis. The similarly high amplitude of diurnal <italic>Cirbp</italic> mRNA accumulation in brain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d; and liver (this study) is somewhat surprising. In fact, most brain areas display much shallower accumulation cycles for clock and clock-controlled mRNAs than the liver. For example, circadian <italic>mPer1</italic> and <italic>Dbp</italic> mRNA levels oscillate about 13-fold and 100-fold, respectively, in liver, but only about 1.4-fold and 2-fold, respectively, in brain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. The low-amplitude rhythms in the latter tissue may be the consequence of an incomplete phase entrainment of local oscillators in brain neurons by the SCN, perhaps because the transport of chemical timing cues across the blood-brain barrier is inefficient. The high amplitude of <italic>Cirbp</italic> expression in the brain may thus be caused by daily temperature fluctuations, which have similar amplitudes in the brain and peripheral organs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In conclusion, we have established a transgenic mouse model that allowed us to study rhythmic liver gene expression genome-wide in the presence and absence of functional hepatocyte oscillators. The identification of genes whose amplitude and phase are nearly identical under these two conditions revealed possible mechanisms by which peripheral oscillators could be entrained. The observation that in liver the circadian expression of <italic>mPer2</italic> can be governed by both systemic cues and hepatocyte oscillators provides a plausible mechanism for the phase entrainment of molecular oscillators in peripheral tissues. Strikingly, heat-induced and cold-induced genes were also identified among the genes whose rhythmic expression is driven by systemic cues.

We feel confident that the in-depth analysis of <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements and transcription factors participating in the systemic control of circadian gene transcription will provide valuable information on the phase-entrainment pathways operative in peripheral tissues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of <italic>TRE-Rev-erb&#x003b1;</italic> transgenic mice.</title><p><italic>TRE-Rev-erb&#x003b1;</italic> mice were generated by pronuclear injection as described in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;.

Mice were sacrificed by decapitation. The inferior vena cava was cut, and ice-cold Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Sigma Cat no. H1641; St. Louis, Missouri, United States) was perfused through the spleen in order to remove blood and refrigerate the liver. Tissue pieces were removed, placed into ice-cold HBSS, and sliced into smaller fragments (volume approximately 10 mm<sup>3</sup>). These tissue pieces were then placed on glass fiber filters in 35-mm tissue culture dishes containing 1.2&#x02013;1.5 ml of HEPES-buffered phenol red-free DMEM (GIBCO Cat no. 1741; San Diego, California, United States) supplemented with 5&#x00025; fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100-U/ml penicillin,100-&#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin, and 0.1 mM luciferin. Only distal edges of the liver lobes were used, since they gave more reproducible and persistent cycles, perhaps owing to their favorable surface/volume ratio. When relevant, Dox was added to a final concentration of 10 &#x003bc;g/ml. Cultures were maintained at 37 &#x000b0;C in a light-tight incubator, and bioluminescence was monitored continuously using Hamamatsu photomultiplier tubes (PMT; Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Photon counts were integrated over 1-min intervals. Dox pretreatment of animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050034-g003">Figure 3</xref>) consisted of two intraperitoneal injections of 2-mg Dox in PBS. Temperature variations in tissue explant cultures were generated using homemade programmable heating chambers.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Microarray hybridization.</title><p>Thirty-six male mice double homozygous for the two transgenes fed with normal chow and an equal number of mice fed with Dox-supplemented chow were maintained on an LD12:12 light cycle and were used for these experiments. Six animals each for Dox-treated and untreated mice were sacrificed at ZT00, ZT04, ZT08, ZT12, ZT16, and ZT20, and whole-cell liver RNA was extracted from each animal. RNA pools of three male animals were assembled by mixing equal amounts of RNA. This resulted in 12 temporally staged RNA pools representing two entire days. A total of 5 &#x003bc;g of pooled RNA was used for the synthesis of biotinylated cRNA; 8.75 &#x003bc;g of biotinylated cRNA was then hybridized to 24 mouse Affymetrix 430 2.0 chips containing 45,000 feature sets and representing 39,000 genes, using standard Affymetrix protocols. The chips were washed and scanned, and the fluorescence signals were analyzed with the RMAexpress software using Robust Multi-array Analysis (RMA) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The data thus obtained were used for a Fourier transform analysis, and the ratio of the F<sub>24</sub> spectral power to the sum of the other Fourier components (i.e., &#x0221e;, 48, 12, 9.6, and 8 h) was calculated for each feature set &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;. The time points were then permuted 50,000 times, and for each of the permutations, the Fourier transform was calculated together with the ratio of the F<sub>24</sub> Fourier component to the other components &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050034-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;. Expression data were fitted to a cosine curve. Temporal mRNA accumulation was considered as circadian if its amplitude was higher than 2-fold and if the ratio of the unscrambled Fourier transform was within the top 5&#x00025; of the scrambled ratios. In order to find circadian genes unaffected by Dox treatment, we calculated a divergence <italic>(D)</italic> coefficient as follows: <disp-formula id="pbio-0050034-e001"><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0050034.e001.jpg" position="anchor" mimetype="image"/></disp-formula>where ZT0:ZT44 represents the hybridization signal for the specified time points. We did not apply any filter for &#x0201c;presence&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;absence&#x0201d; flags (as determined by the MAS Affymetrix software), since 95&#x00025; of the hybridization signals obtained for the 432 feature sets that we qualified as circadian by Fourier transform analysis scored as &#x0201c;present&#x0201d; in more than 12 experiments out of 24 by the MAS software. By comparison, only 35&#x00025; of total (circadian and non-circadian) features sets were considered as present in at least 12 experiments. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"
