In the fungal kingdom, light can regulate growth, the direction of growth, asexual and sexual reproduction, and pigment formation, all of which are important aspects for the survival and dissemination of fungal species. These processes have negative implications to many aspects of human life, as the uncontrolled proliferation of fungi can lead to devastating plant disease, mold, and human disease. On the other hand, fungi are essential for recycling nutrients in the environment, in mycorrhizal interactions with plants, and as a source of food and pharmaceutical metabolites for humans. Understanding the role of environmental signals in fungal development is vital to increase the benefits and decrease the costs that fungi present. Despite the importance of light to fungal development, much has yet to be determined to illuminate the mechanisms fungi use to perceive and respond to light.</p><p>The effects of light have been investigated in model fungal species. While spectral analyses and the morphological effects of light have been well characterized in genera such as <italic>Coprinus</italic> (a basidiomycete) or <italic>Phycomyces</italic> (a zygomycete), at the molecular level <named-content content-type="genus-species">Neurospora crassa</named-content> (an ascomycete) is best understood based on the functions of the <italic>white collar</italic> (<italic>wc-1</italic> and <italic>wc-2</italic>) genes in light sensing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b03">3</xref>]. In <italic>N. crassa,</italic> blue light regulates induction of carotenoid pigment production, protoperithecia (sexual fruiting body) formation and phototropism of perithecial beaks, and circadian rhythm, all of which are abolished by mutations in <italic>wc-1</italic> or <italic>wc-2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b04">4</xref>]. These two genes encode proteins with several conserved domains, including a zinc finger DNA binding domain found in both proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b07">7</xref>]. The two proteins physically interact through PAS (conserved in Per, Arnt, Sim proteins) domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b10">10</xref>]. The WC-1 protein functions as the blue light receptor through a specialized PAS domain responsible for sensing light, oxygen, and voltage in other proteins (LOV domain), and, together with WC-2, acts as a transcription factor. The WC-1 protein interacts with a flavin chromophore [flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)] to function as the blue light receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b12">12</xref>]. A small protein, VIVID, also perceives blue light through a LOV domain and modulates <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. crassa</named-content> sensitivity to light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b13">13</xref>]. <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. crassa</named-content> has an additional four candidate photoactive protein homologs whose functions in photoperception remain elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b15">15</xref>].</p><p>We set out to identify genes involved in the process by which light inhibits mating of the basidiomycete <named-content content-type="genus-species">Cryptococcus neoformans</named-content>. In nature, cryptococcal varieties are associated with bird excreta, soil, tree hollows, and even caves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b17">17</xref>]. Thus, the light stimuli studied under laboratory conditions are highly relevant to the varying light signals the fungus experiences in the wild. <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> exists as a haploid yeast with two bipolar mating types (<bold>a</bold> and &#x003b1;). MAT<bold>a</bold> and MAT&#x003b1; cells fuse to form a dikaryotic hypha that terminates in a basidium in which nuclear fusion and meiosis occur, producing four long chains of haploid basidiospores by mitosis and budding. A similar process, known as haploid or monokaryotic fruiting, can occur with only one mating partner that also gives rise to filaments that terminate in basidium-like structures and produce short spore chains. Spores have been implicated as an infectious propagule, further underscoring the importance of understanding the regulatory processes governing basidiospore production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b19">19</xref>]. Mating and fruiting are controlled in the laboratory by stimuli such as the presence of potential mating partners (via pheromone signaling), nutrient limitation, desiccation, temperature, and light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b19">19</xref>]. Many aspects of the transduction pathways for these signals have been elucidated, particularly in response to pheromones and nutrient limitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b20">20</xref>], but no components of light signaling had been reported to date for this important human pathogen. We identify here two genes required for <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> responses to light, and demonstrate their role in blue light regulation of development and sensitivity to UV light, and their requirement for full virulence of this pathogen in a mammalian host.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> Expresses Three Candidate Photoreceptors That Could Regulate Development</title><p>Mating and fruiting of <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> can be variable during culturing. Previous work in our laboratory and others has endeavored to find environmental factors that lead to this variation.

Under these conditions, light inhibited both mating and haploid fruiting of <italic>C. neoformans,</italic> thereby ruling out any effects of plate-sealing on CO<sub>2</sub> levels or desiccation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030095-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030095-g001">1</xref>B).</p><p>In a candidate gene approach, the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> genome was searched for homologs of fungal genes implicated in light signaling or transduction: <italic>wc-1</italic> and <italic>wc-2, opsin, phytochrome, cryptochrome, vivid, frequency,</italic> and <italic>photolyase</italic>. Unambiguous matches were obtained to <italic>opsin</italic> (<italic>OPS1;</italic> GenBank AY882440), <italic>phytochrome</italic> (<italic>PHY1;</italic> GenBank AY882439), and <italic>white collar 1</italic> (<italic>BWC1;</italic> GenBank AY882437), and transcription of these genes was confirmed by RT-PCR. Opsins are a class of seven-transmembrane proteins that bind retinal via a conserved lysine residue to form ion pumps or light receptors in animals and Archaea. Opsins have been identified in the genomes of a number of fungi, but as yet have no known function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b24">24</xref>]. Phytochromes are histidine or serine/threonine kinase red/far-red light receptors identified in plants, and more recently in bacteria (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b25">25</xref>]). Two phytochrome homologs have been noted in the genome of <italic>N. crassa,</italic> but also have as yet no known function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b14">14</xref>]. The predicted <italic>wc-1</italic> homolog contains a LOV domain, two additional PAS domains, and a nuclear localization signal. In contrast to the <italic>N. crassa wc-1</italic> gene, the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> homolog has no DNA binding domain; our designation of the gene as <italic>Basidiomycete White Collar 1 (BWC1)</italic> is meant to reflect this unique structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title><italic>BWC1</italic> Mediates Inhibition of Mating by Light</title><p>The three putative photoreceptor genes were mutated in a <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> var. <italic>neoformans</italic> (serotype D) strain by replacing the coding region with the <italic>URA5</italic> gene. Single-, double-, and triple-mutant strains were isolated following genetic crosses to test for possible redundant functions in light sensing. The abilities to mate and to haploid-fruit in the light and dark were examined by monitoring the production of filaments. There was no effect on mating or fruiting in strains with the opsin <italic>ops1</italic> or phytochrome <italic>phy1</italic> mutations, either alone or in combination (unpublished data). In contrast, <italic>bwc1</italic> mutants were insensitive to light. All crosses in which both mating partners (bilateral crosses) carried the <italic>bwc1</italic> deletion showed equivalent mating in the light and the dark, as assessed by the production of filaments after 24 h and 48 h, while in strains with a wild-type copy of <italic>BWC1,</italic> light reduced mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030095-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). In unilateral crosses, i.e., in which a <italic>bwc1</italic> mutant strain was crossed to wild type, only a very modest increase in filamentation in the light was observed relative to crosses between two wild-type parents. The <italic>bwc1</italic> mutant strains exhibited more haploid fruiting in the presence of light compared to <italic>BWC1</italic> wild-type strains, and a somewhat higher level of fruiting in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030095-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Reintroduction of a wild-type copy of <italic>BWC1</italic> into a <italic>bwc1</italic> mutant strain restored the inhibition of mating and fruiting by light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030095-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, of the three candidate photoreceptor genes identified, <italic>BWC1</italic> functions in the control of mating and fruiting by light, whereas <italic>OPS1</italic> and <italic>PHY1</italic> do not.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title><italic>BWC1</italic> Controls Cell Fusion and Filament Development</title><p>Because filament formation is a qualitative rather than a quantitive phenotype, auxotrophic derivatives of <italic>BWC1</italic> wild-type and <italic>bwc1</italic> mutant strains were created, and cell fusion was assayed quantitatively; fusion of two auxotrophic parents (<italic>ade2</italic> or <italic>lys1</italic>) yields prototrophic dikaryotic or diploid strains that can grow on medium lacking adenine and lysine. By this assay, fusion of <italic>bwc1</italic> mutant or wild-type strains was equivalent in the dark.

The <italic>bwc1</italic>/<italic>bwc1</italic> mutant strain filamented equally well in the light and the dark, whereas filament development was reduced in the wild-type diploid strain in the light (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030095-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). The filamentation of strains heterozygous at the <italic>BWC1</italic> locus was inhibited by light, indicating that the <italic>bwc1</italic> mutation is recessive (unpublished data). These results demonstrate that <italic>BWC1</italic> functions in light responses at both the initial cell fusion step and during subsequent filament formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Blue Light Inhibition of Cell Fusion Requires <italic>BWC1</italic></title><p>To determine the approximate wavelengths of light that inhibit mating of <italic>C. neoformans,</italic> cell fusion was assayed during growth under colored filters at 24 and 48 h. In four independent experiments, blue light was sufficient to inhibit cell fusion, whereas green or red wavelengths had little or no effect (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030095-g002">Figure 2</xref>B for a representative experiment). In all crosses, only one mating parent required a <italic>bwc1</italic> mutant allele to escape the inhibition of cell fusion by light.

The <italic>ops1</italic> and <italic>phy1</italic> mutant strains were as sensitive to UV light as wild type, but the <italic>bwc1</italic> mutants were markedly hypersensitive to UV light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030095-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Reintroduction of a wild-type copy of the <italic>BWC1</italic> gene into the <italic>bwc1</italic> mutant strain restored a wild-type level of sensitivity to UV light. Based on studies in other organisms, one target gene could be that encoding photolyase. However, there is no evidence for a photolyase in <italic>C. neoformans,</italic> based on the lack of photoreactivation and the absence of a homolog in genome databases (unpublished data). We conclude that Bwc1 functions in response to blue light to inhibit mating, and to UV light to regulate resistance to UV irradiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title><italic>BWC1</italic> Function Is Conserved between Two Varieties of <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content></title><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> is a species complex of three divergent varieties or sibling species. <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> var. <italic>neoformans</italic> (serotype D), utilized in the experiments described thus far, is commonly studied because of the ready availability of established congenic mating partners. However, this variety is uncommon in clinical settings (representing only 5% of cases), and we therefore re-isolated the <italic>bwc1, ops1,</italic> and <italic>phy1</italic> mutations in the most common pathogenic type, <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> var. <italic>grubii</italic> (serotype A), in which congenic strains have only recently been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b26">26</xref>]. Mating of serotype A laboratory strains is less efficient than that of the congenic serotype D strains, and their growth in the light is limited on the V8 (pH 5) medium used for genetic crosses. Serotype A <italic>bwc1</italic> bilateral crosses mated better in the dark than wild-type strains. Crosses performed in the light rarely resulted in filaments and were observed to do so only in the <italic>bwc1</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>bwc1</italic> mutant bilateral crosses (unpublished data). Using V8 (pH 7) medium and the serotype D <italic>bwc1</italic> strains as mating type tester strains, the effects of light on mating efficiency of serotype A could be more readily established. When crossed to serotype D <italic>bwc1</italic> strains, wild-type serotype A strains yielded fewer filaments than the <italic>bwc1</italic> mutant strains in both the light and dark, demonstrating a role for suppression of filament formation by <italic>BWC1</italic> under both conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030095-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). The serotype A <italic>bwc1</italic> strains were also found to be hypersensitive to UV light (unpublished data). Reintroduction of the serotype A <italic>BWC1</italic> gene complemented the mutant phenotypes of both the serotype A and D <italic>bwc1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030095-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030095-g003">3</xref>). In summary, <italic>BWC1</italic> function is conserved in two divergent cryptococcal varieties, and data derived from experiments on laboratory strains are also of significance to clinical isolates.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Insertional Mutagenesis of a Novel Self-Filamentous Haploid Strain Identifies Other Components Required for Light Responses</title><p>In contrast to the <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. crassa</named-content> WC-1 protein, the predicted <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> Bwc1 protein has no zinc finger DNA binding domain or any other known DNA binding motif.

The proteins share a similar structure with regard to the PAS domains, and all of the ascomycete <italic>wc-1</italic> genes examined contained a zinc finger DNA binding domain, whereas none of the basidiomycete <italic>wc-1</italic> homologs encode products with this domain. This suggests that the structural differences between the homologs are conserved in each phylum and are not unique to <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content>.</p><p>We hypothesized that Bwc1 binds to an interacting DNA binding protein, because Bwc1 would be unable to act as a transcription factor on its own. Systematic deletion of all of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> transcription factors, assuming these were annotated, is not technically feasible at this stage. Similarly, standard insertional mutagenesis poses a problem because the filamentation phenotype requires that both the MAT<bold>a</bold> and MAT&#x003b1; mating partners bear the same mutation. However, overexpression of a mating type-specific homeodomain protein in a haploid strain of the opposite mating type confers a self-filamentous morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b27">27</xref>]. We reasoned that such a self-filametous strain could be employed to perform random insertional mutagenesis, and devised a screen to identify the hypothetical protein interacting with Bwc1. The <italic>SXI1&#x003b1;</italic> gene, which encodes the MAT&#x003b1;-specific homeodomain protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b27">27</xref>], was introduced into the genome of a MAT<bold>a</bold> haploid strain. The resulting MAT<bold>a</bold> +<italic>SXI1&#x003b1;</italic> strain (AI49) exhibited self-filamentous growth that was regulated by temperature, light, and nutrients. The strain grew as a budding yeast at 37 &#x000b0;C and filamented at 25 &#x000b0;C, and, like MAT<bold>a</bold>/MAT&#x003b1; diploids, filamentation was inhibited by light, and was most robust on V8 mating medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030095-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).</p><p>The self-filamentous MAT<bold>a</bold> +<italic>SXI1</italic>&#x003b1; haploid strain was mutated with transfer DNA (T-DNA) containing a nourseothricin resistance cassette using the trans-kingdom DNA delivery vehicle <named-content content-type="genus-species">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</named-content>. Then 2,715 individual mutant strains were isolated into 96-well microtiter plates and were analyzed with a stereomicroscope to examine filament formation after 24 and 48 h of growth in the dark and light on V8 agar medium. Three strains were isolated from this mutant library with a phenotype analogous to the <italic>bwc1</italic> mutant in that they filamented equally well in the light and dark and were UV-hypersensitive. The DNA regions flanking the T-DNA insertion were obtained by inverse PCR and compared to the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> genome database. One insertion (strain 1B4) is in a predicted gene with no database similarities (GenBank EAL21986). This gene was also identified in an independent insertion mutant with a different phenotype, and was therefore not analyzed further. The second isolate (28H3) bears an insertion in the promoter of the <italic>RUM1<bold>a</bold></italic> gene, which is located in the mating type locus of <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b28">28</xref>]. Intriguingly, the <italic>Ustilago maydis RUM1</italic> homolog regulates transcription of the bE and bW homeodomain proteins, as well as of genes regulated by the bE/bW homeodomain complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b29">29</xref>]. The third isolate (25F8) contains an insertion in the promoter of a gene, designated <italic>BWC2</italic> (for a consistent nomenclature with respect to <italic>BWC1;</italic> GenBank AY882438), which encodes a predicted protein with a PAS and a zinc finger DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030095-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Importantly, the predicted structure of the Bwc2 protein is strikingly similar to that of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. crassa</named-content> WC-2 protein, which does not perceive photons directly but instead interacts physically with the light sensor WC-1 and acts as a transcription factor.

Attempts to demonstrate Bwc1-Bwc2 interaction in <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> itself via coimmunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged forms of Bwc1 and Bwc2 have been unsuccessful so far, due to the low abundance of the proteins, cross-reactivity of the antibodies with endogenous fungal proteins, and loss-of-function of tagged proteins in strains overexpressing these proteins (unpublished data).

Two approaches were employed to identify genes regulating these responses to light. First, we examined the genome of <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> to identify homologs of genes involved in light perception in other organisms. Second, we designed a novel strategy to identify genes regulating sexual differentiation, and used a self-filamentous haploid strain in an insertional mutagenesis screen to define novel genes with roles in light responses.</p><p><italic>Opsin, phytochrome,</italic> and white collar 1 homologs were found in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> genome, and the function of these candidate photoreceptors was examined by gene disruption. No phenotypes were conferred by the <italic>ops1</italic> or <italic>phy1</italic> mutations, but deletion of the <italic>wc-1</italic> homolog <italic>BWC1</italic> abolished the inhibition of mating and haploid fruiting by light. The <italic>bwc1</italic> mutant phenotypes in the clinical background were generally equivalent to those observed in serotype D; however, in the serotype A crosses with the <italic>bwc1</italic> mutants, it was clear that mating inhibition occurred with a wild-type copy of <italic>BWC1</italic> regardless of the light status. In serotype D, inhibition of mating by light was shown to occur at both the cell fusion and the hyphal developmental stages. Cell fusion assays revealed that only one parent requires a <italic>bwc1</italic> mutation to circumvent repression by light, and the release from light repression in fusion is equivalent between unilateral (<italic>bwc1</italic> &#x000d7; wild type) and bilateral (<italic>bwc1</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>bwc1</italic>) crosses. This observation suggests that during mating only one cell, independent of mating type, needs to commit to fusion. Because a wild-type level of fusion was observed in unilateral crosses, rather than an expected 50% reduction, there must also be cross-talk between the two cells prior to fusion, which is probably mediated via pheromone sensing. Analysis of diploid strains showed that once cell fusion has occurred, the wild-type Bwc1 allele of the protein has sufficient activity, even in the heterozygous state, to repress filament formation in the presence of light to a level equivalent to that observed in wild-type diploid strains.</p><p>In an assay for the wavelength responsible for inhibition of cell fusion, blue light (rather than green or red wavelengths) was found to reduce fusion efficiency between strains with an intact copy of <italic>BWC1</italic>. No inhibition by white or blue light was observed during fusion of <italic>bwc1</italic> mutant strains. These data lead us to hypothesize that Bwc1 functions as a blue light photoreceptor, as is the case for <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. crassa</named-content> WC-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b12">12</xref>]. To test this hypothesis, we initiated efforts to analyze the photochemistry of Bwc1. However, recombinant Bwc1 or fragments of Bwc1 expressed in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> cells were either produced in low quantities or were largely insoluble (unpublished data), and thus formal demonstration of photoreceptor function for Bwc1 remains to be established.</p><p>The <italic>bwc1</italic> mutants were also hypersensitive to UV light, showing that the Bwc1 protein functions in response to both blue (approximately 400&#x02013;500 nm) and UV light (approximately 200&#x02013;400 nm) wavelengths. The ability of blue or UV light to induce carotenoid formation in <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. crassa</named-content> was first noted a century ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b30">30</xref>]. Subsequent work has focused on light in the blue wavelengths, which is sensible given that any study on UV light and its regulation of fungal development is likely to be complicated by the effects this radiation has on cell viability and media stability. Nevertheless, there is evidence that <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. crassa</named-content> also perceives UV light through WC-1. Prior to cloning the <italic>wc-1</italic> gene, the spectra for inhibition of circadian rhythm and for photoinduction of carotenoid production were found to lie in both the UV and blue wavelengths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b32">32</xref>]. Light treatment of <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. crassa</named-content> changes the light absorbance properties of mycelia, and the action spectrum of this response is within both the UV and blue wavelengths and closely overlaps that of flavins, with respective peaks at 360 and 470 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b33">33</xref>]. In particular, the action spectra from physiological data overlap with the properties of the WC-1 protein purified from <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. crassa</named-content> cells, as WC-1-FAD or the chromophore FAD alone show two equal excitation peaks, one at 370 nm (UV) and one at 450 nm (blue) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b12">12</xref>]. These data suggest that <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. crassa</named-content> WC-1 may also be a UV-responsive protein and function like <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> in protecting the fungus from UV damage. The induction of UV-protecting carotenoids in <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. crassa</named-content> by light in a WC-1-dependent manner supports this hypothesis. Nevertheless, a UV-sensing function for the White collar proteins remains to be demonstrated through analysis of protein photochemistry and spectral and phenotypic analysis.</p><p>The predicted Bwc1 protein lacks a DNA binding domain found in the ascomycete WC-1 homologs. We hypothesized that there must be a second protein that interacts with Bwc1, and set out to identify this component via random insertional mutagenesis. To create a haploid self-filamentous strain of <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content>, we expressed the MAT-specific Sxi1&#x003b1; homeodomain protein in a MAT<bold>a</bold> haploid cell, resulting in robust induction of filament development. The self-filamentous strain was mutated with T-DNA insertions from <italic>Agrobacterium,</italic> and three mutant <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> strains with equivalent filament formation in the light and the dark, and UV hypersensitivity, were isolated. In one strain, the T-DNA insertion lies in the promoter of a gene we designated <italic>BWC2</italic>, which has an analogous structure to the <italic>N. crassa wc-2</italic> gene (a PAS domain and zinc finger DNA binding domain) but shares much less sequence similarity relative to that between <italic>C. neoformans BWC1</italic> and <italic>N. crassa wc-1</italic>. The <italic>BWC2</italic> gene was not found in the initial candidate gene search because of this low sequence similarity and because the intron structure of <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> confounded its identity. The <italic>BWC2</italic> gene was mutated to analyze its function. The <italic>bwc2</italic> and <italic>bwc1 bwc2</italic> double mutants exhibit phenotypes comparable to <italic>bwc1</italic> single mutants, and were nonresponsive to light during mating and haploid fruiting and hypersensitive to UV irradiation, suggesting they function in the same pathway. Furthermore, Bwc1 and Bwc2 interact in the yeast two-hybrid system, supporting a model in which the two proteins represent the integral components of a regulatory complex controlling light-regulated development.</p><p>The mating type loci of basidiomycetes have been well studied, and comprise two distinct gene sets: those that encode pheromones and those that encode homeodomain proteins, both of which control different steps in mating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b35">35</xref>]. We hypothesized that transcription of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> pheromone or homeodomain genes would be controlled via Bwc1-Bwc2. We focused on the pheromone genes, because they are important cell-cell signaling molecules, and because <italic>mf&#x003b1;1,2,3</italic> triple-mutant strains exhibit a reduction in fusion efficiency similar to that seen in <italic>bwc1</italic> mutant strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b21">21</xref>]. In <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. crassa</named-content>, transcription of the pheromone genes is under control of the circadian clock and presumably <italic>wc-1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b36">36</xref>]. The mating type specific homeodomain protein Sxi1&#x003b1; of <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> is important for events after cell fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b27">27</xref>]. Examination of the transcription of <italic>MF&#x003b1;1</italic> and <italic>SXI1&#x003b1;</italic> in the light and dark in wild type compared to <italic>bwc1</italic> or <italic>bwc2</italic> crosses at 24 h showed that the <italic>MF&#x003b1;1</italic> and <italic>SXI1&#x003b1;</italic> genes are repressed by Bwc1-Bwc2 in the light. It is therefore likely that Bwc1-Bwc2 control mating by influencing the temporal regulation of these genes.</p><p>The roles of the <italic>C. neoformans BWC1</italic> and <italic>BWC2</italic> genes in virulence were examined. We hypothesized that the fungus may be able to sense darkness within the mammalian host and use this as a signal (possibly via Bwc1-Bwc2) to induce virulence. We also tested virulence, because several signal transduction pathways affecting <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> mating also have an impact on virulence. Disruption of both <italic>BWC1</italic> and <italic>BWC2</italic> reduced the ability of <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> to cause disease, as mice infected with the <italic>bwc1</italic> or <italic>bwc2</italic> mutant strains survived twice as long as those infected with wild-type or control strains. The Bwc1-Bwc2 system represents a novel class of protein complex that is required for cellular responses to an environmental stimulus and affects both development (mating) and virulence in pathogenic fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b20">20</xref>]. In contrast to the cAMP signaling and calcineurin pathways, where mutants have reduced mating efficiency and virulence, here the <italic>bwc1</italic> and <italic>bwc2</italic> mutants have enhanced mating yet reduced virulence. In <italic>bwc1</italic> or <italic>bwc2</italic> strains there was no reduction in those traits normally associated with <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> virulence, such as production of melanin or capsule, or growth at 37 &#x000b0;C or on minimal media. Identification of the downstream targets for this complex should further elucidate the molecular basis for its role in both mating and virulence.</p><p>We propose a model for Bwc1-Bwc2 function that is similar to that of WC-1-WC-2 of <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. crassa</named-content> but differs in several key features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030095-g009">Figure 9</xref>). In this model, <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> Bwc1-Bwc2 bind to DNA in the dark and act as weak repressors to reduce filament development. We hypothesize that photons perceived through a flavin cofactor cause a conformational change that enhances repression of filament formation and cell fusion, and activates transcription of genes required for UV resistance/DNA repair. It is also formally possible that light causes Bwc1-Bwc2 to increase transcription of a gene that functions to repress mating, and/or represses transcription of a repressor of UV sensitivity. The <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. crassa</named-content> model is similar but differs in several key features. Recent evidence suggests that a complex of two subunits of WC-1 and one subunit of WC-2 form in response to light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b10">10</xref>]. The complex positively regulates transcription of genes required for conidiation, mating, and carotenoid production, in marked contrast to the negative regulation of mating observed in <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content>. Another difference is that <italic>wc-1</italic> is light-regulated in <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. crassa</named-content>, while <italic>BWC2</italic> is light-regulated in <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> and <italic>BWC1</italic> is not. The <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. crassa</named-content> complex also regulates transcription of <italic>frq,</italic> and the FRQ protein feedback inhibits the complex, thereby contributing to the wiring of the circadian clock. The roles for WC-1 and WC-2 in <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. crassa</named-content> photoperception also change during the day, adding to the challenge of elucidating their functions. Future studies in <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> will define downstream targets of Bwc1-Bwc2, regulation of Bwc1 and Bwc2 and their complex, and the creation of alleles of Bwc1 bearing mutations in the predicted flavin interacting domain to elucidate the proposed roles of these proteins in light perception.</p><p>Components of the White collar sensing system have been identified in other fungi (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030095-g005">Figure 5</xref>), and are likely to function in light responses in these and other fungal species. Recently the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Trichoderma atroviride</named-content> homologs of <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. crassa</named-content> WC-1 and WC-2 were isolated and mutated, demonstrating a role for these genes in light-induced conidiation and the induction of photolyase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b37">37</xref>].

A homolog of <italic>wc-1</italic> was identified in the truffle-forming ascomycete <italic>Tubor bruchii,</italic> in which blue light inhibits hyphal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b42">42</xref>]. Thus, this gene and its homologs may have applications even to cultivated, edible fungi. It will be of interest to establish whether White collar-like proteins are present in the genomes of the two other fungal phyla proposed for genome sequencing, the zygomycetes and the chytrids. The responses of the zygomycete <italic>Phycomyces</italic> to light, particularly blue and UV wavelengths, have been well characterized, and numerous mutants (e.g., ten different <italic>mad</italic> mutants) affecting responses or sensitivity to particular wavelengths have been isolated, but no photoreceptor genes have as yet been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b02">2</xref>].

The discovery of the <italic>BWC1</italic> and <italic>BWC2</italic> genes as potential UV-blue light responsive proteins in a basidiomycete indicates that this type of protein complex is ancient in the fungal kingdom. The fossil record shows a clear divergence of the fungal kingdom into the four phyla by the Devonian [416&#x02013;359 million years ago (mya)], and a Precambrian origin (prior to 542 mya) for the fungi has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b46">46</xref>]. Margulis et al. proposed that sexual recombination and DNA repair were coselected in the Precambrian for protection against UV light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b47">47</xref>], and genes are known that control both recombination and sensitivity to UV light. Bwc1-Bwc2 in <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. neoformans</named-content> regulates both UV sensitivity and sexual development, ultimately leading to recombination. During the Silurian division (416&#x02013;444 mya), the UV-protection role of the WC-1 proteins could have conferred a major selective advantage to the fungi when they and plants cocolonized the continents at a time when there was no shade from solar radiation. The proteins could have been especially important at other times of global ecological change associated with elevated UV irradiation due to atmospheric and vegetation changes, such as at the end of the Permian (250 mya) or Cretaceous (65 mya), when there are spikes of fungi in the fossil record [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030095-b49">49</xref>].

Gene disruption was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis using standard methods. The mutant serotype D strains were crossed to the congenic strain JEC20 (MAT<bold>a</bold>) to obtain strains with the opposite mating type. Through a series of crosses, strains with double or triple mutations in both mating types were isolated. A set of strains with auxotrophic markers (either <italic>lys1</italic> or <italic>ade2</italic>) with the mutation or wild type at the <italic>BWC1</italic> locus was also generated by crossing. The serotype A <italic>bwc1::URA5</italic> strain was crossed to strain KN99&#x003b1; to obtain a MAT&#x003b1; <italic>bwc1</italic> strain. For reconstitution, the <italic>BWC1</italic> or <italic>BWC2</italic> genes were amplified with primers JOHE8744 and JOHE8745 or JOHE12641 and JOHE12642, respectively, from genomic DNA of strain H99, and ligated adjacent to a cassette conferring resistance to neomycin (G418). A linearized version of this vector was introduced into <italic>bwc1</italic> or <italic>bwc2</italic> mutant strains. The self-filamentous serotype D strain was obtained by introducing the <italic>SXI1&#x003b1;</italic> gene adjacent to <italic>URA5</italic> into strain JEC34 (MAT<bold>a</bold><italic>ura5</italic>).

The growth of strains was also examined at 37 &#x000b0;C on YPD medium, for melanin production on bird seed agar (70 g/L ground bird seed, 0.1% glucose, 0.05% Tween-20) or on low-glucose (0.1%) medium supplemented with the diphenolic molecule <sc>L</sc>-DOPA (100 mg/ml). Capsule production was assayed by growing strains in liquid medium with low levels of glucose (0.5%) and iron (20 mg/L of the chelator EDDHA), and examining exclusion of India ink particles from fungal cells. Strains were grown to logarithmic phase in liquid YPD medium and serial dilutions spotted onto YPD agar plates, which were then irradiated with UV light (0.2 min setting, approximately 48 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>; UV Stratalinker 2400, Stratagene, La Jolla California, United States) to test for UV sensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="s4a3"><title>Wavelength of inhibition and analysis of light inhibition during stages of mating</title><p>Crosses between <italic>lys1</italic> or <italic>ade2</italic> auxotrophic strains with or without the <italic>bwc1</italic> or <italic>bwc2</italic> mutations were conducted under illumination modified with filters to provide blue, green, or red light (LE 4747 blue, LE 4758 green and LE 4725 red; Calumet, Bensenville Illinois, United States).

We hypothesize that photons perceived through a proposed flavin moiety on Bwc1 cause a conformational change that increases repression of filament formation and cell fusion, and activates transcription of genes required for UV resistance. Alternatively, UV sensitivity may be mediated through repression by Bwc1-Bwc2 of a repressor protein.
