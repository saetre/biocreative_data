While the initial stages of the response have been well characterized, less is known about the dynamics of the response after induction and its shutoff. To address this, we followed the response of the SOS network in living individual <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells. The promoter activity (PA) of SOS genes was monitored using fluorescent protein-promoter fusions, with high temporal resolution, after ultraviolet irradiation activation. We find a temporal pattern of discrete activity peaks masked in studies of cell populations. The number of peaks increases, while their amplitude reaches saturation, as the damage level is increased. Peak timing is highly precise from cell to cell and is independent of the stage in the cell cycle at the time of damage. Evidence is presented for the involvement of the <italic>umuDC</italic> operon in maintaining the pattern of PA and its temporal precision, providing further evidence for the role UmuD cleavage plays in effecting a timed pause during the SOS response, as previously proposed. The modulations in PA we observe share many features in common with the oscillatory behavior recently observed in a mammalian DNA damage response. Our results, which reveal a hitherto unknown modulation of the SOS response, underscore the importance of carrying out dynamic measurements at the level of individual living cells in order to unravel how a natural genetic network operates at the systems level.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Oscillations in transcriptional activity in the network responsible for controlling DNA damage are monitored with GFP- promoter fusions in individual <italic>E. coli</italic> cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The SOS genetic network &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b01">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b03">3</xref>&#x0005d; includes more than 30 genes in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b05">5</xref>&#x0005d; that carry out diverse functions in response to DNA damage, including nucleotide excision repair, translesion DNA replication, homologous recombination, and cell division arrest.

The network is controlled by the LexA repressor, which downregulates itself and the expression of the other SOS genes. Following DNA damage, a RecA nucleoprotein filament is formed along stretches of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) near arrested replication forks. This RecA filament promotes autocleavage of the LexA repressor, leading to induction of the response &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b06">6</xref>&#x0005d;.

Those studies revealed an increase in the level of transcripts and of PA of SOS genes, respectively, after induction by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. This was followed by a decrease in the activation of these genes, presumably when DNA damage was repaired and the system was shut off. Such a single-peaked response is expected from a simple model of the network, in which repression of transcription by LexA is the only regulation mechanism.</p><p>Measurements performed over a population of cells might be limited in their ability to accurately describe network responses in the case of a nonhomogenous population, or an unsynchronized response.

We used time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to measure the fluorescence intensity and size of bacteria containing the reporter plasmids over 150 min following DNA-damaging UV irradiation, at a 2-min temporal resolution. Typical snapshots obtained at two times during the response of a number of cells after a 10 J/m<sup>2</sup> UV dose are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030238-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030238-g001">1</xref>B.</p><p>The length, <italic>L</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), and average fluorescence intensity, <italic>I</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), of each cell in the field of view were measured for each image, and the product <italic>I</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)<italic>L</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), proportional to the total amount of GFP in a given cell at time <italic>t</italic> was calculated, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030238-g001">Figure 1</xref>C.

The normalized PA (PA/PA<sub>0</sub>) of the <italic>recA</italic> promoter as a function of time, in representative cells irradiated with different doses of UV radiation, is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030238-g001">Figure 1</xref>D&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030238-g001">1</xref>G (PA<sub>0</sub> is the average PA of uninduced cells; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We find that the measured response of individual cells is highly structured. Up to three peaks in PA are typically observed within the duration of the experiments, with the typical number of peaks increasing with damage level. In contrast to the modulations found in cells following DNA damage, unirradiated cells exhibited a constant PA, close to the uninduced level, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030238-g001">Figure 1</xref>J.

Measurements of the response in cell cultures &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b10">10</xref>&#x0005d; show a single activation peak at about 30 min after irradiation, except for high UV doses (greater than 40 J/m<sup>2</sup>), where another small peak was observed around 90 min.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Peak Timing Correlates with the Cell Growth Rate but Not with the Stage in the Cell Cycle</title><p>Measuring the response in individual cells allows not only for the evaluation of distributions of response dynamics in a population, but also for the calculation of correlations between these dynamics and parameters related to cellular growth. We find that there is a lack of correlation between the peak time and the size of the cells at the time of irradiation, as is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030238-g003">Figure 3</xref>A. This indicates that peak timing is not synchronized with the bacterial cell cycle. The peak time is however correlated with the cell's growth rate (1<italic>/T<sub>D</sub></italic>) after irradiation, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030238-g003">Figure 3</xref>B (<italic>T<sub>D</sub></italic> is the time it takes for a cell's length, or for the sum of lengths of its daughter cells, to double).

As for the peaks' amplitudes, no correlation was observed between PA<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>/PA<sub>0</sub> and either the cell size at the time of irradiation or the cell growth rate.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>The Number of Peaks Grows with UV Dose, Their Normalized Timing Is Constant, and Their Amplitude Saturates</title><p>Next, we analyzed the dependence of the response parameters on the UV dose. The number of peaks observed increases with the amount of damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030238-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). At a UV dose of 10 J/m<sup>2</sup>, most cells (approximately 60&#x00025;) show a single activation peak, while some show two and even three peaks (approximately 25&#x00025; and 15&#x00025;, respectively) with a relatively low amplitude (see below). At 50 J/m<sup>2</sup>, on the other hand, most cells (approximately 55&#x00025;) show three peaks, whereas 35&#x00025; show two peaks, and no more than 10&#x00025; show only one peak. In contrast, the normalized timing of the peak maxima averaged over all cells, <italic>&#x0003c;T<sub>i</sub>&#x0003e;/T</italic> (<italic>i</italic> = 1, 2, 3; <italic>T</italic> = &#x0005b;1/<italic>T<sub>D</sub></italic> + 1/&#x003c4;&#x0005d;<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> ), is constant over the 10&#x02013;50 J/m<sup>2</sup> dose range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030238-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). The average amplitude of the peaks shows some dependence on the UV dose, but it becomes saturated at approximately 20 PA<sub>0</sub> at doses above 20 J/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030238-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). These observations indicate that the cells respond to increasing damage levels by increasing the number of activation cycles, rather than by increasing the amplitude of the response.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>The <italic>umuDC</italic> Operon Is Involved in Maintaining the Pattern of Activity Peaks and Its Precision</title><p>Since the modulations are observed in the activity of all three promoters investigated, it is likely that they represent modulations in the level of the master transcriptional regulator LexA. Thus, the behavior described above reveals the existence of another level of regulation of the SOS response, beyond the transcriptional control by LexA. What are the mechanism(s) underlying the precise temporal modulations of PA? It has been recently proposed that the products of the <italic>umuDC</italic> operon may act as a prokaryotic DNA damage checkpoint, effecting a timed pause in DNA replication &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d;, in addition to their role as an error-prone DNA polymerase (PolV) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d;. This has motivated our hypothesis that the products of <italic>umuDC</italic> may be involved in the mechanism behind the observed modulations.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we repeated the measurements on a strain deleted for the <italic>umuDC</italic> operon <italic>(&#x00394;umuDC)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030238-g005">Figure 5</xref>). We find that a number of important changes are observed in the response of this mutant, compared to the wild-type strain: first, most cells do not show the well-defined peak of PA around 60 min after irradiation. Instead, the prevailing pattern is a peak of PA around 30 min, followed by another peak appearing between 70 and 110 min, with a very large variance of cell-to-cell timing and amplitude (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030238-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030238-g005">5</xref>B; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030238-t001">Table 1</xref>). Second, the amplitude of the first peak reaches higher levels relative to wild type (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030238-g005">Figure 5</xref>A with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030238-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) and does not show saturation with UV dose (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030238-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Moreover, the amplitude and timing of the first peak are more correlated than in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030238-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Thus if the first peak in a <italic>&#x00394;umuDC</italic> cell appears later than the average, it will tend to have a higher amplitude, whereas in wild-type cells, no such correlation is observed. Third, peak time becomes independent of growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030238-g005">Figure 5</xref>E).</p><p>A further test of the involvement of <italic>umuD</italic> in setting the precision of the peak timing and its effect on the second peak is furnished by experiments with a dominant-negative, noncleavable <italic>umuD</italic> mutant gene (K97A), expressed from a plasmid in AB1157 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030238-g005">Figure 5</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030238-g005">5</xref>D, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030238-t001">Table 1</xref>). As with <italic>&#x00394;umuDC,</italic> the amplitude of the first peak does not saturate and increases considerably; the peak at 60 min completely disappears, and in its place a minimum in <italic>recA</italic> PA is observed. Furthermore, the peak centered at approximately 90 min appears with a high timing and amplitude variance among cells.</p><p>These observations indicate that the cleaved form UmuD&#x02032; is required for the reactivation of SOS PA at around 60 min after irradiation. It is interesting to note that the timing of reinitiation of DNA replication after damage reported in Opperman et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d; is similar to the timing of the observed second peak of the SOS response, and both require the existence of UmuD&#x02032;.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present findings show that the SOS response is highly structured, exhibiting discrete peaks in the PA of some of the genes in the network, peaks that appear with high temporal precision. Mutations in the <italic>umuDC</italic> genes affect the precision of these modulations.</p><p>A number of features of the response are important when evaluating possible mechanisms underlying the observed modulations. First, the observed similarity of the temporal patterns of activity of the three promoters studied suggests that the patterns are caused by modulation of LexA levels. This suggests that posttranscriptional regulation plays a role in regulating SOS dynamics. Second, the peak times, normalized by the average doubling time are independent of UV dose, and there is a lack of correlation between the peak time and the length of the bacteria at the time of irradiation. Thus, the normalized timing and phase of the modulations do not depend on factors such as the number of chromosomes (and hence the mean number of DNA lesions) at the time of irradiation. Third, peak timings exhibit a very low variability between cells, in spite of cell&#x02013;cell variations in network component numbers (e.g., proteins), amount of damage, and the different growth stages at the time of irradiation.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that the products of the <italic>umuDC</italic> operon play an important role in generating the temporal modulation of activity, maintaining its temporal precision, and endowing the SOS response with &#x0201c;digital pulses&#x0201d; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b23">23</xref>&#x0005d;, whose number but not amplitude increases with damage. In the absence of <italic>umuDC</italic> the response is analog in nature in that (i) the amplitude of the first peak increases with damage level, whereas in wild-type cells it saturates, and (ii) the amplitude of the first peak and its timing are correlated, in contrast with the amplitude-independent peak timing characteristic of a digital response.</p><p>However, neither deletion of the <italic>umuDC</italic> operon nor the K97A dominant negative, non-cleavable umuD protein fully eliminates the modulations. Both mutants show peaks of activity at around 30 and 90 min after irradiation at 20 J/m<sup>2</sup>. Thus, other factors in the network of interactions between components of the SOS response must also play a role. The active RecA&#x0002a; nucleoprotein filament is known to interact with additional factors induced by the SOS response, which modulate its coprotease activity. These factors include LexA and products of the <italic>umuDC</italic> operon, as well as the RecX &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b25">25</xref>&#x0005d; and DinI &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b27">27</xref>&#x0005d; proteins and double-stranded DNA during homologous recombination &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b28">28</xref>&#x0005d;. These factors might play a role in the decrease of activity after the first and third peaks, which are less affected by the <italic>umuDC</italic> gene products.</p><p>In addition, the level of ssDNA in the cell changes during the response due to the progression of repair processes and the detection of new damage sites by propagating replication forks. The observed peak at 60 min may be an example of such a process, where the delayed translesion synthesis activity of PolV &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b29">29</xref>&#x0005d; causes formation of ssDNA in newly detected damage sites and, thus, reinitiation of the response. This explanation is in accord with the observed elimination of this peak in the &#x00394;UmuDC and uncleavable UmuD mutants. This process can be more accurately timed and synchronized by the previously proposed role of uncleaved UmuD as a checkpoint inhibiting DNA synthesis after damage, and the timed release of this checkpoint by UmuD cleavage &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b29">29</xref>&#x0005d;. Other changes in activity may result from the encounter of persistent lesions during the next round of replication from OriC. This scenario is not favored by the observed lack of correlation between peak timing and the length of cells at the time of irradiation, unless there is a timed pause in initiation of replication from OriC after SOS induction. Such a pause was observed only at high levels of UV irradiation (greater than 60 J/m<sup>2</sup>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b30">30</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The present findings show that the progress of the response is accurately timed, irrespective of the level of the damage. The induction of the SOS response after irradiation inhibits DNA replication &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b32">32</xref>&#x0005d; and cell division &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b03">3</xref>&#x0005d;, establishing a common reference time point for all cells, which are otherwise unsynchronized in their cell cycle. Thereafter, features of the SOS network, such as the different affinities of LexA to its binding sites on the different promoters, and critical events, such as UmuD cleavage, govern the temporal execution of the response and can lead to the synchronization.</p><p>Another possible mechanism behind the temporal modulation of PA is the existence of one or more negative feedback loops in the network. As mentioned above, factors such as DinI, RecX, the products of the <italic>umuDC</italic> operon, and double-stranded DNA during homologous recombination modulate the stability and coprotease activity of the nucleoprotein RecA filament. The increase in the concentration of these factors after SOS induction may lead to a decrease in the rate of LexA degradation, and consequently to a decrease in SOS induction levels, leading to a negative feedback. Any of these possibilities is likely to play a role in the reduction of PA after peaks. This type of negative feedback loops, particularly those with delays, such as transcription delays, can give rise to oscillatory behavior &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b34">34</xref>&#x0005d;. The nearly integer ratio (1:2:3) between the timing of the peaks T<sub>1</sub>:T<sub>2</sub>:T<sub>3</sub> in our experiments may support this scenario (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030238-g003">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030238-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Further experiments with other mutants would be required in order to explore the full mechanism behind the observed modulations and to understand their role in the cellular response to DNA damage. Of particular interest are mutations of other genes that interact with RecA, such as DinI and RecX, and mutations in RecA that show selectivity for either LexA or UmuD cleavage &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b35">35</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Finally, we suggest that the SOS network displays a number of design features that may also occur in other repair systems. First, it <italic>accurately times and synchronizes</italic> the repair process, thus allowing cells to respond not only according to the current amount of damage but also according to the time elapsed since damage was detected. One such timing mechanism, namely UmuD cleavage and its role as a DNA replication checkpoint, allows for an interval during which precise repair is carried out, while DNA replication is arrested and the levels of other repair enzymes are rising. In addition, mutagenesis by PolV may be limited to a short time window, starting from UmuD cleavage and ending by UmuD&#x02032; proteolysis. Second, it affords <italic>differential temporal activation</italic> of various promoters by the modulations in the level of a common repressor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b10">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Third, the SOS network includes mechanisms to <italic>limit the response level,</italic> thereby avoiding a response that is too high at early stages. The decrease of the response after each peak may allow the cell to evaluate whether damage still persists and permit rapid shutoff when repair has been accomplished. The different controls on LexA most probably play important roles in this context: while LexA cleavage followed by proteolysis allows for a fast induction of the response, its autoregulation by negative feedback enables a quick shutoff.</p><p>The results presented here for the SOS response are in striking similarity to recent observations of the behavior of the p53-Mdm2 network in individual mammalian cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b23">23</xref>&#x0005d;, both systems showing modulations in response to DNA damage. Remarkably, the bacterial system shows modulations that are more precise than the human system, a precision that is reminiscent of that found in developmental patterning &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b36">36</xref>&#x0005d; and in circadian clocks &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b37">37</xref>&#x0005d;. It would be interesting to test whether other stress response systems show similar properties and to investigate what may be the fitness advantage of such digital responses over analog ones. Such modulations are readily detected at the single-cell level, whereas slight timing differences smear them out on cell averages.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>The experiments were carried out in strain AB1157 <italic>(argE3, his4, leuB6, proA2, thr1, ara14, galK2, lacY1, mtl1, xyl5, thi1, tsx33, rpsL31,</italic> and <italic>supE44)</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030238-b38">38</xref>&#x0005d; unless otherwise noted.

Images were acquired with an intensified camera (Videoscope International, Dulles, Virginia, United States; ICCD-350F), with integration times ranging from 0.1 to 4 s, and stored in a computer for later analysis. The samples were illuminated with an argon laser (488 nm) only during the time of integration of the camera to reduce photobleaching. Optical filters used were 480AF30 for excitation, 530DF30 for emission, and 505DRLP dichroic mirror (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, Vermont, United States). The incident power on the back aperture of the objective was approximately 5 &#x003bc;W, and the illumination area had a radius of approximately 50 &#x003bc;m. At these illumination level and exposure times, photobleaching was only appreciable after 4 h of experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Sample preparation</title><p>Cells were grown overnight in an LB medium and diluted into a fresh medium used in the experiments (M9 + 20 amino acids except tryptophan, 50 mg/l; thiamine 20 mg/l; thymine 20 mg/l; biotin 1 mg/l; glucose 0.4&#x00025; v/v). After reaching midlog phase (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.25&#x02013;0.4), cells were placed on a preheated agarose slab (experimental medium + 2&#x00025; agarose) and incubated for 15 min at 37 &#x000b0;C.

After UV irradiation, bacteria were covered with a coverslip and monitored using the fluorescence microscope. The thin layer of agar allowed for an efficient supply of oxygen and nutrients to reach the cells during the experiment.
