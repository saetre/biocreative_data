Htt-associated protein 1 (HAP1), a component of neuronal cytoplasmic stigmoid bodies (STBs), can sequester polyQ-expanded Htt and AR in STBs, thereby antagonizing formation of the nuclear aggregates associated with apoptotic neuron loss and disease progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Clones of HAP1 were isolated from unbiased two-hybrid screens for proteins that interact with TBP. Domain mapping showed that regions between amino acids 157 and 261 and between amino acids 473 and 582 of mouse HAP1 both bind specifically to the conserved C-terminal TBP<sub>CORE </sub>domain, away from the TBP N-terminal polyQ region. When fluorescently tagged versions of HAP1 or TBP were expressed independently in COS-7, 293, or Neuro-2a cells, all TBP localized to the nucleus and all HAP1 assembled into cytoplasmic stigmoid-like bodies (STLBs). When co-expressed, a portion of the TBP was assembled into the HAP1 STLBs while the remainder was localized to the nucleus. Although the TBP N terminus, including the polyQ region, was unnecessary for TBP-HAP1 interaction, in mammalian cells, removal of the TBP Qrepeat reduced the proportion of TBP that assembled into STLBs, whereas expansion of the Qrepeat had no significant affect on TBP subcellular localization.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>HAP1 can sequester a subset of TBP protein away from the nucleus; extranuclear TBP sequestration is quantitatively influenced by the TBP polyQ repeat. These results suggest HAP1 could provide protection from SCA17 neuropathology.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The Huntingtin-associated protein, HAP1, was first identified as a protein that interacts with Huntingtin protein (Htt), the causative agent of Huntington's disease (HD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. HD is a member of a family of diseases in which expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat regions in an otherwise functionally diverse group of proteins results in neurodegenerative disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This family includes dentatorubral-palidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), caused by polyQ expansion in atrophin 1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA or Kennedy's disease), caused by polyQ expansion in the androgen receptor, AR; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and spinocerebellar ataxias 1&#x02013;3, 6, 7, and 17 (SCAs), caused by polyQ expansions in various proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>In all of these diseases, expansion of gene sequences encoding the polyQ region of the individual protein results in the disease in later life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. All are associated with neuronal accumulation of nuclear aggregates containing the affected protein as well as other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Although some extranuclear protein aggregates can often also be found, the nuclear accumulations are implicated in inducing the cytopathic state that leads to apoptotic loss of neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In the case of HD, expansion of the polyQ repeat beyond ~36 residues causes an amino- (N-) terminal fragment (encoded by exon 1 of the <italic>htt </italic>gene) to be cleaved and to translocate to the nucleus, where it becomes incorporated into neuronal nuclear aggregates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Nuclear HD aggregates typically contain proteasome subunits, chaperones, and ubiquitin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Aggregates also contain transcription factors, including the TATA-binding protein (TBP), cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CBP), specificity factor 1 (SP1), p53, and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. One of these, TBP, is a general transcription factor that functions in initiation by all three nuclear RNA polymerases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In addition, TBP is, itself, a polyQ protein that, upon expansion of its polyQ repeat, forms intranuclear aggregates leading to the SCA17 neuropathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Although TBP is generally a low abundance protein in normal somatic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], the nuclear aggregates in SCA17 accumulate to high levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], suggesting that the pathological state is associated with increased accumulation of nuclear TBP.</p><p>Although HAP1 interacts with Htt, it is unclear what role this might play in HD. Recent evidence suggests that HAP1 may protect against polyQ-expansion neuropathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], a proposal known as the 'HAP1 protection hypothesis' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thus, although expanded polyQ Htt is abundant throughout the brain, including in the HAP1-expressing hypothalamic and limbic regions in HD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], these areas do not accumulate Htt aggregates and do not exhibit HD pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Moreover, evidence for a neuroprotective role of HAP1 in SBMA has been reported. Thus, HAP1 binds to AR and SBMA pathology is generally not seen in neurons expressing HAP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Importantly, whereas transfection of HEp-2 cells with polyQ-expanded AR results in apoptosis, co-transfection of HAP1 abrogates this effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Two HAP1 isoforms have been characterized in mice, HAP1-A, a 598 amino acid protein, and HAP1-B, a 628 amino acid protein, which both arise from the same gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The difference between HAP1-A and HAP1-B stems from alternative splicing in the 3' region of the pre-mRNA and results in both proteins containing different C-terminal sequences beyond the 577 amino acid HAP1 common region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. It is not yet clear how HAP1-A and HAP1-B might differ functionally, although the predominant vesicle-associated subtype is HAP1-B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Subcellular localization studies show that HAP1 is predominantly cytoplasmic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. HAP1 is a component of stigmoid bodies (STBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], which are non-membrane-bound cytoplasmic inclusions found in the hypothalamus and limbic regions of the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. HAP1 expression induces formation of cytoplasmic inclusions resembling STBs, here termed stigmoid-like bodies (STLBs), in 293 human embryonic kidney carcinoma cells, HEp-2 human larynx carcinoma cells, and mouse neuronal NIE 115 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], suggesting that HAP1-A directs assembly of similar cytoplasmic inclusions in neuronal and non-neuronal cell types.</p><p>In the study presented here, unbiased yeast two-hybrid screens identified HAP1 as a protein that binds to TBP. Like the HAP1-interacting Htt and AR proteins, TBP is the causative agent of a polyQ-expansion-dependent neuropathology (see above). Moreover, like for Htt and AR proteins, we found that binding of HAP1 to TBP occurred away from the TBP polyQ region. Instead, interaction domain mapping studies showed that HAP1 binds specifically to the conserved C-terminal domain of TBP (TBP<sub>CORE</sub>). By inducing formation of green fluorescent protein-tagged HAP1 STLBs in 293, COS-7, or Neuro-2A cells, we show that cytoplasmic STLBs sequester some TBP while still allowing accumulation of substantial levels of TBP in the nucleus. These data suggest HAP1 can specifically associate with TBP to prevent nuclear localization of excess TBP while not impeding normal nuclear TBP accumulation and function.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of HAP1 as a TBP interacting protein</title><p>To identify proteins that interacted with TBP, we screened a mixture of oligo(dT)-primed placental and whole pregnant uteri cDNA libraries (50% of each library was used) (screen #1) or a random-primed library which also consisted of 50% placental and 50% whole pregnant mouse uteri cDNAs (screen #2). Both screens were performed using TBP-FL as the bait protein, which was expressed from the pDBLeu plasmid (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In screen #1, ~6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>primary transformants (yeast containing both a bait and prey plasmid) were plated onto SC-L-W-H-U. From these plates, 82 colonies grew and were transferred to fresh SC-L-W-H-U plates and those clones that re-grew were further tested for activation of the LacZ reporter gene. Seven of the clones grew on SC-L-W-H + 50 mM 3-AT, SC-L-W-H + 75 mM 3-AT, SC-L-W-H-U, and also activated the LacZ reporter gene (data not shown). Inserts were sequenced to identify the interacting protein. Three clones encoded partial cDNAs of B'-related factor 1 (BRF1), a known TBP interacting protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. A fourth clone encoded a nearly full-length HAP1-A protein, beginning at amino acid 7 (HAP1<sub>7&#x02013;598</sub>). The remaining three clones encoded the following proteins: an unknown protein with similarity to human SR-rich proteins (accession number BAB30779) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]; an unknown protein product containing similarity to chromosome segregation ATPases (accession number BAE22251); and Rho-associated coiled-coil forming kinase 1 (accession number NM_009071), a serine-threonine protein kinase.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Yeast two-hybrid bait constructs, prey libraries, and screens.

Out of 183 colonies that grew on SC-L-W-H-U, five yeast clones activated all three reporter genes (HIS3, ADE2, and LacZ), did not grow in the presence of an empty bait plasmid (no TBP insert; data not shown), and thus appeared to express a TBP-interacting prey protein. One of these clones encoded amino acids 155&#x02013;582 of the HAP1-B (HAP1<sub>155&#x02013;582</sub>) protein, with only the last five amino acids extending beyond the HAP1-common domain and into the HAP1-B-specific region.

Sectors 7&#x02013;8 contained strong and weak positive interaction controls, respectively, that were supplied with the ProQuest system. The strong interaction control grew well under all conditions tested. The weak interaction control did not grow on SC-L-W-H-U, suggesting that this condition allowed growth of yeast containing only strong bait-prey interactions. Sector 9 was a negative auto-activation control showing that yeast bearing only the empty bait vector and an empty prey plasmid (no inserts) did not grow under conditions that selected for interacting bait-prey protein pairs.

HAP1 interacted with TBP-&#x00394;Q under all conditions tested (sector 1), but did not interact with any of the truncated TBP-C clones (sectors 2&#x02013;6), suggesting that an intact TBP<sub>CORE </sub>is required for the HAP1-TBP interaction to occur.

Growth of all clones on SC-L-W verified the presence of both the bait and prey plasmids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, left panel).

Similarly, yeast that contained either the empty bait or empty prey plasmids (negative controls) did not grow on plates that selected for interaction of bait and prey proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, sector 9, panels 2, 3).

Thus, the TBP-HAP1 interaction appeared to be a specific interaction between unique polypeptide domains. For verification, the interactions between TBP and HAP1 identified by two-hybrid screens were tested by co-immunoprecipitation in mammalian cell culture. Differently epitope-tagged versions of full-length TBP and HAP1<sub>155&#x02013;582 </sub>were co-expressed in transiently transfected 293 cells.

Moreover, our two-hybrid screens isolated a nearly full-length clone of HAP1-A from the oligo(dT)-primed library and a shorter clone from the random-primed library that extended five amino acids past the HAP1 common region into HAP1-B sequences. The nearly full-length HAP1-A clone, when fused to the DSRed2 fluorescent protein, formed strong STLBs and sequestered a fraction of co-expressed TBP protein in all mammalian cell types tested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).

Since HAP1 has little similarity with other known proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], much of what is known about its function has been discovered through identification of those proteins that interact with HAP1. Specific protein interaction sites on HAP1 have been mapped as follows (mouse HAP1-B amino acid numbering): amino acids 277&#x02013;369 (HAP1<sub>277&#x02013;369</sub>) binds with Htt; full-length HAP1-A binds to AR; HAP<sub>277&#x02013;444 </sub>binds with dynactin P150<sup>Glued</sup>; HAP1<sub>245&#x02013;371 </sub>binds with hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate protein; HAP1<sub>1&#x02013;312 </sub>binds with interRho-GEF Kalirin-7; HAP1<sub>219&#x02013;519 </sub>binds to GABA<sub>A </sub>receptor; HAP1<sub>272&#x02013;598 </sub>binds to IP<sub>3</sub>1 receptor; and HAP1<sub>247&#x02013;446 </sub>binds to NeuroD (ND) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Here we show that a clone encoding amino acids 155&#x02013;582 of HAP1 bound to the TBP<sub>CORE </sub>domain in yeast two-hybrid screens (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). We also show that TBP co-immunoprecipitated with HAP1 in transient cotransfection assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Further, two regions within HAP1 were shown to independently interact with TBP-C. Specifically, the domains of HAP that interacted with TBP are found between amino acids 157&#x02013;261 and between amino acids 473&#x02013;582 (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>We are aware of only one study that has shown a role of HAP1 in transcriptional regulation. In that study, HAP1, in conjunction with Htt, was shown to function as a scaffold protein that mediates the interaction of ND with mixed-lineage kinase 2 in the cytoplasm, resulting in phosphorylation of ND and its subsequent translocation to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. No evidence exists for cytoplasmic regulation of TBP activity, so we feel that it is unlikely that the TBP-HAP1 interaction might similarly regulate gene expression in HAP1-expressing cells. Rather, as detailed below, we favor a model based on the 'HAP1 protection hypothesis' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], wherein HAP1 may help protect neuronal cells from TBP-mediated cytotoxicity.</p><p>Including this report, HAP1 has now been shown to bind specifically to three proteins associated with polyQ-dependent neuropathologies: Htt, AR, and TBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. In all cases, recognition and binding of these proteins by HAP1 is dependent on unique sequences outside of their polyQ regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In other words, HAP1 does not recognize an expanded polyQ repeat per se, but rather, recognizes unique aspects of at least three specific proteins that have a propensity for causing polyQ-dependent neuropathology. Neruopathologies caused by Htt, AR, and TBP are associated with nuclear accumulation of protein aggregates, which are thought to induce cytopathic effects resulting in apoptotic neuron loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. HAP1 is not associated with Htt aggregates in HD brains and HD neuropathology is not associated with brain regions having high HAP1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Thus, although Htt is expressed in many regions of the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], regions that overlap with HAP1 expression are not vulnerable to neuropathology, leading to formulation of the 'HAP1 protection hypothesis' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Similarly, although both bulbar and forebrain neurons express high levels of AR, polyQ-expanded AR aggregates and neuropathology in SBMA patients are not observed in the forebrain regions, which express high levels of HAP1 and exhibit STBs, but rather, are restricted to the HAP1/STB-deficient bulbar regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Overexpression of polyQ-expanded AR in HEp-2 cells induces apoptosis; however, co-overexpression of HAP1 suppresses apoptosis and, instead, causes formation of STLBs containing both proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Thus, HAP1 binds to polyQ-expanded AR though specific interactions with regions outside the polyQ domain, it sequesters polyQ-expanded AR in STLBs, and it protects cells from polyQ-expanded AR-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], strongly supporting a protective role for HAP1.</p><p>Although it is not clear whether HAP1 might also protect neurons from TBP-mediated neuropathology, it is intriguing that, despite ubiquitous expression of TBP in all cells of the body, most regions of the brain exhibiting high levels of HAP1 and abundant STBs do not exhibit neuropathology in SCA17 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. One exception is in the striatum, which has both STBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and SCA17-associated neuropathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, detailed analyses show that, whereas HAP1/STBs are found in the medium and large neurons of the striatum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], SCA17 is associated with loss of the small neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>In the current study, we show that HAP1 binds specifically to the TBP<sub>CORE </sub>and that HAP1 can sequester a subset of TBP into STLBs in co-transfected 293, COS-7, or Neuro-2a cells. Unlike the case for HAP binding to AR (see above), the HAP1-TBP interaction in yeast or mammalian cells did not require expansion of the polyQ region of TBP (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>); however, removal of the polyQ region reduced assembly of TBP into STLBS (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Since the HAP1-binding domains of TBP, Htt, and AR are all disparate from the polyQ regions in each protein (see above), it is interesting that HAP1 binding by all three proteins should show polyQ-dependence. In transfected cells, HAP1/STLBs did not clear TBP from the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Instead, they appeared to sequester a subset of TBP, while still allowing substantial TBP accumulation in the nucleus. It remains unclear whether the TBP protein that accumulated in the nucleus was equivalent to that sequestered in the STLBs (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). One possibility is that the polyQ region of each protein can influence the likelihood that that protein assumes a "state" that allows interaction with HAP1. For example, in the case of TBP, the subset of protein that is sequestered into HAP1 STLBs might be mis-folded, defective in nuclear localization, abnormally associated with other proteins, or otherwise defective, thus making this protein accessible for HAP1 binding. Further studies will be required to better understand the role of the TBP polyQ region in <italic>in vivo </italic>HAP1 association.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>HAP1 has previously been shown to interact specifically and away from the polyQ repeat region with Htt and AR proteins, the causative agents of HD and SBMA, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. In the current study, we isolated HAP1 as a TBP<sub>CORE</sub>-interacting protein from unbiased two-hybrid screens. The interacting domains were mapped and the interactions were confirmed in co-immunoprecipitation assays. Sub-cellular co-localization studies indicated that HAP1-induced STLBs could sequester a subset of overexpressed TBP, but not other overexpressed nuclear proteins, away from the nucleus. Although the co-localization was modeled in an overexpression system, we suspect this may be a suitable model for a HAP1-TBP interaction. Thus, in normal cells, all TBP goes to the nucleus where it functions in transcription initiation and a HAP1-TBP interaction would not occur. Only in the case of a TBP expression anomaly would there be a possible physiological situation in which a HAP1-TBP interaction may be important to combat TBP-mediated cytotoxicity. In our co-localization system, the anomaly is strong overexpression of TBP in the transiently co-transfected cells; in SCA17 patients, anomalous expansion of the TBP polyQ repeat results in overaccumulation TBP, which assembles into nuclear aggregates and results in apoptotic neuronal loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Interestingly, neurons expressing HAP1 and possessing STBs appear to be refractory to nuclear aggregate formation and SCA17 cytopathology (see above). Thus, we posit that HAP1 plays a neuroprotective role in preventing nuclear aggregate formation in the presence of anomalous TBP accumulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Material availability</title><p>All renewable reagents generated for this study, including all plasmids, expression vectors, yeast two-hybrid libraries, and yeast strains, are available on request for unrestricted non-profit research use unless specifically regulated by other parties.</p></sec><sec><title>Two-hybrid baits, libraries, transformations, and screens</title><p>TBP baits were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a plasmid containing the predominant mouse (Mus musculus) somatic TBP cDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].

Total RNA was extracted and CsCl-purified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] from embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) wild-type C57Bl/6J whole pregnant uteri or placentas. In each case, either whole pregnant uteri or placentas were obtained from four pregnant dams to generate a pool of RNA. Poly(A+) mRNA from these samples was purified using Oligo(dT)<sub>25 </sub>Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech ASA) following the manufacturer's protocols. Oligo(dT)-primed libraries were constructed from ~3 &#x003bc;g of poly(A+) RNA; cDNA inserts for each library had an average size of &#x0003e;1 kb (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The whole pregnant uteri and placental libraries contained ~2.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>and ~2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>independent recombinants, respectively; each with ~95% bearing inserts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). To access more 5' regions of prey cDNAs, a random hexamer-primed library was also constructed using 3 &#x003bc;g each of whole pregnant uteri and placental poly(A+) RNA. Construction of random-primed cDNAs was performed using a standard oligo(dT)-primed cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene), with the following adaptations. First, instead of an oligo(dT) primer, random hexamer oligonucleotides were used to prime the first-strand cDNA. Second, a linker containing a 5' <italic>Eco </italic>RI overhang and a blunt 3' end was constructed by annealing the 5' and 3' linker oligos (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and ligating this to the blunt-ended double-strand cDNA product. Both the 5' and 3' ends of the cDNA had <italic>Eco </italic>RI overhangs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), which allowed direct insertion of the library product into an <italic>Eco </italic>RI-digested vector. Two versions of the random-primed library were constructed and subsequently pooled. The first consisted of non-amplified cDNA that was inserted into the <italic>Eco </italic>RI site of pPC86. This library contained ~6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>primary transformants with ~60% bearing inserts. The second library was constructed from random-primed cDNA that had been amplified by PCR using primers that annealed to the linker sequences located at the 5' and 3' ends of the final cDNA library product. PCR-amplified cDNA was digested with <italic>Not </italic>I and inserted into the <italic>Not </italic>I site of pPC86. This library contained ~1.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>independent recombinants with ~90% bearing inserts. After pooling, the combined library consisted of ~2.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cDNA clones and had an average insert size of ~1.0 kb with ~90% bearing inserts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><p>All interactions were tested in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain MaV203 (Gibco BRL), which contained the HIS3, URA3, and LacZ reporters, each under the control of a different promoter. For library transformations, a culture of MaV203 that contained the TBP bait construct was grown at 30&#x000b0;C for 48 hours in liquid synthetic complete medium (SC) lacking leucine (SC-L) (QBIOgene). This culture was used to seed 300 ml of 2&#x000d7; yeast extract/peptone/adenine/dextrose (YPAD) at 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>yeast/ml, which was determined by counting on a hemacytometer. The culture was grown at 30&#x000b0;C for ~5 hours to a density of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7 </sup>yeast/ml. Yeast were collected by centrifugation, washed once with water and once with 100 mM LiAc, and transformed with 14.4 ml 50% PEG (average m.w. 3350), 2.16 ml 1.0 M LiAc, 0.3 ml 10 mg/ml sheared denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 120 &#x003bc;g of the cDNA library in pPC86. Single- or two-component transformations of bait and/or prey plasmids into yeast used a standard PEG/LiAc protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>].</p><p>Two-hybrid screens were performed on SC medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and uracil (SC-L-W-H-U). Both two-hybrid screens used TBP-FL as bait to screen either a combination of 50% whole pregnant uteri and 50% placental (screen 1) or random-primed (screen 2) cDNA prey libraries. Primary transformants were transferred onto a new SC-L-W-H-U plate and clones that grew well on these plates were transferred to either a SC-L-W-H + 80 mM 3-AT plate or were grown on SC-L-W and tested for LacZ expression following the X-Gal Assay protocol detailed in the ProQuest Two-Hybrid system manual (Gibco BRL cat. series 10835). Prey plasmids from clones that grew under all selection conditions and scored positive for LacZ expression (turned blue) were isolated from yeast by glass bead lysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Recovered plasmids were transformed into bacteria, clones were selected, and inserts were sequenced to determine the cDNA identity. Isolated prey plasmids were re-transformed into MaV203 with the bait or with the empty pDBLeu plasmid (auto-activation test) and grown on SC-L-W-H + 75 mM 3-AT, and SC-L-W-H-U plates to verify the interaction.</p><p>To identify the domain of TBP that interacted with HAP1, TBP bait constructs in combination with the empty pPC86 prey plasmid (auto-activation test) or with either the HAP1 random-primed or the HAP1 oligo(dT)-primed clone were co-transformed into MaV203 and plated onto SC-L-W. Individual colonies that grew on SC-L-W plates (containing both the bait and prey plasmid) were suspended in water and streaked onto SC-L-W, SC-L-W-H + 75 mM 3-AT, and SC-L-W-H-U plates to verify the interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction domain mapping</title><p>For generating a HAP1 deletion mutant series, a random-primed yeast two hybrid prey plasmid isolated as a TBP interactor, encoding amino acids 155&#x02013;582 of the mouse HAP1-B cDNA, was used as the template for PCR amplification.

Hoechst and GFP-HAP1 fluorescence were used to delineate nuclear and cytoplasmic regions, as indicated by white dotted lines in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>. Because adherent cells have little cytoplasm over- or under-lying the nucleus, most cells gave clear spatial separation of GFP-HAP1 STLB fluorescence and nuclear Hoechst fluorescence; however, a few cells did have evidence of STLBs over- or under-lying the nucleus, and these were excluded from the analysis.</p><p>Digital photomicrographs of individual cells were used to estimate relative nuclear and extranuclear TBP levels. Total area, nuclear area, and extranuclear area were analyzed using the "Image Histogram" tool for the red (DSRed2-TBP expression) channel within Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe). The pixel-count per intensity level curve was integrated to provide a quantitative estimate of the total amount of red fluorescence in each compartment. Because this integration takes into account the fluorescence intensity in each pixel, it converts the two-dimensional fluorescent photomicrograph into a quantitative representation of all fluorescence in the three-dimensional space within each cellular region, and thus provides an estimate of relative fluorescent protein concentrations.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declares that there are no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>EES designed and directed the project and helped prepare the manuscript.
