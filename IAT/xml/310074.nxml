The encoded proteins is 65% identical to dHMG-D protein, and also contains a single HMG-box as the DNA recognition motif. Analogous to dHMG-D, two transcripts are observed for dHMG-Z which are differentially regulated, and are the product of zygotic transcription unlike the dHMG-D transcripts which arise from both maternal and zygotic transcription. The genes for dHMG-D and dHMG-Z are located on adjacent loci in the genome and each contains two introns. The position of the second intron in the coding region is conserved between the two genes suggesting a common origin via gene duplication.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00067-0224-a" xlink:role="4370"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00067-0223.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4369"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00067-0224.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4370"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00067-0225.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4371"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
