However, their presence and role in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, which play a key role in initiating and developing age related macular degeneration (ARMD), have never been investigated. Here we analyzed the expression of and changes in cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) and one enzyme responsible for endocannabinoid hydrolysis, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), in RPE cell oxidative damage process, a cellular model of ARMD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Primary human RPE cells and cells from the ARPE-19 cell line were cultured and exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 24 h to induce oxidative damage. Real time RT&#x02013;PCR, immunofluorescent staining, and western blot methods were performed to study the expression of and changes in CB1 and CB2 receptors, and FAAH. Cell viability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were measured by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and a dichlorofluorescein (DCF) assay, respectively.

The ECS consists of the following: the cannabinoid receptors, which include Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1)/CB2 receptors and non-CB1/CB2 receptors; the endogenous ligands, primarily anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG); the enzymes responsible for the endogenous ligands' degradation, notably fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), and biosynthesis; and the specific uptake mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>].</p><p>Both cannabinoid receptors subtypes, CB1 and CB2, are abundantly expressed in neurons and can protect neurons from oxidative damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. Cannabinoid receptor induction of neuroprotection has been observed in animal models of some neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>], Huntington&#x02019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>], multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>], and Parkinson disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. However, the presence and regulation of cannabinoid receptors in retinal neurodegenerative disorders have been studied far less than those in brain and other organ systems.</p><p>Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is a late-onset neurodegenerative retinal disease, which predominates in the elderly as a cause of irreversible and profound vision loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. ARMD shares many common clinical and pathogenetic properties with other neurodegenerative disorders. Currently, there is no ideal therapy to prevent or cure ARMD. Intake of antioxidants is the only established treatment for those with the atrophic or &#x0201c;dry&#x0201d; form of ARMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. Although treatment options for those with the neovascular or &#x0201c;wet&#x0201d; form have increased recently, even these treatments are largely ineffective for reversing existing visual impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. Thus, the development of strategies for preventing ARMD assumes great importance; and new treatment approaches should focus on the initial insults that lead to the disease's progression. ARMD initial pathogenesis includes degeneration, dysfunction, or loss of RPE cells caused by oxidative injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of endocannabinoids (AEA and 2-AG) in retinas by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. CB1 receptor, a cannabinoid receptor enriched in neuronal tissue, was localized in the inner and outer plexiform layers of a human retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. Unlike CB1 receptor, CB2 receptor and FAAH were undetectable in the human retina, but were found in rat retina, mostly in the ganglion cells and in the soma of dopamine amacrine cells and large cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. The function of ECS in the eye, in addition to regulating photoreception and neurotransmission in the retina, and the effects on intraocular pressure and ocular blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>], also encompasses neuroprotective effects against retinal neurotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. This background suggests a functional ECS in the retina. Eyes of patients with ARMD have been show increase levels of endocannabinoids (AEA) in their retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that ECS, acting as a novel signaling system in the retina, may play a substantive role in the ARMD pathophysiological process. Because most effects of endocannabinoids are mediated by binding to cannabinoid receptors and terminated by degradation enzyme FAAH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. Thus, the present study aims to examine the expression of CB1 and CB2 receptors, and FAAH in human RPE cells, and their changes in oxidative stress conditions, using a cellular model of ARMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. Our findings may set the basis for the potential pharmacological modulation of cannabinoid receptor tone as a novel therapeutic target in ARMD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Primary human RPE cells and ARPE-19 cell line culture</title><p>Human RPE cells were obtained from eye bank donor eyes, which were cut across the posterior pole, and the vitreous and neural retina were removed.

Plenty of evidence in the previous literature suggests that oxidative stress is a contributing factor to RPE dysfunction in ARMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>]. The results led us to further analyze the cannabinoid receptors and FAAH expression changes in RPE cells induced by oxidative stress. Most studies have used human RPE cells as the in vitro study model of ARMD, either primary or cell line. One of the drawbacks of using primary RPE cells is that it provides a limited number of cells and may lack a consistent cellular background. The ARPE-19 cell line overcomes this problem while maintaining the morphological and functional characteristics of primary cells. In addition, ARPE-19 cells respond to oxidative stress (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, media starvation, etc.) in a fashion similar to that of primary cultured human RPE cells. Therefore, we have used the ARPE-19 cell line for most of our studies. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> added to the culture medium was used as a chemical oxidant. This agent is convenient and biologically relevant, especially for the RPE cells. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has been found in ocular tissues in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>] and can be produced by the RPE cells as a reactive oxygen intermediate during photoreceptor outer segment phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. For these reasons, we selected H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for our studies and performed a series of dose response assays to determine the working concentration that led to a consistent and reliable cytotoxicity.</p><p>By using real-time RT&#x02013;PCR and the western blot method, we showed that oxidative stress can upregulate <italic>CB1</italic> and <italic>CB2</italic> receptor expression and downregulate <italic>FAAH</italic> expression in a cell model of ARMD. These results agree with a previous comparative analytical study, which showed that endocannabinoids (AEA) increased in the retina from human ARMD eyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. As a lipid soluble substance, AEA cannot be stored in vesicles; and therefore it is synthesized on demand and travels, in a retrograde direction, across the postsynaptic membrane to the presynaptic membrane, where it activates presynaptic CB1 and CB2 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>]. After cellular uptake, AEA is degraded via the enzyme FAAH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. Variation of ECS also can be observed in other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, and multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>]. The variation of ECS may be an endogenous response to maintain endocannabinoid homeostasis and regulate the pathologic function of neuron cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. In line with the endocannabinoid homeostasis theory, there are now several examples of the successful use of ECS-directed drugs used to alleviate the clinical symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>]. These results suggest that cannabinoid receptors may be potential targets for therapeutic interventions for ARMD.</p><p>We also introduced CP55,940, which is a nonselective CB1/CB2 receptor agonist in oxidative stress-induced RPE cellular damage. We found that CP55,940 protected ARPE-19 cells from oxidative stress-induced cell damage and intracellular ROS generation in a dose-dependent way with excellent efficacy. We further explored whether CP55,940 induced cytoprotective signaling pathways while rescuing RPE cells from oxidative damage. The PI3K/Akt- and ERK1/2-mediated survival signal pathways had been suggested to protect RPE cells from oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>]. We therefore addressed whether CP55,940 could modulate PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways, and found that CP55,940 could enhance H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced activation of PI3K/Akt and reduce the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. We further investigated whether the selective activation of CB1 or CB2 receptor could protect RPE cells from oxidative stress induced damage. We used a cell viability assay to determine viability in cells treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. We demonstrated that CB2 receptor agonist, but not CB1 receptor agonist, significantly protected human RPE cells from oxidative stress. Several studies have shown CB1 receptor activation to mediate neuroprotection, but this is not a universal finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>]. This neuroprotective effect could be related to different cell types and pathological conditions.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated the expression of CB1 and CB2 receptors and FAAH in human RPE cells, and their changes in oxidative stress conditions. The RPE cells perform vital functions for safeguarding photoreceptor cells against oxidative stress and are involved in the pathogenesis of ARMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>]. These findings open up the attractive possibility that a correlation exists between endocannabinoid homeostasis and the onset of ARMD. However, as we observe inhibition, rather than the more usual stimulation, of ERK signaling, the involvement of receptors other than CB1 as well as CB2 in the effects of CP55,940 or JWH015 cannot be excluded. More studies using siRNA or specific CB1 and CB2 receptor antagonists should be performed to examine whether manipulating the levels of cannabinoid receptors could be a novel pharmacological approach to treat ARMD in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We greatly appreciate the support received from Shanghai Leading Academic Discipline Project S30205 and
