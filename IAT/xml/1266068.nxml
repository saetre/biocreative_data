This tract contains a guanine-rich sequence consisting of four runs of three or more contiguous guanines separated by one or more bases, corresponding to a general motif for the formation of an intramolecular G-quadruplex. In this study, we observed the progressive unwinding of the oligomer duplex DNA containing this region into single-stranded forms in the presence of KCl and the G-quadruplex-interactive agents TMPyP4 and telomestatin, suggesting the dynamic nature of this tract under conditions which favor the formation of the G-quadruplex structures. Subsequent footprinting studies with DNase I and S1 nucleases using a supercoiled plasmid DNA containing the human VEGF promoter region also revealed a long protected region, including the guanine-rich sequences, in the presence of KCl and telomestatin. Significantly, a striking hypersensitivity to both nucleases was observed at the 3&#x02032;-side residue of the predicted G-quadruplex-forming region in the presence of KCl and telomestatin, indicating altered conformation of the human VEGF proximal promoter region surrounding the guanine-rich sequence. In contrast, when specific point mutations were introduced into specific guanine residues within the G-quadruplex-forming region (Sp1 binding sites) to abolish G-quadruplex-forming ability, the reactivity of both nucleases toward the mutated human VEGF proximal promoter region was almost identical, even in the presence of telomestatin with KCl. This comparison of wild-type and mutant sequences strongly suggests that the formation of highly organized secondary structures such as G-quadruplexes within the G-rich region of the human VEGF promoter region is responsible for observed changes in the reactivity of both nucleases within the polypurine/polypyrimidine tract of the human VEGF gene. The formation of the G-quadruplex structures from this G-rich sequence in the human VEGF promoter is further confirmed by the CD experiments. Collectively, our results provide strong evidence that specific G-quadruplex structures can naturally be formed by the G-rich sequence within the polypurine/polypyrimidine tract of the human VEGF promoter region, raising the possibility that the transcriptional control of the VEGF gene can be modulated by G-quadruplex-interactive agents.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The size of most primary solid tumors is known to be limited to within &#x0223c;1&#x02013;2 mm in diameter because the cancer cells initially rely on pre-existing host blood vessels for a supply of oxygen and nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). However, starving tumor cells can become angiogenic by gaining the ability to direct the formation of new blood vessels for their survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). The angiogenic switch in cancer cells is often initiated by increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a pluripotent cytokine and angiogenic growth factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). VEGF consists of two identical subunits and binds to VEGF receptors on the surfaces of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). The interaction of VEGF and its cognate receptors stimulates the proliferation, migration, survival and permeability of endothelial cells, resulting in the formation of new blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The formation of new blood vessels adjacent to primary tumor sites promotes the growth of cancer cells by providing oxygen and nutrients. In addition, newly formed blood vessels serve as escape routes for disseminating tumor cells, contributing to tumor metastasis even in locations distant from the primary tumor site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>).</p><p>The expression of human VEGF, which is frequently elevated in many types of cancer, is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). VEGF expression is induced by a variety of factors, including hypoxia, pH, activated oncogenes, inactivated tumor suppressor genes and growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). The molecular basis of VEGF gene expression has been extensively studied by characterizing the <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements and transcription factors involved in constitutive VEGF expression in human cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). The human VEGF promoter region contains putative binding sites for several transcription factors, such as HIF-1, AP-1, AP-2, Egr-1, Sp1 and many others, suggesting that they may be involved in VEGF transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Functional analysis of the human VEGF promoter using the full-length VEGF promoter reporter revealed that the proximal 36 bp region (&#x02212;85 to &#x02212;50 relative to transcription initiation site) is essential for basal or inducible VEGF promoter activity in several human cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). This region contains at least three Sp1 binding sites, each consisting of a polypurine/polypyrimidine tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Although there are binding sites for other factors, such as two Egr-1 elements and one AP-2 element, all Sp1 binding sites were found to be functionally significant in constitutive VEGF promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Polypurine/polypyrimidine tracts are also found in the promoter region of other growth-related genes, including Hmga-2, EGF-R, c-Myc, I-R, AR, c-Src, c-Ki-Ras, TGF-&#x003b2;, PDGF A-chain, insulin and muscle-specific protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). These sequences have been proposed to be very dynamic in their conformation, easily adopting non-B-DNA conformations, such as melted DNA, hairpin structures, slipped helices, or others, under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). These sequences also provide landing sites for a transcription machinery complex to initiate transcriptional activation of these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). In particular, the guanine-rich sequences found in the polypurine/polypyrimidine tracts are known to form G-quadruplex structures consisting of two or more G-tetrads in the presence of monovalent cations such as Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> under physiological conditions as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Recently, both NMR and X-ray crystallography studies have determined the structures of various forms of G-quadruplexes, and these studies have revealed that folding patterns of these G-quadruplexes depend on the precise arrangement and composition of G-repeats, as well as on the size of the intervening sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Significantly, the polypurine tract of the VEGF promoter consists of five runs of at least three contiguous guanines (GR-I to GR-V in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) separated by one or more bases, conforming to the general motif capable of forming G-quadruplex structures. Therefore, we hypothesized that the polypurine/polypyrimidine tract of the VEGF promoter region is very dynamic in its structure and can easily adopt a non-B-DNA conformation under physiological conditions. Moreover, we predicted that the G-rich strand of this tract could form specific G-quadruplex structures in the presence of K<sup>+</sup> or G-quadruplex-interactive agents.</p><p>To test our hypothesis, we initially used a DNA breathing assay with an oligomer duplex containing the polypurine/polypyrimidine tract in the VEGF promoter. We anticipated that the unwinding of this oligomer duplex could be facilitated in the presence of G-quadruplex-interactive agents by trapping out and stabilizing the G-quadruplex transiently formed by the G-rich strand of the polypurine/polypyrimidine tract. In addition, we used DNase I and S1 nuclease footprinting to study the structural transition within this tract of the VEGF promoter, since the activity of these enzymes is modulated by DNA conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>).</p><p>In this article, we demonstrate that G-quadruplex-interactive agents promote the unwinding of the oligomer duplex containing the polypurine/polypyrimidine tract in the presence of K<sup>+</sup>. Footprinting experiments with DNase I and S1 nuclease using a supercoiled plasmid containing either the wild-type or mutant VEGF promoters revealed that the emergence of DNase I and S1 nuclease cleavage in the vicinity of the polypurine/polypyrimidine tract was dependent on both the capability of the wild-type sequence to form G-quadruplex structures and the presence of K<sup>+</sup> and G-quadruplex-interactive compounds. Collectively, these results support the conclusion that G-quadruplex structures form within this polypurine/pyrimidine tract of the VEGF promoter.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Drugs, enzymes and oligonucleotide DNA</title><p>TMPyP4 was purchased from Midwest Chemicals, and telomestatin was kindly provided by Dr Kazuo Shin-ya (University of Tokyo, Japan).

A mutant reporter plasmid, pGL3-VEGFM17, was constructed by introducing point mutations into specific guanine residues within the Sp1 binding sites of the VEGF promoter regions of pGL3-VEGFP using a QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to destabilize or abolish the G-quadruplex-forming ability of this region.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> footprinting of the VEGF promoter region with DNase I and S1 nuclease</title><p>A supercoiled form of each of the plasmids (pGL3-VEGFP and pGL3-VEGFM17) was incubated in the absence of any salt, or in the presence of 100 mM KCl with and without 1 &#x000b5;M telomestatin as a selective G-quadruplex-interactive agent at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h and then treated with DNase I or S1 nuclease for 2 min. DNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in double-distilled water after vacuum drying. To map DNase I and S1 nuclease cleavage sites on the plasmid DNA, linear amplification by PCR was performed using Thermo Sequenase Cycle Sequencing kit (USB) with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled gene-specific primers d(CCCAGCGCCACGACCTCCGAGCTACC) and d(CTGTGAACCTTGGTGGGGGTCGAGC) to amplify the top and bottom strands of the plasmid DNA, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Circular dichroism spectroscopy</title><p>Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Easton, MD), using a quartz cell of 1 mm optical path length, an instrument scanning speed of 100 nm/min, with a response time of 1 s and over a wavelength range of 200&#x02013;330 or 200&#x02013;600 nm for the titration experiments with drugs.

It was anticipated that the unwinding of the 59WT would occur if Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairs are destabilized by the formation of non-B-DNA structures in the Sp1 binding sites of the VEGF promoter region. In the DNA breathing assay, the oligomer duplex (59WT) labeled at the 5&#x02032; end of the G-rich strand with <sup>32</sup>P was incubated with increasing concentrations of the G-quadruplex-interactive agents TMPyP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>) or telomestatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) at 37&#x000b0;C in the presence of 150 mM KCl and then electrophoresed on an 8% native polyacrylamide gel to separate other species of DNA from the duplex form of DNA. G-quadruplex-interactive agents were included to determine if these agents promote the unwinding process by further stabilizing and trapping out the G-quadruplex structures formed by the G-rich strand. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>, the formation of a single-stranded DNA species was progressively increased as the concentrations of TMPyP4 and telomestatin were increased. TMPyP4 and telomestatin will prevent the conversion back to a B-DNA structure by trapping out and stabilizing the G-quadruplex structures formed in this region of the VEGF promoter. The results from the DNA unwinding study support the idea that the polypurine/polypyrimidine tract of the VEGF promoter region is very dynamic in its structure, and G-quadruplex structures can be formed by the G-rich strand of this tract under physiological conditions of potassium, pH and temperature with the addition of G-quadruplex-stabilizing agents.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> footprinting of the wild-type VEGF promoter contained in a plasmid in the presence of K<sup>+</sup> and G-quadruplex-interactive compounds</title><p>DNase I and S1 nucleases have been previously used as tools for studying structural transitions occurring in normal B-type DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). For example, while DNase I preferentially cleaves locally unwound or normal duplex regions over single-stranded regions, S1 nuclease preferentially cleaves single-stranded regions of DNA over duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). However, both enzymes show the lowest cleavage activity toward highly organized secondary structures such as hairpins or G-quadruplex structures. For these reasons, the existence of a non-B-conformation can be implied from changes in the pattern of DNase I and S1 nuclease sensitivity of certain regions of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><sec><title>DNase I cleavage</title><p>DNase I footprinting was used to determine the possible structural transition from B-DNA to non-B-type DNA structures in the promoter region of the VEGF gene. For the DNase I footprinting, the plasmid pGL3-VEGFP, which contains the VEGF promoter region from &#x02212;787 to +50, was incubated either in the absence of salt or in the presence of 100 mM KCl, with and without 1 &#x000b5;M telomestatin as the selective G-quadruplex-interactive agent, at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h and then treated with DNase I for 2 min. DNase I cleavage sites in the plasmids were then mapped using linear amplification by PCR with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled gene-specific primers. The primer extension reaction carried out on the top strand of the plasmid revealed a long DNase I <italic>protected</italic> region located at approximately &#x02212;53 to &#x02212;123 bp, which includes the G-rich sequences, when the supercoiled pGL3-VEGFP plasmid was incubated with 100 mM KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>; compare lanes 2 and 3 with lane 1). This result is in accord with a transition from B-DNA to a non-B-DNA structure in the VEGF promoter region, which is most probably a G-quadruplex and consequently resistant to DNase I digestion. Significantly, a striking DNase I hypersensitivity was found at a cytosine located at the 3&#x02032;-side of the predicted G-quadruplex-forming region in the presence of KCl and telomestatin, which is most probably associated with the junction site between the G-quadruplex and the adjacent normal B-DNA (arrow A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). The primer extension reaction of the bottom strand of the plasmid revealed that the reactivity of DNase I on the C-rich region in the VEGF promoter was moderately reduced in the presence of KCl and KCl with telomestatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; compare lanes 2 and 3 with lane 1). This result suggests that the C-rich sequence and the surrounding region of the VEGF promoter might exist in single-stranded form as a result of the transition of purine-rich strand in the B-type DNA structure to a G-quadruplex under these conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>S1 nuclease cleavage</title><p>Since reduced reactivity to DNase I can be caused by either the presence of a single-stranded region or a highly organized secondary structure, such as G-quadruplex structures within the polypurine/polypyrimidine tract of the VEGF promoter, an additional footprinting experiment using S1 nuclease was carried out to obtain further detailed information about the conformational transition occurring in this region. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>, the reactivity of S1 nuclease on the top strand of the polypurine/polypyrimidine tract of the VEGF promoter was markedly reduced in the presence of KCl with telomestatin. The reduced reactivity of the VEGF promoter region surrounding the G-quadruplex-forming region to both DNase I and S1 nuclease suggests the formation of highly organized secondary structures, such as G-quadruplex structures, rather than the formation of a single-stranded form in the G-rich region of the VEGF promoter in the presence of KCl with telomestatin. Significantly, the hypersensitivity site observed with S1 nuclease also corresponds to that obtained with DNase I in the presence of KCl with telomestatin. The presence of this common hypersensitivity site to both nucleases at the 3&#x02032;-side of the G-quadruplex-forming region is a strong indicator of the enhanced exposure of this particular residue to both nucleases, suggesting the presence of a junction site between the B-type DNA structure and the G-quadruplex at this site in the promoter region of the VEGF gene. In contrast, the reactivity to S1 nuclease of the opposite strand of the same region was moderately enhanced, with the hypersensitive region extending upstream of the G-rich tract (see arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These results suggest that the opposite strand of the G-rich sequence and the surrounding region of the VEGF promoter exists in a single-stranded form as a result of the transition of B-type DNA structure to the G-quadruplexes under the conditions that favor such transitions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Comparison of the abilities of the G-rich strands of the wild-type versus mutant VEGF promoter sequences to form stable G-quadruplex structures</title><p>In order to demonstrate the G-quadruplex-forming ability of the G-rich strand of the polypurine/polypyrimidine tract in the presence of KCl, a DNA polymerase stop assay was used, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). This assay provides a simple and rapid way to identify DNA secondary structures, such as G-quadruplexes, <italic>in vitro</italic>, based on the principle that DNA polymerase is incapable of traversing these structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Thus, the DNA polymerase, traversing toward the 5&#x02032; end of the template and unable to efficiently resolve quadruplex DNA, pauses or stops 3&#x02032; to the first guanine involved in a stable G-quadruplex. When a DNA template (WT) containing the G-quadruplex-forming region [d(G<sub>4</sub>CG<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>G<sub>5</sub>CG<sub>4</sub>)] was annealed with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled primers and incubated with <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase, a potassium-dependent pause of the DNA polymerase extension was observed with this DNA template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In contrast, in the absence of KCl, the DNA polymerase bypasses the G-repeat region. The KCl-dependent pausing is observed immediately 3&#x02032; to the fourth guanine run (GR-IV), presumably through stabilization of the intramolecular G-quadruplex structure, confirming that this region is indeed capable of forming intramolecular G-quadruplex structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). A potassium-dependent pausing of DNA polymerase extension was not observed in the mutant DNA template (MT), in which mutations were introduced into the G-quadruplex-forming region to abolish the formation of G-quadruplex structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> footprinting of the mutant VEGF promoter region with DNase I and S1 nuclease</title><p>The importance of the G-quadruplex-forming ability of the polypurine/polypyrimidine tract in causing the change in the reactivity of both nucleases in the presence of KCl and telomestatin was determined using the mutant reporter plasmid pGL3-VEGFM17.

This result provides strong support for the idea that the formation of highly organized secondary structures, such as G-quadruplex structures, within the G-rich region of the VEGF promoter region is responsible for observed changes in the DNase I and S1 cleavage reactivity of the polypurine/polypyrimidine tract in the human VEGF promoter sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>CD spectra of the G-rich strand in the VEGF promoter reveals a parallel-stranded G-quadruplex</title><p>CD spectroscopy has been widely used to infer the presence of G-quadruplexes and is particularly useful for differentiating parallel and antiparallel G-quadruplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). All guanosines in the structure of a parallel quadruplex have an <italic>anti</italic>-conformation of the glycosyl bonds, resulting in a positive band at &#x0223c;265 nm and a small negative band at &#x0223c;245 nm in CD spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). In contrast, the guanosines in an antiparallel quadruplex have alternating <italic>syn</italic> and <italic>anti</italic> glycosyl conformations along each strand, exhibiting a positive band at &#x0223c;295 nm that is associated with an antiparallel strand arrangement. The oligonucleotide used in CD studies was VEGF-PuT, d(T<sub>5</sub>G<sub>3</sub>CG<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>G<sub>5</sub>CG<sub>3</sub>T<sub>5</sub>), which contains a potential G-quadruplex forming region [d(G<sub>3</sub>CG<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>G<sub>5</sub>CG<sub>3</sub>)] of the G-rich strand in the VEGF promoter. As shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, the CD spectra of this sequence displays the characteristic signature for the parallel-type of G-quadruplex in the presence of increasing concentration of KCl, exhibiting a positive band at &#x0223c;265 nm and a small negative band at &#x0223c;245 nm.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The proposed transition of B-DNA into non-B-DNA structures, such as melted DNA, hairpin structures, slipped helices or others, has been reported in a number of growth-related mammalian genes, including Hmga2, EGF-R, c-Myc, malic enzyme, I-R, AR, c-Src, c-Ki-Ras, TGF-&#x003b2;, sMtCK, &#x003b1;7 integrin and PDGF A-chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Significantly, the polypurine/polypyrimidine tracts are often found in the proximal promoter region of these genes, implicating the importance of structural transitions in these DNA tracts in mediating transcriptional regulation of these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). In general, DNA unwinding at the proximal promoter region of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genes is believed to enhance open promoter complex formation with transcriptional machineries leading to transcriptional activation of the genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). A polypurine/polypyrimidine tract was also found within the proximal promoter region of the VEGF gene, the gene product of which is an angiogenic growth factor. This tract is known to serve as a multiple binding site for Sp1 and Egr-1 transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). The polypurine tract of the VEGF promoter region contains a guanine-rich sequence consisting of four runs of three or more contiguous guanines separated by one or more bases. This guanine-rich sequence conforms to a general motif capable of forming an intramolecular G-quadruplex: G<italic><sub>x</sub></italic>N<italic><sub>y</sub></italic>G<italic><sub>x</sub></italic>N<italic><sub>y</sub></italic>G<italic><sub>x</sub></italic>N<italic><sub>y</sub></italic>G<italic><sub>x</sub></italic>, where <italic>x</italic> &#x02265; 3 and <italic>y</italic> &#x02265; 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Therefore, in this study, we were interested in addressing whether a conformational transition exists among B-type DNA, melted DNA and G-quadruplex structures within this tract in the VEGF promoter, and whether specific G-quadruplex structures can naturally form from the guanine-rich sequence of this tract in the presence of KCl and/or G-quadruplex-interactive agents. We anticipated that the results of this study would enhance our understanding of the role of DNA structure in transcriptional regulation of the VEGF gene. Furthermore, we wished to explore a new therapeutic strategy to treat tumor angiogenesis by repressing the transcriptional activation of a major angiogenic gene, VEGF, by modification or stabilization of non-canonical DNA structures such as G-quadruplexes with G-quadruplex-interactive drugs.</p><p>In this report, the dynamic nature of a polypurine/polypyrimidine tract of the VEGF promoter region has been demonstrated through a DNA breathing assay using the oligomer duplex DNA containing this tract. Both TMPyP4 and telomestatin, which are two representative G-quadruplex-interactive agents, were found to promote the unwinding of this oligomer duplex in the presence of KCl (150 mM) under physiological conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We propose that these agents can trap out and stabilize the G-quadruplex structures that are transiently formed from the unwound G-rich strand of the 59mer duplex, facilitating the unwinding of the oligomer duplex into single-stranded forms. The destabilization of the proximal region of the VEGF promoter may contribute to the transcriptional activation of the VEGF gene by providing the binding site for transcriptional machinery, including transcriptional factors (e.g. CNBP or hnRNP, which are single-stranded DNA-binding proteins) and RNA polymerase in the TATA-less promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). The results from our footprinting studies using DNase I and S1 nuclease also demonstrate that the VEGF promoter region including the guanine-rich sequences adapts an unusual DNA conformation. In general, locally unwound or normal duplex regions are preferentially cleaved by DNase I over single-stranded regions or highly organized secondary structures such as hairpins or G-quadruplex structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). In contrast, S1 nuclease prefers to cleave single-stranded or locally unwound regions of duplex DNA over normal duplex and highly organized secondary structures. Therefore, the combined use of both nucleases in <italic>in vitro</italic> footprinting experiments is expected to reveal pertinent information about unusual structural features of defined elements within the global region of DNA duplex molecules. A summary of the results from the DNase I and S1 nuclease footprinting experiments is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. The DNA cleavage results from our footprinting studies revealed a long <italic>protected</italic> region including the guanine-rich sequences by both nucleases in the presence of KCl and telomestatin, which are known to facilitate the transition of B-type DNA structures to G-quadruplexes. Significantly, a striking hypersensitivity to both nucleases was observed at the 3&#x02032; side residue of the predicted G-quadruplex-forming region in the presence of KCl and telomestatin, indicating an altered conformation of the VEGF proximal promoter region surrounding the guanine-rich sequence. It is important to note that the identical changes in footprinting patterns by both nucleases in the presence of KCl are significantly enhanced by the presence of the G-quadruplex-interactive agent telomestatin, suggesting that telomestatin interacts with G-quadruplex structure(s) formed by the G-rich sequence within the polypurine/polypyrimidine region. Finally, since specific point mutations introduced into specific guanine residues within the G-quadruplex-forming region abolished G-quadruplex-forming ability, and correspondingly, the reactivity of both nucleases toward the mutated VEGF proximal promoter region was little changed, even in the presence of telomestatin with KCl, these results also provide solid evidence that the formation of G-quadruplex structures within the G-rich region of the VEGF promoter region is responsible for observed changes in the reactivity of both nucleases within the polypurine/polypyrimidine tract of the human VEGF gene.</p><p>The result from CD spectroscopy suggests that the secondary structures formed by the G-rich strand, d(G<sub>4</sub>CG<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>G<sub>5</sub>CG<sub>4</sub>), of the VEGF promoter could be the parallel type of intramolecular G-quadruplex. Our electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicated that this sequence predominantly formed an intramolecular G-quadruplex structure in the presence of KCl (D. Sun, unpublished data). The structure of G-quadruplexes formed by this oligonucleotide is predicted to be very similar to that found in the C-MYC G-quadruplex structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). In this mutant sequence derived from the NHEIII1 in the c-MYC promoter, the central run of guanines is substituted in the four thymines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). This structure involves a core of three stacked G-tetrads formed by four G-stretches and three loops bridging three G-tetrad layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). The central loop contains six residues, while the two other loops contain only one residue.</p><p>Previous studies reported that certain types of G-rich sequences are capable of forming parallel or antiparallel G-quadruplex structures consisting of two or more G-tetrads in the presence of monovalent cations such as Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>. G-rich sequences capable of forming G-quadruplexes have been reported in telomeric sequences, immunoglobulin switch regions, the insulin gene, the control region of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, the promoter region of the c-Myc gene, fragile X syndrome triplet repeats, and HIV-1 RNA [(reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>)] and muscle-specific protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Recently, the solution structure of the parallel G-quadruplex in the c-Myc promoter was determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Direct evidence for the existence of G-quadruplexes <italic>in vivo</italic> is beginning to emerge, and the ability of these important sequences to form very stable G-quadruplex structures <italic>in vitro</italic> suggests that G-quadruplex DNA may play an important role in several biological events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). For instance, a recent study provided compelling evidence that a specific G-quadruplex structure formed in the c-Myc promoter functions as a transcriptional repressor element, establishing the principle that c-Myc transcription could be controlled by ligand-mediated G-quadruplex stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). Analogous to the c-Myc gene, the transcription of the VEGF gene could be regulated by the G-quadruplex structures formed by the G-rich sequence within the polypurine/polypyrimidine tract of the promoter region. G-quadruplex structures could inhibit the interaction of transcriptional factors (e.g. Sp1) with their cognate sites if those sites overlap the G-quadruplex-forming region. Alternatively, the formation of G-quadruplex structures could induce DNA bending at the junction sites between G-quadruplex structures and normal B-DNA structures, potentially leading to the activation or repression of transcription. Future studies are directed toward addressing whether mutation of sequences of the polypurine/polypyrimidine tract could lead to transcriptional repression (or activation) of the VEGF promoter, and if the G-quadruplex-forming ability of this region correlates with the promoter activity of the VEGF genes.</p><p>In summary, our results provide strong evidence that specific G-quadruplex structures can naturally be formed by the G-rich sequence within the polypurine/polypyrimidine tract of the VEGF promoter region, raising the possibility that the transcription of this gene can be controlled by ligand-mediated G-quadruplex stabilization.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Kazuo Shin-ya (University of Tokyo) for providing the telomestatin for this study.
