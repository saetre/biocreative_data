In the stamen, the appropriate growth of the filament, which largely depends on the mechanical properties of the cell wall, is required to position the anther correctly close to the stigma at the pollination stage. Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases (XTHs) are a family of enzymes that mediate the construction and restructuring of xyloglucan cross-links, thereby controlling the extensibility or mechanical properties of the cell wall in a wide variety of plant tissues. Our reverse genetic analysis has revealed that a loss-of-function mutation of an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> XTH family gene, <italic>AtXTH28</italic>, led to a decrease in capability for self-pollination, probably due to inhibition of stamen filament growth. Our results also suggest that the role of AtXTH28&#x02009;in the development of the stamen is not functionally redundant with its closest paralog, <italic>AtXTH27</italic>. Thus, our finding indicates that AtXTH28 is specifically involved in the growth of stamen filaments, and is required for successful automatic self-pollination in certain flowers in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis</italic></kwd><kwd>Cell wall</kwd><kwd>Self-pollination</kwd><kwd>Stamen filament</kwd><kwd>XTH</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>For successful fertilization in flowering plants, the stamen and pistil act as key components of male and female gametophytes, respectively. In the stamen, the development of the anther and stamen filament is key to ensuring successful fertilization from the point of view of morphogenesis of the male gametophyte (Goldberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">1993</xref>). After differentiation of the male germline, pollen mother cells undergo meiosis to form tetrad cells, the haploid microspores, which then mature into pollen grains during cell division and formation of the complex pollen wall. During development of pollen grains, the stamen filament elongates in the flower bud, by harmonizing an extension of the stamen. In self-pollinating plants, such as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, these developmental events occur at the correct time when the stigma is receptive, so that the anthers are positioned above the stigma to release the pollen grains for effective fertilization (Goldberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">1993</xref>).</p><p>Synthesis, assembly and modification of the plant cell wall constitute fundamental processes in regulation of both cell expansion and differentiation during morphogenesis, thereby representing primary determinants of the anther and stamen structures for reproductive competence. During the course of meiosis, the microsporocytes secrete a callose wall between the plasmalemma and the original cellulosic wall. At the end of meiosis, the external and intersporal walls of the tetrads are dissolved by enzymes secreted by the tapetum, such as endoglucanase and exoglucanases, to release individual microspores (Ariizumi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2004</xref>, Scott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2004</xref>, Dong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2005</xref>, Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2007</xref>). Anther dehiscence requires secondary wall thickening, which generates the tensile force necessary for the rupture of the stomium(Keijzer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">1987</xref>, Steiner-Lange et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2003</xref>, Mitsuda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2005</xref>). These studies identified a relatively small number of cell wall genes that probably play a role in pollen grain maturation and anther dehiscence. However, recent comprehensive gene expression profile analysis identified a large number of cell wall genes working at different stages of anther development, most of which belong to gene families such as glycosyl hydrolases, glycosyltransferases and structural proteins (Amagai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2003</xref>, Zik and Irish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2003</xref>, Mandaokar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2006</xref>, Alves-Ferreira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2007</xref>, Hobo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2008</xref>). Despite rapid advances in the identification of cell wall genes expressed in the stamen, the role of most families of cell wall genes remains functionally unexplored.</p><p>Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases (XTHs) have been implicated in both the splitting and reconnection of xyloglucan cross-links (Fry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">1992</xref>, Nishitani and Tominaga <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">1992</xref>), and are considered to play a pivotal role in both the construction and the disassembly of cell wall architecture in a wide variety of plant tissues (Rose et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2002</xref>). XTHs are typically encoded by large multigene families in land plants. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, 33 genes that encode XTH proteins have been identified (Yokoyama and Nishitani <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2001</xref>). Comprehensive gene expression analyses of the XTH family in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> revealed that most family members exhibit spatially and temporally distinct expression profiles, and some of the <italic>AtXTH</italic> genes are predicted to be expressed in flower development (Yokoyama and Nishitani <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2001</xref>, Hyodo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2003</xref>, Imoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2005</xref>, Becnel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2006</xref>). Despite extensive studies on this gene family, little is known about the role of <italic>AtXTH</italic> genes in flower development.</p><p>To identify the <italic>XTH</italic> genes responsible for reproductive competence in flower development, we analyzed the reproductive phenotypes of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants in each <italic>AtXTH</italic> gene by a reverse genetic strategy. We found that a loss-of-function mutation of the <italic>AtXTH28</italic> gene causes a defect in self-pollination in certain flowers. In this report, we propose that <italic>AtXTH28</italic> has a specific role in the formation of cell wall architecture that is essential during stamen development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Isolation of the atxth28 mutant</title><p>Using a reverse genetic strategy, we analyzed reproductive phenotypes of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants in which each <italic>AtXTH</italic> gene has been disrupted, and found that a loss-of-function mutant line for the <italic>AtXTH28</italic> gene (<italic>atxth28</italic>) showed a phenotypic defect in silique development. A T-DNA insertion mutant of the <italic>AtXTH28</italic> gene was obtained from the Salk Institute, which contains the insertion between the second and third exons of the coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>A). Semi-quantitative reverse transcription&#x02013;PCR (RT&#x02013;PCR) analysis showed that no transcript of <italic>AtXTH28</italic> was detected in the <italic>atxth28</italic> mutant, whereas <italic>AtXTH28</italic> mRNA accumulated substantially in wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>B).

To determine the effect of the mutation more precisely, we investigated the relationship between the silique position and the length of siliques in terms of inflorescence development. Most of the first to fifth siliques on the primary stem of the mutant line were shorter than those of the wild type, and fewer numbers of seeds were in these siliques, although longer siliques containing normal seed number were found occasionally near the fifth silique. For sixth and later siliques, the number of longer siliques gradually became larger, and all upper siliques after the eighth on the primary stem were equivalent to those of the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>C). Although the first and second siliques were sometimes shorter in wild-type plants, the pattern of shorter silique formation apparently differed for the <italic>atxth28</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>C).</p><p>For complementation tests, a 5.7&#x02009;kb genomic DNA fragment containing the entire <italic>AtXTH28</italic> sequence, including 3.0 and 1.0&#x02009;kb of the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-flanking regions, respectively, was introduced into an <italic>atxth28</italic> mutant line by <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation. The <italic>AtXTH28</italic> transcript was restored in the transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>B), and the silique length phenotype of these transgenic plants coincided with that of the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>C). These observations indicate that the shorter silique phenotype in the <italic>atxth28</italic> mutant is caused by a defect in <italic>AtXTH28</italic>.</p><p>We generated various combinations of double mutant lines between other closely related <italic>AtXTH</italic> genes using T-DNA insertion mutants. The severity of the phenotype found in the <italic>atxth28</italic> mutant was not enhanced in these double mutants compared with the single <italic>atxth28</italic> mutant. It is worth noting that the <italic>atxth27/atxth28</italic> double mutant did not increase the severity of the <italic>atxth28</italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>C).</p></sec><sec><title>Self-pollination ability</title><p>In order to determine the viability of male and female organs in the <italic>atxth28</italic> mutant, hand self-pollination and reciprocal crossing between <italic>atxth28</italic> mutant and wild-type plants were performed. The <italic>atxth28</italic> pollen had normal viability by hand pollination, and normal siliques were produced on reciprocal crossing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). To investigate automatic self-pollination in <italic>atxth28</italic> and wild-type flowers, pollen grains on stigma papilla were observed using aniline blue staining. On the second and/or third flowers of the wild-type plants, a large number of pollen grains and penetration of pollen tubes were observed on the stigma papillae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>A, B). In contrast, at the same position of the inflorescence in the <italic>atxth28</italic> mutant, most flowers did not have pollen grains on the stigma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>B). In the upper position of the inflorescence of the <italic>atxth28</italic> mutant, which could form longer siliques, pollen grain number and pollen tube penetration resembled those of the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>B). To check the release of pollen grains from the anther, we compared anther development and the timing of anther dehiscence for wild-type and <italic>atxth28</italic> flowers. No differences were observed in the maturation of anther tissues (e.g. tapetum and pollen development) or in the timing of anther dehiscence, and, furthermore, no morphological differences were observed in the outer structure of anthers (data not shown). These results indicate that the <italic>atxth28</italic> mutation affects self-pollination and consequently induces a shorter silique phenotype. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Silique phenotype of the <italic>atxth28</italic> mutant for pollen viability in <italic>atxth28.</italic> (A) Schematic representation of a hand pollination experiment.

To examine whether the <italic>atxth28</italic> mutation affects the physical position of anthers, we measured the length of stamen filaments. For an evaluation of the relative position between anther and stigma, the length ratio between stamen and pistil is a good indicator. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>A shows that, at the pollination stage (stage 14, Smyth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">1990</xref>), the <italic>atxth28</italic> mutant exhibited a significantly lower stamen/pistil ratio compared with that of wild-type plants, indicating that the <italic>atxth28</italic> stamen filaments did not elongate sufficiently to the correct position close to the stigma at the pollination stage. At the flowering stage (stage 15), the stamen/pistil ratio showed no significant difference between wild-type and <italic>atxth28</italic> flowers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>B).

In the developing flower bud, male and female reproductive organs develop independently and mature at around stage 13, just before anthesis. Before this stage, the gynoecium and stamen lengthen in concert, and, after that, stamen filaments extend even faster and the length of the long stamens outstrips that of the gynoecium at the beginning of stage 14. During the elongation of the stamen, anthers dehisce and release pollen, and then pollination is accomplished when mature pollen and stigma brush against each other. For successful pollination by delivery of pollen grains to the surface of the stigma, the morphological structure is one of the key features for successful reproduction, in addition to the viability of the reproductive components, the pollen and pistil. The <italic>atxth28</italic> mutant lacked accurate development of a male component, i.e. timing of the elongation of the stamen filament, the distance between the anther and stigma, and orientation of anther dehiscence. That is, the <italic>atxth28</italic> mutant failed to keep the correct position of the anthers relative to the stigma at the pollination stage, due to a defect in the stamen filaments. Due to this defect, the capability for automatic self-pollination was decreased.</p><p>Expression of the <italic>AtXTH28</italic> gene was observed in stamen filaments, and its mRNA accumulated intensively in the vascular tissue of the filaments at the pollination stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), indicating that the <italic>AtXTH28</italic> gene product takes part in cell wall construction of the vascular tissue in stamen filaments during the early stages of flower development. Given that xyloglucan modification is mediated exclusively by the XTH family of proteins, AtXTH28 is responsible for cutting and rejoining xyloglucan chains within the vascular cell walls, thereby controlling the extensibility or mechanical properties of the cell wall in vascular cells during stamen filament elongation. A defect in the properties of the vascular cell walls would cause a change in the timing of elongation of the stamen filament. In addition, the <italic>AtXTH28</italic> gene was expressed extensively at the junction between anther and filament, and in the receptacles at a later stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>B). Proper construction of cell walls by AtXTH28 would also be required for development of the mechanical properties of the tissues that stabilize the growth direction of the stamen.</p><p>Alternatively, the mechanical properties of the junction regions, controlled by <italic>AtXTH28</italic>, might be associated with a twist in the stamen filament. In the <italic>atxth28</italic> mutant, the anther dehiscence side does not always face the stigma: anthers faced the stigma with various angles, such as 180&#x000b0;, 45&#x000b0;, 30&#x000b0; and 0&#x000b0; (as in the wild type). Subtle changes in <italic>atxth28</italic> expression spatially and temporally in stamen filaments would lead to significant differences in the capability for automatic self-pollination.</p><p>The relatively subtle phenotype of the <italic>atxth28</italic> mutant, shorter siliques for the first couple of flowers in the main inflorescence, suggests that there is a functional redundancy among members of the <italic>AtXTH</italic> family of genes. In fact, expression of <italic>AtXTH28</italic> was null in all flowers of the <italic>atxth28</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>B), although later developing siliques lengthened normally. We generated various combinations of double mutant lines between other closely related <italic>AtXTH</italic> genes using T-DNA insertion mutants. The severity of the phenotype found in the <italic>atxth28</italic> mutant was not enhanced in these double mutants compared with the single <italic>atxth28</italic> mutant. It is worth noting that the <italic>atxth27/atxth28</italic> double mutant did not increase the severity of the <italic>atxth28</italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>C). <italic>AtXTH27</italic> and <italic>AtXTH28</italic> originated from a gene duplication event and maintain a high degree of nucleotide sequence identity (Yokoyama and Nishitani <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2001</xref>). The mutation in <italic>AtXTH27</italic> causes a cell type-specific defect in the development of tracheary elements in expanding rosette leaves, but no observable defects in the developing inflorescence (Matsui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2005</xref>). This phenotype was also not enhanced in <italic>atxth27/atxth28</italic> double mutants, indicating that <italic>AtXTH28</italic> is not functionally redundant with <italic>AtXTH27</italic> and instead has evolved a non-overlapping, member-specific role in the development of stamen filaments.</p><p>The self-compatibility (SC) of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> is mainly caused by a disruption of the <italic>S</italic> locus genes <italic>SP11/SCR</italic> and <italic>SRK</italic>, components of a pollen&#x02013;stigma interaction (Shimizu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2008</xref>). This indicates that the ancestor of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> should have self-incompatibility (SI), and, in fact, <italic>A. lyrata</italic>, a wild relative of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, is an SI species. In addition, <italic>S</italic>-locus gene mutants showing SC were recently identified in <italic>Brassica</italic> (S. Isokawa, K. Suwabe and M. Watanabe, unpublished data), a species classified in the same family with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the Brassicaceae. These results indicate that disruption of <italic>S</italic>-locus genes leads to SC in several species of the Brassicaceae. SI is one of the genome barriers in plant reproduction and is controlled by the physiological mechanism mentioned above. In the case of the <italic>atxth28</italic> mutant, male and female components for reproduction are normal and functional, and a disruption of the gene for an enzyme involved in restructuring of the vascular cell wall in stamen filaments leads to repression of automatic self-pollination. Thus, physiological and morphological properties are critical for successful plant reproduction, and the <italic>atxth28</italic> mutant will offer an opportunity to explore the morphological aspects of pollination biology.</p><p>In conclusion, a gene potentially regulating cell wall construction and modification, <italic>AtXTH28</italic>, is involved in a self-pollination mechanism through a change in cell wall formation in stamen filaments, and the formation of the cell wall is important for correct stamen development. Thus, the <italic>AtXTH28</italic> gene can act as a model for linking a reproductive phenomenon to regulation of the cell wall structure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>The <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (L) Heynh Columbia (Col-0) background was used throughout the experiments.
