Little is known, however, about mechanisms that coordinate RPTP&#x003b1; activity with cell behavior.

NCAM associates with T- and L-type voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels, and NCAM clustering at the cell surface results in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx via these channels and activation of NCAM-associated calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II&#x003b1; (CaMKII&#x003b1;). Clustering of NCAM promotes its redistribution to lipid rafts and the formation of a NCAM&#x02013;RPTP&#x003b1;&#x02013;CaMKII&#x003b1; complex, resulting in serine phosphorylation of RPTP&#x003b1; by CaMKII&#x003b1;.

Adhesion molecules initiate recognition of the extracellular matrix and other cells, and, as transmembrane receptors, activate intracellular signaling cascades fundamental to all aspects of cell behavior. This line of communication is important not only during ontogenetic development but also in the adult nervous system during functional changes, such as learning, memory, and regeneration after traumatic injury. The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) has been recognized as an important mediator of cell interactions via its extracellular domain, which consists of immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin type III&#x02013;homologous structures that act as ligand and receptors in homophilic and heterophilic cell interactions. Two of the major isoforms of NCAM with molecular masses of 180 kD (NCAM180) and 140 kD (NCAM140) are transmembrane glycoproteins that trigger signaling cascades in the cell interior when clustered either by their natural ligands or by antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schuch et al., 1989</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maness and Schachner, 2007</xref>). Signaling cascades triggered by NCAM have been implicated in neurite outgrowth, neuronal survival, and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rutishauser et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">L&#x000fc;thi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bukalo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Walmod et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The most well-described intracellular signaling pathways activated by NCAM to induce neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation include activation of PKC with subsequent NCAM-dependent redistribution of the enzyme to cholesterol-enriched plasma membrane microdomains, so-called lipid rafts, where PKC activates GAP43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leshchyns'ka et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Korshunova et al., 2007</xref>). Association of PKC with NCAM depends on the FGF receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leshchyns'ka et al., 2003</xref>), which associates with NCAM and is activated in response to NCAM clustering at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Niethammer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kiselyov et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Another pathway includes activation of p59fyn (hereafter referred to as fyn)/FAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beggs et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">1997</xref>) being induced in response to NCAM clustering or via binding of the glial cell line&#x02013;derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) to NCAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Paratcha et al., 2003</xref>). Activation of this pathway depends on NCAM's association with glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, such as prion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Santuccione et al., 2005</xref>) and GFR&#x003b1;1, a cognate receptor for GDNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Paratcha et al., 2003</xref>), and palmitoylation of the intracellular domain of NCAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Niethammer et al., 2002</xref>), linking NCAM to p59fyn enriched in lipid rafts. We have previously found that this pathway is induced by NCAM140, which associates with the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase &#x003b1; (RPTP&#x003b1;) by direct interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bodrikov et al., 2005</xref>). When NCAM is clustered at the neuronal cell surface, the NCAM140&#x02013;RPTP&#x003b1; complex is further stabilized by the membrane&#x02013;cytoskeleton linker protein spectrin and redistributes to lipid rafts, where RPTP&#x003b1; binds to and activates fyn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bodrikov et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>We now present evidence that clustering of NCAM at the cell surface results in an enhancement of serine phosphorylation and phosphatase activity of RPTP&#x003b1;. By investigating the mechanisms of NCAM-dependent RPTP&#x003b1; activation, we found that PKC&#x003b4;, which had been shown in other studies to mediate activation of RPTP&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandt et al., 2003</xref>), is not involved in NCAM-induced activation. Instead, we identified calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II&#x003b1; (CaMKII&#x003b1;) as a previously unrecognized enzyme to bind to and phosphorylate RPTP&#x003b1; at two serine residues that increase the phosphatase activity of RPTP&#x003b1;. We show that clustering of NCAM at the cell surface induces lipid raft&#x02013;dependent activation of CaMKII&#x003b1;, which then phosphorylates RPTP&#x003b1; at the two serine residues, which, in turn, leads to activation of fyn. Overexpression of RPTP&#x003b1; mutated in both serine residues interferes with NCAM-induced neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons in vitro. These observations attribute an important role in the trifunctional interaction between NCAM, CaMKII&#x003b1;, and RPTP&#x003b1; in lipid rafts and thus add a new dimension in NCAM-mediated signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>NCAM up-regulates RPTP&#x003b1; activity by increasing its phosphorylation on Ser180 and Ser204</title><p>To analyze the role of NCAM in regulation of the phosphatase activity of RPTP&#x003b1;, RPTP&#x003b1; was immunoprecipitated from NCAM&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; and NCAM&#x02212;/&#x02212; brain lysates. We then used two commercially available phosphotyrosine-containing peptides derived from the epidermal growth factor receptor, which serve as substrates for many protein tyrosine phosphatases, and estimated the efficiency of the release of phosphate from these peptides in the presence of RPTP&#x003b1; immunoprecipitates.

(E) RPTP&#x003b1;-negative fibroblasts transfected with RPTP&#x003b1;WT alone or cotransfected with NCAM140 and RPTP&#x003b1;WT, RPTP&#x003b1;S180A, RPTP&#x003b1;S204A, or RPTP&#x003b1;S180/204A were treated with NCAM polyclonal antibodies or nonspecific rabbit IgG. Note that similar levels of NCAM140 were expressed in cells (lysates) and that similar levels of RPTP&#x003b1; were immunoprecipitated from the lysates (IP: HA-tag). Mutation of Ser180 and/or Ser204 does not influence coimmunoprecipitation of NCAM140 with RPTP&#x003b1;. Immunoprecipitated RPTP&#x003b1; was then subjected to the serine phosphorylation estimation by the alkaline hydrolysis (top) and phosphatase activity analysis (bottom). Application of NCAM antibodies but not IgG increased serine phosphorylation and phosphatase activity of RPTP&#x003b1;WT in NCAM140&#x02013;RPTP&#x003b1;WT&#x02013;cotransfected cells.

In addition, we estimated levels of phosphate released from serine residues of the immunoprecipitated RPTP&#x003b1; by alkaline treatment. Both methods showed that serine phosphorylation of RPTP&#x003b1; was reduced in NCAM&#x02212;/&#x02212; brains by &#x0223c;60% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B&#x02013;D</xref>).</p><p>Phosphorylation of Ser180 and Ser204 within RPTP&#x003b1; intracellular domain has been shown to be critical for the induction of RPTP&#x003b1; phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stetak et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zheng et al., 2002</xref>). To analyze the role of Ser180 and Ser204 in NCAM-mediated RPTP&#x003b1; regulation, an HA tag containing wild-type RPTP&#x003b1; (RPTP&#x003b1;WT) and RPTP&#x003b1; mutants with Ser180 (RPTP&#x003b1;S180A), Ser204 (RPTP&#x003b1;S204A), or both (RPTP&#x003b1;S180/204A) substituted with alanine were coexpressed with NCAM140 in RPTP&#x003b1;-deficient fibroblasts. Similar levels of NCAM140 coimmunoprecipitated with RPTP&#x003b1;WT and RPTP&#x003b1; mutants from lysates of transfected cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Thus, mutation of Ser180 and Ser204 does not affect the binding of RPTP&#x003b1; to NCAM. Clustering of NCAM140 at the surface of fibroblasts by NCAM antibodies increased levels of serine phosphorylation of RPTP&#x003b1;WT by &#x0223c;200% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). In contrast, phosphorylation of RPTP&#x003b1;S180A and RPTP&#x003b1;S180/204A in response to NCAM140 clustering was blocked, whereas phosphorylation of RPTP&#x003b1;S204A was partially inhibited (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Hence, Ser180 and Ser204 are phosphorylated in response to NCAM140 clustering, with Ser180 being required for NCAM-dependent RPTP&#x003b1; phosphorylation.</p><p>Phosphatase activity of RPTP&#x003b1;WT was increased after NCAM140 clustering by &#x0223c;250% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Phosphatase activity of RPTP&#x003b1; mutants, however, was reduced when compared with RPTP&#x003b1;WT. Mutation of Ser180 induced a stronger inhibitory effect on the catalytic activity of RPTP&#x003b1; when compared with Ser204 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). The catalytic activity of RPTP&#x003b1; was fully inhibited when both Ser180 and Ser204 were mutated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). In contrast to fibroblasts transfected with NCAM140, application of NCAM antibodies to the fibroblasts cotransfected with RPTP&#x003b1;WT and NCAM180 or NCAM120 did not result in phosphorylation and activation of RPTP&#x003b1;WT (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803045/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803045/DC1</ext-link>). Hence, NCAM140 is the major NCAM isoform involved in regulation of RPTP&#x003b1; activity.</p></sec><sec><title>NCAM does not regulate PKC&#x003b4; activity and its association with RPTP&#x003b1;</title><p>Previous studies indicated that among all PKC isoforms, only PKC&#x003b4; phosphorylates RPTP&#x003b1; on Ser180 and Ser204 in nonneuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">den Hertog et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tracy et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zheng et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandt et al., 2003</xref>). NCAM associates with and induces activation of several PKC isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leshchyns'ka et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kolkova et al., 2005</xref>), but its role in PKC&#x003b4; activation has not been analyzed. We thus analyzed whether NCAM regulates RPTP&#x003b1; phosphorylation by inducing PKC&#x003b4; activation. RPTP&#x003b1; coimmunoprecipitated with PKC&#x003b4; (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), and PKC&#x003b4; coimmunoprecipitated with NCAM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>) from brain lysates. However, levels of activated PKC&#x003b4; phosphorylated at Thr505 in the activation loop of the kinase were not changed in NCAM&#x02212;/&#x02212; brain homogenates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Furthermore, similar levels of activated PKC&#x003b4; coimmunoprecipitated with RPTP&#x003b1; from NCAM&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; and NCAM&#x02212;/&#x02212; brain lysates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Thus, NCAM does not regulate association of RPTP&#x003b1; with PKC&#x003b4;, nor does it regulate PKC&#x003b4; activation in the brain. In agreement, the most prominent NCAM isoform that coimmunoprecipitated with PKC&#x003b4; was the smallest GPI-linked NCAM isoform with a molecular mass of 120 kD (NCAM120; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). NCAM120 lacks the intracellular domain and therefore probably associates indirectly with PKC&#x003b4;, as has been shown for spectrin, another intracellular binding partner of NCAM120 that associates with NCAM120 via lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leshchyns'ka et al., 2003</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>PKC&#x003b4; associates with NCAM and RPTP&#x003b1; but its activity is not regulated by NCAM.</bold> (A and B) PKC&#x003b4; (A) or NCAM (B) immunoprecipitates (IP) from NCAM&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; brain lysates were analyzed by Western blotting as indicated.

These mutations within RPTP&#x003b1; did not affect binding of RPTP&#x003b1; to NCAM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Hence, RPTP&#x003b1; mutants overexpressed in neurons should act in a dominant-negative fashion by substituting for endogenous RPTP&#x003b1; in the NCAM&#x02013;RPTP&#x003b1; complex. Overexpression of RPTP&#x003b1;WT in neurons resulted in enhanced neurite outgrowth most likely caused by the nonspecific outgrowth-promoting activation of Src-family kinases by RPTP&#x003b1;WT (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 B</xref>). Exposure of GFP-transfected neurons to NCAM-Fc applied in the culture medium increased neurite lengths by &#x0223c;100% when compared with Fc-treated GFP-transfected control neurons (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 B</xref>).

However, neurites in NCAM-Fc&#x02013;treated RPTP&#x003b1;WT-transfected neurons were approximately two times longer than in NCAM-Fc&#x02013;treated GFP-transfected neurons, which indicates that RPTP&#x003b1;WT potentiates the response to NCAM-Fc (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 B</xref>). RPTP&#x003b1;S180A and RPTP&#x003b1;S204A mutants showed a reduced ability to promote neurite outgrowth and to enhance responsiveness to NCAM-Fc when compared with RPTP&#x003b1;WT (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 B</xref>). The RPTP&#x003b1;S180A mutant was strongly impaired in its ability to nonspecifically promote neurite outgrowth but did not completely block the response to NCAM-Fc. In contrast, the RPTP&#x003b1;S204A mutant strongly interfered with the response to NCAM-Fc but was still able to nonspecifically promote neurite outgrowth at a level that was not different from that of RPTP&#x003b1;WT. A plausible explanation for this observation is that Ser180 and Ser204 may play slightly distinct roles in the maintenance of the unregulated basal versus the NCAM-mediated, thus regulated, neurite outgrowth. A double mutant RPTP&#x003b1;S180/204 did not promote neurite outgrowth and totally blocked the NCAM-Fc&#x02013;induced response (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 B</xref>). Thus, we conclude that CaMKII&#x003b1;-mediated phosphorylation of Ser180 and Ser204 within the RPTP&#x003b1; intracellular domain is required for NCAM-induced neurite outgrowth.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have further explored the cascades of molecular interactions activated by the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM; the molecular players in the functional interconnection had been previously implicated in NCAM-dependent neurite outgrowth. The tyrosine kinase fyn was the first to be identified as an NCAM-associated signaling partner that triggers the MAP kinase/FAK-related downstream signaling of NCAM, leading to activation of transcription factors, such as CREB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beggs et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schmid et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jessen et al., 2001</xref>). The fyn pathway then became very important as a cosignaling pathway in NCAM-induced signaling, which needed to be activated in lipid rafts in parallel with the FGF receptor located outside of lipid rafts in order to trigger converging signaling cascades to enhance neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Niethammer et al., 2002</xref>). Because the intracellular domain of NCAM does not contain sequences known to induce fyn activation, we previously investigated the relationship between NCAM and the well-known activator of Src-family tyrosine kinases, of which fyn is a member, the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase RPTP&#x003b1;. RPTP&#x003b1; that dephosphorylates Tyr-531 of fyn to activate the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhandari et al., 1998</xref>) is highly enriched in neurons and growth cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Helmke et al., 1998</xref>), where it colocalizes with NCAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bodrikov et al., 2005</xref>). We identified RPTP&#x003b1; as a direct binding partner of NCAM140, linking this NCAM isoform to fyn. Interestingly, the interaction between NCAM and RPTP&#x003b1; was enhanced by spectrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bodrikov et al., 2005</xref>), which also interacts directly with the intracellular domains of the transmembrane isoforms of NCAM, NCAM140, and, in particular, NCAM180 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pollerberg et al., 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sytnyk et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leshchyns'ka et al., 2003</xref>) and indirectly via lipid rafts with the GPI-anchored isoform NCAM120 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leshchyns'ka et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we expand our previous findings by showing that clustering of NCAM at the cell surface enhances serine phosphorylation and phosphatase activity of RPTP&#x003b1;, thus identifying NCAM as the first recognition molecule and surface receptor that not only associates with but also regulates the catalytic activity of RPTP&#x003b1;. The catalytic phosphatase activity of RPTP&#x003b1; can be enhanced by PKC-mediated Ser180 and/or Ser204 phosphorylation of the intracellular domain of RPTP&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">den Hertog et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tracy et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stetak et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zheng et al., 2002</xref>), with PKC&#x003b4; but not other PKC isoforms playing the major role in the phosphorylation of RPTP&#x003b1; on Ser180 and Ser204 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandt et al., 2003</xref>). However, we found that PKC&#x003b4; is not involved in NCAM-induced activation. In agreement with this notion is the observation that 2.5&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;M of the PKC&#x003b4; inhibitor rottlerin did not inhibit RPTP&#x003b1; serine phosphorylation in nonstimulated NIH3T3 fibroblasts, and that very high concentrations of rottlerin (50 &#x003bc;M) only mildly affected RPTP&#x003b1; serine phosphorylation (unpublished data), which suggests that other enzymes are involved. Furthermore, we show that BisI, a PKC&#x003b4; inhibitor, does not block RPTP&#x003b1;-mediated fyn activation in response to NCAM clustering. Accordingly, we identified CaMKII&#x003b1; as a previously unrecognized enzyme that binds to and phosphorylates RPTP&#x003b1; at serine residues Ser180 and Ser204, increasing the phosphatase activity of RPTP&#x003b1;. We also show that CaMKII&#x003b1;, which associates with NCAM via spectrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sytnyk et al., 2006</xref>), is activated in response to clustering of NCAM at the cell surface. Calmodulin, which associates with RPTP&#x003b1; in the presence of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, may thus play a role in CaMKII&#x003b1; activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liang et al., 2000</xref>). NCAM-induced CaMKII&#x003b1; activation then leads to phosphorylation of RPTP&#x003b1; at Ser180 and Ser204, which, in turn, leads to activation of lipid raft-enriched fyn (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig10"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p><bold>A schematic model of molecular interactions induced by NCAM140 clustering and resulting in fyn activation.</bold> (A) Nonclustered NCAM140 resides outside of lipid rafts and does not associate with RPTP&#x003b1;, CaMKII&#x003b1; (shown as a holoenzyme), and fyn, which are present in inactive forms in the plasma membrane outside of lipid rafts, in the cytosol and in lipid rafts, respectively. (B) NCAM140 clustering induces palmitoylation of the intracellular domain of NCAM140 that promotes NCAM140 redistribution to lipid rafts, where it binds to prion protein (PrP). In parallel, NCAM140 clustering induces FGFR activation, promoting arachidonic acid production (not depicted), which results in arachidonic acid&#x02013;dependent Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Williams et al., 1994</xref>) via T- and L-type VDCC. An increase in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration promotes binding of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>/CaM to CaMKII&#x003b1;, releasing the catalytic domain of CaMKII&#x003b1; from inhibition by autoregulatory sequences proximal to the CaM binding site (not depicted). By associating with T- and L-type VDCC, NCAM anchors CaMKII&#x003b1;, which is bound to NCAM140 via spectrin, near the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx sites. NCAM-induced aggregation of CaMKII&#x003b1; in lipid rafts promotes transautophosphorylation of the CaMKII&#x003b1; holoenzymes at Thr286, resulting in the constitutive activation of CaMKII&#x003b1;. (C) In parallel to CaMKII&#x003b1; activation, NCAM140 promotes redistribution of RPTP&#x003b1; to lipid rafts. In lipid rafts, activated CaMKII&#x003b1; (only one CaMKII&#x003b1; molecule is shown for simplicity) phosphorylates RPTP&#x003b1; at Ser180 and Ser204, which changes the conformation of RPTP&#x003b1;, resulting in enzyme activation. (D) Activated RPTP&#x003b1; binds and dephosphorylates fyn at Tyr531, activating the enzyme. Downstream targets of active fyn include the Ras&#x02013;MAP (MAP) kinase pathway, the sustained activity of which is required for neuronal differentiation (not depicted).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1821185f10"></graphic></fig><p>Overexpression of RPTP&#x003b1; in neurons enhances basal neurite outgrowth rates, probably by nonspecific activation of Src-family kinases. Indeed, overexpression of RPTP&#x003b1; in nonneuronal cells results in persistent activation of Src, with concomitant cell transformation and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zheng et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2000</xref>), and mutation of Ser180 or Ser204 blocks neoplastic transformation of cells by RPTP&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zheng et al., 2002</xref>). This suggests that phosphorylation and activity of RPTP&#x003b1; are tightly regulated in normal cells. Homeostatic mechanisms that coordinate changes in RPTP&#x003b1; phosphatase activity are therefore intimately linked with the changes in cell behavior. It is thus not surprising that disturbance of the relationship of NCAM with RPTP&#x003b1; may link NCAM to tumorigenesis in different cell types that express NCAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavallaro and Christofori, 2004a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">b</xref>).</p><p>Our study again emphasizes the importance of lipid-enriched microdomains, the so-called lipid rafts. The fact that NCAM uses this signaling platform for fyn activation has previously been shown by ablating the palmitoylation sites in the intracellular domain of NCAM, which target the two major transmembrane isoforms of NCAM to lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Niethammer et al., 2002</xref>). NCAM-dependent fyn activation was also reduced in prion protein-deficient mice, which correlates with reduced levels of NCAM in lipid rafts isolated from these mice and implicates prion protein as a lipid raft&#x02013;recruiting signal for NCAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Santuccione et al., 2005</xref>). In this study, we provide further details on the molecular interactions induced by NCAM in lipid rafts by showing that if the targeting of NCAM140 to lipid rafts is disturbed, NCAM-induced activation of CaMKII&#x003b1; in lipid rafts and subsequent phosphorylation and activation of RPTP&#x003b1;, and thus of fyn, are reduced. Because aggregation and oligomerization of CaMKII&#x003b1; is necessary for full activation of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hudmon et al., 2005</xref>), we propose that the special environment of lipid rafts promotes oligomerization of NCAM-associated CaMKII&#x003b1; to induce its full activation (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). In agreement, clustering of NCAM increases the levels of detergent-insoluble oligomerized CaMKII&#x003b1; in cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sytnyk et al., 2006</xref>). Association of NCAM with T- and L-type VDCC accumulating in lipid rafts should then bring CaMKII&#x003b1; into the vicinity of the sites of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx into the cell (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). Thus, our present study confirms the importance of lipid rafts in cell signaling for neurite outgrowth. The generation of such platforms during ontogenetic development appears to be crucial for neurite outgrowth. It will be interesting to determine whether such cell adhesion molecule-mediated platforms are required for synaptic plasticity in the adult brain, which requires functional and structural modifications of synaptic membranes and associated signaling mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies and toxins</title><p>Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against NCAM (for biochemical and immunocytochemical experiments; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Niethammer et al., 2002</xref>) and rat monoclonal antibodies H28 against NCAM (for immunocytochemical experiments; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gennarini et al., 1984</xref>) were against the extracellular domain of all NCAM isoforms.

Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine and Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. When indicated, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml NCAM polyclonal antibodies or 10 &#x003bc;g/ml nonspecific rabbit IgG were applied to cells for 10 min. 10 &#x003bc;M KN62 was applied 1 h before stimulation, and NCAM antibodies were applied (as described in the Clustering of NCAM at the neuronal cell surface section) but in the presence of KN62. To deplete cholesterol from lipid rafts, cultures were incubated for 15 min with 5 mM methyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin (MCD; Sigma-Aldrich) before stimulation, and NCAM antibodies were applied (as described in the Clustering of NCAM at the neuronal cell surface section) but in the presence of MCD. All reagents were applied in culture medium at 37&#x000b0;C in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation and coimmunoprecipitation</title><p>Brain homogenates were prepared using 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. Samples containing 1 mg of total protein were lysed for 40 min on ice with RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, 1 mM NaF, 2 mM NaVO<sub>4</sub>, 0.1 mM PMSF, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]). In experiments with transiently transfected CHO cells, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed 30 min on ice with RIPA buffer. After centrifugation, supernatants were cleared with protein A/G&#x02013;agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 3 h at 4&#x000b0;C, then incubated with corresponding antibodies or control IgG for 1.5 h at 4&#x000b0;C followed by precipitation with protein A/G&#x02013;agarose beads for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C. The beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer and twice with PBS, then analyzed by immunoblotting.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of cytosolic, total membrane, and lipid raft fractions</title><p>Brain homogenates were prepared using a Potter homogenizer in HOMO buffer (1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 5 mM Tris, pH 7.4) containing 0.32 M sucrose (HOMO-A) and centrifuged at 700 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C to pellet nuclei and mitochondria. The resulted supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 <italic>g</italic> at 4&#x000b0;C for 30 min. Supernatants obtained after centrifugation were used as fractions enriched in cytosolic proteins, whereas pellets were used as total membrane fractions. Rafts were isolated from total membrane fractions as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leshchyns'ka et al., 2003</xref>). In brief, membranes were resuspended in ice-cold TBS, pH 7.5, and extracted for 20 min on ice with 4 volumes of 1% Triton X-100 in TBS. Extracted membranes were mixed with equal volume of 80% sucrose in 0.2 M sodium carbonate, overlaid sequentially with 30% sucrose in TBS, 10% sucrose in TBS, and TBS, and centrifuged at 230,000 <italic>g</italic> for 17 h at 4&#x000b0;C. The lipid raft fraction was collected at the interface between 10 and 30% sucrose, pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 <italic>g</italic> for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C, and resuspended in TBS. Total protein concentration was measured using the BC kit (Interchim).</p></sec><sec><title>Recombinant proteins</title><p>Human Fc-tagged extracellular domain of mouse NCAM and GST-tagged intracellular domains of RPTP&#x003b1; were used as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bodrikov et al., 2005</xref>). Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II&#x003b1; (CaMKII&#x003b1;) was obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc.</p></sec><sec><title>In vitro phosphorylation</title><p>Recombinant CaMKII&#x003b1; or CaMKII&#x003b1; immunopurified from rat brain (BIOMOL International, L.P.) was activated according to the manufacturer's instructions. For analysis of the phosphorylation in vitro, proteins were immunoprecipitated from CHO cells, fibroblasts, or brain homogenates as described in the Immunoprecipitation and coimmunoprecipitation section. Mock immunoprecipitation with nonspecific IgG served as a control of immunoprecipitation specificity, and beads with immunoprecipitated nonspecific IgG obtained after mock immunoprecipitation were used as control in phosphorylation reactions. Beads were then washed twice with RIPA buffer, three times with TBS, and diluted in TBS. To analyze phosphorylation of recombinant RPTP&#x003b1;-ID, they were coupled to glutathione beads. Glutathione beads with GST coupled instead of RPTP&#x003b1;-ID were used as control. Beads were washed three times with TBS and diluted in TBS. Equal volumes of control beads or beads with proteins of interest were incubated for 30 min at 30&#x000b0;C in CaMKII&#x003b1; reaction buffer (New England Biolabs, Inc.) supplemented with 200 &#x003bc;M ATP in the presence of activated CaMKII&#x003b1;, then washed with TBS, centrifuged for 1 min, and used for Western blot analysis or protein phosphorylation estimation.</p></sec><sec><title>Estimation of the serine phosphorylation of RPTP&#x003b1;</title><p>Serine/threonine phosphorylation was analyzed by the alkaline hydrolysis of phosphate from seryl and threonyl residues in phosphoproteins. Because mutations of Ser180 and Ser204 within RPTP&#x003b1;-ID completely inhibited serine/threonine phosphorylation of RPTP&#x003b1;, we refer to this method as to the analysis of serine phosphorylation of RPTP&#x003b1; throughout the text. In brief, beads containing phosphorylated and control proteins were treated with 1 N NaOH for 30 min at 65&#x000b0;C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of a similar volume of 3.1 N HCl, and released phosphate was measured using Malachite green phosphate detection kit (R&#x00026;D Systems) according to manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the RPTP&#x003b1; phosphatase activity</title><p>Control beads and beads with immunoprecipitated RPTP&#x003b1; were washed twice with RIPA buffer, three times with TBS, and diluted in TBS.

Phosphatase activity was measured using a nonradioactive phosphatase assay system (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting</title><p>Proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose transfer membrane (PROTRAN; Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 5 mA. Immunoblots were blocked in milk and incubated with appropriate primary antibodies followed by incubation with peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies and visualized using Super Signal West Pico reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on BIOMAX film (Sigma-Aldrich). For immunoblots labeled with phospho-specific antibodies, 3% of BSA was used instead of milk. Molecular weight markers were prestained protein standards from Bio-Rad Laboratories. For quantitative comparisons of chemiluminescence between the lanes, the same amounts of total protein or equal amounts of immunoprecipitates were loaded in each lane. All preparations were performed three times and at least two Western blots were performed with an individual sample (<italic>n</italic> &#x02265; 6). Values from all Western blots were used to calculate mean values and standard errors of the mean. The chemiluminescence quantification was performed using TINA 2.09 software (University of Manchester) or Scion Image for Windows (Scion Corporation). Group comparisons were made using a paired <italic>t</italic> test.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows the analysis of the Ser180 and Ser204 phosphorylation and phosphatase activity of RPTP&#x003b1;WT, expressed in RPTP&#x003b1;-negative fibroblasts alone or together with NCAM120 or NCAM180, after application of NCAM polyclonal antibodies or nonspecific rabbit IgG to transfected fibroblasts.
