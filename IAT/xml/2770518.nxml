Although there have been great strides in behavioral prevention and medical treatment of HIV/AIDS, for the last several years the pandemic has claimed about 2.5 million lives annually <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.unaids.org"/> and remains unchecked. It is predicted that 20-60 million people will become infected over the next two decades even if there is a 2.5% annual decrease in HIV infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Studies of the HIV-1 life cycle led to the development of drugs targeting viral proteins important for viral infection, most notably reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors. Despite the success of combinations of these drugs in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 strains that are facilitated by the high mutation and recombination rates of the virus in conjunction with its prolific replication poses a serious limitation to current treatments. An attractive strategy to circumvent this problem entails targeting host factors that are recruited by the virus to complete its life cycle.</p><p>HIV-1 replication requires numerous cellular as well as viral factors, creating a large set of novel potential targets for drug therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The premise is that compounds directed against a cellular factor that is exploited during HIV-1 gene expression may block viral replication without adverse effects. One such cellular factor is eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A, formerly eIF-4D). eIF5A is the only protein known to contain the amino acid hypusine. The protein occurs in two isoforms, of which eIF5A-1 is usually the more abundant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and has been implicated in HIV-1 replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Over-expression of mutant eIF5A, or interference with hypusine formation, inhibits HIV-1 replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. eIF5A has been implicated in Rev-dependent nuclear export of HIV-1 RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Originally characterized as a protein synthesis initiation factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], the precise function(s) of eIF5A remain elusive. It has been implicated in translation elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], mRNA stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It is tightly associated with actively translating ribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and is an RNA-binding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Consequently, it has been suggested to function as a specific initiation factor for a subset of mRNAs encoding proteins that participate in cell cycle control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Its biological roles encompass cancer, maintenance of the cytoskeletal architecture, neuronal growth and survival, differentiation and regulation of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The mature form of eIF5A-1 is associated with intraepithelial neoplasia of the vulva [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] while the eIF5A-2 gene is amplified and expressed at high level in ovarian carcinoma and cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Reduction of eIF5A levels slowed proliferation and led to cell cycle arrest in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In mammalian cells, inhibitors of hypusine formation arrest the cell cycle at the G1/S boundary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]; they also led to reduced proliferation of leukemic cells and sensitized Bcr-Abl positive cells to imatinib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>Maturation of eIF5A involves both acetylation and hypusination and is necessary for most if not all of its biological roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Hypusine is formed by the posttranslational modification of a specific lysine residue in both eIF5A isoforms throughout the archaea and eukaryota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Hypusine, the enzymes responsible for its formation, and eIF5A itself, are highly conserved in eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. This modification of eIF5A entails two consecutive steps (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In the first step, deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) catalyzes the cleavage of the polyamine spermidine and the transfer of its 4-aminobutyl moiety to the &#x003b5;-amino group of lysine-50 (in human eIF5A-1) of the eIF5A precursor, yielding a deoxyhypusine-containing intermediate. In the second step, deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH) hydroxylates the deoxyhypusyl-eIF5A intermediate to hypusine-containing mature eIF5A using molecular oxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. DOHH is essential in <italic>C. elegans </italic>and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, but not in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], indicative of a requirement for fully modified eIF5A at least in higher eukaryotes. The non-heme iron in the catalytic center of DOHH renders the enzyme susceptible to small molecule inhibitors that conform to the steric restrictions imposed by the active site pocket and interact with the metal via bidentate coordination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibition of HIV replication by drugs that block eIF5A modification</bold>. <bold>A</bold>. Hypusination of eIF5A (gray) occurs in two steps: the transfer, catalyzed by DHS, of an aminobutyl moiety (blue) from spermidine onto the side chain of eIF5A lysine-50, yielding deoxyhypusine (Dhp); and its subsequent hydroxylation, catalyzed by DOHH, yielding hypusine (Hpu).

Amount of released p24 protein per million viable cells was determined every 24 hr. <bold>D</bold>. CPX and DEF inhibit gene expression from an HIV molecular clone in a dose dependant manner. The molecular clone pNL4-3-LucE<sup>- </sup>and pCMV-Ren were transfected into 293T cells and drugs were added to the concentrations shown.

Data are means of three time points (12, 18 and 24 hr) presented as percentages.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-6-90-1"/></fig><p>The pharmaceuticals ciclopirox (CPX) and deferiprone (DEF) are drugs that block DOHH activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Both drugs are metal-binding hydroxypyridinones (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). CPX is a topical antifungal (e.g., Batrafen&#x02122;) and DEF is a medicinal chelator (e.g., Ferriprox&#x02122;) taken orally for systemic iron overload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. DEF has been shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication in latently-infected ACH-2 cells after phorbol ester induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and in peripheral blood lymphocytes but not in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>].</p><p>Here we report that clinically relevant concentrations of CPX and DEF block HIV-1 infection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We investigated the early effects of the drugs on gene expression from HIV-1 molecular clones in model systems. Both drugs disrupt eIF5A maturation by blocking the binding of DOHH to its substrate. We show that they inhibit gene expression from HIV molecular clones at the RNA level. The drugs act specifically on the viral LTR, with no discernible requirement for viral proteins, and reduce RNA synthesis from the HIV-1 promoter at the level of transcription initiation. Consistent with eIF5A being a target for these drugs, partial depletion of eIF5A-1 by RNA interference also inhibits HIV-1 promoter-driven gene expression, and this inhibition is non-additive with that caused by the drugs. We conclude that the action of CPX and DEF is at least in part a result of the inhibition of eIF5A hydroxylation, suggesting that cellular DOHH could serve as an antiretroviral target without incurring gross topical or systemic toxicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Antiviral activity of ciclopirox and deferiprone</title><p>To examine the effect of CPX and DEF on HIV-1 propagation, uninfected PBMCs from healthy donors were co-cultured with HIV-infected PBMCs, and virus production was monitored by the p24 capture assay. In untreated cultures, p24 was first detected at 96 hr and its levels increased until up to 144 hr (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>; Control). Addition of CPX and DEF at 48 hr, to 30 &#x003bc;M and 250 &#x003bc;M respectively, reduced p24 to baseline levels. This profound inhibition is due, at least in part, to activation of apoptosis at later stages of infection ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]; unpublished data). These concentrations are within the clinically relevant range and are sufficient to block DOHH activity and eIF5A modification (see below). Agent P2, a chelation homolog of CPX (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), did not impede p24 production (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). These findings suggested that the inhibition of HIV replication by CPX and DEF could be due to inhibition of DOHH and eIF5A maturation.</p><p>We selected 293T cells as a model system to explore the relationship between the drugs, eIF5A, and HIV gene expression. These cells efficiently transcribe HIV-1 genes from molecular clones as well as subviral constructs, allowing for early detection of changes in HIV gene expression. To establish the system, we examined the effect of CPX and DEF on the expression of firefly luciferase (FF) from the HIV-1 molecular clone pNL4-3-LucE<sup>- </sup>that was engineered to carry the FF gene in place of the viral <italic>nef </italic>gene. The molecular clone was transfected into 293T cells together with the pCMV-Ren vector that expresses <italic>Renilla </italic>luciferase (Ren) from the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promoter as a control for transfection efficiency and non-specific effects of the compounds. Dual luciferase assays were conducted at 12 hr post-transfection. Results are expressed as relative luciferase activity (FF:Ren). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, the drugs repressed expression from the HIV-1 molecular clone in a dose dependent fashion. Long-term drug exposure leads to pleiotropic effects including apoptosis ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]; unpublished data), but marginal 293T cell death was observed within 24 hr using these concentrations of CPX and DEF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, inset). We therefore characterized the action of CPX and DEF on eIF5A and HIV gene expression in 293T cells during the first 12 to 24 hr of drug treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Drug effects on eIF5A and DOHH</title><p>To examine the effect of the drugs on the synthesis of modified eIF5A, 293T cells transfected with a FLAG-tagged eIF5A expression vector were simultaneously treated with CPX or DEF. FLAG-eIF5A was monitored using NIH-353 and anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,B</xref>). The NIH-353 antibody reacts preferentially with post-translationally modified eIF5A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. CPX reduced the appearance of mature eIF5A over the 3-30 &#x003bc;M concentration range, while DEF was effective at 200-400 &#x003bc;M. The drugs did not alter the expression of actin. Comparable results have been obtained in other cell types by spermidine labeling of eIF5A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In addition to the CPX homolog Agent P2, we used deferoxamine (DFOX; Desferal&#x02122;) as a control compound. DFOX, a metal-binding hydroxamate like CPX and Agent P2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), is a globally used medicinal iron chelator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] that does not inhibit HIV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. In contrast to CPX and DEF, P2 and DFOX had little or no effect on the appearance of mature FLAG-eIF5A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,B</xref>), indicating that the ability to chelate iron is insufficient to inhibit DOHH and the maturation of eIF5A. None of these compounds reduced the overall expression of the FLAG-eIF5A protein detectably (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), ruling out general inhibitory effects on gene expression. Based on these results, we used 30 &#x003bc;M CPX and 250 &#x003bc;M DEF for subsequent experiments.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Ciclopirox and deferiprone prevent the maturation of eIF5A</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

Complexes that immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody were immunoblotted and probed with antibodies against DOHH. Endogenous DOHH co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-eIF5A, and this association was largely prevented by treatment with CPX or DEF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, top panel). Consistent with their inability to inhibit eIF5A maturation, neither P2 or DFOX prevented the formation of the eIF5A:DOHH complex.

No DOHH was associated with FLAG-eIF5A in the presence of GC7 because it prevents the synthesis of deoxyhypusyl-eIF5A.

Reciprocally, the interaction between endogenous eIF5A and tagged DOHH was inhibited by CPX and DEF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>, right). Similarly, the interaction of endogenous eIF5A with tagged DHS was inhibited by GC7 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>, left) but was resistant to CPX and DEF (not shown). We conclude that CPX and DEF, but not P2 or DFOX, target DOHH and inhibit its interaction with its substrate, deoxyhypusyl-eIF5A.</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of gene expression from HIV-1 molecular clones</title><p>To explore the mechanism whereby CPX and DEF inhibit HIV gene expression, we first examined the specificity of their effect on the expression from the pNL4-3-LucE<sup>- </sup>molecular clone.

We next examined the effects of CPX and DEF on viral mRNA expression. The sensitivity of FF expression from pNL4-3-LucE<sup>- </sup>to these drugs suggested that the inhibition of RNA accumulation is independent of Rev since the FF sequences are substituted into the <italic>nef </italic>gene which gives rise to spliced mRNA. To determine whether the action of CPX and DEF is exerted at the level of the accumulation, splicing or nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of HIV RNA, we transfected pNL4-3-LucE<sup>- </sup>into 293T cells and monitored spliced and unspliced HIV RNA after drug treatment. RNase protection assays were carried out using a probe complementary to the 5' region of all HIV-1 transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. The probe spans the major splice donor site so as to generate two sizes of protected fragments: unspliced RNA protects an RNA fragment 50 nucleotides (nt) longer than that from spliced RNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). CPX and DEF, but not P2, reduced the level of both spliced and unspliced RNAs by ~50% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). A similar reduction was observed in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. In contrast, the production of <italic>Renilla </italic>luciferase RNA driven by the CMV promoter was unchanged in the nucleus and cytoplasm after drug treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).

Because previous reports indicated that modified eIF5A is involved in the Rev-dependent export of unspliced and underspliced HIV-1 RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], we examined whether the drugs affect the splicing or export of viral RNAs mediated by Rev. The <italic>rev</italic>-defective molecular clone pMRev(-) contains the entire HIV-1 genome but Rev expression is prevented by substitutions in its initiation codon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. To compare the inhibitory effect of CPX and DEF in the presence and absence of Rev, cells were transfected with pMRev(-), either with or without a Rev expression vector, and RNA was analyzed by RPA as above. As expected, in the absence of Rev there was very little unspliced RNA in the cytoplasm although substantial levels were present in the nucleus, and Rev expression increased the level of unspliced RNA in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Treatment with CPX or DEF reduced the levels of both spliced and unspliced RNAs in the nucleus and cytoplasm by 2-3 fold irrespective of the presence or absence of Rev (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Similar data were obtained in COS7 cells (not shown). These results indicate that the drugs inhibited HIV-1 RNA accumulation by a mechanism that is independent of Rev-mediated viral RNA splicing and export. This finding is consistent with the inhibition of FF expression from pNL4-3-LucE<sup>- </sup>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Furthermore, since pMRev(-) contains an intact <italic>nef </italic>gene, we can rule out the possibility that the findings with pNL4-3lucE<sup>- </sup>are a consequence of the absence of <italic>nef </italic>from this molecular clone.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic requirements for drug sensitivity</title><p>The data obtained with pMRev(-) excluded involvement in the drug responses of the <italic>env </italic>mutation, <italic>nef </italic>deletion and FF gene insertion in pNL4-3lucE<sup>-</sup>, as well as the <italic>rev </italic>gene. To search for viral elements that confer sensitivity to CPX and DEF in these short-term experiments, we generated a series of truncations of the HIV-1 genome. Unique restriction sites were exploited to delete major open reading frames from pNL4-3-lucE<sup>- </sup>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).

These two deletions encompass nearly all of the viral coding sequences. Nevertheless, FF expression from these constructs was inhibited &#x02265;50% by CPX and DEF within 12 hr (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). (Note that Tat-deficient constructs were complemented by co-transfection of a Tat expression vector in these assays.)

To determine whether the drugs inhibit at the elongation step, we examined their effect on HIV-1 transcripts generated in COS7 cells co-transfected with pLTR-FF and pCMV-Ren in the presence or absence of a Tat expression vector. Nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA was analyzed in RNase protection assays using a probe complementary to the promoter-proximal region of HIV transcripts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).

To examine the effect of eIF5A hydroxylation directly we attempted to deplete DOHH by RNA interference. No significant effect on eIF5A modification or HIV gene expression was detected. This is probably because the level of DOHH was not reduced below 60% (data not shown). We therefore turned to siRNA directed against eIF5A-1 itself. Compared to non-targeted control siRNA, eIF5A-1 siRNA reduced the level of its cognate RNA by ~80% at 24 hr (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>).

Although the magnitude of this effect was relatively modest, presumably because of incomplete depletion of eIF5A, two observations attest to its importance. First, the inhibition of HIV-driven gene expression correlated with eIF5A knockdown and recovery (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>, lower panel) indicating that targeted reduction of eIF5A expression correlates with inhibition of HIV-driven gene expression. Second, the effects of the drugs and siRNA were not additive. When cells transfected with siRNA for 3 or 4 days were exposed to the drugs for the last 12 hr of this period, eIF5A knockdown did not elicit a further inhibition of HIV-1 gene expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). While additional actions cannot be excluded, these observations are consistent with the drugs functioning in the hypusine pathway to inhibit HIV-1 RNA accumulation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>HIV-1 replication can be inhibited by disruption at several different levels of the pathway leading to the post-translational modification of eIF5A with hypusine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. The formation of hypusine from lysine requires the sequential action of the enzymes DHS and DOHH. We found that two drugs, CPX and DEF, block eIF5A maturation by inhibiting the interaction between DOHH and its substrate, deoxyhypusyl-eIF5A. At clinically used concentrations, the drugs profoundly inhibited HIV-1 infection in long-term cultures and rapidly reduced HIV-1 gene expression in model systems. CPX and DEF both impaired transcription from the HIV-1 promoter independently of all known viral genes, a mode of action that would be expected to decrease the likelihood of resistance arising during drug treatment. Enhanced susceptibility to apoptosis was reported in an HIV-1 infected cell line treated with DEF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and similar findings have been made in PBMCs with both DEF and CPX (Hanauske-Abel et al., in preparation). Hence we propose that inhibition of HIV-1 transcription by these drugs ultimately leads to loss of viral control over the survival of infected cells and to their apoptotic ablation, as outlined in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Scheme for inhibition of HIV-1 infection by CPX and DEF</bold>.

In phase I the drugs cause a reduction in the expression of HIV proteins, some of which are necessary to prevent apoptosis of HIV infected cells. Apoptosis of infected cells takes place during phase II in the presence of the drugs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-6-90-8"/></fig><sec><title>CPX and DEF actions</title><p>Despite divergent chemical structures, CPX and DEF both act as potent inhibitors of eIF5A maturation in cells and <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. DEF is in clinical use as an orally active medicinal chelator for treatment of transfusion-related iron overload, and CPX is employed as a topical antifungal. After oral medication, the concentration of DEF in serum can reach and exceed 250 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. The topical preparations of CPX, which contain up to 57.5 mM of the agent, achieve levels in excess of 30 &#x003bc;M in skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. Our results were obtained at 250 &#x003bc;M DEF and 30 &#x003bc;M CPX, concentrations well within the range of the drugs' clinically relevant levels. At these concentrations, CPX and DEF can reduce bioavailable intracellular iron levels as determined with an iron-sensitive reporter system, but this effect does not correlate with their antiretroviral action (unpublished data). The medicinal chelator DFOX, which also reduced bioavailable intracellular iron levels, did not inhibit gene expression from the HIV molecular clone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) or block HIV-1 replication when used at clinically relevant levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. This lack of inhibition is consistent with its lack of clinical antiretroviral activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]. Several other chelators have been reported to inhibit HIV-1 replication via various possible mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>], among them the biologically distinct tridentate drug deferasirox (ICL670) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>]. Agent P2, a bidentate chelation homolog of CPX lacking its hydrophobic cyclohexyl group, displayed little or no activity in our cell-based assays. Thus, the inhibitory action of CPX and DEF on HIV-1 transcription is not merely a consequence of their ability to coordinate and deplete bioavailable iron by bidentate chelation.</p><p>CPX and DEF destabilized the interaction between DOHH and deoxyhypusyl-eIF5A, resulting in a marked decrease in the appearance of newly synthesized mature eIF5A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The drugs did not prevent eIF5A from forming a complex with DHS, which is consistent with the accumulation of deoxyhypusyl-eIF5A in the presence of either drug at concentrations that completely blocked DOHH activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Neither DFOX nor P2 had any effect on the binding of eIF5A to DOHH, in accordance with their failure to inhibit the formation of hypusinyl-eIF5A. On the other hand, the DHS inhibitor GC7 blocked formation of lysyl-eIF5A:DHS complexes, causing a marked decrease in the levels of deoxyhypusyl-eIF5A and its complexes with DOHH. These findings, supported by molecular modeling (Hanauske-Abel et al., unpublished data), lead us to propose that CPX and DEF enter the deoxyhypusine-binding pocket of DOHH, become oriented towards its catalytic iron atom and chelate it. The drug-iron chelate is then released from the apoenzyme, which irreversible collapses into a catalytically inactive molecule incapable of binding substrate. Supporting this mechanism, DEF is known to cause release of peptide-bound iron from several non-heme metalloproteins, among them mono- and diferric transferrin, cyclooxygenase, and lipoxygenase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Drug effects on HIV-1 gene expression</title><p>We analyzed the action of the drugs in a model system consisting of 293T cells transfected with HIV-1 molecular clones. Within 12 hours of their addition, CPX and DEF inhibited gene expression from two different molecular clones, impairing transcription from the viral promoter at the level of initiation. This conclusion is supported by several observations: the inhibition was dependent on the HIV-1 5'-LTR. No specific effects were detectable on transcription elongation or on downstream mRNA processing, transport or stability. Gene expression from another promoter (the CMV immediate early promoter) and the levels of cellular proteins (actin, eIF5A) were unaffected by CPX and DEF. It is notable that hydroxyurea, which has clinically relevant antiretroviral activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>], also rapidly inhibits transactivation of the HIV promoter to a similar degree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>]. While the concentrations of hydroxyurea required exceed those of CPX by almost two orders of magnitude, the presence of a hydroxyurea-like domain in the CPX structure may imply a common mechanism of action.</p><p>eIF5A has also been reported to play post-transcriptional roles in HIV gene expression. The work of Hauber and colleagues identified eIF5A as a cellular cofactor for Rev [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], leading to the expectation that CPX and DEF would block the export of under-spliced HIV-1 RNAs from the nucleus in a Rev-dependent manner. This prediction was not substantiated in our experiments, however. First, the sensitivity of FF expression from pNL4-3-LucE<sup>- </sup>to the drugs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) implies a Rev-independent action because the FF luciferase gene is inserted into the HIV-1 <italic>nef </italic>gene. The HIV-1 <italic>nef </italic>gene's mRNA is fully spliced and transported independently of Rev. Second, the drugs reduced the accumulation of unspliced and spliced RNA from pNL4-3-LucE<sup>- </sup>to approximately equal extents and the decrease in RNA accumulation occurred in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Third, the drugs inhibited RNA expression from the <italic>rev</italic>-minus molecular clone pMRev(-) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), and from several deletion constructs that lack <italic>rev </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). We therefore conclude that Rev is not involved in the effects of CPX and DEF reported here. Similarly, CPX and DEF inhibited the expression of p24, which is translated from incompletely spliced <italic>gag </italic>mRNA, to about the same extent as FF, generated from spliced mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). In another study, DEF and mimosine (a naturally occurring analog) were shown to reduce the association of <italic>gag </italic>mRNA with polysomes, implying an effect on p24 synthesis at the translational level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. While this action could be compatible with an eIF5A role in protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], it does not comport with the inhibition of transcription documented here. Sharp differences between the experimental systems employed mitigate against direct comparisons. The findings of Andrus and co-workers were made using latently infected ACH-2 cells induced by a phorbol ester [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], which entails multiple effects including sequelae of PKC activation. Moreover, the experiments were conducted over a longer term than those reported here, increasing the opportunity for additional effects to be manifested. The short time span of our experiments was designed to uncover the primary effects of the drugs on HIV-1 gene expression. Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that eIF5A also affects other processes and these effects may become more evident with longer drug exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of eIF5A</title><p>eIF5A-1 depletion by siRNA reduced HIV-driven gene expression in a manner that was not additive with the action of CPX and DEF. DOHH knockdown by siRNA did not significantly impair HIV gene expression in 293T cells, but expression from the viral promoter was reduced by ~50% in HeLa cells (data not shown). Knockdown of DHS or of eIF5A-1 in HeLa cells elicited similar effects. Although other drug actions (including the inhibition of other hydroxylases) are not excluded, these findings strengthen the view that the sensitivity of HIV-1 to CPX and DEF results at least in part from their action on eIF5A maturation. How this affects transcription initiation remains to be elucidated. Despite a large body of literature documenting the function of eIF5A at various levels of gene expression, its mechanism(s) of action remain elusive. Interestingly, connections exist between eIF5A and HIV transcription via the cell cycle: hypusine-containing eIF5A is required for G1/S passage as noted above, and HIV-1 is transcribed efficiently in the G2 phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">92</xref>] although not exclusively so [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>]. Thus, inhibition of eIF5A modification could affect both HIV transcription and the cell cycle through eIF5A-dependant cellular components that are common to both pathways. Further work will be required to define the function of mature eIF5A in HIV-1 infection and to establish the sequence of molecular events engendered by CPX and DEF. Our findings provide a mechanistic rationale to study such drugs for their ability to suppress HIV-1 infection in patients, and encourage the development of antiretroviral agents that target the posttranslational formation of hypusine in eIF5A.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Ciclopirox and deferiprone, two clinically used drugs, block HIV-1 infection. In model systems, the drugs inhibit the enzyme DOHH required for maturation of eIF5A and repress expression from the HIV-1 promoter at the level of transcription initiation. Our results support the concept that drugs targeting DOHH should be tested clinically for HIV-1 inhibition and could be developed as antiretrovirals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Deferiprone was purchased from Calbiochem. Ciclopirox, deferoxamine and actinomycin D were purchased from Sigma. Agent P2 was synthesized and characterized as described by Hanauske-Abel et al. (in preparation).

The HIV-1 molecular clone pMRev(-), and the Rev expression vector, plasmid pCMV-Rev, were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. FLAG-tagged Rev and eIF5A expression vectors were made by sub-cloning Rev and eIF5A sequences respectively, into the pcDNA3.1FLAG vector. pBSII-HIV+80-340 was constructed by subcloning PCR-amplified HIV-1 sequence (+80-340) from pNL4-3-LucE<sup>- </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">94</xref>] into the pBSIIKS+ Bluescript vector. pNL4-3-LucE<sup>- </sup>truncations were generated by deleting sequences using suitable restriction enzymes. Truncation III was made by deleting sequence from nt 1506 to 5784 using SpeI and SalI enzymes. Similarly, truncations IV (nt 5784 to 8464) and V (nt 712 to 8464) were made with SaII and BamHI and with BssHII and BamHI, respectively. The plasmid pGL2TAR was obtained from Dr. David Price and contains most of the HIV-1 LTR (from KpnI to HindIII). To generate construct VI, the HindIII to PflM1 sequence from pGL2TAR was replaced by the HindIII to XhoI sequence from construct V. Construct VII (pLTR-FF) was made by substituting the sequence between the ClaI and BsgI sites of pGL2TAR with the ClaI to BsgI fragment from construct VI.</p></sec><sec><title>HIV-1 infection of PBMC cultures</title><p>Uninfected PBMCs from a healthy donor were incubated with infected PBMCs at a 10:1 ratio (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells) in 24-well microplates in RPMI medium with antibiotics, glutamate, IL-2 and 10% fetal calf serum.
