However, the role of this enzyme in determining drug pharmacokinetics <italic>in vivo</italic> and the consequential effects on drug absorption distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity are unclear. In order to resolve this issue, we have carried out the conditional deletion of microsomal cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> in the liver to create the hepatic microsomal cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> null mouse. These mice develop and breed normally and have no overt phenotype. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies using a range of substrates for different P450 enzymes showed that in hepatic microsomal cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> null NADH-mediated metabolism was essentially abolished for most substrates, and the NADPH-dependent metabolism of many substrates was reduced by 50&#x02013;90%. This reduction in metabolism was also reflected in the <italic>in vivo</italic> elimination profiles of several drugs, including midazolam, metoprolol, and tolbutamide. In the case of chlorzoxazone, elimination was essentially unchanged. For some drugs, the pharmacokinetics were also markedly altered; for example, when administered orally, the maximum plasma concentration for midazolam was increased by 2.5-fold, and the clearance decreased by 3.6-fold in hepatic microsomal cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> null mice. These data indicate that microsomal cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> can play a major role in the <italic>in vivo</italic> metabolism of certain drugs and chemicals but in a P450- and substrate-dependent manner.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p><italic>Author's Choice</italic>&#x02014;Final version full access.</p></fn><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by <grant-sponsor>Cancer Research UK Programme</grant-sponsor> Grant <grant-num>C4639/A5661</grant-num> (to C.

This protein is involved in fatty acid desaturation, reactivation of methemoglobin to hemoglobin, and electron transfer into the cytochrome P450 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>).</p><p>The role of cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> in cytochrome P450 monooxygenase reactions has been controversial for nearly 40 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). Depending on the cytochrome P450 involved, the experimental conditions, and the substrate utilized, cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> has been shown to stimulate or inhibit cytochrome P450 reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). Indeed, in the case of cytochrome P450 CYP2B4, activity can be both stimulated or inhibited by the presence of the enzyme, depending on the concentration of cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Cytochrome <italic>b<sub>5</sub></italic> has been shown to affect the <italic>in vitro</italic> activities of a wide range of human P450s, such as CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4, as well as the metabolism of an extensive number of commonly used drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). Although the mechanism(s) of the stimulatory effect of cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> on P450 metabolism appear complex, it is widely accepted that the P450 catalytic cycle involves the sequential transfer of two electrons from NADPH via P450 oxidoreductase (POR).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">2</xref> Hildebrandt and Estabrook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>) concluded that cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub>/cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> reductase was able to supply the second (rate-limiting) electron from NADH and possibly in a more rapid manner. However, recent data from Waskell <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) suggest that cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> and POR are capable of reducing P450s at much the same rate, albeit that overall catalysis occurs more slowly with POR, leading to speculation that the oxyferrous form of P450 may exist in different conformations with POR or cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>).</p><p>A noncatalytic (<italic>i.e.</italic> allosteric) role has also been proposed for the interaction of cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> with cytochrome P450, based on reports that apocytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> (<italic>i.e.</italic> without the heme prosthetic group) can stimulate P450 catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Although these findings have been debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>) and appear to depend upon the enzyme studied, the mechanism(s) underlying such allosteric effects remains uncertain. It does seem clear however, that cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> binding can cause conformational changes to the substrate access channel and binding pocket in the P450 enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). In many cases, allosteric stimulation increases P450 activity by a relatively small amount, and the physiological relevance of this effect, if any, is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>).</p><p>All studies on cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> to date have been carried out <italic>in vitro</italic>; the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of these findings has remained unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). Although the prediction of <italic>in vivo</italic> drug pharmacokinetic data obtained from <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments rarely takes the potential contribution of cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> into account, a recent study using recombinant human P450s did find that using cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> yielded a more accurate estimate of intrinsic clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>).</p><p>In order to establish the relevance of the <italic>in vitro</italic> observations to those <italic>in vivo</italic> and to evaluate whether variability in cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> levels may affect rates of drug metabolism, we have conditionally deleted microsomal cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> in the liver. Using hepatic microsomal cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> null (HBN) mice, we demonstrate that the <italic>in vitro</italic> rate of NADPH- and NADH-dependent metabolism of a range of both model substrates and probe drugs is markedly changed. Furthermore, we show that when probe drugs are administered to mice, significant changes in drug pharmacokinetics occur.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Chemicals</italic>&#x02014;All reagents unless stated were purchased from Sigma.

No cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> protein could be detected in microsomes from the large intestine of either genotype (data not shown).</p><p>In order to investigate whether concomitant changes in P450 expression had occurred, three representative liver microsomal samples of each genotype were analyzed for P450 enzyme profiles, POR, and cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> reductase levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>).

In contrast, from 2 h, the average concentration of parent drug was statistically much lower in the wild-type than in HBN mice for most of the compounds and remained so for the duration of the experiment. Pharmacokinetic analysis for each drug showed that the clearance was consistently faster, and the AUC was consistently lower (except in the case of midazolam) in wild-type compared with HBN mice. Furthermore, the terminal half-life for phenacetin, tolbutamide, chlorzoxazone, and midazolam was statistically different between the two lines, being significantly longer in HBN mice, increasing from 53 to 168 min, 197 to 321 min, 92 to 257 min, and 83 to 329 min, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, and supplemental Table 4).

In the case of midazolam, phenacetin, and metoprolol, AUC and C<sub>max</sub> were consistently higher in HBN mice, whereas the clearance was slower (supplemental Fig. 4, supplemental Table 5). For midazolam, AUC and C<sub>max</sub> were significantly increased from 34 to 124 min&#x000b7;&#x003bc;g/ml and from 0.4 to 1.0 &#x003bc;g/ml, respectively, whereas clearance was decreased from 149 to 41 ml/min/kg (supplemental Table 5). The phenacetin elimination profile also showed significant changes, with C<sub>max</sub> increasing from 0.06 to 0.09 &#x003bc;g/ml in HBN and clearance decreasing from 688 to 550 ml/min/kg. Although the phenacetin AUC increased from 1.5 to 1.8 min&#x000b7;&#x003bc;g/ml, this change was not significant. In the case of metoprolol, similar trends were observed in C<sub>max</sub> and AUC; however, these did not reach statistical significance. In contrast to the observations above, the alterations in the pharmacokinetic parameters for tolbutamide gave significantly lower AUC and C<sub>max</sub> values and a (nonsignificant) higher clearance rate, relative to wild-type animals (supplemental Fig. 4 and supplemental Table 5). This unexpected effect appeared to be a consequence of using the drug mixture (see below). Interestingly, although the terminal half-life for chlorzoxazone was significantly decreased in HBN mice from 194.0 to 46 min, the decreased AUC and C<sub>max</sub> and increased clearance in HBN mice were not significantly different (supplemental Table 5). Additionally, there were no significant differences between HBN and wild-type mice in the plasma concentration of chlorzoxazone at any of the time points analyzed (supplemental Fig. 4).</p><p>Administration of the probe drugs individually to HBN and wild-type mice yielded essentially the same elimination profiles for phenacetin, metoprolol, midazolam, and chlorzoxazone, compared with those obtained from use of the drug mixture (data not shown). However, when tolbutamide was administered singly (supplemental Fig. 4<italic>A, inset</italic>), the elimination profiles were found to be reversed in comparison with that obtained from the drug mixture (<italic>i.e.</italic> significantly increased AUC and C<sub>max</sub> and significantly decreased clearance in HBN mice). Similar to data obtained with the drug mixture administered intravenously, the pattern of metabolite production in the HBN animals showed a delay in maximal levels of circulating metabolites (supplemental Fig. 5).</p><p>Using the oral and intravenous dosing data, percentage bioavailability was calculated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). HBN animals showed a 4-fold increase in midazolam bioavailability, whereas for phenacetin, metoprolol, and chlorzoxazone, bioavailability was very low in the wild-type animals (&#x0003c;4%) and unaltered in the nulls. When dosed as part of the drug mixture, tolbutamide bioavailability in the HBN mice was decreased by &#x0223c;50% as compared with wild type; however, when orally dosed as a single agent and recalculated, both wild-type and HBN animals showed &#x0003e;100% bioavailability.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>All previously published work on the effects of cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> on NADPH-dependent P450 activity has been carried out <italic>in vitro</italic>. In order to establish the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of this hemoprotein in drug disposition, we have generated a mouse where this enzyme has been conditionally inactivated in the liver.</p><p>To exclude the possibility that a global deletion of microsomal cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> would be lethal, a conditional targeting strategy was used. Mice deleted for hepatic microsomal cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> developed normally, with the <italic>Cytb</italic><sub>5</sub><sup><italic>lox/lox</italic></sup>::<italic>Cre<sup>ALB</sup></italic> genotypes being found in Mendelian proportions. No alterations in liver morphology, hepatic lipid content, or hepatic serum markers were observed.</p><p>The hepatic deletion of microsomal cytochrome <italic>b<sub>5</sub></italic> was shown to be both specific and essentially complete by Western blotting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>) and, importantly, unlike the hepatic deletion of cytochrome P450 reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>), did not result in significantly increased expression of hepatic P450 proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). These data indicate that at the time points studied, a reduction in P450 activity, as a consequence of microsomal cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> deletion, is not compensated by an increase in P450 expression. The use of a range of both model substrates and probe drugs clearly demonstrated that the absence of microsomal cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> significantly attenuated P450-mediated metabolism <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The extent of suppression of enzyme activity varied markedly between substrates, as has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). For all fluorocoumarin substrates employed, there was a highly significant decrease in NADPH-mediated P450 metabolism in liver microsomes from the HBN mice (as high as 90% for EFC), whereas for the two resorufin analogues and bufuralol, the change was still significant (at least 50% decrease for each compound) but less marked. This variability in cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> effects was further illustrated by the use of a series of probe drugs, where the kinetic parameters defining the <italic>in vitro</italic> metabolism were markedly changed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). For all substrates, with the exception of tolbutamide, the data followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> values were essentially unchanged in the HBN samples. This suggests that cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> binding does not cause a conformational change in the structure of the P450s responsible for this metabolism. In contrast, in both wild type and HBN samples, the data for tolbutamide oxidation did not fit Michaelis-Menten kinetics, exhibiting negatively cooperative binding. Furthermore, the removal of cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> had a pronounced effect on tolbutamide binding, decreasing the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> by 68-fold, indicating that the presence of cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> does affect tolbutamide binding.</p><p>In all cases, <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> values were substantially reduced by the removal of cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> (range 1.7&#x02013;20-fold lower for acetaminophen and 4-hydroxymidazolam production, respectively), implying that the presence of cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> is critical for optimal turnover in the P450s investigated. Interestingly, the effects of cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> were different dependent on the site of metabolism (<italic>e.g.</italic> with midazolam, the <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> for oxidation at the 1- <italic>versus</italic> 4-hydroxy sites was 29 <italic>versus</italic> 5% of the control, respectively). A similar effect was also seen for metoprolol oxidation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), indicating that cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> effects show specificity for different sites of oxidation.</p><p>These findings provide strong genetic evidence that the modulatory effects of cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> are both substrate- and P450-dependent and that the activities of many P450 enzymes are affected by this protein. Similar reductions in P450 activities (60&#x02013;70%) have also been demonstrated using antibodies to cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub>, both in microsomal fractions and with purified protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>). Furthermore, the addition of recombinant membrane-bound cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> to HBN liver microsomes led to a concentration-dependent increase of catalytic activities toward BFC and chlorzoxazone, indicating that the loss of activity in HBN samples was indeed due to the absence of cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> (supplemental Fig. 2, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic>). The <italic>in vitro</italic> data generated from the probe drugs suggests that in general, the absence of cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> results in reduced rates of P450-mediated metabolism.</p><p>It is interesting to note that in some cases the fluorocoumarin substrates and tolbutamide NADH-mediated metabolism were essentially abolished in HBN mice, whereas for the other compounds, residual activity remained (<italic>e.g.</italic> in the case of ER or BR), indicating the existence of an alternative metabolic pathway involving NADH but independent of cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). One possible explanation for the residual activity could be the presence of an alternate electron donor, such as the recently described outer mitochondrial cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub>, which is derived from a gene locus on chromosome 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>) and encodes for a protein of 16.3 kDa, slightly larger than microsomal cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> at 15.2 kDa and &#x0223c;45% identical at the amino acid level. However, to date, there is no evidence for the interaction of outer mitochondrial cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> with the microsomal P450 system.</p><p>Recently, a novel, soluble, NAD(P)H reductase (NAD(P)H cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> oxidoreductase), located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>), which contains both cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> and cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> reductase domains. In order to confirm that this enzyme was not induced in the HBN mice, and potentially compensating for the loss of microsomal cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub>, we obtained antiserum to NAD(P)H cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> oxidoreductase; immunoblotting liver samples from wild-type and HBN mice found no difference in expression levels (data not shown). Li and Porter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>) have also described a second microsomal reductase, which is active with squalene monooxygenase and apparently capable of supporting up to 40% of the activity of this enzyme, although the identity of this reductase and its interactions with other enzymes remain unclear.</p><p>In addition, due to its role in fatty acid desaturation, it is possible that changes in the phospholipid bilayer, as observed in stearoyl-CoA-desaturase null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>), are responsible for the observed effects of cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> on P450 metabolism. However, no changes in the fatty acid composition of endoplasmic reticulum membranes from wild-type and HBN mice were found (supplemental Fig. 3).</p><p>In order to establish the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of the hepatic cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> deletion, we administered a series of probe drugs by both intravenous and oral routes to control and HBN mice. These drugs were chosen because they have been shown to be metabolized in a number of species by different cytochrome P450s. The interpretation of such experiments is inevitably complex, particularly because in the mouse there is little background historical information on the key factors that define their pharmacokinetic parameters. However, consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, in general, it was evident that the deletion of hepatic cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> caused marked changes in drug pharmacokinetics independent of the route of administration.</p><p>When administered intravenously, the terminal half-life was increased in HBN mice for all drugs used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). This increase is consistent with decreased liver metabolism as a consequence of hepatic microsomal cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> deficiency and provides the first evidence that strongly supports the conclusion that cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> plays a role in <italic>in vivo</italic> P450-mediated drug metabolism. In addition, the profiles of metabolite production for midazolam, phenacetin, and metoprolol were different between HBN and wild-type mice; for example, maximal metabolite levels of 1&#x02032;-hydroxymidazolam occurred 3 times more slowly in HBN mice than in wild type (120 <italic>versus</italic> 40 min) when dosed intravenously (supplemental Fig. 5). These differences in metabolite production are consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> kinetic data shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. For example, the <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> values for 1&#x02032;-hydroxymidazolam were &#x0223c;3 times higher in wild type as compared with HBN. No major differences in the formation of the demethyl metabolite of metoprolol were observed at the early time points between HBN and wild-type mice, despite major <italic>in vitro</italic> differences (supplemental Fig. 5 and Table 1).</p><p>Following oral administration of the drug mixture, the interpretation of pharmacokinetic parameters is more complex due to factors such as the absorption across gastrointestinal tract and hepatic blood flow. This added complexity was manifest in the fact that for some drugs, such as midazolam, microsomal cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> deficiency and the consequent reduction in hepatic metabolism can lead to increased bioavailability (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) as well as a decreased rate of elimination. These alterations in pharmacokinetics could therefore potentially lead to an exaggerated response to the drug. However, for the other drugs, first pass liver metabolism does not appear to be important in determining bioavailability, which is presumably dependent primarily on efficiency of gastrointestinal absorption or metabolism. When dosed orally, the C<sub>max</sub> appears to be the most reliable indicator of a change in metabolizing capacity and acts as a valuable corollary to the increased half-life observed following intravenous administration.</p><p>In summary, mice with a hepatic deletion of microsomal cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> display a significant change in the metabolism of a range of substrates by a number of cytochrome P450 enzymes <italic>in vitro</italic> and, more importantly, <italic>in vivo</italic>. The data presented in this report suggest that the level and/or activity of hepatic microsomal cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> can play a significant role in the metabolism, disposition, and therapeutic effectiveness of clinically used drugs. The extrapolation of <italic>in vitro</italic> data to <italic>in vivo</italic> and the relative importance to drug pharmacokinetics and disposition are very complex and involve a wide range of parameters that could include the cytochrome P450/cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> ratio, the cytochrome P450 enzyme involved, the substrate concentration, the P450 turnover number, and the overall role of cytochrome P450 metabolism as a rate-limiting factor in drug disposition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M803496200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M803496200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Catherine Hughes and Susanne van Schelven for excellent technical assistance.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Loughran, P.
