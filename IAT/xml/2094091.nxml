Although overproduction is unstable in mammalian cells, we have overproduced a recombinant hSNM1 protein in an insect cell system. The protein is a single-strand 5&#x02032;-exonuclease, like its yeast homolog. The enzyme utilizes either DNA or RNA substrates, requires a 5&#x02032;-phosphate moiety, shows very little activity on double-strand substrates, and functions at a size consistent with a monomer. The exonuclease activity requires the conserved &#x003b2;-lactamase domain; site-directed mutagenesis of a conserved aspartate inactivates the exonuclease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The SNM1 protein belongs to the metallo-&#x003b2;-lactamase family of proteins, characterized by conserved sequences for binding Zn<sup>2+</sup> and cleaving substrates with ester linkages. The &#x003b2;-CASP subfamily (CPSF73, Artemis/SNM1 (or Pso2), and Elac1 and 2, further have conserved domains, A, B and C, in addition to the hydrolytic lactamase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). SNM1 is the product of a gene first described in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> as <italic>PSO2</italic>, a non-essential gene required for normal survival after exposure to psoralen or other DNA interstrand cross-linking (ICL) agents such as nitrogen mustard or cisplatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The <italic>SNM1</italic> gene is assigned to the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway (<italic>RAD3</italic> epistasis group), despite the fact that cells deficient in SNM1 protein in yeast show no increase in sensitivity to other DNA-damaging agents such as UV or radiation. A defect in SNM1 in yeast is additive to a defect in the <italic>RAD52</italic> pathway (recombination) or the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway (post-replication) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), showing that the three DNA repair epistasis groups in yeast are defined in ICL repair as well. For mutants defective in all three pathways, a single ICL is lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>ICL repair produces double-strand breaks (DSB) and <italic>snm1</italic> yeast mutants incise DNA with ICLs normally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8">6&#x02013;8</xref>), showing normal DSB formation. However, intact DNA is not reformed at normal rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) in <italic>snm1</italic> mutants, but HO-induced mating type switching is processed normally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), demonstrating that there are specific features of ICL-induced DSBs which require SNM1 function and that <italic>snm1</italic> mutants process some DSBs normally. Disruption of the &#x003b2;-lactamase domain of SNM1 prevents function in ICL repair <italic>in vivo</italic>. The yeast SNM1 enzyme is known to be a DNA 5&#x02032;-exonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), and disruption of the &#x003b2;-lactamase domain destroys the exonuclease activity, linking this function to ICL repair. Thus it seems that the exonuclease must act in processing a specific structural intermediate in ICL repair.</p><p>The SNM1 family is well conserved in mammals and contains SNM1B/Apollo, SNM1C/Artemis, ELAC2 and CPSF73 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The CPSF subunit hydrolyzes mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The mammalian orthologs all have the &#x003b2;-lactamase domain preserved, suggesting hydrolytic function. SNM1B/Apollo possesses a 5&#x02032;-exonuclease activity and may play a role in telomere maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Artemis has been shown to be a 5&#x02032;-exonuclease interacting with DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>, which phosphorylates it, to gain a specific endonucleolytic function cleaving DNA hairpin structures, such as formed by the RAG1/RAG2 functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). That Artemis plays a role in V(D)J recombination and immune competency was demonstrated by the finding that some patients with radio-sensitive severe combined immune deficiency (RS-SCID) are defective in Artemis function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15">13&#x02013;15</xref>).</p><p>No such functional role has been demonstrated for the mammalian <italic>SNM1</italic> gene. Disruption in mice produces remarkably little phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Embryonic stem (ES) cells from mice with an <italic>Snm1</italic> disruption show increased sensitivity to MMC, but not to other DNA cross-linking agents, including cisplatin or psoralen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Another report found that SNM1 disruption alone or in combination with a p53 null mutation resulted in accelerated tumorigenesis, as well as decreased survival of <italic>snm1</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from these mice show loss of a mitotic checkpoint and increased sensitivity to spindle poisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Thus the multiple orthologs in mammals, along with the mild phenotype, cloud the role of SNM1 protein in genome stability and DNA repair. While human fibroblasts depleted for SNM1 manifest a striking chromosomal instability (unpublished data), without a defined group of patients, the function of SNM1 is unknown.</p><p>We have cloned the <italic>hSNM1</italic> gene into an insect cell system and overexpressed the recombinant protein. It possesses a 5&#x02032;-exonucleolytic activity on single-stranded DNA or RNA. The activity is reduced at least 97% on double-stranded DNA or hairpin structures. The protein functions as a monomer of &#x0223c;115 kDa. Mutagenesis of the conserved aspartate residue at position 736 to an alanine inactivates the nucleolytic activity, indicating the &#x003b2;-lactamase domain encodes the nuclease function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and plasmid construction</title><p>Kc 167 insect cell line (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) was purchased from Drosophila Genomics Resource Center, Indiana University, Indiana, and was grown in Schneider's Drosophila Medium (SDM) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA).</p><p>A full-length hSNM1 cDNA clone was isolated from a lymphoblast cDNA library (a gift from Dr Manuel Buchwald), and sub-cloned into the expression vector pAc5.1a (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) by PCR amplification of the coding region with primers tagged with a Kozak sequence and compatible restriction sites (MfeI and SmaI) (pAc5.1a-EcoRI and BstB1 + Klenow). To make the hSNM1-D736A mutant construct, the Quick-Change site-directed mutagenesis method was followed as recommended (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). Briefly, mutant sense and antisense primers (5&#x02032;-CACACATTTTCATTCTGCTCATTATGCTGGATTGTC-3&#x02032;, and 5&#x02032;-GACAATCCAGCATAATGAGCAGAATGAAAATGTGTG-3&#x02032;, respectively) were used in PCR amplification, with pAC5.1-hSNM1 as template and Pfu-Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). The PCR product was digested with DpnI, and transformed into chemically competent <italic>E. coli</italic> XL1-Blue MRF&#x02032; cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). Colony PCR followed by BclI digestion (the D736A mutation eliminates a BclI restriction site) was performed to identify the mutant clones. The selected clones were then confirmed by sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Transfection of plasmids into Kc 167 cells was performed using Cellfectin Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 10 &#x003bc;g plasmid (pAc5.1-hSNM1 or pAc5.1a control) was mixed with 50 &#x003bc;l Cellfectin, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was then added to 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> Kc 167 cells, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After the incubation, the transfected cells were grown in SDM containing 5% FBS for 3 days before the harvest.</p><p>The following steps were performed at 4&#x000b0;C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in 500 &#x003bc;l Buffer A (50 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.1, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 1% IGEPAL CA 630, 10% glycerol, 5 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, plus 1/100 volume Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Nutley, NJ, USA), rocked gently for 1 min, then incubated on ice for 10 min. A cleared lysate was obtained by centrifugation at 800 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C. The cleared lysate supernatant was then mixed with an equal volume of 50% v/v slurry of TALON beads (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), pre-equilibrated in Buffer B (50 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.1, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 5 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF), and incubated at 4&#x000b0;C for 2 h with gentle rotation. The bound beads were then poured into a Poly-Prep chromatography column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and unbound proteins were allowed to flow through by gravity. The column was then washed with 20 bed volumes of Buffer B, followed by 10 bed volumes of Buffer C (50 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.1, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 5 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF). Elution of hSNM1 was performed by adding 4 bed volumes of Buffer D (50 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.1, 300 mM NaCl, 150 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol) and collecting 250 &#x003bc;l fractions. All the fractions were brought to a final concentration of 5 mM DTT, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at &#x02013;80&#x000b0;C. Protein concentrations of the samples were determined with protein assay dye reagent concentrate (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Purification fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue, silver staining or western blotting.</p><p>Approximately 100&#x02013;125 &#x003bc;g of TALON-purified hSNM1 and hSNM1-D736A were further purified by gel filtration on Superose-6 or Superose-12 FPLC columns (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) equilibrated in Buffer E (50 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O pH 7.1, 5 mM DTT, 300 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol). After a void volume of 8 ml, a total of 40 0.5 ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining and immunoblotting.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>Approximately 20 &#x003bc;l of each protein fraction was separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). After blocking in PBST (PBS + 0.1% Tween-20) with 5% non-fat dry milk, the membrane was probed with anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) diluted 1:5000 in PBST with 5% non-fat dry milk. The blot was then incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) diluted 1:10 000 in PBST with 5% non-fat dry milk. Detection was by Immobilon-Western Chemiluminescent HRP reagent (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Substrates</title><p>Custom oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., Coralville, IA, USA) were 20-dT (5&#x02032;-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT); S-1 (5&#x02032;-GACCAAGGGGTACCAG); S-2 (5&#x02032;-CCAACCTACACACCTATATCCATTTGCTGGTACCCCTTGGTC). Shorter oligo-dT substrates (15-dT, 10-dT and 5-dT) were synthesized by the OHSU Molecular Microbiology and Immunology Research Core Facility. To make a 5&#x02032; labeled ssDNA, 25 pmol of 20-dT was labeled with [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP, using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). To make a 3&#x02032; labeled ssDNA substrate 25 pmol of 20-dT was labeled with [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP-dideoxyadenosine triphosphate using terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). The 3&#x02032;-end-labeled substrate was then phosphorylated with cold ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase or left unphosphorylated at the 5&#x02032;-end. The internally labeled dsDNA (42 bp) was made by 5&#x02032; phosphorylating S-1 with cold ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, then annealing to 15 pmol S-2. The duplex was then extended with Klenow polymerase with dATP, dTTP, dGTP and [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]-dCTP. Unincorporated radionucleotides were removed by ProbeQuant G-50 micro columns (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). A pseudoflap substrate was constructed by annealing 5&#x02032;-end-labeled cru-13 (5&#x02032;-CTCCATCCAAGGAGTTGGCGATCACGAAGCTTTAATCTGGAGCCA) with cru-14 5&#x02032;-TCCAGATTAAAGCTTCGTGATCGACCGAGGTCCAAGAACTC). Hairpin and hairpin-loop substrates were generated with oligonucleotides HP-1 (5&#x02032;-CCACTGCGTCTAAGGTGGAGGTGAACGTTCACCTCCACCTTAGACG) and HP-loop (5&#x02032;-CCACTGCGTCTAAGGTGGAGGTGAACTTTTTTTTTTGTTCACCTCCACCTTAGACG), respectively, and labeling with [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]-dCTP and Klenow polymerase. This strategy incorporated a single 3&#x02032;-[<sup>32</sup>P]-C, and left the 5&#x02032;-end unphosphorylated, thus protecting the 5&#x02032;-end from exonucleolytic attack during the assay. A single-strand RNA substrate (5&#x02032;-UGCCUUCCACCUCCACCAATT) was labeled at the 5&#x02032;-end with polynucleotide kinase and [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP, as for the 20-dT substrate.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> nuclease assay</title><p>The assay was similar to an assay for yeast SNM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) Briefly, 0.5 pmol of radiolabeled substrate was combined with indicated amounts of purified protein (see the figure legends) in 15 &#x003bc;l of 1&#x000d7; Buffer F (50 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.2, 10 mM Mg acetate, 75 mM Potassium acetate, 1 mM DTT) supplemented with 100 &#x003bc;g/ml BSA, and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 20 min. For control reactions, 10 units of Rec-J<sub>f</sub> or &#x003bb;-exonuclease (for double-stranded substrate) (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) were used as recommended by the supplier. The reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of formamide gel loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.04% xylene cyanol, 0.04% bromophenol blue) and heating at 65&#x000b0;C for 20 min. DNA was resolved on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Greater resolution was obtained with 16% acrylamide gels, as indicated in the figure legends. The gel was wrapped in Saran wrap and analyzed by autoradiography. One unit of enzymatic activity is defined as the release of 1 pmol of <sup>32</sup>P as mononucleotide in 10 min at 37&#x000b0;C.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Overproduction of hSNM1 is not stable in human fibroblasts</title><p>In order to isolate and purify hSNM1, the cDNA for <italic>SNM1</italic> (GenBank D42045) was synthesized by PCR and cloned into a pIRES vector system with a 3&#x02032;-V5 epitope and 6xHis tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). This construct was transfected into human fibroblasts. Production of the SNM1 protein was verified by immunoblot analysis for the V5 epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), and the cells were continued on selection with puromycin. After fourteen days the cells remained puromycin resistant, but the expressed protein was absent by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Comparison of over 12 independent transfections, with subsequent culture, showed that hSNM1 expression was lost in each case by two weeks. The overall transfection efficiency of the SNM1 construct was poor, suggesting it had a deleterious effect on cell growth. Thus, apparently the SNM1 protein is not tolerated at an increased or unregulated level in human fibroblasts. Our finding is in agreement with the observations of others, suggesting that SNM1 is toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Intolerance of overexpression of SNM1 is in contrast to lack of the protein, which is well tolerated. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Affinity purification of His-tagged hSNM1Protein.

The 3&#x02032;-epitopes allowed tracking the protein purification by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). The column purification (immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography, IMAC) was done by passing a cleared cell lysate over the matrix in low imidazole (5 to 10 mM), followed by washes with 20 mM imidazole and elution with buffer containing 150 mM imidazole. The peak of the activity and epitope tag typically eluted in the second and third fractions, indicating a uniform binding and elution pattern for the 6xHis tag; there was slight batch-to-batch variation in the relative amount of SNM1 protein in peak elution fractions, most likely due to the small scale of the purifications and the manual elution and collection of the fractions.</p></sec><sec><title>hSNM1 has single-strand 5&#x02032;-exonuclease activity requiring a phosphate</title><p>With a single-stranded substrate 20 bases in length, with a 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P label (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) the hSNM1 protein manifests 5&#x02032;-exonuclease activity, similar to that reported for yeast SNM1 and Artemis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D).

The substrate in lanes 4 and 5 was an equimolar mix of 5&#x02032;-labeled 5-dT, 10-dT, 15-dT and 20-dT (the 5-dT oligo did not label well with polynucleotide kinase). Products were resolved on a 16% acylamide&#x02013;42% urea gel.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm530f2"/></fig></p><p>To evaluate whether the activity is able to hydrolyze DNA from the 3&#x02032;-terminus, a substrate was constructed with the <sup>32</sup>P label at the 3&#x02032;-end. The hSNM1 enzyme does not hydrolyze substrate detectably from the 3&#x02032;-terminus. This test also showed that the exonuclease activity strictly requires a 5&#x02032;-phosphate group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), whereas the RecJ<sub>f</sub> enzyme is active without a 5&#x02032;-phosphate group, although with reduced activity. The final product for hSNM1 is in the range of 6&#x02013;8 nt, indicating that the exonuclease hydrolyzes from the 5&#x02032;-terminus, with much decreased affinity for the substrate once the oligonucleotide is shorter than an octamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lane 6). Better resolution of the reaction was obtained by running the reaction products on a 16% acrylamide&#x02013;42% urea gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C) using an equimolar mix of 5&#x02032;-labeled oligonucleotides differing by 5 nt in length. The reaction went nearly to completion with the 20-dT substrate, the 15-dT was &#x0223c;75% digested, the 10-dT substrate was digested &#x0003c;20% and there was no detectable digestion of the 5-dT substrate, supporting loss of binding for short substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lane 6). At this resolution, the single-nucleotide product clearly co-migrated with the product of the RecJ<sub>f</sub> reaction verifying that the product is a mononucleotide. On the 16% gel, the products of digestion of a 3&#x02032;-labeled substrate migrated as a ladder with single-nucleotide spacing ranging from 6 to 20 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, lane 7).

This would represent a lower estimate due to mixed nuclease and phosphatase activities in the extract. IMAC purified hSNM1 fraction 3 was fractionated on a gel filtration column for further purification and to estimate the apparent molecular weight of the active species.

A pseudoflap structure consisting of two annealed oligonucleotides sharing 23 bp of complementarity and 18 nt of non-complementary bases was incubated with hSNM1 over a 30-min time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). Whereas hSNM1 removed the 5&#x02032; label as a single nucleotide, there was no evidence for the generation of a 23-mer intermediate. Similarly, a 21-bp hairpin substrate and a 21-bp hairpin with a 10 nt loop were not incised by hSNM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B), in contrast to Exo 1 from yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Taken together, this suggests that hSNM1 has no single-strand endonucleolytic activity. This does not preclude the possibility of activation by post-translational modification or interaction with a partner protein, but at face value hSNM1 appears to be a purely single-strand exonuclease.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The hSNM1 protein has been overproduced in an insect cell vector system and partially purified, with definition of a single-stranded DNA 5&#x02032;-exonclease activity, dependent on the conserved &#x003b2;-lactamase domain. Thus the protein shares the basic activity of its orthologs, ySNM1 and Artemis, which show 5&#x02032;-exonuclease activity. Other members of the &#x003b2;-CASP family, CPSF73 and CPSF100, process the 3&#x02032; termini of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). As described above, mutation of a conserved site in the &#x003b2;-lactamase domain (D736A) inactivates the 5&#x02032;-exonuclease activity. Mutagenesis of the same site (D37N) in Artemis, changing an aspartate to asparagine, caused loss of the DNA-PKcs endonuclease activity of the protein, but did not cause loss of the 5&#x02032;-exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The discrepancy for loss of the exonuclease may reflect the different amino acid substitutions, or it may reflect a fundamental difference in structure and activity of the two proteins.</p><p>The ySNM1 protein is known to act in ICL repair after incision (unhooking) at the site of the ICL, and to be required for reformation of the intact strand of DNA. It is possible that the yeast enzyme is involved in terminus modification of intermediates in the ICL repair pathway, facilitating strand rejoining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The EXO1 enzyme of yeast, involved in several DNA processing pathways in yeast is also a 5&#x02032; exonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Therefore the activity of hSNM1 is a candidate to be involved in modifying termini at the site of DNA repair. Since hSNM1 is specific for single-stranded DNA, such a substrate might be generated during the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links, possibly in concert with a helicase, analogous to what has been suggested for Exo1 and WRN or RecQ1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>There is no defined group of patients defective in hSNM1, nor is there an easily identifiable defect in DNA repair in animal models lacking SNM1. This may be due to the existence of multiple closely related members of the &#x003b2;-CASP family, SNM1A, SNM1B and Artemis. Disruption of SNM1B in chicken DT40 cells renders them sensitive to cisplatin, and a double disruption of SNM1A and SNM1B is additive, suggesting that SNM1B may be a redundant function in ICL repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). A knockdown of hSNM1B/Apollo also sensitized human cells to cross-linking agents as well as ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). hSNM1B/Apollo was recently characterized as a 5&#x02032;-exonuclease interacting with TRF2 in telomere maintenance, suggesting that hSNM1 and hSNM1B/Apollo may have partially overlapping functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), but that their association with different proteins or complexes may determine the pathway in which they operate. In view of these results collectively, identification of a phenotype in animal models lacking SNM1 may require multiple deficiencies. While hSNM1 has not been shown to be significant for cell survival with multiple DNA cross-linking agents, we have found that its deficiency leads to chromosome breaks and radial formation, an index of genome instability with ICL formation (unpublished data).</p><p>We found no evidence for phosphorylation of the protein (data not shown). This does not eliminate the possibility that modification of SNM1 occurs in human cells with DNA damage. The enzyme reported here was recombinant and produced in insect cells and so may not reflect the state of hSNM1 in human cells, with or without damage. Artemis is notably modified, acquiring an endonucleolytic activity cleaving putative recombination intermediates when phosphorylated and bound by DNA-PK. Thus it is possible that we observed only one activity associated with hSNM1.</p><p>The hSNM1 protein cannot be stably overproduced in a human cell. Since disruption of SNM1 has been reported to alter a mitotic checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), it may be that overproduction is lethal to the cell due to disruption of the mitotic checkpoint. Alternatively, since we demonstrate here that SNM1 is a 5&#x02032;-exonuclease, it is possible that overexpression is destroying an intermediate in normal DNA processing, leading to genome instability. If SNM1 is modified in human cells, then it might be that the modified form possesses an additional activity, which is deleterious when overexpressed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by USPHS grant 5P01HL048546.
