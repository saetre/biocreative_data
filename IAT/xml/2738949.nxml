We identified a mutant forming unreduced pollen that enabled us to investigate direct effects of unbalanced parental genome contributions on seed development and to reveal the underlying molecular mechanism of dosage sensitivity. We provide evidence that parent-of-origin&#x02013;specific expression of the Polycomb group (PcG) gene <italic>MEDEA</italic> is causally responsible for seed developmental aberrations in Arabidopsis seeds with increased paternal genome contributions.

It is assumed that abnormalities in growth and structure of the endosperm (the nutritional tissue of the seed) are the cause of triploid seed failure, consistent with the proposed role of the endosperm in reproductive isolation and angiosperm speciation. In many species, the ratio of maternal to paternal genomes in the endosperm is important for normal seed development, giving rise to the hypothesis that parent-of-origin&#x02013;specific gene expression (imprinting) of regulatory genes in the endosperm is the underlying cause for developmental failure in seeds with deviating parental contributions. We tested this hypothesis using the <italic>jason</italic> mutant that forms unreduced male gametes and triploid seeds with increased paternal genome dosage. Based on the results of our study, we propose that imprinting of the FIS component <italic>MEDEA</italic> serves as a dosage sensor for increasing paternal genome contributions, establishing the molecular basis for dosage sensitivity. Our study provides strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that misbalanced expression of imprinted genes is the cause of seed development defects after interploidy crosses and demonstrates that <italic>MEDEA</italic> imprinting is a major origin of developmental defects caused by increased paternal genome contributions.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Polyploidy, the presence of more than two complete sets of chromosomes within an organism, is known to be common in plants and in some animals such as amphibians, fish and reptiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000663-Otto1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000663-Comai1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

The additional sets of chromosomes may originate from the same species (&#x0201c;autopolyploid&#x0201d;), or from the hybridization of two different species (&#x0201c;allopolyploid&#x0201d;). Polyploids can arise spontaneously by the fusion of a diploid gamete with a normal haploid gamete, leading to the formation of a triploid zygote. Diploid gamete formation resulting from failure of reduction during meiosis occurs in several plant species and can give rise to triploids that serve as a bridge to the formation of stable polyploids with an even set of chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000663-Ramsey1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In most flowering plants the fusion of one sperm cell with the haploid egg cell is accompanied by the fusion of a second sperm cell with the homodiploid central cell nucleus, resulting in the formation of the triploid endosperm with a 2&#x02236;1 ratio of maternal to paternal genomes. The endosperm is a nourishing tissue supporting embryo growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000663-Costa1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Double fertilization occurs also in polyploids, resulting in the formation of embryo and endosperm with proportionally increased ploidies.

Genomic imprinting is the mitotically stable inheritance of differential expression states of maternal and paternal alleles caused by different epigenetic modifications of the alleles. Genomic imprinting renders maternal and paternal genomes non-equivalent, and balanced contributions of maternal and paternal genomes are therefore essential for post-fertilization development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000663-Spielman1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000663-Surani1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The penetrance of the interploidy hybridization barrier varies within and between species.

The lower number of deregulated genes in seeds of <italic>jas</italic> pollen parents is attributed to the fact that only about half of these seeds are triploid (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000663-t001">Table 1</xref>), reducing the statistical power to detect small expression changes, whereas all seeds derived from tetraploid pollen parents are triploid. Strikingly, 83&#x00025; of up-regulated and 41&#x00025; of down-regulated genes in seeds derived from <italic>jas</italic> pollen parents were also up- or down-regulated in mutants lacking FIS function (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;7.84E-106 for up-regulated genes and p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;7.56E-49 for down-regulated genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000663-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

These findings strongly suggest that increased paternal genome contribution causes global deregulation of direct or indirect target genes of the FIS PcG complex.

Lack of JAS function causes failure of chromatid segregation during meiosis II, leading to second division nuclear restitution.

Glass beads (1.25&#x02013;1.55 mm) were added, and the samples were ground unfrozen in a Silamat S5 (Ivoclar Vivadent, Ellwangen, Germany). RNA was extracted using the RNAqueous kit (Ambion/Applied Biosystems, Lincoln, CA) combined with Plant RNA Isolation Aid (Ambion/Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was subjected to a DNase treatment. cDNA was prepared from total RNA using the WTOvation Pico System (NuGEN Technologies, San Carlos, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. SPIA amplification was used to prepare single-stranded cDNA from the mRNA starting material. Fragmented and biotin-labeled single-stranded cDNA targets were generated with the FL-Ovation cDNA Biotin Module V2 (NuGEN). Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChips were used throughout the experiment (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).
