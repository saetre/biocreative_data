We report here that the transcriptional co-activator PCAF directly interacts with cdk2. This interaction is mainly produced during S and G<sub>2</sub>/M phases of the cell cycle. As a consequence of this association, PCAF inhibits the activity of cyclin/cdk2 complexes. This effect is specific for cdk2 because PCAF does not inhibit either cyclin D3/cdk6 or cyclin B/cdk1 activities. The inhibition is neither competitive with ATP, nor with the substrate histone H1 suggesting that somehow PCAF disturbs cyclin/cdk2 complexes. We also demonstrate that overexpression of PCAF in the cells inhibits cdk2 activity and arrests cell cycle progression at S and G<sub>2</sub>/M. This blockade is dependent on cdk2 because it is rescued by the simultaneous overexpression of this kinase. Moreover, we also observed that PCAF acetylates cdk2 at lysine 33. As this lysine is essential for the interaction with ATP, acetylation of this residue inhibits cdk2 activity. Thus, we report here that PCAF inhibits cyclin/cdk2 activity by two different mechanisms: (i) by somehow affecting cyclin/cdk2 interaction and (ii) by acetylating K33 at the catalytic pocket of cdk2. These findings identify a previously unknown mechanism that regulates cdk2 activity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) are key enzymes for the regulation of cell cycle progression and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Their activities are firstly regulated by their binding to regulatory subunits called cyclins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). A specific subset of cyclin/cdk complexes participates in the control of cell cycle progression by being activated at different stages of the cell cycle, thus driving the cells through its different phases. It is now clear that cdk1 bound to cyclins A and B governs G<sub>2</sub>/M transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). G<sub>1</sub> progression is primarily under the control of cyclin D/cdk4/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Finally, cyclins E and A paired to cdk2 are required for G<sub>1</sub>/S transition and progression through S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>Cyclin/cdk complexes are additionally regulated by a number of mechanisms including phosphorylation and binding to inhibitory proteins. Thus, in addition to cyclin binding most cdks require phosphorylation at a conserved residue (Thr 160 in human cdk2) to achieve full kinase activity. The enzyme responsible for this phosphorylation is CAK, that consists in the cdk7/cyclin H/Mat 1 trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Major cdks can also be inhibited by phosphorylation at a conserved tyrosine (Tyr 15) and at its adjacent threonine (Thr 14). These phosphorylations are carried out by Wee1 and Myt1 in vertebrate cells and can be removed by the phosphatase cdc25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Finally, cdk activity is also regulated by binding to members of two families of inhibitors (CKIs): the Ink4 family (p16<sup>ink4a</sup>, p15<sup>ink4b</sup>, p18<sup>ink4c</sup> and p19<sup>ink4d</sup>) and the Cip/Kip family (p21<sup>Cip1</sup>, p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and p57<sup>Kip2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The members of the Ink4 family only interact with cdk4 and cdk6 inhibiting their activities. In contrast, the Cip/Kip members bind to all known cyclin/cdk complexes. These proteins are potent inhibitors of cyclin/cdk2, but they also inhibit the other cyclin/cdk complexes, although in a less extension.</p><p>Apart from participating in cell cycle regulation cyclinA/cdk2 also plays a role in the control of the transcriptional activity of steroid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). For instance, both the estrogen receptor (ER) and the progesterone receptor (PR) are activated by cyclin A/cdk2. In the first case, this complex directly phosphorylates ER, thus potentiating its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In the second case, cyclin A/cdk2 phosphorylates the co-activator SRC-1, fact that enhances its affinity for PR and thus increases gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Thus, in the promoters regulated by these receptors cyclin A/cdk2 participates in multi-protein complexes that also contain transcription factors, co-repressors and co-activators including acetyltransferases.</p><p>During the last decade a growing number of evidences indicate that acetylation, a post-translational modification occurring at the N&#x003b5;-amino-group of lysines, might regulate protein functions in many different ways as, for instance, protein-protein interaction, protein association to DNA and protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that cdk9, a member of the cdk family involved in transcriptional regulation, is acetylated by Gcn5 and PCAF at lysines 44 and 48 that are located at the catalytic pocket of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In particular, K48 is essentially involved in orienting the ATP phosphate residues within the catalytic pocket and thus, acetylation of this lysine residue inactivates the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Therefore, acetylation of cdk9 at these specific lysines is a new mechanism involved in transcriptional regulation. Lysine K48 is conserved in all the members of the cdk family and this fact suggests that other cdks may be susceptible to be acetylated at this site. For this reason, we aimed to explore whether acetylases might participate in the regulation of cdk2 activity. Recently, we observed that the acetyltransferase PCAF can acetylate cyclin A at specific lysines, leading to its degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). PCAF is homologous to GCN5 and in vertebrate cells both proteins are subunits of the SAGA-type multiprotein complexes. These complexes are co-activators that stimulate transcription in part via acetylation and modification of nucleosomes, in cooperation with nucleosome remodeling enzymes and by physically recruiting the mediator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>We report here that PCAF directly binds to cdk2, acetylates K33 and as a consequence inhibits its kinase activity. Moreover, our results also revealed that merely the interaction of PCAF with cyclin/cdk2 complexes, in the absence of acetylation, inhibits cdk2 activity. This effect is specific because PCAF does not inhibit the activities of either cyclin B/cdk1 or cyclin D3/cdk6 complexes. Therefore, PCAF can regulate cdk2 activity by two different mechanisms: acetylation of K33 of cdk2 and disturbing cyclin/cdk2 complexes independently of acetylation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>cDNA of wild-type cdk2 was cloned into pGEX2T and pECFP-C1 vectors. pUHDP1-Flag-cdk2 WT and K33R and pGEX2T-cdk2 K33R were a generous gift from R.

SPR detects binding interactions by monitoring the reflection of a beam of light off the interface between an aqueous solution of potential binding molecules and a biosensor surface carrying an immobilized bait protein. The analysis of the interaction between PCAF and cdk2 was performed at room temperature using a Biacore T100 (Biacore International AB). Purified recombinant proteins GST-PCAF and GST-cdk2 were cleaved with Thrombin protease (Sigma) to remove GST. Then, PCAF was immobilized on a carboxymethylated dextran sensor chip (CM5) using the amine coupling method as described by the manufacturer. A blank immobilization was performed using the same method and was used as the reference surface. Purified full-length cdk2 was diluted in HBS-EP buffer (Biacore International AB) and was injected over the flow cells at a flow rate of 30 &#x000b5;l/min for 60 s. Following a dissociation time of 120 s, final regeneration of the surface was performed with a short pulse of 0.05% (w/v) SDS.

Interestingly, these complexes contain SPT3, a protein subunit of the GCN5/PCAF multiprotein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). A similar interaction was observed with ectopic YFP-PCAF and Flag-cdk2 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D).

As observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E results indicate that cdk2 directly interacts with the acetylase.</p><p>The interaction between cdk2 and PCAF during cell cycle was subsequently determined. Thus, cells were synchronized at different phases of the cell cycle by a double thymidine block or by a nocodazole treatment as described in the methods section. To check whether synchronization was correct we analyzed the levels of cyclin A, and phosphorylated histone H3 in the cell extracts. It is known that cyclin A levels are high at S and G<sub>2</sub>/M, whereas they remain low at G<sub>1</sub> and mitosis and that phosphorylated histone H3 is considered to be a mitotic marker. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>F the levels of cyclin A and those of phosphorylated H3 behaved as expected. We also observed that cdk2 remained constant along cell cycle, whereas the levels of PCAF were high at S and G<sub>2</sub>/M, slightly lower at metaphase and much lower at G<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>F). The interaction between cdk2 and PCAF at these different stages of the cell cycle was determined by IP with anti-cdk2 followed by WB with anti-PCAF. Results indicate that cdk2 was preferentially associated with PCAF during G<sub>2</sub>/M, whereas the association decreased at S phase and metaphase and was almost undetectable at G<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>G). Similar results were observed when the interaction between overexpressed proteins was analyzed. However, in this case the association of PCAF with cdk2 at S phase is much higher than that observed in the case of the endogenous proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp777/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1D</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>PCAF inhibits cyclin A/cdk2 activity</title><p>Because of the direct interaction between PCAF and cdk2, we aimed to study whether PCAF might affect cyclin/cdk2 activity.

Those members of the family that participate in the regulation of the G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle act as integrators of the extracellular mitogenic stimuli, that include growth factors, interaction with the extracellular matrix and cell&#x02212;cell interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). These external factors, when associate with specific plasma membrane receptors trigger different signaling pathways that converge in the regulation of the activity of the G<sub>1</sub>-operating cdks. In addition to that, cdks also integrate the signaling emanated from cell cycle checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Therefore, these kinases have multiple regulatory mechanisms that allow them to coordinate these different pathways and qualify cdks for doing this complex integrative activity. As mentioned above, the now classical general mechanisms that regulate cdk activity include the interaction with cyclins, that stimulates cdk activity, and with CKIs that, on the contrary, inhibit cdk activity. Phosphorylation also regulates positively and negatively the activity of cdks. However, more recently, new mechanisms that specifically regulate the activity of some cdks are emerging. For example, it should be mentioned that the oncogene and chromatin remodeling protein SET specifically inhibits cyclin B/cdk1 activity by associating to this complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Other examples are that acetylation of K48 of cdk9 by PCAF and Gcn5 inactivates this enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and that acetylation of cyclin A at specific lysines promotes its degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>We report here that the acetyltransferase PCAF inhibits cyclin/cdk2 activity by two different mechanisms: (i) by interacting with cyclin/cdk2 complexes in experimental conditions that do not allow protein acetylation (absence of the acetyl donor Acetyl-CoA) and (ii) by acetylating K33 of the cdk2 sequence, similarly to that observed for cdk9.</p><p>PCAF is a histone acetyltransferase homologous to Gcn5, both belonging to the GNAT family (Gcn5 related N-acetyltransferases), which are important for transcriptional initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). PCAF participates in the reversible acetylation of various transcriptional regulators as the general transcription factors TF<sub>II</sub>E&#x003b2; and TF<sub>II</sub>F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) and the sequence-specific transcription factors E2F1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), c-myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), myo D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) and p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). In the cell, PCAF is a subunit of multiprotein complexes that posses global histone acetylation activity and locus-specific co-activator functions together with acetyl transferase activity on non-histone susbtrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Interestingly, PCAF possesses a domain with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in its N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).</p><p>We have recently observed that PCAF directly interacts with and acetylates cyclin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). This acetylation is produced at early mitosis and stimulates cyclin A degradation at prometaphase with the consequent inactivation of cyclin A/cdk2 complexes. These results together with those reported here indicate that the mechanism involved in the inhibition of cyclin A/cdk2 activity by PCAF is quite complex and include at least three different actions: alteration of cyclin A/cdk2 association, acetylation of cdk2 and acetylation of cyclin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). Likely, these three actions of PCAF on cyclin A/cdk2 proceed in a specific sequence in order to block the activity of this complex during a given period of time. We propose that after binding of PCAF to cyclin A/cdk2 the activity of this complex is inhibited simply by the affectation of the interaction between both subunits. Then, cdk2 could be acetylated on K33 at the catalytic pocket, a fact that would additionally inactivate the enzyme but also, and probably most important, would provoke its separation from cyclin A. This is suggested by the data reported here revealing that the pseudoacetylated cdk2K33Q mutant does not interact with cyclin A. Subsequently, acetylated cdk2 would remain inactive and also protected from the putative activation by other type of cyclins. <fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>An outline representing the two different mechanisms, by which PCAF inhibits the activity of cyclin A/cdk2 complexes is shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp777f9"/></fig></p><p>Kinetic analyses of cyclin A/cdk2 activity in the presence or absence of PCAF reveal that it does not compete either with ATP or with the substrate. As PCAF directly interacts with both cyclin A and cdk2 it is likely that this double interaction disturbs somehow cyclin A/cdk2 association, thus reducing its enzymatic efficiency. This is supported by the evidence that, to effectively inhibit the activity of cyclin A/cdk2 complexes, the integrity of a long fragment of PCAF is needed (C-terminus including aa 352&#x02013;382). Specific domains within this C-terminus fragment of PCAF, as HAT, ADA and Bromodomain, when tested alone, do not inhibit the activity of the complex. Likely, this long C-terminus fragment should contain specific domains responsible for the specific interaction with cyclin A and cdk2. However, the identity of these putative interacting domains still remains unknown.</p><p>Overexpression of PCAF blocks cell cycle progression at S and G<sub>2</sub>/M as observed by FACS analysis. This is consistent with the evidence that at these stages of the cell cycle the interaction of PCAF with cdk2 and also with cyclin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) is high. Interestingly, this cell cycle blockade is reversed, when cells are simultaneously co-transfected with PCAF and cdk2. These results indicate that overexpression of PCAF is affecting the cellular availability of cdk2 and that by increasing the amount of cdk2 in the cells, the cell cycle arrest is overcome. We still do not know the role of PCAF on the regulation of S phase but a recent report indicates that GCN5 modulates S phase by regulating cdc6 phosphorylation by cyclin A/cdk2 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). In this article authors describe that overexpression of GCN5 generates a block in S phase similarly to that we observed in cells transfected with PCAF. Because these two acetylases are highly homologous it can be postulated that PCAF can also play a role in regulating DNA synthesis. The putative role of PCAF on G<sub>2</sub>/M could be related to the inactivation of cyclin A/cdk2 complexes at the G<sub>2</sub> phase. However, to demonstrate this hypothesis it is necessary to determine the endogenous acetylation of cdk2 along the cell cycle. Unfortunately, detection of endogenous acetylated cdk2 <italic>in vivo</italic> has been widely elusive until now.</p><p>PCAF acetylation of K33 of cdk2 is a similar event to that occurring in cdk9. It has been previously reported that this kinase can also be acetylated by PCAF and Gcn5 at K48, which is the equivalent to K33 in cdk2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). As cdk9 is involved in transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), authors demonstrated that acetylation of this kinase specifically inhibits cdk9 dependent transcriptional activity. As this lysine is located in the catalytic pocket of all cdks but also of many other kinases, one can speculate that acetylation of this specific residue could be a more general mechanism of the regulation of kinase activity.</p><p>PCAF also plays an important role in the DNA damage checkpoint response by acetylating p53 and E2F1. After DNA damage, PCAF acetylates and stabilizes E2F1 and as a consequence complexes containing both proteins are formed. These complexes re-localize from cell cycle progression-genes to the promoters of pro-apoptotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Moreover, PCAF acetylates p53 at lysine 320 and induces the expression of selected p53 target genes as PIG3 and NOXA under DNA damage conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Results reported here allow us to speculate about the possibility that PCAF could also participate in the DNA damage response by inhibiting cyclin/cdk2 complexes in order to arrest cell cycle progression. Thus, PCAF activation after DNA damage would induce the acetylation of both cyclin A and cdk2 leading to the inhibition of cdk2 activity and cell cycle arrest.</p><p>As cyclin A/cdk2 complexes are involved in the regulation of steroid hormone mediated transcription, it appears that the inhibition of these complexes by PCAF could affect the activity of SR-mediated gene expression. However, this possibility still remains to be explored.</p><p>As a summary, our results reveal a new mechanism for the regulation of cell cycle progression by PCAF. This acetylase controls cdk2 activity by a mechanism that includes the direct binding to cyclin/cdk2 complexes that might compromise the interaction between both proteins and by acetylating an essential lysine located in the catalytic pocket of the kinase.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp777/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Grants SAF2006-05212 and SAF2007-60491 from the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci&#x000f3;n of Spain and Rticc RD06/0020/0010 from the Instituto de Salud Carlos III.
