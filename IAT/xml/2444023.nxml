This can be a result of regulated angiogenesis, recruitment of circulating endothelial progenitors and/or vascular trans-differentiation. The present study demonstrates that treatment of SKBR-3 breast cancer cells with retinoic acid (RA), an important regulator of embryogenesis, cancer and other diseases, stimulates the formation of networks in Matrigel. RA-treatment of SKBR-3 cells co-cultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells resulted in the formation of mixed structures. RA induces expression of many endothelial genes including vascular endothelial (VE) cadherin. VE-cadherin was also induced by RA in a number of other breast cancer cells. We show that RA-induced VE-cadherin is responsible for the RA-induced morphological changes. RA rapidly induced the expression of Sox-9 and ER81, which in turn form a complex on the VE-cadherin promoter and are required to mediate the transcriptional regulation of VE-cadherin by RA. These data indicate that RA may promote the expression of endothelial genes resulting in endothelial-like differentiation, or provide a mechanism whereby circulating endothelial progenitor cells could be incorporated into a growing organ or tumor.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Organogenesis during embryonic development and tumor growth are dependent on adequate vasculature. For example a breast tumor that is unable to induce angiogenesis fails to reach a size greater than 4 mm and is incapable of distant metastasis. Metastatic lesions are often the source of cancer symptoms and the primary cause of death in cancer patients. Thus, the degree of vascularization of the tumor is one of the most important negative prognostic parameters in breast cancer.</p><p>Illustrating how a tumor induces new vasculature is, therefore, a crucial step to understand molecular nature of tumor progression. The classic paradigm of the angiogenic switch states that, as the tumor expands, central necrosis occurs due to hypoxia and nutrient deprivation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002714-Folkman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. This leads to the production of angiogenic factors such as VEGF and the recruitment of endothelial cells from neighboring blood vessels or circulating progenitors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002714-Kerbel1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. An alternative concept of tumor angiogenesis has been proposed in which some tumor cells trans-differentiate into endothelial cells and give rise to patterned spheroidal tumor clusters containing channel-like spaces between them capable of mimicking the circulatory system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002714-Hendrix1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. This phenomenon, termed as &#x0201c;vasculogenic mimicry&#x0201d;, is highly predicative of clinical outcome in patients with aggressive melanoma. Vasculogenic mimicry also occurs in other tumor types including breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002714-Hendrix2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002714-Labelle1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In the breast cancer model, blood flows between tumor cell-lined vascular spaces and endothelium-lined and/or mature vasculature. However, detailed molecular mechanisms underlying vasculogenic mimicry still remain to be elucidated, and it is not known if any treatment regimens can regulate this process.</p><p>Retinoids, natural or synthetic vitamin A analogues, have been used in anti-cancer therapy for many years. RA exhibits differentiation and cell cycle arrest-dependent growth inhibition properties in many cells and tissues. Many clinical and experimental model studies have shown that retinoids and their derivatives are effective in prevention and treatment of breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002714-Donato1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002714-Zanardi1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, treatment of primary lung cancer with &#x003b2;-carotene, the most important dietary precursor of vitamin A, induced an even higher incidence of lung cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002714-1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002714-Omenn1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Fenretinide, a vitamin A analogue, appears to reduce the risk of second breast cancers in premenopausal women, but increases risk in postmenopausal women <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002714-Veronesi1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies imply that retinoids may be effective in a preventative setting, but may actually have a negative effect after tumor initiation and during progression, particularly in estrogen-depleted circumstances. As some tumor cells may harbor a pluripotent stem cell phenotype, retinoid-induced &#x0201c;differentiation&#x0201d; during carcinogenesis could result in either a negative outcome (e.g. vascular or mesenchymal differentiation) or a positive one (e.g. mammary epithelial differentiation). In other words, retinoid-dependent &#x0201c;differentiation&#x0201d; may be responsible both for its failure as a treatment in certain circumstances as well as its side effects, due to its action on non-tumor cells. In the present study, we report that 9-<italic>cis</italic>-RA induced endothelial-like differentiation in the estrogen receptor negative SKBR-3 breast adenocarcinoma cell line. Using microarray analysis, we found that 9-<italic>cis</italic>-RA treatment resulted in an endothelial-like genetic program and robustly induced VE-cadherin. 9-<italic>cis</italic>-RA treatment induced VE-cadherin in four other breast cancer cells. We also show that Sox-9 and the Ets-1 family member ER81 are required for the transcriptional regulation of VE-cadherin by 9-<italic>cis</italic>-RA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Materials and Reagents</title><p>9-<italic>cis</italic>-RA was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany), mouse anti-VE-cadherin was from Immunotech (France) and R&#x00026;D systems (Minneapolis, MN), goat anti-VE-cadherin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-Sox-9 was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA), anti-myc was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), anti-FLAG (M2) was from Sigma, anti-GAPDH was from Research Diagnostics Inc (Flanders, NJ).

Therefore, we hypothesized that the effects of RA on VE-cadherin expression are mediated by RA induction of other, perhaps known, endothelial regulatory genes. VE-cadherin expression is known to be regulated by members of the ets family of transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002714-Gory1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002714-Prandini1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, our examination of the VE-cadherin promoter suggested ets and sox binding sites in VE-cadherin promoter. We reasoned that any candidate mediator genes for VE-cadherin expression would be also rapidly induced by 9-<italic>cis</italic>-RA in SKBR-3 cells. Sox-9, a member of the high mobility group (HMG) box gene family of transcription factors, was one of the candidate genes identified in our microarray. Indeed, Sox-9 is known as a target of RA.

Another candidate gene was ER81 (ETV1; ets variant gene1). The ER81 promoter contains 4 RARE sites, and RA induces Ets1 transcription. Using real-time PCR analysis We found that he Sox-9 transcript was rapidly elevated by 9-<italic>cis</italic>-RA-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002714-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, left), and was increased 8.28 fold after 2 h exposure to 9-<italic>cis</italic>-RA.

Induction of Sox-4 and Sox-18 by 9-<italic>cis</italic>-RA were also observed, but levels did not begin to increase until well after VE-cadherin induction (not shown). Increase of nuclear expression of Sox-9 by 9-<italic>cis</italic>-RA was also observed by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002714-g003">Fig. 3B</xref> right).

In addition, mosaic blood vessels occur in colon carcinomas and melanomas. The formation of these networks seems to recapitulate the embryonic development of vasculogenic networks, and is associated with the distinctly patterned, extra-cellular matrix-rich networks that are observed in aggressive tumors. In aggressive melanoma with a vasculogenic phenotype, altered expression of angiogenesis/vasculogenesis-related genes such as VE-cadherin, E-selectin and tissue-factor pathway inhibitor is observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002714-Hendrix1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. We show that 9-<italic>cis</italic>-RA induced these endothelial specific genes in SKBR-3 breast cancer cells with concomitant endothelial-like morphological alterations including network formation in Matrigel.

However we do find that RA-treated SKBR3 cells can form mixed vessel-like structures when co-cultured with HUVECs. These findings suggest that, under certain circumstances, RA treatment triggers an endothelial-like transdifferentiation in a subset of breast cancer cells perhaps allowing the formation of mixed vessels with the host vasculature resulting in an unfavorable clinical outcome.</p><p>VE-cadherin is exclusively expressed in endothelial cells and is restricted to cell-to-cell junctions where it mediates cell adhesion.

It is possible that angiogenesis is secondary to vasculogenesis in providing a circulatory system for the growing tumor. In other words, RA-induced trans-differentiated cells may provide a homing mechanism for circulating endothelial cells (CECs) or bone marrow-derived endothelial precursor cells (EPCs). Circulating endothelial cells and progenitor cells are clearly important in tumor growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002714-Shaked1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is possible that these CECs/EPCs migrate to the tumor site and are stabilized at that location because of homotypic cell-cell interactions between cell surface antigens (e.g. VE-cadherin) that are common to both trans-differentiated tumor cells and migrating CECs/EPCs. The observations that RA-treated SKBR3 cells formed nodes form which HUVEC networks appear to nucleate is consistent with this possibility.</p><p>The ability of carcinoma cells to take on characteristics typical of cells from quite different backgrounds is well established and may be related to a stem cell-like origin.

Our data suggests that these properties need to be taken into account when considering treatment or prevention regimens using potent differentiating agents such as vitamins A and D. Although some agents might inhibit proliferation of a subpopulation of tumor cells, they might stimulate the trans-differentiation of another subpopulation. Clearly, those tumor cells that re-acquire differentiated properties in response to such an agent still harbor the genetic defects that transformed them initially and <underline>cannot</underline> be considered as normal differentiated cells.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrated that 9-<italic>cis</italic>-RA induces endothelial-like trans-differentiation in SKBR-3 cells. These phenotypic changes are accompanied by significant induction of the endothelial genetic program. VE-cadherin plays a central role in these morphological alterations, and we found that both Sox-9 and ER81 bind to VE-cadherin promoter and participate in its transcriptional induction by RA. These data may explain the mixed results of clinical trials using various vitamin A analogues, and bring up the rather disturbing notion that treatments with retinoids might stimulate certain tumor cells to acquire vasculogenic properties.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002714.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Microarray and q-PCR analyses.</p><p>(0.26 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0002714.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to acknowledge the support of Luis Dettin and the following LCCC Core Facilities: microscopy, tissue culture, macromolecular analysis and microarray.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0002714-Folkman1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Folkman</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><year>1971</year><article-title>Tumor angiogenesis: therapeutic implications.</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><volume>285</volume><fpage>1182</fpage><lpage>1186</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">4938153</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0002714-Kerbel1"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kerbel</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Folkman</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><year>2002</year><article-title>Clinical translation of angiogenesis inhibitors.</article-title><source>Nat Rev Cancer</source><volume>2</volume><fpage>727</fpage><lpage>739</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12360276</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0002714-Hendrix1"><label>3</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hendrix</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Seftor</surname><given-names>EA</given-names></name><name><surname>Hess</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Seftor</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name></person-group><year>2003</year><article-title>Vasculogenic mimicry and tumour-cell plasticity: lessons from melanoma.</article-title><source>Nat Rev Cancer</source><volume>3</volume><fpage>411</fpage><lpage>421</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12778131</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0002714-Hendrix2"><label>4</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hendrix</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Seftor</surname><given-names>EA</given-names></name><name><surname>Kirschmann</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name><name><surname>Seftor</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name></person-group><year>2000</year><article-title>Molecular biology of breast cancer metastasis.
