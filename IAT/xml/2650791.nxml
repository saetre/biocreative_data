One PDE family member, PDE3B, plays an important role in the regulation of a variety of metabolic processes such as lipolysis and insulin secretion. In this study, the cellular localization and the role of PDE3B in the regulation of triglyceride, cholesterol and glucose metabolism in hepatocytes were investigated. PDE3B was identified in caveolae, specific regions in the plasma membrane, and smooth endoplasmic reticulum. In caveolin-1 knock out mice, which lack caveolae, the amount of PDE3B protein and activity were reduced indicating a role of caveolin-1/caveolae in the stabilization of enzyme protein. Hepatocytes from PDE3B knock out mice displayed increased glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol levels, which was associated with increased expression of gluconeogenic and lipogenic genes/enzymes including, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b3;, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. In conclusion, hepatocyte PDE3B is localized in caveolae and smooth endoplasmic reticulum and plays important roles in the regulation of glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol metabolism. Dysregulation of PDE3B could have a role in the development of fatty liver, a condition highly relevant in the context of type 2 diabetes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are important regulators of signal transduction processes mediated by cAMP and cGMP. The PDE family contains eleven structurally related and functionally distinct subfamilies (PDE1-11) that differ in their primary structures, affinities for cAMP and cGMP, responses to specific effectors and inhibitors, as well as mechanisms through which they are regulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Conti1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. PDE3 isoforms are encoded by two similarly organized genes, PDE3A and PDE3B. These enzymes hydrolyze cAMP and cGMP with high affinity in a mutually competitive manner and are inhibited by compounds such as cilostamide, cilastazol and milrinone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Degerman1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Thompson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The structural organization of PDE3A and PDE3B proteins is identical with the catalytic domain found in all PDEs located in the C-terminal portions of the molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Degerman1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Thompson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The catalytic domains of PDE3A and B are highly conserved, except for an insertion of 44 unique amino acids that is not found in the catalytic domains of other PDE families and that also differs in, and thus distinguishes, PDE3A and B isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Degerman1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Thompson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Their N-terminal regulatory domains are quite divergent, consisting of two hydrophobic regions important for membrane association of these enzymes. Full-length PDE3s (Mw 135 kDA) are found in association with membranes; smaller PDE3A forms are found in cytosolic fractions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Choi1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, PDE3B has been shown to be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and to specific detergent-resistent parts of the plasma membrane, caveolae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Nilsson1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Ahmad1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Caveolae are special forms of lipid rafts observed as small flask-shaped 50&#x02013;100 nM invaginations of the plasma membranes and are particularly abundant in adipocytes. They have a high content of sphingolipids, cholesterol and are stabilized by one or more isoforms of caveolin. Caveolae are believed to be important in the organization of signal transduction events, particularly insulin and cAMP signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Cohen1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

Further, we show that PDE3B plays important roles in the regulation of glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol metabolism in hepatocytes.</p><p>The localization of PDE3B to caveolae is highly interesting, since caveolae have been suggested to be important in the organization of cellular signalling as well as in lipid synthesis and cholesterol homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Cohen1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The presence of caveolae in hepatocytes has previously been demonstrated using different approaches. Plasma membranes of isolated rat hepatocytes has been shown to contain sphingolipid-enriched microdomains with high amounts of cholesterol and caveolin-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Tietz1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, and the presence of caveolae in the hepatocyte plasma membrane has been shown directly using rapid-freeze, deep-etching electron microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Calvo1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. In agreement with the presence of caveolae in hepatocyte plasma membranes, in this study we detect caveolin-1 and flotillin-1, markers for caveolae and lipid rafts, respectively, specifically in the plasma membrane of isolated mouse hepatocytes and fractionation of sonicated plasma membranes in a sucrose gradient resulted in co-migration of caveolin-1, flotillin-1 and cholesterol. Furthermore, results from caveolin-1 KO mice suggest an important role of caveolin-1 in hepatocyte lipid droplet formation and liver regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Mayoral1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Fernndez1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The finding that caveolin-1 KO livers show reduced levels of both PDE3B activity and protein expression indicates a role of caveolin-1/caveolae in the stabilization of the PDE3B protein which has also been demonstrated for the adipocyte PDE3B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Nilsson1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results demonstrating that PDE3B in hepatocytes is localized to distinct cellular locations, plasma membrane/caveolae as well as smooth ER, is in agreement with recent results in adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Nilsson1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Ahmad1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Exactly which is the role for PDE3B at these cellular locations needs to be further investigated.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate increased glucose production and increased level of PEPCK mRNA and protein in hepatocytes from PDE3B KO mice, which is in agreement with previous studies in these mice (clamp studies <italic>in vivo</italic> and PEPCK expression in intact liver) and with studies using PDE3 inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Choi2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Abdollahi1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The increase in glucose production observed in isolated hepatocytes is not extensive and whether this increase can fully explain the increased production of glucose seen <italic>in vivo</italic> in PDE3B KO mice is difficult to know. Although we culture the hepatocytes on Primaria&#x02122; dishes to keep as much as possible of the original properties of the cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Dohda1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, the hepatocytes most likely have reduced biological responsiveness compared to the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation in PDE3B KO mice. Furthermore, a number of defects related to the storage of triglycerides and cholesterol were identified in hepatocytes from PDE3B KO mice. Thus, we found up-regulation of triglyceride levels in hepatocytes as was the case in PDE3B KO livers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Choi2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and of SREBP1c, one of two transcriptional factors encoded by SREBF1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Raghow1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. The expression of SREBP1c predominates in the liver and has previously been shown to be regulated by insulin and increased intracellular cAMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Raghow1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study we demonstrate a specific role of PDE3B in cAMP mediated regulation of SREBP1c. Nuclear SREBPs is known to interact with cAMP response element binding protein (CREBP)-binding protein (CBP) and PPAR&#x003b3;&#x02013;regulated coactivator-1&#x003b2; (PGC-1&#x003b2;) which leads to upregulation of fatty acid synthase and suppression of PEPCK gene expression in liver in response to insulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Raghow1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Cyclic AMP has also been shown to contribute to the regulation of HMG CoA reductase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Bifulco1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, however, little is known regarding involvement of specific PDEs, such as PDE3B, in this process and in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis. In this study we show that indeed PDE3B seems to be important in this context but the exact signalling pathways in the regulation of HMG CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis needs to be further evaluated. Thus, in hepatocytes from PDE3B KO mice, increased triglyceride and cholesterol biosynthesis occurred in parallel with elevated gluconeogenesis. At this point we can not completely exclude that decreased breakdown and/or release of triglycerides and cholesterol contribute to the increased levels of the lipids in the PDE3B KO hepatocytes. However, the increased expression of PPAR&#x003b3;, SREBP1c and HMG CoA reductase together with previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Choi2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> showing increased expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) in PDE3B KO liver, indicate that increased biosynthesis contribute to the fatty liver phenotype. Indeed increased accumulation of fat in the liver is highly relevant in the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and the metabolic syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Kotronen1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004671-Kotronen2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been estimated that 70&#x02013;80&#x00025; of T2D patients have non alcoholic fatty liver disease. This disease covers a spectrum of liver diseases from steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. Indeed, increased fat accumulation in the liver appears to be a marker of hepatic insulin resistance and a close correlate of all components of the metabolic syndrome independent of obesity. The role of defect/dysregulated PDE3B in fatty liver development needs to be further investigated.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate that, in mouse hepatocytes, PDE3B is localized in caveolae/raft regions in the plasma membrane as well as in smooth ER and that the enzyme has an important role in the regulation of triglyceride, cholesterol and glucose metabolism in these cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Karl Sw&#x000e4;rd for supplying the PDE3B KO livers.
