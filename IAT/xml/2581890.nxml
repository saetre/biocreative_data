In poliovirus-infected cells, ER and Golgi stacks disappear, while new clusters of vesicle-like structures form sites for viral RNA synthesis. Virus replication is inhibited by brefeldin A (BFA), implicating some components(s) of the cellular secretory pathway in virus growth. Formation of characteristic vesicles induced by expression of viral proteins was not inhibited by BFA, but they were functionally deficient. GBF1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small cellular GTPases, Arf, is responsible for the sensitivity of virus infection to BFA, and is required for virus replication. Knockdown of GBF1 expression inhibited virus replication, which was rescued by catalytically active protein with an intact N-terminal sequence. We identified a mutation in GBF1 that allows growth of poliovirus in the presence of BFA. Interaction between GBF1 and viral protein 3A determined the outcome of infection in the presence of BFA.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>All positive strand RNA viruses replicate their genomes in association with membranous structures that are formed after infection by remodeling pre-existing cellular organelles. The role of membranes and the mechanisms exploited by viral proteins to orchestrate the formation and functioning of viral membranous replication complexes are largely unknown. Poliovirus replication is severely suppressed by brefeldin A (BFA), a well-known inhibitor of the cellular secretory pathway. Three cellular proteins (GBF1, BIG1 and BIG2) that activate small GTPases called Arfs, whose activity is necessary for normal functioning of the secretory pathway, are known targets of BFA. Here we demonstrate that poliovirus utilizes the GBF1-dependent Arf activation pathway for its replication. Our data explain the mechanism of BFA inhibition of poliovirus replication by demonstrating that viral protein 3A binds and recruits GBF1 to membranes that support viral RNA synthesis. Inactivation of GBF1 by BFA prevents Arf activation and recruitment, and prevents formation of functional replication complexes. Surprisingly, formation of membranous structures morphologically similar to viral replication complexes occurs in the presence of BFA, although these structures do not function in the synthesis of viral RNA. Other plus strand RNA viruses are known to exhibit sensitivity to BFA and our data suggest that hijacking of the Arf activation pathway may be a common feature shared by diverse groups of viruses.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>All known positive strand RNA viruses replicate their genomes in association with remodeled cellular membranes. Assembly of replication complexes on membranes is believed to have several advantages. Membranes provide a scaffold that increases the local concentration of proteins involved in replication and facilitates the proper topological orientation of replication complex components. The association with membranes protects replicating RNA from cellular nucleases, and may also prevent induction of cellular innate immune responses by confining dsRNA or other signaling intermediates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Salonen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Poliovirus is a member of the <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family, which consists of small, non-enveloped positive strand RNA viruses that include numerous human and veterinary pathogens, such as polio, rhinovirus (common cold virus), hepatitis A virus, and foot and mouth disease virus. The poliovirus genome is a single RNA molecule of about 7500 nt in length which is directly translated in an infected cell into a single polyprotein that undergoes immediate processing <italic>in cis</italic> and <italic>in trans</italic> by three virus-encoded proteases into a cascade of intermediates and mature polypeptides. Non-structural proteins, necessary for RNA replication, are encoded in the P2-P3 region of the genome, while coding sequences for structural proteins, necessary for packaging of progeny RNA but dispensable for replication, are located in the P1 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000216-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Infection of cells with poliovirus results in rapid and massive reorganization of virtually all intracellular membranes except for mitochondria, into clusters of tightly-associated vesicles of heterogeneous size which harbor viral replication complexes on their surfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Bienz1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Caliguiri1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Kallman1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. These replication complexes have been shown to be associated with all of the non-structural viral proteins from the P2 and P3 coding region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Bienz2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Tershak1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Such massive rearrangements in cellular membrane organization likely require major rewiring of normal membrane metabolism, but the molecular mechanisms underlying induction, formation and functioning of poliovirus membranous replication complexes remain largely unknown. It has been shown that at the early stages of poliovirus infection non-structural virus protein 2B co-localizes with COPII-coated vesicles, budding from ER exit sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Rust1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. These data together with the observations that poliovirus-induced vesicles are often found in electron micrographs close to the remnants of ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Bienz3">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> suggest that the COPII-dependent mechanism of vesicle formation may contribute to the development of viral replication complexes. However, Shlegel et al. have identified markers not only from the ER, but also from Golgi and lysosomes, present on polio-induced vesicles. It was proposed that autophagy-like processes may be involved in membrane remodeling in polio infected cells, which would also explain the large proportion of double membrane vesicles observed by electron microscopy of infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Schlegel1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="ppat-1000216-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000216.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Inhibition of poliovirus growth by BFA depends on the host cell.</title><p>A.

Interestingly, neither formation of COPII-coated vesicles nor autophagy are sensitive to BFA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Purhonen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Shaywitz1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Bednarek1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that these two processes do not fully account for all cellular pathways exploited by poliovirus for its replication. BFA is a fungal metabolite, specifically targeting the activation of small cellular GTPases, Arfs, which are key regulators of the cellular secretory pathway. The inactive, cytoplasmic GDP-bound form of Arf, upon nucleotide exchange to GTP, undergoes conformational changes that allow Arf-GTP to bind membranes. Arf-GTP is referred to as &#x0201c;activated&#x0201d;; it initiates formation of secretory vesicles and regulates cytoskeleton functions and lipid metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Kahn1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Conversion of Arf-GDP into Arf-GTP requires the activity of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). In human cells BFA inhibits the function of three GEFs &#x02013; GBF1, BIG1 and BIG2 &#x02013; by stabilizing transient complexes formed between the GEF and Arf-GDP. The specificity of BFA action on these GEFs is provided by the sequence of their Sec7 domains, directly involved in Arf activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Casanova1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We have shown previously that Arf-GTP accumulates on membranes in poliovirus- infected cells. Surprisingly, in an <italic>in vitro</italic> reaction, expression of two distinct viral proteins &#x02013; 3A, a small membrane-binding protein, and 3CD, a soluble protein with protease activity &#x02013; was sufficient to induce Arf translocation to membranes. We demonstrated that these two proteins specifically engage different cellular GEFs: 3A induces translocation of GBF1 to membranes while 3CD results in association with membranes of BIG1 and BIG2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Belov1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Belov2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Belov3">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, all three mammalian BFA-sensitive GEFs could be involved in poliovirus replication. Wessels et al. have demonstrated that direct interaction between GBF1 and 3A from poliovirus or coxsackie virus B3, a close relative of poliovirus, is responsible for association of GBF1 with membranes in 3A-expressing cells. When 3A was expressed individually, binding of 3A to GBF1 resulted in inhibition of the Arf-activating function of GBF1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Wessels1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Wessels2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. This mechanism was proposed to explain an established phenomenon of inhibition of cellular protein secretion in polio- and coxsackievirus-infected cells, which had been shown previously to be caused by 3A expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Dodd1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Doedens2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Doedens3">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In this paper we show that in the context of normal virus replication, functional GBF1 is required for successful virus propagation, and GBF1-3A interactions determine the outcome of infection in the presence of BFA. Surprisingly, the BFA-sensitive step in poliovirus replication was not the morphological remodeling of cellular membranes, but the functioning of replication complexes, suggesting strong dependence of poliovirus RNA replication on components of the host membrane traffic machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sensitivity of poliovirus to BFA depends on the host cell</title><p>To determine whether host cell factors contribute to BFA sensitivity of poliovirus replication, we took advantage of an available BFA-resistant cell line, BER-40, which was isolated from parental Vero cells after mutagenesis and subsequent passaging in the presence of BFA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Chen1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Vero cells are routinely used in large-scale viral vaccine production, and they support robust replication of poliovirus. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000216-g001">Figure 1B</xref> shows that while replication of poliovirus in Vero cells was severely inhibited by BFA, the BFA-resistant derivative of Vero cells, BER-40, was able to support replication of the virus in the presence of the inhibitor. These results demonstrate that some cellular BFA-sensitive process is required for successful propagation of poliovirus in Vero cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Mutation in GBF1 is responsible for BFA resistance of BER-40 cells</title><p>To identify the BFA-sensitive host factor involved in poliovirus replication, we decided to investigate the mechanism of resistance of BER40 cells to the inhibitor.

We examined the gene sequences coding for all three high molecular weight Arf GEFs &#x02013; GBF1, BIG1 and BIG2 &#x02013; that are known to be targets of BFA, to determine whether mutations were present in BER-40 cells compared with the parental Vero cell line. Formation of a stable complex between BFA, a sensitive ArfGEF and Arf-GDP is determined by specific amino acids in the Sec7 domains of the ArfGEFs; the rest of the protein does not participate in this interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Peyroche1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. We amplified the Sec7 domain coding sequences of BIG1, BIG2 and GBF1 from mRNA isolated from Vero and BER-40 cells. Sequence analysis showed that while BIG1 and BIG2 Sec7 domains were identical in both cell lines, BER-40 cells contained two species of GBF1 Sec7 sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000216-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). One corresponded to the same sequence found in the parental Vero cells, while the other coded for a substitution of the A in GBF1 residue 795 to E (A795E). The two gene sequences likely arise from genetic heterozygosity in the BER-40 cells rather than a mixture of two cell populations, since a sensitive population would be rapidly selected against in the presence of BFA. To confirm that this mutation was responsible for the BFA-resistant phenotype of BER40, we introduced it into an expression plasmid coding for YFP-GBF1 fusion protein, shown previously to be indistinguishable from the wild type GBF1 in intracellular localization and functional activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Niu1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. The mutated plasmid was used to transfect HeLa cells, a human cell line commonly used as a laboratory host for poliovirus and known to be highly sensitive to BFA. Transfection with the mutated plasmid conferred a greatly increased resistance to BFA, compared with cells transfected with an empty vector or cells transfected with a plasmid encoding the wild type GBF1 sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000216-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). In addition to increased cell survival in the presence of BFA, the BFA-resistant form of GBF1 also rescued the functional properties of the cells' secretory pathway, which are known to be sensitive to BFA treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Misumi1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

We also tested whether the rescue of polio replication from BFA inhibition in HeLa cells was dependent on GBF1's ability to functionally activate Arf.

Taken together, the data show that the 3A-2 mutant is more sensitive to BFA, more sensitive to depletion of GBF1 by siRNA kockdown, and is harder to rescue from BFA inhibition by providing ectopic GBF1. These properties are all consistent with low-affinity binding between 3A-2 and its target GBF1, whose activity is required for virus growth.</p><p>This analysis does not discriminate between a direct interaction of 3A with GBF1 and indirect activation of GBF1 translocation to membranes by a pathway triggered by 3A.

Our results (not shown) confirmed previous studies performed in a mammalian two-hybrid system, showing a strong interaction between wild type poliovirus 3A and GBF1 and the severe inhibition of such interaction for the 3A-2 mutation in the corresponding Coxsackie virus protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Wessels1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Wessels3">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since virus replication is inhibited by drugs that prevent Arf activation, such as BFA, we attempted to determine whether BFA affected either of these two potential inputs of Arf into poliovirus replication. To this end, we utilized a non-replicating poliovirus RNA where the cognate regulatory sequences in the 5&#x02032; non-translated region were substituted with an IRES from encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) to express polioviral proteins. This non-replicating RNA was expressed from a plasmid in HeLa cells by T7 RNA polymerase produced from a recombinant vaccinia virus. In this case accumulation of poliovirus-specific RNA is not dependent on replication, and the synthesis of polio proteins is not affected by the presence of brefeldin A.

Viral proteins were synthesized from polio RNAs generated by T7 RNA polymerase supplied by recombinant vaccinia virus. To ensure that equal amounts of proteins were produced during the stage of membrane remodeling with and without BFA, both samples were incubated in the presence of 2 mM guanidine-HCl, a specific and reversible inhibitor of polio RNA replication that prevented amplification of viral RNA template. The cells were incubated for 4.5 hours, the time that we found in the previously-described electron microscopy studies to be sufficient for vesicular structures to form. The presence of guanidine-HCl during this time blocked RNA replication from starting even if competent replication complexes had formed.

Often host proteins in infected cells are diverted to perform their normal function(s) in a new microenvironment or with modified specificity. In this paper we show that replication of poliovirus strongly depends on the activity of a cellular protein, GBF1. GBF1 activates the small cellular GTPase, Arf1, by exchanging Arf-bound GDP for GTP to regenerate the active form of Arf. In uninfected cells, GBF1 is required for specific steps during the transfer of proteins and membranes through the secretory pathway, from ER through the Golgi to plasma membrane or endosomes. Activation of Arf by GBF1 occurs during formation of COPI-coated vesicles from the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). This activity of GBF1 is inhibited by BFA which binds and stabilizes the Arf1-GDP-GBF1 intermediate complex and thus prevents GBF1 from performing multiple rounds of Arf activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Peyroche1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Niu1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

We demonstrate that GBF1 can rescue poliovirus infection from inhibition by BFA, and that reduced interaction between GBF1 and viral protein 3A increases the sensitivity of poliovirus infection to BFA. Inhibition of polio replication by BFA is specific for the particular host cell, and this specificity is determined by the sequence of the catalytic Sec7 domain of GBF1 in the cell. We identified a new mutation in GBF1, A795E, that renders the factor resistant to BFA. Expression of this BFA-resistant GBF1 conferred BFA resistance to HeLa cells and allowed efficient rescue of poliovirus replication in the presence of BFA. This mutation generates a single amino acid substitution at a residue that is very close to the BFA binding site identified on the crystal structure of the complex between the GEF Sec7 domain, BFA and Arf-GDP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Renault1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Mossessova1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.

Interestingly, another amino acid in the Sec7 domain of GBF1, M832, whose substitution to L also makes GBF1 resistant to BFA, is located very close to A795 in the crystal structure and also participates in van der Waals contact with BFA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Niu1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Renault1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Previous work from this laboratory demonstrated that two other high molecular weight GEFs that activate Arf, BIG1/BIG2, are recruited to polio replication complex membranes, both in vitro and in infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Belov4">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Recruitment of BIG1/BIG2 was mediated by viral protein 3CD, independent of 3A's recruitment of GBF1. Since the activities of these two GEFs are also sensitive to BFA, the data described in this report suggest that BIG1/BIG2 also are not involved in the morphological development of replication vesicles. It is not yet clear whether or what role these GEFs play in this complex process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Belov1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, since any or all of them might perform BFA-insensitive functions that could affect membrane remodeling or other aspects of polio replication.</p><p>Wessels et al. have performed elegant studies on the fate and consequences of expressing just the 3A protein from polio or Coxsackie virus B3 in mammalian cells. They found loss of COPI coatomer complex on membranes and reduction of activated Arf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Wessels2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. They also showed that 3A interacts directly with GBF1, and concluded that this interaction resulted in inhibition of the Arf-activating property of GBF1 when 3A was expressed by itself in mammalian cells. The single amino acid insertion in the 3A-2 mutant caused the viral protein to lose detectable binding to GBF1 and therefore did not inhibit GBF1's GEF activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Wessels1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Wessels3">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. It was proposed that this 3A-induced inhibition of GBF1 GEF activity was responsible for shutting down the secretory pathway in infected cells. In the course of virus infection, 3A protein is synthesized together with other viral proteins and is likely involved in interactions with other viral products that may significantly modify the outcome of its interactions with cellular proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Yin1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Teterina1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Our previous data showed that the amount of Arf-GTP steadily increased during the course of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Belov4">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>; thus at least overall GEF activity in infected cells is not inhibited. Moreover Gazina et al. demonstrated that components of COPI coats, whose association with membranes is directly dependent on GBF1-induced Arf activation, are associated with replication complexes of echovirus 11, a related picornavirus that is sensitive to BFA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Gazina1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. A genetic screen of Drosophila cells identified the COPI coatomer as a host factor essential for growth of another picornavirus-like virus, Drosophila C virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Cherry1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. These data do not support the notion that GBF1 activity is inhibited in infected cells. Our data presented here directly show that GBF1 is necessary for poliovirus replication and that only expression of catalytically active GBF1 can rescue poliovirus replication in the presence of BFA. Moreover we showed that synthesis of 3A results in stimulation of GBF1-dependent activation of Arf <italic>in vitro</italic>. These latter experiments are the most difficult to reconcile with the results from the van Kuppeveld laboratory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Wessels2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> since they demonstrate stimulation rather than inhibition of Arf activation even in the absence of other viral proteins. Collaborative studies in both laboratories are currently in progress to attempt to understand these apparently conflicting results. Our data also suggest that although the 3A-2 mutant may manifest a much weaker interaction with GBF1, it still retains some residual ability to induce association of this protein with membranes. We propose that interaction of 3A with GBF1 diverts its activity from its normal function in the secretory pathway to sites of polio replication where it functions in poliovirus (and likely other BFA-sensitive picornaviruses) replication. This diversion to viral replication complexes would likely result in inhibition of cellular secretion. Inhibition of cellular secretion leads to reduced presentation of antigens on the surface of infected cells as well as reduced release of cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Dodd1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Deitz1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, effective subversion of a cellular pathway may provide a double benefit for the virus by sustaining genome replication in the cell as well as inhibiting a pathway important for the organism's defense against infection.</p><p>Inhibition of the cellular secretory pathway was suggested to provide an advantage for replication of the virus in an animal host, but was believed to be dispensable for replication in cells culture. Although the 3A-2 mutation was found to strongly reduce poliovirus's ability to inhibit cellular secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Doedens2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, it was reported not to interfere significantly with propagation of the virus in cell culture. On the other hand, when the corresponding mutation was introduced into CVB3, the mutant was less pathogenic in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Wessels2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. The mechanism of the apparent attenuation remains to be elucidated.</p><p>What roles do GBF1-dependent reactions play in poliovirus replication? GBF1 normally participates in the formation of COPI-coated vesicles on ERGIC structures, and poliovirus replication complexes form on membranous structures that resemble clusters of heterogeneously sized vesicles. Thus, GBF1 may possibly be involved in remodeling host membranes into those structures. In poliovirus-infected cells, however, development of infection very rapidly results in complete reorganization of cellular organelles into specific membranous vesicles, so that ER, ERGIC and other structures are no longer detectable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Bienz1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, although some early secretory pathway steps could still be observed in infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Beske1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore infected cells very rapidly lose the normal morphological substrate for formation of COPI-like vesicles. Supporting this idea is our observation that the &#x00394;37 mutant of GBF1 is distributed like a soluble protein in infected cells while it is indistinguishable from the wt GBF1 in mock-infected cells. Apparently GBF1 in polio-infected cells is no longer retained on membranes through its normal interactions, such as binding to Rab1b and/or p115 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Monetta1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-GarciaMata2">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, but wt protein is tethered on remodeled membrane structures through binding to polio protein 3A, while the &#x00394;37 GBF1 mutant is unable to interact with 3A and therefore behaves like a soluble protein. Poliovirus infection is known to induce rapid degradation of nuclear pores and consequent leakiness of the nuclear envelope that allow even high molecular weight soluble proteins to freely penetrate the nuclear envelope in both directions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Belov5">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Gustin1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. Another set of data also suggests that the BFA-sensitive (and therefore the GBF1-dependent) step in poliovirus replication is not remodeling of membranes but rather proper functioning of the replication complexes. Poliovirus infection is sensitive to addition of BFA at every stage of the replication cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Maynell1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>; our unpublished observations), which would be difficult to reconcile with the requirement of such activity only for the morphogenesis of replication structures. Our experiments presented here directly show that BFA does not preclude formation of characteristic vesicle-like structures. The similar appearance by low-power electron microscopy of the membrane structures formed by viral proteins in the presence and absence of BFA was surprising; however, the apparent similarity does not imply that these structures are biochemically and functionally similar, as evidenced by the differences in Arf1 localization and very likely numerous other markers including the effectors normally recruited by Arf. Those structures are unable to support polio RNA replication when the inhibitor is removed. Association of activated Arf with membranes is known to induce binding of many effector proteins and coat complexes and to activate membrane-modifying enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Kahn1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Nie1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. It is likely that in the polio-induced vesicles, Arf's role could be to bring to the membranes other host proteins that participate in replication of the viral genome or in regulating the lipid composition of these structures to make them suitable for assembly of functional replication complexes. Interestingly, expression of the Arf1Q71L mutant that has increased affinity for GTP and therefore is always in an &#x0201c;activated state&#x0201d; was not able to restore polio replication from either inhibition of GBF1 activity by BFA or from knock-down of GBF1 expression by siRNA. This result may indicate that GBF1 performs some other function in polio replication, unrelated to Arf activation, but the most likely explanation of this inability of the Arf1 Q71L mutant to rescue polio replication is that the replication process requires Arf that can perform normal cycling between its GTP- and GDP-bound form, while Arf1 Q71L is constantly activated and bound to membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Dascher1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Vasudevan1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Zhang1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Presley1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>All positive strand RNA viruses remodel host membranes into novel structures where replication complexes are assembled, and RNA replication of at least some of them was shown to be sensitive to BFA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Gazina1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000216-Molina1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>.
