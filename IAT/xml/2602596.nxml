In tumor cells with wildtype p53, inhibition of calpain increased p53 level and enhanced apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003997-Atencio1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. The Rb tumor suppressor is cleaved by calpain during tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF&#x003b1;)-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. Calpain inhibitors stabilized Rb; mouse embryo fibroblasts with targeted disruption of a gene encoding calpain regulatory subunit CAPN4 have elevated Rb level and showed resistance to TNF&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis in comparison with wild-type cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003997-Tonnetti1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The E7 transforming protein of the human papilloma virus (HPV) induces calpain-mediated Rb cleavage in vitro and in vivo; the cleaved Rb was deficient in inducing growth arrest in SAOS-2 cells. Calpain inhibitors interfered with the E7-mediated degradation of Rb and reduced the viability of HPV-transformed cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003997-Darnell1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our finding that activity capable of NORE1A proteolysis as found not only in cell lines but in human tumors argues against the hypothesis that calpain cleavage of NORE1A and perhaps RASSF1A is an artifact of tissue culture. The calpain-mediated cleavage of NORE1A and RASSF1 tumor suppressors might be a mechanism by which some human tumors escape growth and tumor suppression. Further studies will be needed to address the question whether inhibition of this cleavage might induce re-expression of NORE1A and RASSF1A proteins with subsequent growth arrest or cell death in tumor cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Lines and Transfection</title><p>H358, H460, H157, HEK293 and A549 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in high-glucose DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum in a 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 37&#x000b0;C.
