The eIF4E protein was induced about 3-fold after 5 hr, which is physiologically relevant, as eIF4E amounts can be increased upon cell stimulation and in tumors to a similar extent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000242-Mao1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000242-Rosenwald1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. To assess the translational effect of eIF4E overexpression and to avoid secondary effects (especially transcriptional), a relatively short induction time of 5 hr was chosen followed by polyribosome fractionation and microarray analysis. Polysome profiles for both induced (-tet 5 hrs) and uninduced 3T3-tTA and 3T3-tTA-eIF4E cells overlapped and showed no significant differences (data not shown). A characteristic profile of 3T3-tTA and 3T3-tTA-eIF4E cells is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000242-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>. The 40S and 60S ribosome subunits and 80S ribosomes typically sedimented between fractions 3 and 11 in the sucrose density gradients, whereas polysomes sedimented between fractions 14 and 24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000242-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).

Two examined the effect of eIF4E induction on transcription and translation in the 3T3-tTA-eIF4E cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000242-g001">Fig. 1D, schemes 1 and 2</xref>). The other two analyses were conducted using the parental cell line 3T3-tTA which served as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000242-g001">Fig. 1D, schemes 3 and 4</xref>). First, we examined the effect of eIF4E on total mRNA levels. Total mRNA from uninduced versus induced 3T3-tTA-eIF4E was compared to RNA from uninduced versus induced 3T3-tTA. This analysis identified transcriptional activation that occurs in 3T3-tTA-eIF4E cells when eIF4E is induced but not in 3T3-tTA cells. As predicted from the short induction period for eIF4E, only a limited subset of transcripts was changed in transcriptome abundance (from a total of 27 unique annotated genes, 22 were induced and 5 repressed at a q-value&#x0003c;0.1 and 1.3 fold-change cut off). These changes are probably secondary to translation. As expected eIF4E mRNA levels were increased by approximately 16-fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000242.s001">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>Next, we identified the mRNAs that sedimented with the polysomal fractions from induced 3T3-tTA and 3T3-tTA-eIF4E cell lines and normalized them against total RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000242-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). This allowed for the scoring of an increase in translational efficiency of a mRNA independent of its abundance in the cell. We then identified those genes whose polysomal/total RNA level differed between 3T3-tTA and 3T3-tTA-eIF4E cells. A preliminary analysis was conducted using a cutoff ratio of 1.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000242.s002">Table S2</xref>). Further statistical analysis was undertaken (described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials &#x00026; Methods</xref> section) and results are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000242.s003">Table S3</xref>. eIF4E induction resulted in a shift of 294 mRNAs (unique and annotated) to the heavier polysome fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000242.s003">Table S3</xref>). To search for biological themes that are associated with genes whose translation is affected by eIF4E, we looked for overrepresentation of genes belonging to groups classified by the gene ontology consortium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000242-Ashburner1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. We separated the dataset into two parts, mRNAs whose translation is activated and mRNAs whose translation is repressed. We considered those that showed a &#x0003e;2-fold relative enrichment and a &#x0003c;0.05 Fisher's test p-value significant. Several functional categories were enriched among genes that were translationally activated including: protein biosynthesis, members of the small and large ribosomal subunits and mitosis related proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000242.s004">Table S4</xref>).</p><p>The recruitment of 245 of mRNAs to ribosomes was decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000242.s003">Table S3</xref>). The translationally repressed mRNAs were more diverse than the stimulated mRNAs including categories related to differentiation and cell migration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000242.s005">Table S5</xref>). While we expected activation of translation as a function of eIF4E induction, the large number of genes whose translation was repressed after eIF4E induction is surprising. Mechanisms that can modulate translational activity of subsets of transcripts exist e.g. micro RNAs (miRNA), which target transcripts for translational silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000242-Bentwich1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000242-Hwang1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. We hypothesized that miRNA mediated repression, as a possible eIF4E compensatory mechanism, could account for some of the translational repression and searched for overrepresentation of miRNA target sequences among the translationally repressed genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000242-Lewis1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, we found an enrichment of genes with target sites for several miRNAs (14 different miRNAs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000242.s005">Table S5</xref>). A similar search among translationally activated transcripts yielded enrichment of only one miRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000242.s004">Table S4</xref>). This suggests that compensatory miRNA-mediated translational repression might explain a part of the genes that were identified as translationally repressed. Furthermore, untranslated small RNAs/miRNAs have recently been shown to affect the rate-limiting steps of translation initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000242-Engels1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000242-ValenciaSanchez1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Among the different classes of mRNAs that were recruited to ribosomes, the most unexpected was that ribosomal protein mRNAs from both the small and large subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000242.s003">Table S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000242.s004">Table S4</xref>). It is striking, however, that not all ribosomal protein mRNAs were recruited: 26 out of 63 ribosomal protein mRNAs as well as 2 out 13 mitochondrial ribosomal protein mRNAs on the array were recruited to polysomes. Importantly, the sedimentation of growth-related mRNAs was also shifted to heavier polysomes: these include mRNAs encoding anti-apoptotic proteins; growth factors; various cell signaling proteins (kinases, phosphatases); transcription factors and proteins involved in growth and proliferation, mRNA processing, protein degradation and modification, cellular detoxification and transport (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000242.s003">Table S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>eIF4E overexpression stimulates the translation of a subset of mRNAs</title><p>To demonstrate that the eIF4E-induced recruitment of mRNAs to polysomes results in enhanced protein levels, several of the proteins of the newly-identified targets were analyzed by Western blotting. The selection of mRNAs was based on the analysis presented above as well as a preliminary analysis of translational activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000242.s002">Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000242.s003">S3</xref>). Most genes found in the preliminary analysis were also identified in the final analysis. Some genes failed to pass the more stringent threshold in the final analysis, yet exhibited the translational activation that was predicted, showing that false negatives occur in the present final analysis. To further corroborate our results, NIH 3T3 cells and primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that constitutively express hemagglutinin-tagged eIF4E (HA-eIF4E) were examined in parallel to the inducible cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000242-g002">Fig. 2A and B</xref>). HA-eIF4E was detected in the stable cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000242-g002">Fig. 2A, lanes 12 and 14</xref>) and was expressed at &#x0223c;50&#x00025; of the level of endogenous eIF4E, assuming that the anti-eIF4E antibody reacts with the HA-tagged protein with an affinity similar to that of eIF4E. We chose to study the levels of several representative eIF4E targets because of the anti-apoptotic and proliferative activities of eIF4E: three anti-apoptotic proteins, bax-inhibitor 1 (BI-1), defender against cell death 1 (dad1) and survivin; the mitosis-related factor centromere autoantigen A (cenpA); the growth- and angiogenic-factor macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and ribosomal proteins. eIF4E overexpression led to a significant increase (2- to 4-fold) in the amounts of BI-1, dad1, survivin, cenpA and MIF proteins in both the inducible and constitutive cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000242-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Overexpression of eIF4E also caused a significant increase in the amount of a subset of ribosomal proteins from both ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000242-g002">Fig. 2A, compare lanes 7&#x02013;10 to 6</xref>). In accordance with these data, increased levels of the ribosomal proteins were also observed in the NIH 3T3 cells and MEFs that constitutively express HA-eIF4E (lanes 12 and 14). To control for specificity, the expression of other translation factors (eIF4GI and eIF4AI), components of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway (TSC2, raptor and the translational repressor 4E-BP1) and &#x003b2;-actin was also determined. No changes in their protein levels were observed in eIF4E-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000242-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Importantly, the levels of ribosomal proteins whose mRNAs did not shift in the polysome gradients (S6, L7a and L9) also failed to increase in response to eIF4E induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000242-g002">Fig. 2B, lanes 7&#x02013;10, 12 and 14</xref>). These data demonstrate that eIF4E specifically increases the translation of a subset of mRNAs.</p><p>eIF4E induction could in principle either facilitate the recruitment of mRNA to ribosomes or affect protein stability. To distinguish between these two possibilities, RT-PCR was performed on total RNA and polysomal fractions from uninduced and induced 3T3-tTA-eIF4E cells. mRNA levels of two anti-apoptotic proteins (BI-1, survivin), the growth-related factor MIF, a subset of ribosomal proteins (L23, L34, L9, S17) and &#x003b2;-actin were examined. No changes in total mRNA levels were detected after induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000242-g003">Fig. 3A, last two lanes</xref>). Next, the mRNA distribution along the sucrose density gradient was studied. The mRNAs for BI-1, survivin and MIF all shifted to the heavier polysome fractions in the eIF4E-overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000242-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). eIF4E induction also led to increased association of the ribosomal protein mRNAs L23 and L34 with the heavier polysome fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000242-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Two other ribosomal protein mRNAs (L9 and S17) failed to shift to heavier polysomes after eIF4E induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000242-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). We did not observe changes in &#x003b2;-actin mRNA distribution along the gradient between induced and uninduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000242-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). To ensure that the RT-PCR assay is a valid assay for measuring mRNA distribution along the sucrose density gradient, L34 and &#x003b2;-actin mRNA distribution was also determined by Northern blotting.

The protective effect of eIF4E was even more striking in the eIF4E-inducible cell line because it expresses more eIF4E than does the constitutively expressing HA-eIF4E cell line: eIF4E overexpression in the induced 3T3-tTA-eIF4E cells resulted in a substantial decrease in ionomycin-induced apoptosis (24 hr: 33&#x00025; vs. 12&#x00025;; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000242-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>).

An interesting possibility is that only a subset of TOP sequences confers differential eIF4E responsiveness. We therefore examined the effect of eIF4E induction on a TOP-responsive luciferase reporter: DNA segments containing the promoters and 5&#x02032; UTRs of murine ribosomal proteins L32, L32 mut (non-TOP), S16, S16 mut (non-TOP), L30 and &#x003b2;-actin (non-TOP) were subcloned upstream of the luciferase gene. Only the L32 ribosomal protein mRNA is an eIF4E target. 3T3-tTA and 3T3-tTA-eIF4E cells were transfected with the various luciferase reporters and induced for 16 hr. Induction of eIF4E led to increased activity of only the TOP-containing L32 5&#x02032; UTR reporter (2- to 3-fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000242-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>).

Luciferase activity of the reporters was also investigated in the parental cell line 3T3-tTA.

To this end, the S16 and L30 TOPs were exchanged for the L32 TOP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000242-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). Significantly, eIF4E induction led to increased luciferase activity (2- to 3-fold) of both the mutated S16 and L30 5&#x02032; UTRs, which now possessed the L32 TOP sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000242-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>).

Consistent with the earlier results, the exchange of the L32 TOP for that of S16 and L30 (L32 to S16 and L32 to L30) rendered these mRNAs unresponsive to eIF4E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000242-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>).
