We investigated the peripheral mitochondrial localization of nuclear-encoded mRNAs (MLR) in various conditions in which the mRNA binding protein context and the translation efficiency were altered. We identified Puf3p, a Pumilio family RNA-binding protein, as the first trans-acting factor controlling the MLR phenomenon. This allowed the characterization of two classes of genes whose mRNAs are translated to the vicinity of mitochondria. Class I mRNAs (256 genes) have a Puf3p binding motif in their 3'UTR region and many of them have their MLR properties deeply affected by <italic>PUF3</italic> deletion. Conversely, mutations in the Puf3p binding motif alter the mitochondrial localization of <italic>BCS1</italic> mRNA. Class II mRNAs (224 genes) have no Puf3p binding site and their asymmetric localization is not affected by the absence of <italic>PUF3</italic>. In agreement with a co-translational import process, we observed that the presence of puromycin loosens the interactions between most of the MLR-mRNAs and mitochondria. Unexpectedly, cycloheximide, supposed to solidify translational complexes, turned out to destabilize a class of mRNA-mitochondria interactions. Classes I and II mRNAs, which are therefore transported to the mitochondria through different pathways, correlated with different functional modules. Indeed, Class I genes code principally for the assembly factors of respiratory chain complexes and the mitochondrial translation machinery (ribosomes and translation regulators). Class II genes encode proteins of the respiratory chain or proteins involved in metabolic pathways. Thus, MLR, which is intimately linked to translation control, and the activity of mRNA-binding proteins like Puf3p, may provide the conditions for a fine spatiotemporal control of mitochondrial protein import and mitochondrial protein complex assembly. This work therefore provides new openings for the global study of mitochondria biogenesis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The crucial role of mitochondria in eukaryotic cells is reflected, at least in part, by the increasing number of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins implicated in human diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Zeviani1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Mitochondria are complex structures; yeast mitochondria may contain up to 1000 different proteins, accounting for about 17&#x00025; of the proteins synthesized in this simple cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Sickmann1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Prokisch1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Tight spatial and temporal control of the production of these proteins is clearly required to achieve the multiple mitochondrial functions required to respond to the diverse demands of cells. Many studies have addressed this question, using genetic and biochemical approaches to focus on a few mitochondrial complexes. For example, respiratory complex IV (RCC4) has been shown to be assembled via highly sophisticated regulatory loops, with the production of mRNAs and proteins from 33 nuclear and mitochondrial genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Fontanesi1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The assembly of respiratory complexes, reflecting 2.5 billion years of evolution in eukaryotic cells, is the archetype for the biogenesis of complex cellular structures. Studies of the biogenesis of mitochondrial building blocks require the classification of mitochondrial functional modules and the determination of the spatiotemporal rules governing their establishment. Genome-wide gene expression studies and analyses of physical interactions between proteins and mutant phenotypes have led to the identification of 164 functionally distinct modules containing two or more proteins and 93 modules containing only one protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Perocchi1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Transcript localization and translational regulation provide a means for the posttranscriptional spatial and temporal regulation of protein production and, possibly, complex assembly. It is therefore of prime importance to consider the site of translation of the various proteins comprising the mitochondrial functional modules. The dual genetic origin of the proteins present in mitochondria implies the involvement of two major cellular compartments in translation, as no mRNA has ever been shown to be imported into mitochondria. The subunits encoded by mtDNA are synthesized by the transcriptional/translational machinery present in the mitochondrial matrix. The system developed by Fox <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Bonnefoy1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> made it possible to analyze the <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> elements controlling the mitochondrial translation process. Most mitochondrial genes require several translation regulators; these proteins, located at the membrane, facilitate the co-translational insertion of newly synthesized hydrophobic proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Bonnefoy1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Naithani1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Proteins encoded by nuclear genes are translated on cytoplasmic ribosomes and must be transported into and across mitochondrial membranes. Two transport mechanisms have been proposed, both based on a well-characterized machinery of receptors and translocators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Kellems2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Posttranslational processing is consistent with the observation that many proteins generated <italic>in vitro</italic> can be imported into mitochondria. However, since the pioneering work of Butow <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Kellems1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Kellems2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Kellems3">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> strong experimental evidence has been obtained to suggest that cytosolic ribosomes bound to mitochondria may control a co-translational import process. This process has been studied with microarrays to identify all the nuclear-encoded mRNAs co-purified with mitochondria. Surprisingly, about half of the mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins were found to be translated in the vicinity of the mitochondria; the mRNA molecules of this class were named MLRs (mitochondrially-localized mRNAs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Marc1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Further analyses focusing on respiratory and translocator complexes provided support for the hypotheses that MLR proteins, the mitochondrial import of which is probably co-translational, are: i) mainly of prokaryotic origin, ii) linked to the first steps of the complex core construction, iii) imported principally via the TOM-TIM23 pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Garcia1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The close relationship between mRNA localization and translation is not well understood. However, it has often been suggested that one of the major biological functions of mRNA localization is to restrict the production of the encoded protein to the appropriate region, implying that mRNA is not translated during the translocation process. A family of translational regulatory proteins&#x02014;the PUF proteins&#x02014;repress the translation of their target mRNAs by binding to elements located in the 3'UTR in diverse eukaryotic species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Wickens1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. One of the best-known example is the yeast protein Puf6p, which blocks the translation of <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA, localized specifically to the yeast bud, by binding to its 3'UTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Gu1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Another one, Puf3p is a multifunctional mRNA binding protein, located in mitochondria, that interacts with the machinery for mitochondrial motility and inheritance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-GarciaRodriguez1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Puf3p is also known to bind to a consensus motif in the 3'UTR of many mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Jackson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Gerber1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. There is also evidence that the deletion of <italic>PUF3</italic> results in a decrease in mRNA deadenylation and a doubling of the half-life of <italic>COX17</italic> mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Olivas1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> . Thus, Puf3p proteins probably control the transport/translation/stability of a specific set of mRNAs, as a function of growth conditions, in mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><p>We previously carried out genome-wide analyses to identify nuclear-encoded mRNAs which, in wild type standard conditions, are translated to the vicinity of mitochondria. This allowed us to establish an MLR value (Mitochondrial Localization of mRNA) for most of the yeast genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Marc1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. This new study takes advantage of both important improvements in the microarray technology and a new procedure for calculation of MLR rate which takes into account the contamination level of mitochondrial fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Garcia2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and Doc. S1). In addition, we examined the influence of different parameters on the MLR values such as absence or presence of cycloheximide and puromycin and, most importantly, the role of Puf3p protein. This made it possible to group nuclear-encoded proteins which are imported into mitochondria. The MLR values of the most important group of mRNAs (class I) are clearly dependent on the presence of Puf3p. Thus, Puf3p is the first <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor guiding the localization to the vicinity of mitochondria of well-defined functional classes of mRNAs to be identified. Puf3p-dependent mRNAs were mostly found to encode proteins of the mitochondrial translation machinery and involved in translation control and proteins controlling the assembly of respiratory chain complexes; all these proteins play a key role in the early steps of mitochondrial biogenesis. Another group of MLR-mRNAs was found to be Puf3p-independent and to encode structural proteins of respiratory complexes or metabolic pathways. This classification may provide insight into the spatiotemporal program of mitochondrial biogenesis. Also, given the high level of conservation of mitochondrial components across eukaryotes, we expect these results to have a significant impact on our understanding of mitochondrial biogenesis in mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A class of mitochondrial localized mRNA putatively bound to Puf3p</title><p>Puf3p is an mRNA-binding protein that i) is localized to the cytosolic face of the mitochondrial outer membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-GarciaRodriguez1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, ii) can control translation by speeding up deadenylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Olivas1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and iii) can regulate mRNA stability in response to environmental conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Foat1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, using a protein A-tagged Puf3p protein captured with IgG-Sepharose to conduct affinity chromatography, Gerber and colleagues characterized 220 target mRNAs that mainly encode mitochondrially-localized proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Gerber1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore addressed the potential role of Puf3p in the MLR process. We carried out comparative global analyses of the mRNAs co-purified with mitochondrial fractions in the presence or absence of the gene <italic>PUF3</italic>, using DNA microarrays. The protocol for global data analyses is described in the &#x0201c;<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>&#x0201d; section. It takes into account the unavoidable contaminations and provides, for each mRNA species in the cell, a quantitative assessment of the percentage of molecules which are localized to the vicinity of mitochondria. We found that a mitochondrial localization rate of 8&#x00025; was statistically valid as a cut-off to distinguish between MLR and non-MLR-mRNAs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002293.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The complete data are available in our website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biologie.ens.fr/lgmgml/publication/MitoGenesis/">http://www.biologie.ens.fr/lgmgml/publication/MitoGenesis/</ext-link>) but this work will only consider the 794 genes (including 8 mitochondrially-encoded genes, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002293.s008">Table S1</xref>), which were considered as coding for mitochondrial proteins. Among these 794 genes, we were able to distinguish 480 nuclear-encoded MLR-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002293-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002293.s008">Table S1</xref>). These 480 nuclear-encoded MLR-mRNAs can be divided in two classes. Class I (256 mRNAs) includes Puf3p targets identified by Gerber et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Gerber1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> which code for mitochondrial products (142 mRNAs) plus mRNAs which have a 3'UTR Puf3 motif (114 mRNAs). Class II (224 mRNAs) have no 3'UTR Puf3 motif. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002293-g001">Figure 1D</xref> summarizes the origins of the different mRNA classes. These genome-wide approaches based on biochemical purifications had to be confirmed by <italic>in situ</italic> analyses. FISH analyses were thus conducted on four mRNAs: 2 class I mRNAs: <italic>YAH1</italic> (MLR&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;24&#x00025;) and <italic>BCS1</italic> (MLR&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;31&#x00025;), 1 class II mRNA: <italic>ATP4</italic> (MLR&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;32&#x00025;) and, finally, 1 class III mRNA (not asymmetrically localized) <italic>ATP16</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002293.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Since it is an extremely difficult task to estimate distances between mitochondria and a specific mRNA from 2D representations, we recently developed a software (Jourdren <italic>et al.</italic>, in preparation) to quantify these distances on a large number of cells. We represent the data as the percentage of cells having a significant (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) mRNA symmetrical distribution. This cell percentage, which supports our mRNA classification, is in agreement (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002293-g002">Figure 2</xref>) with quantitative RT-PCR analyses of biochemical purifications. Notably, this quantitative FISH approach underscores the difficulty to conclude from 2D representation of FISH analyses.

The fact that Puf3p could be involved in both mRNA stability and mRNA localization prompted us to look for relationship between the two processes. We thus analyzed the stationary level of 11 different mRNAs in the presence or absence of <italic>PUF3</italic>. The increase in mRNA level connected to deletion of <italic>PUF3</italic> seems to be linked to a decrease in mitochondrial localization of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002293.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Interestingly, when <italic>PUF3</italic> is deleted, <italic>COX17</italic> mRNA and <italic>COX 23</italic> mRNA are 5.2 and 3.3 fold more abundant respectively and they are no longer asymmetrically localized (MLR near 0). These two mRNAs have two puf3p binding sites in their 3'UTR and are thus more dependent on Puf3p for both stability and localization. More mRNAs should be examined for their half-life in the wild type and &#x00394;<italic>puf3</italic> contexts to firmly confirm this negative correlation between mRNA localization and abundance and better define the role of <italic>PUF3</italic> in this relationship.</p><p>We also wondered whether this Puf3 effect on mRNA localization depends on direct interactions with the corresponding mRNA.

We nevertheless carried out comparative microarray analyses to assess the impact of cycloheximide on the MLR process. To our surprise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002293-g003">Figure 3</xref>, B and D), cycloheximide treatment increased or decreased the levels of mitochondrion-bound mRNAs. A box-plot representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002293-g003">Figure 3E</xref>) comparing the distributions of the mitochondrial localization rates of MLR-mRNAs in different experimental situations shows that the median value of the distribution, indicated by the line through the center of the box, was significantly decreased by cycloheximide. This global decrease in the asymmetric distribution of mRNAs linked to mitochondria resulted from the cycloheximide-dependent delocalization of 135 mRNAs, while 40 mRNAs were more asymmetrically distributed after cycloheximide treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002293.s008">Table S1</xref>). This second observation is consistent with the common assumption that the translation inhibitor stabilizes ribosome-mRNA associations. By contrast, the delocalization of 135 mRNA molecules in the presence of cycloheximide was unexpected. These 135 mRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002293.s008">Table S1</xref>) correspond principally to genes involved in ribosome assembly and the assembly of respiratory complexes. Remarkably, most of them are targets of Puf3p. This cycloheximide effect is not easily explained. Our recent observation that mitochondrial mRNA localization depends on both cis-acting signals and translation suggests that an active translation process might be required for the asymmetric localization of some mRNAs (Garcia <italic>et al</italic>., in preparation).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>MLR-mRNAs and functional modules</title><p>Puf3p was previously shown to target mRNAs involved in specific functions and protein complexes (e.g. the subunits of the mitochondrial ribosome) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Gerber1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> . Therefore, <italic>PUF3</italic> may have an important role in protein complex assembly, in addition to its role in determining the MLR properties of individual genes. We used the recently published catalog of the mitochondrial functional modules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Perocchi1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> to investigate this aspect. The absence of <italic>PUF3</italic> had two opposite effects on the MLR values of functional modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002293-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In <italic>&#x00394;puf3</italic> strain, modules involved in translation (ribosomal proteins, translation regulators etc.) and in the assembly of respiratory chain complexes (RCCasm1 to 5) had lower average MLR values whereas metabolic modules (TCA, iTCA, branched amino acids etc.) had higher average MLR values. The first of these situations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002293-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, class A modules) is easy to explain because the corresponding modules contain mostly class I genes, which have at least one <italic>PUF3</italic> motif in their 3'UTR. On the other hand, the increase in the MLR value of class B modules may result from an indirect effect due to the absence of <italic>PUF3,</italic> resulting in an imbalance in the mRNA-binding protein populations.

These modules&#x02014;RCCasm1 to 5&#x02014;are composed of 24 proteins required for the construction of respiratory complexes, but they do not form an integral part of these complexes.

For the calculation of the mitochondrial localization rate from microarray data, we used a method adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Garcia2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. A detailed protocol is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002293.s012">Doc S1</xref>. Briefly, we estimated the mitochondrial purification yield from the median log2 values of the mitochondrial fraction/total cell extract ratios of 33 RNAs transcribed from the mitochondrial genome (8 mRNAs, 2 rRNAs and 23 tRNAs). This median value was set at 100&#x00025; and served as the normalization factor used to transform all the log2 values into mitochondrial localization rates. These raw rates were corrected to take into account the biochemical contamination due to the non-mitochondrial fraction. This task is difficult because the mitochondrial fraction is always contaminated by membrane fractions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Diehn1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. However, as negative control, we considered 416 mRNAs not connected with mitochondria (according to YPD, see supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002293.s011">table S4</xref>) and calculated a median contamination value, which was substracted from the raw localization rates as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Garcia2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> to obtain the final corrected and normalized mitochondria localization rates (MLR values) for each mRNA probed on the array. To generate a list of mRNAs which were statistically enriched in the mitochondrial fraction in our experiments, the microarray data were analyzed with the SAM (significance analyses of microarrays) method implemented in the TMEV software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tm4.org">www.tm4.org</ext-link>), with default parameters and a false discovery rate of 5&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002293-Tusher1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. This list was used to set a MLR value cutoff with a reasonable rate of false positive. We observed that a cutoff of 8&#x00025; led to 3&#x00025; of mislocalized mRNA according to the list generated by SAM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002293.s001">Figure S1</xref>), with a total false positive rate of 8&#x00025; (5&#x00025; of SAM FDR plus 3&#x00025; of discrepancies between SAM and the MLR value cutoff). Therefore, among the 489 MLR-mRNAs identified in this study, only 40 may be false positives. RT-PCR analyses were simultaneously performed on mRNA preparation used for microarrays to validate the method (See Supplemental Data, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002293.s009">Table S2</xref>).

To assess relative RNA localizations we developed a software dedicated to distance measurement between two fluorescent probes and allowing analysis of a large cell population. We could thus quantify the distance between mitochondria, revealed with mitochondrial rRNA probes, and a specific mRNA. This analysis is based on 1) 3D segmentation and extraction of object features (coordinates and intensity). 2) Distance measurement of each mRNA particles to the mitochondrial surface. 3) Statistical analysis of data generated: distances are intensity-weighted and for each cell the distribution of mRNA- mitochondria distance is analysed to extract the percentage of particles in the close vicinity of mitochondria (a threshold of 100 nm was chosen to be consistent with microscope resolution). In these conditions if more than 35&#x00025; of the studied mRNA is localized to mitochondrial vicinity there are 95&#x00025; chances that the corresponding cell exhibits mRNA asymmetric localisation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">results</xref> for ATP16 mRNA). Data represent fraction of cell population with localized mRNA with confidence intervals calculated using binomial test. Such analyses could be routinely carried out on more than 300 cells.
