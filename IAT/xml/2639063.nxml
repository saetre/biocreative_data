Despite a steadily increasing number of diabetic patients, there exist few concepts to prevent disease progression and overt renal failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. While predominant changes during early diabetic nephropathy include altered haemodynamics, hyperfiltration and hyperglycaemia, progressive glomerulosclerosis with the presence of Kimmelstiel&#x02013;Wilson lesions and tubulointerstitial fibrosis can be found during later stages of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3 R4">3,4</xref>].</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2; is considered the central cytokine for the development of diabetic nephropathy mediating glomerular hypertrophy, matrix expansion and glomerulosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. After its extracellular activation, TGF-&#x003b2; binds to the specific receptors TGF-&#x003b2;-R1 and -R2 mediating phosphorylation of transcription signalling molecules (p-smads) and subsequent transcription of target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6 R7">6,7</xref>].</p><p>Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is the founding member of a family of matricellular glycoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].

Since we recently established TSP-1 as an endogenous activator of TGF-&#x003b2; in experimental diabetic nephropathy <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], this study aimed to examine the potential relevance of the TSP-1/TGF-&#x003b2; axis for human type-2 diabetic nephropathy.</p><p>In the present study, we evaluated the spatial relationship of glomerular as well tubulointerstitial expression of TSP-1 and subsequent TGF-&#x003b2; signalling in biopsies from patients with type-2 diabetic nephropathy and correlated these biopsy data with each other and with clinical data of disease progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Source of tissue</title><p>Archival tissues from core needle biopsies performed between 1992 and 2003 at the Klinikum Nuremberg (Nuremberg, Germany) were used for this study (<italic>n</italic> = 40).

Glomerular and cortical TSP-1 were quantified using computer-assisted image analysis software (MetaVue, Visitron Systems, Puchheim, Germany) determining the percentage of area positive for TSP-1. Glomerular and tubulointerstitial expression of TGF-&#x003b2;1/2 were evaluated using a semiquantitative scoring system from 0 to 4, where 0 means &#x0003c;5%, 1 means 6&#x02013;25%, 2 means 26&#x02013;50%, 3 means 51&#x02013;75% and 4 means 76&#x02013;100% positively stained area per glomerular cross section or tubulointerstitial field of vision, respectively. Assessment of glomerulosclerosis was done via PAS stainings. A semiquantitative scoring system from 0 to 4 was applied where 0 means no sclerosis and 1 means 0&#x02013;25%, 2 means 26&#x02013;50%, 3 means 51&#x02013;75% and 4 means 76&#x02013;100% of the glomerular tuft area is sclerotic.

Glomerular (2.62 &#x000b1; 2.65% positive area) as well as cortical (4.5 &#x000b1; 4.2% positive area; mainly consisting of tubulointerstitial) TSP-1 was increased in diabetic versus control kidneys (both <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C, D). Differentiation of diabetic nephropathy in three stages of severity demonstrates that in milder diabetic lesions, glomerular and tubulointerstitial, an increase of TSP-1 can be seen (stage 1: 1.98 &#x000b1; 1.98, stage 2: 1.47 &#x000b1; 1.94% positive area, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E&#x02013;G), but did not reach statistical significance compared to controls due to the low number of biopsies for these groups (stage 1: <italic>n</italic> = 5, stage 2: <italic>n</italic> = 5) and a significant variation of diabetic disease and TSP-1 expression in individual glomeruli within the same biopsy.

In parallel, serum creatinine values (300.6 &#x000b1; 114.9 &#x003bc;mol/l) indicated advanced disease in most patients. A summary of diabetes-associated complications is depicted in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. Sixty percent of all patients presented with a prior diagnosis of arterial hypertension and received antihypertensive medication before the renal biopsy. Forty-three percent of patients had been put on ACE inhibitor treatment prior to the renal biopsy that had no influence on expression levels of TSP-1 or p-smad2/3 compared to patients without ACE inhibitors [TSP1 glomerular (%): 1.9 &#x000b1; 1.1 versus 2.3 &#x000b1; 1.2, n.s.; TSP-1 cortical (%): 3.1 &#x000b1; 3.9 versus 3.4 &#x000b1; 3.2, n.s.; p-smad2/3 glomerular: 13.5 &#x000b1; 8.8 versus 18.3 &#x000b1; 10.4 (<italic>n</italic>), n.s.; p-smad2/3 cortical: 118.6 &#x000b1; 55.9 versus 128.2 &#x000b1; 53.9 (<italic>n</italic>), n.s.]. Differentiation of baseline data from all three subgroups (grade 1&#x02013;3) compared to controls demonstrates that functional parameters such as proteinuria and serum creatinine are linked to severity of histological lesions (glomerulosclerosis and fibrosis;

Interestingly, beyond the correlation of TSP-1 with the disease stage, the only correlation we detected was present between glomerular p-smad2/3 and the degree of proteinuria (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C). All other parameters assessed (age, glomerulosclerosis, fibrosis, duration of diabetes, albuminuria, presence of retinopathy, presence of diabetic neuropathy, presence duration of hypertension, HbA1c level, serum creatinine and urea) did not show a direct relationship to TSP-1 or p-smad2/3.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Type-2 diabetes is one of the most challenging chronic disorders in the western world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. After years of diabetes, diabetic nephropathy is very common and associated with excess morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Despite some improving grasp regarding the underlying pathophysiology, treatment options after the onset of diabetic nephropathy and chronic kidney disease are still very limited. Whereas elevated blood glucose initially causes haemodynamic alterations, hyperfiltration and activation of glomerular cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>], as well as excessive matrix deposition, are hallmarks of chronic diabetic nephropathy leading to glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis of the kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2; is the best-known profibrotic cytokine, clearly being linked to the development of diabetic nephropathy by various experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. To bind to its receptors, latent TGF-&#x003b2; has to be extracellularly activated. Our group recently demonstrated TSP-1 as an important endogenous activator of latent TGF-&#x003b2; in <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> models of glomerulonephritis as well as diabetic nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13 R14 R15">13&#x02013;15</xref>]. Therefore, interference with the TGF-&#x003b2; activation process is an interesting therapeutical option to prevent its profibrotic action in the kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>].</p><p>In the present biopsy study, we wanted to investigate the relevance of the TSP-1/TGF-&#x003b2; axis in human biopsies with type-2 diabetic nephropathy. Dependent on the severity of glomerular and tubulointerstitial lesions, the local nephropathologist divided biopsies into three stages (1&#x02013;3) of diabetic nephropathy. Glomerular TSP-1 was increased in biopsies with diabetic nephropathy, which was most prominent in advanced disease in areas of glomerulosclerosis and fibrosis (stage 3). In parallel to this finding, we also detected increased expression of TGF-&#x003b2; and of the number of cells positive for the phosphorylated form of the TGF-&#x003b2; signalling complex smad2/3 in glomeruli of patients with diabetic nephropathy compared to controls. TSP-1 and p-smad2/3 were co-localized by fluorescence double staining suggesting the experimentally shown functional relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Nevertheless, the degree of glomerular TSP-1 did not directly correlate with the extent of glomerular p-smad2/3 positivity, but did significantly correlate with tubulointerstitial smad2/3 positivity. Although pure speculation, this interesting link of glomerular TSP-1 with tubulointerstitial TGF-&#x003b2; activation may indicate a paracrine action of TSP-1 between different compartments of the kidney. Expression analysis of glomerular TSP-1 as well as TGF-&#x003b2; and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) has been performed in a recent study by Wahab and colleagues demonstrating in 19 biopsies that glomerular TSP-1, TGF-&#x003b2; and CTGF are increased early on during human diabetic nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Our findings in 40 renal biopsies are consistent with their data, showing increased glomerular TSP-1 already in incipient diabetic lesions of our patients and a more pronounced increase in more severe diabetic disease. While this excellent study by Wahab and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] focused completely on glomerular changes, our study also accounts for changes of the tubulointerstitium.</p><p>Hereby, we could demonstrate that cortical (reflecting tubulointerstitial) TSP-1 was increased during diabetic nephropathy and frequently co-localized with p-smad2/3 positivity indicating TGF-&#x003b2; signalling activity. In addition, cortical TSP-1 correlated with the number of tubulointerstitial p-smad2/3 positive cells supporting the concept of a causal relationship between TSP-1 and TGF-&#x003b2; activity in human diabetic nephropathy. The importance of tubulointerstitial changes for the overall time course and progression of human renal disease was established many years ago by Bohle and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], while more recent studies confirmed this also for the time course of diabetic nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19 R20">19,20</xref>]. Our group recently demonstrated in three different experimental nephritis models with interstitial fibrosis that TSP-1 co-localized with active TGF-&#x003b2; within the tubulointerstitium and was an excellent predictor for the later resulting interstitial fibrosis as detected in individual animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Therefore, the results of this study suggest a similar role for TSP-1 in human diabetic nephropathy.</p><p>In addition, correlating a large number of clinical parameters with the degree of glomerular p-smad2/3 positivity or TSP-1, only the extent of glomerular p-smad2/3 positivity positively correlated with the degree of proteinuria but no other clinical parameter as assessed in these diabetic patients. This interesting finding is consistent with the reported direct relationship between urinary excretion of TGF-&#x003b2; and proteinuria as well as TGF-&#x003b2; and glycaemic control, at least early on in disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22 R23 R24">22&#x02013;24</xref>]. While we detected a spatial and correlative relation between TSP-1 and the TGF-&#x003b2; activation, we did not find a correlation of either factors with fibrosis/sclerosis in our biopsies from patients with diabetic nephropathy. While this seems to be a surprising result, it has to be considered that detection of the profibrotic TGF-&#x003b2; activity might indicate/reflect active <italic>de novo</italic> production of matrix molecules in a dynamic process but not necessarily the general status of fibrosis, especially when a given tissue is already quite fibrotic/sclerotic. In our study, frequent acellular Kimmelstiel&#x02013;Wilson lesions, the degree of fibrosis/sclerosis within these biopsies as well as the clinical data indicate mostly severe disease, where the active component of matrix production may actually already be slowed down.</p><p>In summary, the present study demonstrates the spatial and suggests a functional activity of the TSP-1/TGF-&#x003b2; axis in patients with type-2 diabetic nephropathy. Especially in the tubulointerstitium of diabetic nephropathy, TSP-1 is closely linked to TGF-&#x003b2; activity as indicated by p-smad2/3 positivity. The positive correlation of glomerular p-smad2/3 positivity with proteinuria further supports the importance of the TSP-1/TGF-&#x003b2; system as a relevant mechanism for progression of human type-2 diabetic nephropathy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The skilled technical help of S.
