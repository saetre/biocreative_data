Interleukin (IL)-15 and its high affinity IL-15 receptor, IL-15R&#x003b1;, support NK cell homeostasis in resting animals via a novel trans presentation mechanism. To better understand how IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; support NK cell activation during immune responses, we have used sensitive assays for detecting native IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; proteins and developed an assay for detecting complexes of these proteins. We find that IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; are preassembled in complexes within the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi of stimulated dendritic cells (DCs) before being released from cells. IL-15R&#x003b1; is required for IL-15 production by DCs, and IL-15 that emerges onto the cell surface of matured DCs does not bind to neighboring cells expressing IL-15R&#x003b1;. We also find that soluble IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes are induced during inflammation, but membrane-bound IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes, rather than soluble complexes, support NK cell activation in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we provide in vivo evidence that expression of IL-15R&#x003b1; specifically on DCs is critical for trans presenting IL-15 and activating NK cells. These studies define an unprecedented cytokine&#x02013;receptor biosynthetic pathway in which IL-15R&#x003b1; serves as a chaperone for IL-15, after which membrane-bound IL-15R&#x003b1;&#x02013;IL-15 complexes activate NK cells via direct cell&#x02013;cell contact.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: BMDC, bone marrow&#x02013;derived DC; DT, diphtheria toxin; HSC, hematopoietic stem cell; poly I:C, poly inosinic&#x02013;polycytidylic acid; TLR, Toll-like receptor.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>NK cells are innate immune effector cells that secrete cytokines and acquire cytolytic function within hours of viral infections. The activation of NK cells is regulated by the balance of inhibitory and activating signals and is dependent on DCs, cytokines, and co-stimulatory molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). NK cell responses to microbes are triggered by Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, which stimulate secretion of type I IFNs that in turn support IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>).</p><p>IL-15 and its proprietary receptor IL-15R&#x003b1; are both essential for supporting NK cell homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). An unusual aspect of IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; binding is the extraordinarily high affinity with which these proteins interact (&#x0223c;5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;11</sup> M) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Another notable observation is that the phenotypes of IL-15 (IL-15<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) and IL-15R&#x003b1; (IL-15R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) &#x02013;deficient mice are indistinguishable, suggesting that physiologically relevant IL-15 signals require IL-15R&#x003b1; and that these molecules function in close cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). On the other hand, some studies have reported secretion of soluble IL-15, and the ability of recombinant IL-15 to stimulate cells bearing IL-2/15R&#x003b2; and &#x003b3;c but lacking IL-15R&#x003b1; raises questions about whether and when IL-15 may perform IL-15R&#x003b1;&#x02013;independent functions. Additional questions surrounding IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; biology relate to the observations that IL-15 cDNAs are difficult to express heterologously unless leader sequences, ATG sites, and 3&#x02032; mRNA sequences are altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). These findings suggest that complex intracellular processing regulates the bioavailability of IL-15.</p><p>Prior studies from our laboratory showed that IL-15R&#x003b1; functions in an unexpected non&#x02013;cell-autonomous fashion in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). IL-15R&#x003b1; expression on responding cells does not enhance the responsiveness of IL-15&#x02013;dependent cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Soluble IL-15 can bind to IL-15R&#x003b1; on accessory cells that &#x0201c;trans present&#x0201d; IL-15 to responding cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Trans presentation in vivo requires expression of IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; by hematopoietic accessory cells and expression of IL-2/15R&#x003b2; by IL-15&#x02013;responsive NK cells and memory CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Trans presentation appears to be the dominant mechanism by which IL-15 signals are delivered in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>).</p><p>Why IL-15 signals should be delivered via this somewhat complicated trans presentation mechanism is unclear. Some clues have been provided by recent studies revealing that coordinate expression of IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; by the same accessory cells such as DCs is required for supporting both NK and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> memory T cell homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). These results are not consistent with a mechanism in which IL-15 is secreted by DCs and subsequently bound to IL-15R&#x003b1; on the surface of other DCs to be trans presented to IL-15&#x02013;responsive cells. Instead, they suggest a more complicated model of trans presentation.</p><p>The studies above focused on the functions of IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; during noninflamed, homeostatic conditions. TLRs induce the production of both IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; by myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Hence, to understand how endogenous IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; proteins function during inflammatory responses, we have developed sensitive assays for detecting endogenous IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; proteins. We have used these assays to further examine how these proteins are induced in DCs and how they support NK cell activation.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>IL-15, IL-15R&#x003b1;, and complexes of IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; proteins are induced in DCs after TLR stimulation</title><p>Analyses of the biology of IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; have been challenging because the potent physiological effects of these proteins occur at relatively low levels of expression. To understand how IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; function under physiological circumstances, we first optimized ELISAs for these proteins using recombinant IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; proteins and found that we were able to detect picomolar levels of these proteins (unpublished data). Because IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; bind to each other with high affinity and may function as a complex in physiological settings, we investigated whether the presence of either protein affects the detection of the other. Detection of IL-15R&#x003b1; protein was not affected by the presence of IL-15 (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071913/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071913/DC1</ext-link>). In contrast, the detection of IL-15 protein was progressively diminished by the presence of increasing amounts of IL-15R&#x003b1; protein (Fig. S1 B). These results suggest that at least one of the anti&#x02013;IL-15 antibodies used in our capture ELISA binds to an epitope that is masked when IL-15 binds to IL-15R&#x003b1;. Several commercially available antibodies to IL-15 shared this capacity for interference with IL-15R&#x003b1; binding (unpublished data).</p><p>mRNA transcripts for IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; are induced by TLR ligands in DCs, but the translation of these proteins may not follow mRNA levels. We thus measured the levels of IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; proteins before and after stimulation with LPS or poly inosinic&#x02013;polycytidylic acid (poly I:C). Negligible levels of IL-15R&#x003b1; were detected in cell lysates from nonstimulated bone marrow&#x02013;derived DCs (BMDCs), and IL-15R&#x003b1; protein levels were similarly induced in lysates from WT or <italic>IL-15<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cell BMDCs (but not <italic>IL-15R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells) between 2 and 12 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Hence, IL-15R&#x003b1; is induced in DCs by TLR stimulation, and IL-15 does not influence the production of IL-15R&#x003b1;.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Detection of IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; proteins and IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complex expression in lysates of TLR-stimulated DCs.</bold> ELISA measurement of IL-15R&#x003b1; (A) and IL-15 (B) proteins and IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complex (D) expression in lysates of poly I:C&#x02013;stimulated BMDCs at the indicated time points.

All data are representative of at least three separate experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2051213f01"></graphic></fig><p>Somewhat surprisingly, IL-15 protein was only transiently detected at modest levels within <italic>IL-15R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> BMDCs and not at all in WT cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). This occurred despite the fact that IL-15 mRNA levels, detected by real-time PCR, were markedly induced by poly I:C in both <italic>IL-15R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and WT BMDCs (unpublished data). To understand why IL-15 protein was not detected in WT cells, we hypothesized that IL-15 in WT cells might be complexed with IL-15R&#x003b1; protein. As noted above, epitopes of IL-15 detected by several anti&#x02013;IL-15 antibodies are blocked by high affinity interactions between IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1;. To investigate whether IL-15 is complexed with IL-15R&#x003b1; in poly I:C&#x02013;stimulated BMDCs, we established conditions to dissociate these proteins without denaturing them before ELISA analyses. We boiled lysates from poly I:C&#x02013;stimulated BMDCs in the presence of 0.01% SDS before analyzing IL-15 protein levels by ELISA. These experiments showed that IL-15 protein was indeed induced in WT cells at nanomolar levels in parallel with the induction of IL-15R&#x003b1; (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Similar results were obtained with LPS stimulation of DCs (unpublished data). Thus, IL-15 is induced by TLR stimulation and appears to be predominantly bound to another protein (e.g., IL-15R&#x003b1;) inside DCs.</p><p>To further examine the possibility that endogenous IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; proteins exist in complexes in normal BMDCs, we developed a &#x0201c;complex&#x0201d; ELISA in which an anti&#x02013;IL-15 antibody that detects IL-15 in the presence of IL-15R&#x003b1; was used as a &#x0201c;capture&#x0201d; antibody and an anti&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; antibody was used as a &#x0201c;detection&#x0201d; reagent (Fig. S1 C). We used this complex ELISA to measure the levels of IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes in cell lysates from BMDCs. IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes were induced by poly I:C in WT BMDCs but not in <italic>IL-15<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> BMDCs or <italic>IL-15R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> BMDCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). The kinetics of IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complex induction was very similar to the induction of IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; proteins. Collectively, these studies suggest that IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; proteins are induced in BMDCs by TLR ligands and exist largely in IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes are not detected unless IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; are coordinately expressed by the same DCs</title><p>Exposure of DCs to TLR ligands is thought to stimulate IL-15 secretion from DCs, after which IL-15 may be subsequently bound to IL-15R&#x003b1; on the cell surface of DCs. The identification of IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes in the lysates of stimulated DCs could thus reflect this sequence of events. Alternatively, our prior studies suggest that IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; must be coordinately expressed on the same hematopoietic cells to support IL-15&#x02013;dependent NK cells and memory CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells under homeostatic (non-inflamed) conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Thus, it is possible that IL-15R&#x003b1; and IL-15 must be coordinately expressed during TLR-induced inflammatory conditions as well. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated a 1:1 mixture of <italic>IL-15<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>IL-15R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> BMDCs as well as uniform cultures of WT, <italic>IL-15<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, and <italic>IL-15R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> BMDCs with poly I:C and measured the production of IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes in BMDC lysates by ELISA. As these cells were plated at concentrations at which <italic>IL-15<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>IL-15R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> DCs were in direct contact, the production of freely soluble IL-15 protein from <italic>IL-15R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> DCs should allow binding of IL-15 to IL-15R&#x003b1; on the surface of neighboring <italic>IL-15<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> DCs and potential recycling of these complexes. These experiments revealed that IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes are detected only in cultures of poly I:C&#x02013;stimulated WT BMDCs and not in 1:1 mixtures of <italic>IL-15<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>IL-15R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> BMDCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>).

One mechanism by which IL-15R&#x003b1; could facilitate the production of IL-15 would be if IL-15R&#x003b1; directly bound newly synthesized IL-15 before being secreted (e.g., within the ER or Golgi) and stabilized IL-15 in a complex. To test this possibility, we pretreated BMDCs with brefeldin A (which blocks protein trafficking through the Golgi) before stimulation with LPS, and then tested lysates of these cells for the presence of IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes. Significant levels of IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes were induced in WT cells even in the presence of brefeldin A (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). No IL-15R&#x003b1; protein was observed on the surface of these cells by flow cytometry, and no soluble IL-15R&#x003b1; (sIL-15R&#x003b1;) was detected in supernatants, confirming that brefeldin A blocked the emergence of IL-15R&#x003b1; from the Golgi complex (Fig. S2, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071913/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071913/DC1</ext-link>). Thus, IL-15R&#x003b1; appears to bind IL-15 during biogenesis. Brefeldin A may also block the trafficking of proteins from recycling and/or late endosomes to the plasma membrane. To eliminate the possibility that brefeldin A exclusively unveiled recycling complexes in these experiments, we treated DCs with LPS plus cycloheximide, which should block the formation of nascent IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes but should not block recycling complexes, and then asked whether IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes were induced. These experiments revealed that cycloheximide prevented the formation of IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes, suggesting that the complexes we detect in LPS plus brefeldin A&#x02013;treated DCs are newly synthesized (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>).</p><p>Like many transmembrane and secreted proteins, IL-15 undergoes N-linked glycosylation in the ER, a form that is sensitive to EndoH digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). N-linked sugars are removed from IL-15 in the Golgi during further processing so that mature forms of IL-15 are resistant to EndoH. To determine whether IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes may be assembled when IL-15 bears EndoH-sensitive N-linked sugars during biogenesis, we asked whether IL-15 that co-precipitated with IL-15R&#x003b1; from LPS-stimulated DCs is EndoH sensitive. LPS-stimulated DCs were lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer, immunoprecipitated with anti&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; antibodies, and treated with either EndoH or buffer alone before immunoblotting analysis for IL-15 expression. These experiments revealed that EndoH treatment of anti&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1;&#x02013;immunoprecipitated lysates produces a novel IL-15&#x02013;specific band at &#x0223c;12.7 kD, corresponding to un-glycosylated IL-15 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Therefore, native IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes contain EndoH-sensitive IL-15, indicating that these complexes form in the ER or early Golgi before the completion of Golgi processing.</p></sec><sec><title>TLR-stimulated DCs release soluble IL-15&#x02013;sIL-15R&#x003b1; protein complexes</title><p>To follow the fate of IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes after Golgi processing, we studied the expression of these proteins on the cell surface of stimulated DCs. Emergence of IL-15R&#x003b1; protein onto the surface of DCs occurs normally in the absence of IL-15, but emergence of IL-15 requires IL-15R&#x003b1; (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071913/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071913/DC1</ext-link>).

Accordingly, we studied the levels of IL-15 and sIL-15R&#x003b1; proteins in supernatants from poly I:C&#x02013;stimulated BMDCs. These experiments revealed that minimal amounts of IL-15 were induced by poly I:C stimulation in the supernatants of WT BMDCs after 24 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, gray columns) and 48 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, black columns) h, but not in supernatants from <italic>IL-15<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>IL-15R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells. Given the interference of IL-15R&#x003b1; with ELISA-mediated detection of IL-15 in cell lysates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), we suspected that IL-15 might be present in IL-15&#x02013;sIL-15R&#x003b1; protein complexes in these supernatants. We thus boiled these supernatants in the presence of 0.01% SDS before ELISA and found that IL-15 was indeed induced and progressively accumulated in the supernatants from WT but not <italic>IL-15<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Thus, IL-15 is secreted from WT DCs predominantly in the form of IL-15&#x02013;sIL-15R&#x003b1; complexes. Importantly, no IL-15 was observed in the supernatants from IL-15R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> DCs, even after boiling of the supernatants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>).

Thus, the differences in IL-15, IL-15R&#x003b1;, and IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; protein levels are likely due to differences in protein production rather than differences in recycling or secretion from the cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Coordinate expression of IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; by DCs is required for supporting NK cell activation in vitro</title><p>Our prior studies indicated that IL-15R&#x003b1; expression on DCs is required for NK cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>).

However, these studies leave open the possibility that IL-15 and DCs might independently support NK cell activation in vivo. For example, IL-15 might be produced by macrophages to stimulate DCs to activate NK cells in vivo. To more directly investigate whether IL-15R&#x003b1; expression by DCs mediates NK cell activation in vivo, we reconstituted irradiated <italic>IL-15<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> IL-15R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> double-mutant mice with a 1:1 mixture of HSCs from CD11c&#x02013;diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor (CD11c-DTR) transgenic mice and HSCs from either WT or <italic>IL-15R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. After hematopoietic reconstitution, DT was injected into the chimera to transiently eliminate DCs. 24 h later, mice were injected with poly I:C.

These experiments revealed that DT eliminated approximately half of the CD11cHi DCs in chimera reconstituted with a 1:1 mixture of CD11c-DTR and other HSCs (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 B</xref>).

Plasma membrane-bound IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes are highly stable complexes that do not release appreciable amounts of free IL-15 to neighboring IL-15R&#x003b1;&#x02013;bearing cells. These membrane-bound complexes trans present IL-15 to responsive cells during cell&#x02013;cell contact, mediating the critical stimulatory signal to NK cells. Soluble IL-15&#x02013;sIL-15R&#x003b1; complexes are released from the cell surface, but these complexes fail to provide agonistic signals. We have coupled these cell biological studies with in vivo studies that have confirmed the physiological validity of our experiments with cultured DCs. Finally, we have demonstrated that IL-15R&#x003b1; expression specifically on DCs plays an essential role in supporting NK cell activation in mice. As membrane-bound IL-15R&#x003b1;&#x02013;IL-15 complexes on DCs appear to play a dominant role in supporting NK cell activation in vivo, these studies highlight the notion that cytokine signals may be delivered by specific cell types in cell contact&#x02013;dependent fashion.</p><sec><title>IL-15R&#x003b1;, a chaperone for IL-15</title><p>We have found that EndoH-sensitive forms of IL-15 are bound to IL-15R&#x003b1; in LPS-stimulated DCs, and that IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes can be found in brefeldin A&#x02013;treated but not cycloheximide-treated cells. Considered together with our discovery that DCs must express IL-15R&#x003b1; to secrete IL-15, it is likely that IL-15R&#x003b1; binds to IL-15 and stabilizes this protein in the ER and/or Golgi apparatus. Such complexes probably prevent free IL-15 from undergoing ER-associated protein degradation, a well-established process by which &#x0201c;misfolded&#x0201d; proteins in the ER are proteolyzed in ubiquitin- and proteosome-dependent processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Recycling and trans presentation of these membrane-bound complexes may then stimulate responding cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Hence, our results suggest that IL-15R&#x003b1; functions both as an intracellular chaperone for IL-15 as well as an extracellular scaffold that presents IL-15 to responsive cells.</p><p>We have shown that IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes that emerge onto the surface of DCs fail to release soluble IL-15 to neighboring IL-15R&#x003b1;&#x02013;expressing DCs. These surprising observations suggest that IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes on DC surfaces are highly stable, a finding consistent with the high affinity of IL-15R&#x003b1; for IL-15 (&#x0223c;5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;11</sup> M) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Thus, although heterologous IL-15 can be added to IL-15R&#x003b1;&#x02013;expressing cells, form cell surface complexes, and stimulate IL-15&#x02013;dependent responses, the physiological production and trans presentation of IL-15 by DCs appears to predominantly involve IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes that form intracellularly during biosynthesis and remain intact for prolonged periods (e.g., 24 h) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Preassembly of IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; protein complexes in DCs explains a requirement for coordinate expression of IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; to support NK cell activation</title><p>Our finding that IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes are preassembled within DCs provides an explanation for why coordinate expression of these molecules is required for NK cell activation in vitro and in vivo. Coordinate expression of IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; by DCs is required for the formation of IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes and the activation of NK cells in vitro and in vivo after TLR stimulation. This result parallels prior findings that coordinate expression of these molecules is necessary to perform IL-15&#x02013;dependent homeostatic functions in resting mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Hence, the cell biology of IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; interactions during inflammatory conditions resembles the homeostatic condition.</p><p>In addition to identifying intracellular complexes of IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1;, we have identified soluble extracellular IL-15&#x02013;sIL-15R&#x003b1; complexes that are released from DCs after TLR stimulation. A prior study described the presence of soluble IL-15R&#x003b1; in the serum of resting mice, and proposed that IL-15R&#x003b1; could be proteolytically cleaved from the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Our current experiments extend and contrast with the prior results in two respects. First, we find that the production and release of soluble sIL-15R&#x003b1; is induced by TLR stimulation, rather than being constitutively present at high levels (e.g., 40 ng/ml) in resting C57BL/6J strain mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Second, we find that the majority of soluble IL-15R&#x003b1; is complexed with IL-15. Therefore, although free IL-15 is not released from DCs, soluble IL-15&#x02013;sIL-15R&#x003b1; complexes, which may represent IL-15 bound to a proteolytic product of IL-15R&#x003b1;, are released into solution.</p><p>Our results with both cultured DC supernatants and mouse sera indicate that membrane-bound IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes on DCs and not soluble IL-15&#x02013;sIL-15R&#x003b1; complexes support NK cell production of IFN-&#x003b3; and granzyme B. Although soluble IL-15&#x02013;sIL-15R&#x003b1; complexes might perform other functions, this important finding suggests that trans presentation of IL-15 requires cell&#x02013;cell contact between IL-15&#x02013;presenting and IL-15&#x02013;responsive cells. The cell contact&#x02013;dependent nature of IL-15 trans presentation also implies that IL-15 signals may be delivered in the context of other signals between the two cells, akin to antigen presentation between DCs and T cells. Finally, our findings imply that IL-15 signals are delivered via direct cell&#x02013;cell contact rather than via soluble proteins. Hence, cytokine-mediated survival, growth, and activation signals may be delivered by specific cell types and in specific locations.</p><p>Although the physiological functions of soluble IL-15&#x02013;sIL-15R&#x003b1; complexes are unclear, it is important to note that these complexes are neither agonistic nor antagonistic in our DC&#x02013;NK cell co-culture assays (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>). In this regard, nonagonsitic soluble IL-15&#x02013;sIL-15R&#x003b1; complexes contrast with agonistic soluble IL-6&#x02013;IL-6R complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). This observation provides important clues about their function. If soluble complexes bound to IL-2/15R&#x003b2;/&#x003b3;c receptors as well as membrane-bound complexes, one might expect them to display either agonist or antagonist activities (via competitive inhibition). Thus, soluble IL-15&#x02013;sIL-15R&#x003b1; complexes may not bind well to cell surface IL-2/15R&#x003b2; receptors on cell surfaces under physiological circumstances. This failure of IL-15&#x02013;sIL-15R&#x003b1; complexes to bind IL-2/15R&#x003b2; receptors could be due to differences between the structures of the soluble IL-15&#x02013;sIL-15R&#x003b1; complex and the membrane-bound IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complex. Alternatively, membrane-bound IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes may possess a competitive advantage over soluble IL-15&#x02013;sIL-15R&#x003b1; complexes due to the increased local concentration or valency of membrane-bound complexes during cell&#x02013;cell contact.</p><p>The failure of endogenous soluble IL-15&#x02013;sIL-15R&#x003b1; complexes to activate NK cells can also be contrasted with recent studies indicating that certain cytokine-specific antibodies can form complexes with their cognate cytokines, stabilize cytokines, and amplify the immunological effects of these cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). There are multiple differences between antibody&#x02013;cytokine complexes and receptor&#x02013;cytokine complexes. For example, different anti&#x02013;IL-15 antibodies or forms of IL-15R&#x003b1; may interfere with IL-15 binding to IL-2/15R&#x003b2; and &#x003b3;c receptors. In addition, antibodies, but not soluble cytokine receptors, can also bind to Fc receptors on multiple cells. Recent structural studies of IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; proteins have revealed important insights into how these proteins interact and should facilitate future investigations into how such receptor&#x02013;cytokine complexes differ from antibody&#x02013;cytokine complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Combining these biochemical insights with the divergent biological properties of these complexes should facilitate future attempts to engineer these proteins for therapeutic benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>DCs require IL-15R&#x003b1; to trans present IL-15 to NK cells during NK cell activation</title><p>We have used mixed radiation chimera to selectively unveil the role of IL-15R&#x003b1; expression by DCs during NK cell activation in vivo. Our findings extend our prior work that IL-15R&#x003b1; on BMDCs is critical for activating NK cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Our current findings are also consistent with a recent study using both IL-15<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and CD11c-DTR mice to show that both IL-15 and DCs are required for NK cell activation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). By using mixed radiation chimera generated from both <italic>IL-15R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and CD11c-DTR HSCs, we have extended the prior work to show that IL-15R&#x003b1; expression specifically on DCs mediates NK cell activation in vivo. Further elucidation of these interactions should be facilitated by the generation of mice bearing lineage-specific deletions of IL-15 or IL-15R&#x003b1;. Considered together with our data showing that DCs trans present IL-15 via cell&#x02013;cell contact, and with recent work showing the localization of NK cells to lymphoid structures, a model of NK cell activation emerges in which NK cells are recruited to DCs and receive critical IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1;&#x02013;dependent activation signals during DC&#x02013;NK cell contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). In this regard, DC activation of NK cells broadly resembles DC activation of naive T cells, during which an immunological synapse constitutes a sophisticated cell contact&#x02013;dependent activation mechanism. Indeed, direct evidence for a DC&#x02013;NK cell synapse directing IL-15 signaling to NK cells has recently been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>).</p><p>Recent structural studies have revived the notion that IL-2R&#x003b1; may trans present IL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). Although IL-2 signals clearly perform distinct biological functions from IL-15 signals in vivo, and although IL-2R&#x003b1; has not shown the capacity to bind and trans present IL-2 in vivo, directed cytokine presentation may nevertheless be a feature of IL-15, IL-2, and perhaps other cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). This mode of cell contact&#x02013;dependent delivery of cytokine signals would greatly restrict the cells that receive cytokine signals. Finally, given the rapidity with which memory CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are reactivated in vivo, the requirement for DCs to reactivate memory CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, the selective expression of IL-2/15R&#x003b2; receptors by these cells, and the IL-15 dependence of these cells, it is possible that memory CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell reactivation involves a similar IL-15&#x02013;dependent activation event mediated by DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we have shown that IL-15 and IL-15R&#x003b1; are preformed as complexes in DCs in response to TLR stimulation. IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes progress to the DC surface where they deliver critical activating signals to NK cells during cell&#x02013;cell contact. IL-15&#x02013;IL-15R&#x003b1; complexes that are cleaved from the surface of DCs may be byproducts of a termination mechanism for this potent stimulus. This novel series of cell biological events refines our understanding of IL-15R&#x003b1;&#x02013;mediated trans presentation, and highlights how the immune system delivers cytokine signals in a highly regulated and cell type&#x02013; and geographically restricted fashion.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice, radiation chimera, adoptive transfers, and in vivo DC ablation.</title><p><italic>IL-15R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> (R&#x003b1;KO) mice were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>).
