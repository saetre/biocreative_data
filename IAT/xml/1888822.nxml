While yeast CAF1 displays deadenylase activity, this activity is not required for its deadenylation function <italic>in vivo</italic>, and CCR4 is the primary deadenylase in the complex. In order to identify CAF1-specific functional regions required for deadenylation <italic>in vivo</italic>, we targeted for mutagenesis six regions of CAF1 that are specifically conserved among CAF1 orthologs. Defects in residues 213&#x02013;215, found to be a site required for binding CCR4, reduced the rate of deadenylation to a lesser extent and resulted in <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotypes that were less severe than did defects in other regions of CAF1 that displayed greater contact to CCR4.

Deadenylation, as compared to decapping and 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; nuclease digestion, has been shown to be most important in the control of mRNA degradation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The CCR4-NOT complex in responsible for the majority of the poly(A) shortening process in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7">5&#x02013;7</xref>), and its 1.0 MDa core complex is comprised of 10 components: CCR4, CAF1 (also known as POP2), five NOT proteins (NOT1&#x02013;NOT5), CAF40, CAF130 and BTT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11">8&#x02013;11</xref>). Of these proteins, CCR4 and CAF1 appear to be the most important players in the mRNA deadenylation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>The CCR4 protein as a member of ExoIII family of nucleases/phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) is the catalytic subunit responsible for degradation of the mRNA poly(A) tail, and point mutations in the predicted active site of CCR4 cause deadenylation defects like that of a <italic>ccr4</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Similarly, a <italic>ccr4</italic> mutant in <italic>Drosophila</italic> also displayed an <italic>in vivo</italic> deadenylation defect, as did reduction in CAF1 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>The role of the CAF1 protein, however, is less clear. Its principal role has been considered to be that of linking CCR4 to the remainder of the CCR4-NOT complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Deletion of the <italic>CAF1</italic> gene showed a dramatic deadenylation defect <italic>in vivo</italic>, albeit to a lesser extent than that of <italic>ccr4&#x00394;</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), and this has been interpreted to mean that CCR4 must be part of the CCR4-NOT complex to function well <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although CAF1 is classified as a member of the DEDDh family of nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and the polypeptide isolated from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> can function as a 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease with some preference for poly(A) sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), inactivation of predicted key catalytic active sites of CAF1 did not affect <italic>in vivo</italic> deadenylation function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Moreover, over-expression of <italic>CCR4</italic> could partially complement the deadenylation defect of a <italic>caf1</italic> deletion, but over-expression of <italic>CAF1</italic> did not rescue phenotypes associated with that of a <italic>ccr4</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). These results indicate that the deadenylase activity of CAF1 is not required for its <italic>in vivo</italic> deadenylation function. Moreover, CAF1 has been shown recently to interact with PUF5 and to be required for PUF5-induced deadenylation of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), supporting other roles of CAF1 in mRNA deadenylation.</p><p>Since the predicted catalytic sites of CAF1 are not critical to its <italic>in vivo</italic> function, understanding the functional roles of CAF1 on mRNA turnover will require the identification of other important regions of the CAF1 protein. To identify in the CAF1 protein functional regions, which are critical for mRNA degradation, we conducted a deletion analysis of yeast CAF1 by targeting regions absolutely conserved among CAF1 orthologs. This mutation analysis identified four functional regions of CAF1, including those required for binding CCR4 and for deadenylation. Domains of CAF1 that are important to deadenylation <italic>in vivo</italic> included but are not limited to those that are required for CCR4 binding. Relatedly, defects in CAF1, but not that in CCR4, were lethal with defects in DHH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) and PAB1, factors involved in translation, and over-expression of translation-associated proteins could suppress <italic>caf1&#x00394; pab1</italic> lethality. Moreover, we showed that a PAB1 translation defect severely reduced deadenylation when coupled with a <italic>caf1</italic> deletion. CAF1, in addition to binding CCR4, may act on the deadenylation process in conjunction with factors affecting translation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and growth conditions</title><p>The background yeast strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

These two alleles were chosen in that results shown below indicated that the <italic>caf1-1</italic> and <italic>caf1-6</italic> alleles appeared phenotypically similar to <italic>caf1-3</italic>, and <italic>caf1-2</italic> was unique for being most defective in CCR4 binding. Strains carrying <italic>caf1-10</italic> (213AAA215) and <italic>caf1-11</italic> (255AAA257) displayed the exact same phenotypes as did strains with their respective deletion alleles, <italic>caf1-2</italic> and <italic>caf1-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). For the remainder of our analysis the original deletion mutations were used. It should also be noted that these <italic>CAF1</italic> deletion derivatives, as has been previously observed for <italic>caf1</italic> deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>), did not affect the relative protein amounts and, therefore, expression in the cell of other CCR4-NOT components, such as CCR4, NOT1, NOT3 or CAF40 (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>The caf1-2 protein is defective in binding with CCR4</title><p>The relative locations of the proteins in the CCR4-NOT core complex have been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>) in which the CAF1 protein is critical for linking CCR4 to NOT1 and the remainder of the CCR4-NOT complex. We, therefore, assessed the ability of each of the CAF1 mutant proteins to bind CCR4 and NOT1, using Flag-tagged CAF1 protein variants expressed in a <italic>caf1</italic> deletion background. Flag-CAF1 was used for this analysis as the Flag immunoprecipitations resulted in substantially cleaner backgrounds than immunoprecipitations with either HA- or LexA-CAF1 variants. After Flag immunoprecipitations were conducted, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, we found that the caf1-4 protein was able to bind CCR4 as well as wild-type CAF1. The caf1-2 protein, in contrast, was totally defective in binding to CCR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). The slight band observed in the <italic>caf1-2</italic> lane with CCR4 antibody does not migrate where CCR4 is located and is a result of a non-specific protein interaction. The caf1-1, -3, -5 and -6 proteins also displayed reduced binding to CCR4, but they still displayed significantly more association with CCR4 than did caf1-2. While all of the mutant proteins were still capable of binding NOT1, they did display reduced binding to NOT1 as compared to wild-type CAF1.</p><p>In order to verify these results, we also conducted the immunoprecipitation in the reverse direction for several of the key CAF1 variants. Using a Flag-tagged CCR4 and LexA-fused versions of the CAF1 variants, we isolated Flag-CCR4 and determined the abundance of LexA-CAF1 that was co-immunoprecipitated. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, LexA-caf1-2 was most severely deficient in binding CCR4. In contrast, LexA-caf1-1 and LexA-caf1-6 proteins bound significantly better to CCR4 than did LexA-caf1-2. However, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, both the LexA-caf1-1 and LexA-caf1-6 proteins were still defective in binding CCR4 as compared to wild-type CAF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B).</p><p>These above results suggest several conclusions. First, the immunoprecipitation data indicate that the differences in the growth and caffeine phenotypes described above do not result solely from differences in CAF1 binding NOT1 or CCR4. The severe phenotypes displayed with the <italic>caf1-1</italic>, <italic>-3</italic> and <italic>-6</italic> alleles were not due solely to loss of CCR4 binding, as each of these corresponding proteins could bind CCR4 as well as caf1-5, whose allele did not display as severe growth defects. The caf1-2 protein was most defective for binding CCR4, and yet the strain carrying <italic>caf1-2</italic> grew better than did those carrying <italic>caf1-1</italic>, <italic>-3</italic> or <italic>-6</italic>, indicating that loss of CCR4 binding alone was not the cause for the <italic>caf1</italic> deletion phenotypes. Therefore, while CAF1 binding to CCR4 contributes to part of the defects observed with <italic>caf1&#x00394;</italic>, as exemplified by <italic>caf1-2</italic>, other CAF1 interactions must also be important to its function. Third, the ratio of NOT1-CCR4 in the caf1-1, -3, -5 and -6 immunoprecipitations was similar to that found in the wild-type strain, arguing that some of the CCR4-NOT complex was intact in the cell. The expression and abundance of the individual CCR4-NOT proteins in the cell were not affected by the caf1 variants as determined by western analysis (data not shown), suggesting that the each of the caf1 variants except for caf1-4 was causing some destabilization of the CCR4-NOT complex. Yet, as the strain carrying <italic>caf1-5</italic> was similar to wild type in terms of its growth at high temperature, the reduced abundance of the CCR4-NOT complex <italic>per se</italic> is not the sole cause for all of the severe growth defects observed with <italic>caf1-1</italic>, <italic>-3</italic> and <italic>-6</italic>. These observations also suggest that the severe growth defects of <italic>caf1-1</italic>, <italic>-3</italic> and <italic>-6</italic> relative to that of <italic>caf1-2</italic> and <italic>caf1-5</italic> are not specifically due to the caf1-1, -3 and -6 proteins being completely misfolded and hence comparable to the <italic>caf1&#x00394;</italic> allele, as some of these caf1-1, -3 and -6 proteins are still capable of binding CCR4 and NOT1.</p><p>We also assayed the purified CCR4-NOT complex from each of the mutated strains for <italic>in vitro</italic> CCR4 deadenylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). CAF1 is not required for CCR4 <italic>in vitro</italic> deadenylation function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), and, as expected, the six <italic>caf1</italic> alleles did not significantly alter CCR4-NOT <italic>in vitro</italic> deadenylation activity following purification of Flag-CCR4 (Supplementary Figure 1). We were not able to assay, however, for CAF1 deadenylase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> since we have not been able to demonstrate enzyme activity for yeast CAF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of separable functional regions required for mRNA deadenylation</title><p>In order to determine if the <italic>caf1</italic> mutant alleles affected mRNA deadenylation <italic>in vivo</italic>, transcriptional pulse-chase experiments were performed on the <italic>GAL1</italic> mRNA. In this experiment, transcription of <italic>GAL1</italic> mRNA was induced by adding galactose and then repressed by adding glucose to the growing culture. Following a 15&#x02009;min induction, <italic>GAL1</italic> mRNA synthesis was shut-off at time zero and aliquots were prepared for northern analysis at each time point. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, <italic>GAL1</italic> mRNA was shortened with a 3&#x02032; oligonucleotide probe and RNase H prior to separation on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel for size resolution of the poly(A) tail. Due to two polyadenylation sites in the <italic>GAL1</italic> gene, <italic>GAL1</italic> mRNAs consists of two forms: <italic>GAL1</italic>-L and <italic>GAL1</italic>-S in which the long <italic>GAL1</italic>-L has an additional 110&#x02009;nt in its 3&#x02032;-UTR segment as compared to <italic>GAL1</italic>-S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). However, as <italic>GAL1</italic>-S mRNA is less abundant and therefore more difficult to detect and quantitate than that of <italic>GAL1</italic>-L mRNA, we present only the data for <italic>GAL1</italic>-L. Also, for this experiment LexA fusions to the CAF1 variants were used to transform a <italic>caf1</italic> deletion yeast strain so that CAF1 would be constitutively expressed from its <italic>ADH1</italic> promoter. </p><p>The deadenylation rate analysis of <italic>GAL1</italic>-L mRNA identified several functional regions in CAF1 that are important for normal deadenylation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Of the six <italic>caf1</italic> alleles, <italic>caf1-1</italic>, <italic>caf1-3</italic> and <italic>caf1-6</italic> alleles displayed severe deadenylation rate defects similar to that displayed with a <italic>caf1</italic> null allele. For the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B), <italic>GAL1</italic>-L poly(A) tails were shortened to 8&#x02013;12&#x02009;nt within 9&#x02009;min. In contrast, in the <italic>caf1-1</italic>, <italic>-3</italic> and <italic>-6</italic> allele background, <italic>GAL1</italic>-L was only deadenylated to &#x0223c;30&#x02013;35 A's within the first 9&#x02009;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Similar defects in <italic>GAL1</italic>-S mRNA deadenylation were also observed for <italic>caf1-1</italic>, <italic>-3</italic> and <italic>-6</italic> as compared to wild type (data not shown). The average rate of deadenylation for <italic>GAL1</italic>-L in wild type was 4.9 A's/min in which the rate of deadenylation was based on the lower end of the poly(A) distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). In the <italic>caf1-1</italic>, <italic>-3</italic> and <italic>-6</italic> mutated strains, the range of the deadenylation rates for <italic>GAL1</italic>-L mRNAs were from 2.0 to 2.9&#x02009;nt/min (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). For <italic>caf1-2</italic> and <italic>caf1-5</italic>, in contrast, the deadenylation rates for <italic>GAL1</italic>-L were in the 3.4&#x02013;4.4 A's/min range, indicating that they were defective in deadenylation but not to the extent observed for the <italic>caf1-1</italic>, <italic>-3</italic> and <italic>-6</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). <italic>caf1-4</italic> displayed a faster deadenylation rate than wild type. In addition, it should be observed that the caf1-1, -3 and -6 proteins failed to allow complete deadenylation to 8&#x02013;10 A's even at the 40-min time point. caf1-2 allowed deadenylation to proceed much further to nearly wild-type lengths, whereas caf1-5 displayed a more severe deadenylation endpoint defect with <italic>GAL</italic>1-L. Given that the phenotypic analysis of <italic>caf1-2</italic> and <italic>caf1-5</italic> showed that their temperature and caffeine sensitivities were halfway between wild type and that of the <italic>caf1</italic> deletion, these <italic>in vivo</italic> deadenylation data agree well with their <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotypes. </p><p>To more precisely analyze deadenylation endpoints, the steady-state RNA levels of <italic>MFA2pG</italic> were studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In this case, the <italic>pG</italic> mRNA fragments that results from deadenylation, decapping and 5&#x02032; nuclease digestion of <italic>MFA2pG</italic> allows a better estimate of the deadenylation endpoint than does pulse-chase analysis. Previously, a <italic>caf1</italic> deletion has been shown to result in median endpoints of &#x0223c;16&#x02013;20 A's as compared to 8&#x02013;12 A's for wild-type <italic>CAF1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). We found that <italic>caf1-1</italic>, <italic>-3</italic> and <italic>-6</italic> alleles resulted in a longer poly(A) tail length for the <italic>pG</italic> fragment that results after deadenylation, decapping and 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; nuclease action on <italic>MFA2pG</italic> than for wild-type CAF1: 24&#x02013;29 A's for the longest A lengths as compared to 11 A's for wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, lanes 2, 4, 7 compared to lane 1; summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). In the <italic>caf1-2</italic> and <italic>caf1-5</italic> alleles, the deadenylation endpoints of the <italic>pG</italic> fragment were not significantly affected as compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, lanes 3, 6; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). It should also be noted that the rate of <italic>MFA2pG</italic> deadenylation appeared slower in the <italic>caf1-1</italic>, <italic>-3</italic> and <italic>-6</italic> backgrounds as compared to <italic>caf1-2</italic>, <italic>-5</italic>, and <italic>CAF1</italic>. In the top part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, it can be observed that full-length <italic>MFA2pG</italic> mRNA poly(A) tails are on average significantly longer for <italic>caf1-1, -3,</italic> and -<italic>6</italic> than that of <italic>caf1-2</italic>, <italic>-5</italic> and <italic>CAF1</italic>, indicative of slowed deadenylation. Moreover, the ratio of full-length <italic>MFA2pG</italic> RNA to that of the <italic>pG</italic> fragment was significantly greater for <italic>caf1-1</italic>, <italic>-3</italic> and <italic>-6</italic> as compared to <italic>caf1-2</italic>, <italic>-5</italic>, and <italic>CAF1</italic>, indicating that the rate of decapping and degradation of the <italic>MFA2pG</italic> mRNA was being slowed, most likely due to a slowed rate of deadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). These overall results indicate that the severe growth phenotypes of <italic>caf1-1</italic>, <italic>-3</italic> and <italic>-6</italic> probably result from the inability of the CCR4-NOT complex to properly deadenylate <italic>in vivo</italic> and that CAF1 must also interfere with the deadenylation process separately from its contacts to CCR4 and NOT1. </p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the role of CAF1 in deadenylation separate from contacting CCR4</title><p>The above results support the model that CAF1 has an effect on the mRNA degradation process in addition to that derived from its contact to CCR4. In this regard, the <italic>caf1</italic> deletion has previously been shown to be lethal with a deletion in the decapping/translational regulator <italic>DHH1</italic> whereas the <italic>ccr4</italic> deletion is not lethal with that of <italic>dhh1&#x00394;</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In order to determine which <italic>CAF1</italic> allele can confer lethality with <italic>dhh1&#x00394;</italic>, we constructed a strain carrying both a <italic>dhh1&#x00394;</italic> and a <italic>caf1&#x00394;</italic> that was covered by a plasmid expressing a <italic>GAL1-CAF1</italic> gene. This strain was unable to grow on glucose growth conditions when <italic>GAL1-CAF1</italic> expression was shut-off (Supplementary Figure 2). Following transformation of <italic>LexA-CAF1</italic> plasmids encoding each of the above mutagenized <italic>CAF1</italic> alleles, the <italic>caf1-1</italic>, <italic>-3</italic> and <italic>-6</italic> alleles did not allow growth on glucose growth conditions whereas <italic>caf1-2</italic> and <italic>-5</italic> alleles allowed growth on glucose (Supplementary Figure 2). These data suggest that <italic>caf1-1</italic>, <italic>-3</italic> and <italic>-6</italic> alleles are also defective in a non-deadenylation function.</p><p><italic>caf1&#x00394; dhh1&#x00394;</italic> lethality could result from their combined effects on deadenylation that is separate from CCR4 effects on deadenylation. However, this model is unlikely in that lethality does not occur under circumstances when deadenylation in the cell is completely blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). An alternative model would be that as DHH1 is known to be involved in both decapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), CAF1 could be involved separately from CCR4 in either or both of these functions leading to a <italic>caf1&#x00394; dhh1&#x00394;</italic> lethality. This model would further suggest that CAF1 effects on deadenylation that are separate from binding CCR4 would result from its involvement in this other function. That is, CAF1 interaction with the decapping/translation processes may affect deadenylation. However, CAF1 is not probably involved in decapping separately from CCR4. Studies that measured the relative decapping rate using the <italic>MFA2pG</italic> RNA have suggested that the slowed deadenylation observed with a <italic>caf1</italic> deletion does not result in a more severe decapping defect than does <italic>ccr4&#x00394;</italic> (5,6; data not shown).</p><p>In an analysis of the genetic interactions of poly(A)-binding protein (PAB1) with CCR4 and CAF1, we observed that deleting the RRM2 or RRM1 domain of PAB1 was lethal with a <italic>caf1</italic> deletion but not with <italic>ccr4&#x00394;.</italic> The RRM2 domain of PAB1 is important both for contacting the poly(A) tail and the translation initiation factor eIF4G, and both RRM1 and RRM2 are required for poly(A) stimulated <italic>in vitro</italic> translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36 B37 B38">36&#x02013;38</xref>). This observation suggests that CAF1 has functions separate from CCR4 that involve some role of PAB1. We subsequently analyzed whether deletion of other components of the CCR4-NOT complex or those of the PAN2/3 deadenylase were lethal with these PAB1 variants. We found that the <italic>not4&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>not5&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>caf40&#x00394;</italic>, as well as <italic>pan2&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>pan3&#x00394;</italic>, were not lethal with these PAB1 mutants (data not shown), implying that it was a specific property of CAF1 that resulted in the lethality. This observed <italic>caf1&#x00394; pab1-&#x00394;RRM2</italic> lethality suggests that CAF1 may functionally interact with factors affecting translation, which in turn may affect deadenylation. The RRM1 and RRM2 deletions of PAB1 also reduced the <italic>in vivo</italic> rate of protein synthesis by 28 and 15%, respectively, whereas deletion of RRM3, RRM4 or of the C-terminal region of PAB1 had &#x0003c;6% effects on the rate of protein translation (data not shown). Deletions of RRM3, RRM4 or the C-terminus of PAB1 were correspondingly not lethal with <italic>caf1&#x00394;</italic> (data not shown). We also found that the <italic>caf1-1</italic>, <italic>-3</italic> and <italic>-6</italic> alleles but not those of <italic>caf1-2</italic> or <italic>caf1-5</italic> were lethal with <italic>PAB1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>RRM2</italic> (data not shown). These genetic interactions support the possibility that CAF1 is functionally involved with factors that affect the translation process.</p><p>To clarify the genetic interaction between <italic>caf1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>PAB1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>RRM2</italic>, we conducted a genetic screen to identify genes whose over-expression could rescue this synthetic lethality. A high-copy YEp13-<italic>LEU2</italic> yeast genomic library was transformed into a strain carrying the <italic>caf1&#x00394; PAB1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>RRM2</italic> allele and the YC360 plasmid [PAB1-URA3]. Eleven plasmids that suppressed the <italic>caf1&#x00394; PAB1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>RRM2</italic> lethality were identified, as evidenced by their ability to support loss of the YC360 plasmid following growth on 5&#x02032;-FOA plates. Five of these plasmids contained <italic>CAF1</italic> and one plasmid carried <italic>PAB1</italic>. All of these plasmids suppressed the lethality strongly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Of the remaining five plasmids, two displayed moderate suppression, and of these one was found to carry the <italic>DHH1</italic> gene and the other the <italic>STM1</italic> gene. The remaining three weakly suppressing plasmids will be reported on separately. </p><p>Because previous analysis has identified several multi-copy suppressors of a <italic>caf1</italic> deletion, including that of <italic>DHH1</italic>, <italic>CCR4</italic>, <italic>PKC1</italic>, <italic>STM1</italic> and <italic>PUF5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), we tested whether over-expression of each of these different genes in a strain carrying <italic>caf1&#x00394; PAB1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>RRM2</italic> and <italic>PAB1-URA3</italic> could suppress the <italic>caf1&#x00394; PAB1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>RRM2</italic> lethality and allow loss of <italic>PAB1-URA3</italic> and subsequent growth on 5&#x02032;-FOA media. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, we failed to observe any high-copy suppression of <italic>caf1&#x00394; PAB1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>RRM2</italic> by <italic>CCR4</italic>, <italic>PKC1</italic> or <italic>PUF5</italic>. Since over-expression of <italic>CCR4</italic> can complement <italic>caf1&#x00394;</italic> deadenylation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), this last result confirms that <italic>caf1&#x00394; pab1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>RRM2</italic> lethality is not due solely to a deadenylation defect. Moreover, it indicates that the ability of over-expressed <italic>DHH1</italic> and <italic>STM1</italic> to complement the <italic>caf1&#x00394; PAB1-&#x00394;RRM2</italic> lethality does not result from simply the ability to complement <italic>caf1&#x00394;</italic> defects. These findings provide additional genetic evidence supporting the functional participation of CAF1 in a process that is separate from the role involving CCR4.</p><p>One additional model to explain the role of DHH1 in suppressing the <italic>caf1&#x00394; PAB1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>RRM2</italic> lethality would be that over-expression of DHH1 could compensate for the deadenylation defect caused by <italic>caf1&#x00394;</italic>. In analyzing the steady-state <italic>MFA2pG</italic> levels, over-expression of <italic>DHH1</italic>, however, had no effect on the deadenylation defects observed with the <italic>caf1-1</italic>, <italic>-6</italic> and <italic>caf1&#x00394;</italic> alleles (data not shown). In each of these strains, the <italic>MFA2pG</italic> mRNA did not deadenylate completely and had longer poly(A) tail lengths than the wild-type regardless of whether <italic>DHH1</italic> was over-expressed or not. We additionally tested whether DHH1 association with the CAF1 variants was altered, as it has been shown that NOT1 and CAF1 can associate with DHH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). DHH1 interaction with the CCR4-NOT complex for each of the CAF1 variants, however, was unaffected (Supplementary Figure 3), in agreement with previous data that showed that a <italic>caf1</italic> deletion had little effect on DHH1 association with NOT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>).</p><p>As DHH1 is involved in translation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) and STM1 can interact with the ribosome and eIF4E and is important for protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39 B40 B41 B42 B43">39&#x02013;43</xref>), we determined whether over-expression of <italic>CAF1</italic> or <italic>CCR4</italic> could in turn complement a defect in translation factor eIF4E (<italic>cdc33-1</italic> allele). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, over-expression of <italic>CAF1</italic> but not that of <italic>CCR4</italic> could complement the caffeine sensitivity displayed in a strain carrying the <italic>cdc33-1</italic> allele. As <italic>cdc33-1</italic> is specifically defective in binding the 5&#x02032; mRNA cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), these results provide further support for a functional interaction of CAF1 with translational factors distinct from the role of CCR4 in deadenylation. However, as over-expression of <italic>CAF1</italic> was found neither to rescue the <italic>cdc33-1</italic> defect in <italic>in vivo</italic> protein translation nor did it affect <italic>in vivo</italic> protein translation in a wild-type background (data not shown), over-expression of <italic>CAF1</italic> does not probably restore eIF4E function completely.</p><p>Because of the genetic interaction between <italic>CAF1</italic> and that of <italic>cdc33-1</italic>, we also assessed whether a <italic>caf1&#x00394;</italic> could affect translation directly. Two aspects were analyzed. First, we conducted polysome profiles of mRNA isolated from wild-type and <italic>caf1&#x00394;</italic> strains. No differences between the polysome profiles were observed (data not shown). Second, we assayed if a <italic>caf1&#x00394;</italic> affected the rate of <italic>in vivo</italic> protein translation by quantitating the rate of incorporation of [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine into newly synthesized protein. A <italic>caf1&#x00394;</italic> was found to reduce the rate of <italic>in vivo</italic> translation to 35% of wild type. In contrast, a <italic>ccr4&#x00394;</italic> reduced <italic>in vivo</italic> translation only to 55% of wild type. SEMs for these series of experiments were &#x0003c;5% of the values. Similarly, in a <italic>cdc33-1</italic> background, a <italic>caf1&#x00394;</italic> deletion reduced the rate of <italic>in vivo</italic> protein synthesis from 35% (<italic>cdc33-1</italic>) to that of 13% (<italic>cdc33-1 caf1&#x00394;</italic>); the rate of protein synthesis was reduced to 24% by combining <italic>cdc33-1</italic> with <italic>ccr4&#x00394;</italic>. These results indicate that a <italic>caf1&#x00394;</italic> was displaying an additional effect on protein translation than observed through its possible effects on CCR4.</p><p>If CAF1 were to functionally interact with PAB1 and/or the translation process, it might be expected that defects in PAB1 could, in turn, when combined with <italic>caf1&#x00394;</italic>, specifically reduce deadenylation. We subsequently analyzed whether other less severe defects in the RRM2 domain of PAB1 in conjunction with a <italic>caf1</italic> deletion affected the deadenylation process. Two PAB1 variants are known to affect different PAB1 translational functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). PAB1-184 and PAB1-134 carry three amino acids substitutions each: PAB1-184 affects eIF4G binding <italic>in vitro</italic> and PAB1-134 has an undefined <italic>in vitro</italic> translation defect involving 5&#x02032;-cap-dependent translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). We first analyzed the effect of these variants on the steady-state distribution of poly(A) tail lengths for <italic>GAL1</italic>-L mRNA in conjunction with a <italic>caf1</italic> deletion. <italic>caf1&#x00394; PAB1-134</italic> resulted in significantly longer steady-state <italic>GAL1</italic>-L poly(A) tail lengths as compared to <italic>caf1&#x00394;</italic> alone, indicative of a slowed deadenylation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A, right panel; data not shown), whereas <italic>PAB1-184</italic> had no effect on poly(A) tail lengths in conjunction with <italic>caf1&#x00394;</italic>. This result suggests that both CAF1 and the PAB1-134 mutated residues are required for complete deadenylation. In contrast, <italic>PAB1-134</italic> in combination with <italic>ccr4&#x00394;</italic> did not affect the steady-state distribution of <italic>GAL1</italic>-L poly(A) tail length as compared to <italic>ccr4&#x00394;</italic> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A; middle panel) nor did it affect the <italic>GAL1</italic>-L poly(A) tail lengths with wild-type PAB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A, left panel). These latter results demonstrate that PAB1-134 is not affecting PAN2/3 deadenylase activity, which is the only deadenylase activity present in a strain lacking CCR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). </p><p>Analysis of the actual deadenylation rate for <italic>GAL1</italic>-L showed that a <italic>caf1&#x00394; PAB1-134</italic> background caused a severe slowing of the rate of deadenylation (0.7 A's/min compared to 4.0 A's/min for wild-type <italic>PAB1</italic> and 2.2 A's/min for <italic>caf1&#x00394;</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B). This slowing of the rate of deadenylation by <italic>caf1&#x00394; PAB1-134</italic> was as severe as that observed in a <italic>ccr4</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C; 1.1 A's/min). These observations suggest that defects in translation caused by PAB1-134 can cause corresponding defects in deadenylation and that proper translation in conjunction with CAF1 is required for complete deadenylation by CCR4 (see Discussion). Because the PAB1-134 protein had only been assessed for effects on <italic>in vitro</italic> translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), it remains possible that PAB1-134 does not affect <italic>in vivo</italic> translation. We consequently determined if PAB1-134 was defective for <italic>in vivo</italic> translation by quantitating the rate of incorporation of [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine into newly synthesized protein. PAB1-134 did not affect the rate of <italic>in vivo</italic> translation as compared to PAB1 wild type (data not shown). However, when we combined <italic>PAB1-134</italic> with a defect in eIF3 (<italic>prt1-63</italic> allele) that has previously been shown to reduce the rate of <italic>in vivo</italic> translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), we found that <italic>PAB1-134 prt1-63</italic> reduced the rate of <italic>in vivo</italic> translation significantly compared to <italic>prt1-63</italic> alone: <italic>prt1-63 PAB1-134</italic> (31&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.0%), <italic>prt1-63</italic> (45&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.0%), and wild type (100%). In contrast, <italic>PAB1-184</italic> did not affect <italic>in vivo</italic> translation alone or in conjunction with <italic>prt1-63</italic> (48&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.5%). These results indicate that the PAB1-134 protein does display defects for <italic>in vivo</italic> translation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>It has been shown that the CAF1&#x02009;C-terminal domain purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> exhibits an exonuclease activity with a poly(A) preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Our previous mutation studies of CAF1 established, however, that its RNase function is not required for the <italic>in vivo</italic> deadenylation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). This discrepancy prompted us to identify the functional domains that are critical for CAF1 to perform its role in mRNA turnover. By targeting only those sequences absolutely conserved amongst all CAF1 orthologs but not present in other members of the DEDDh family of nucleases, we sought to identify CAF1-specific functions. This methodology led us to define several separable functional regions in the CAF1 protein.</p><p>Immunoprecipitation analyses with <italic>CAF1</italic> mutants used in this study showed that three amino acids (213FRS215) deleted in <italic>caf1-2</italic> are most required for the CAF1 interaction with CCR4. As mammalian CAF1 can also bind yeast CCR4, it would be expected that the CAF1 residues involved in this contact have been retained evolutionarily. Residues 213&#x02013;215 are found in a loop region whose structure was not fixed enough to be determined in the X-ray analysis of CAF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Other residues of CAF1 might also be involved in contacting CCR4 as the caf1-1, -3, -5 and -6 proteins also displayed weakened binding to CCR4. The caf1-2 protein displayed a weak caffeine-sensitive phenotype and intermediate effects on deadenylation <italic>in vivo</italic> as compared to a <italic>caf1</italic> deletion or to mutations in other regions of the CAF1 protein that were capable of binding CCR4 to a much greater extent. It appears, therefore, that CAF1 binding to CCR4 is not the only function of CAF1 for deadenylation. This conclusion extends the results from our previous analysis wherein mutations in CCR4 that significantly reduced, albeit did not eliminate, CCR4 binding to CAF1 appeared phenotypically wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to <italic>caf1-2</italic>, the most important regions for CAF1 function <italic>in vivo</italic> were identified by the <italic>caf1-1</italic>, <italic>-3</italic> and <italic>-6</italic> alleles. These three <italic>caf1</italic> mutant alleles displayed severe defects in poly(A) shortening like that of a <italic>caf1</italic> deletion and were as caffeine sensitive as the <italic>caf1</italic> deletion. Three observations suggest that <italic>caf1-1</italic> and <italic>caf1-3</italic> alleles are equivalent physically and functionally. First, the X-ray crystal structure showed that <italic>caf1-1</italic> and <italic>caf1-3</italic> alleles are located in the same region where two parallel &#x003b2; strands (&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;4) are aligned side by side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The exact locations of caf1-1 and caf1-3 in these &#x003b2; strands indicate that each triplet of residues do not actually H-bond with each other, but lie contiguous along the &#x003b2; sheet structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Each defect would be expected to partially disrupt this region of the &#x003b2; sheet structure. Second, yeast cells carrying either of the two alleles grew more slowly than did a <italic>caf1</italic> deletion. Third, both alleles showed similar <italic>GAL1</italic> deadenylation rates and defects in <italic>MFA2pG</italic> endpoints. These observations indicate that the <italic>caf1-1</italic> and <italic>caf1-3</italic> alleles define a novel functional region of yeast CAF1 required for its cellular activity. The <italic>caf1-6</italic> allele, deleting residues 340DFE342, defines a third functional region of CAF1. Phenotypes associated with <italic>caf1-6</italic> are nearly identical to those observed for <italic>caf1-1</italic> and <italic>-3</italic>, although the location of the <italic>caf1-6</italic> mutation is on the opposite site of the CAF1 protein as that of <italic>caf1-1</italic> and <italic>-3</italic>. It is unlikely, however, that the putative contacts made by the caf1-6 region (&#x003b1;8) are to the same factors as presumed to contact the &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;4 sheets. At least, both regions and their putative contacts are central to CAF1 <italic>in vivo</italic> function.</p><p>In regards to the location of the six mutations in the structure of CAF1, the following observations can be made. First, none of the mutations are either in the presumed catalytic area (&#x003b1;4 and &#x003b1;5 and the loop between the &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;3 strands) or in the negatively charged cavity of CAF1 that coincides with the active site found in the structurally and evolutionarily related &#x003b5; subunit of DNA polymerase III (polIII) or DNA polymerase I (polI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Second, the &#x003b2;1 strand of CAF1 (the site of the <italic>caf1-1</italic> alteration) is not found in polIII, although it is present in polI. The sequence features of &#x003b2;4 that were mutated in <italic>caf1-3</italic> are alternating non-polar/polar/non-polar residues, a pattern retained by both polIII and polI, albeit with distinctly different residues for the polar residues and different sizes for the non-polar amino acids. Third, the whole protein region corresponding to &#x003b1;8, the turn region after &#x003b1;7, and the loop between &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b1;3, the sites of the <italic>caf1-6</italic>, <italic>-5</italic> and <italic>-2</italic> mutations, respectively, is not present in either polIII or polI. These three sites are all close to one another and are located on the exterior of the protein. The evolutionary conservation of this region across the CAF1 protein family argues for unique contacts made by it, including but not limited to binding CCR4.</p><p>In that we also observed that none of our <italic>CAF1</italic> alleles severely affected <italic>in vitro</italic> CCR4 deadenylation activity regardless of whether the alleles blocked CCR4 binding to CAF1 (<italic>caf1-2</italic>) or not, we conclude that CAF1 does not directly regulate CCR4 activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. This is in agreement with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Also, as mentioned above each of the <italic>CAF1</italic> alleles interacted equivalently well with NOT1, further suggesting that the identified roles for CAF1 <italic>in vivo</italic> are not solely defined through this interaction either. Yet, because binding to NOT1 was reduced by each of the defective CAF1 proteins, it remains possible that disruptions in the CAF1-NOT1 interaction are responsible for at least part of the reductions in deadenylation that were observed. Moreover, in that DHH1 is known to contact the CCR4-NOT complex through the N-terminal part of NOT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), the genetic interactions observed between DHH1 and CAF1 could be mediated in part by NOT1.</p><p>Because the <italic>caf1-1</italic>, <italic>-3</italic> and <italic>-6</italic> alleles resulted in more significant defects in deadenylation than did the <italic>caf1-2</italic> allele, CAF1 appears to function to control the deadenylation process through non-CCR4 contacts in addition to its contact to CCR4. As mentioned above, disrupting the NOT1 contact does not seem to be solely responsible for this phenotype and we showed that all of the CAF1 variants interacted equivalently with DHH1. The genetic analyses demonstrating <italic>caf1&#x00394;</italic> but not <italic>ccr4&#x00394;</italic> lethality with the decapping/translation regulator <italic>dhh1&#x00394;</italic> and with <italic>PAB1-&#x00394;RRM2/&#x00394;RRM1</italic> is consistent with CAF1 exerting effects separate from CCR4. However, neither of these lethalities is probably due solely to deadenylation defects that are more severe than those observed in a <italic>ccr4&#x00394;</italic> background in that the total lack of deadenylation in yeast is not lethal (6; data not shown). As it has been observed that a <italic>caf1</italic> deletion does not result in more severe decapping defects than does <italic>ccr4&#x00394;</italic> (5,6; data not shown), it is also unlikely that CAF1 is exerting these other effects through decapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Rather, it appears that CAF1 in conjunction with DHH1 and with PAB1 is required for some other essential process.</p><p>In terms of the role of CAF1 in deadenylation, CAF1 appears to play at least two roles. First, through its contact to CCR4 it aids CCR4 association to the CCR4-NOT complex that is important for CCR4 deadenylation. Second, it may affect some aspect of translation that in turn interferes with deadenylation and/or act on deadenylation in conjunction with factors such as PAB1 and DHH1 that play roles in translation. Several observations support this inference. Deleting those domains of PAB1 that are known to affect <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> translation were lethal with deleting <italic>CAF1</italic>. In addition to the observed lethalities described above, we found that over-expression of translational regulator <italic>DHH1</italic> and ribosome-associated protein <italic>STM1</italic> can specifically suppress the <italic>caf1&#x00394; PAB1-&#x00394;RRM2</italic> lethality. Other suppressors of <italic>caf1&#x00394;</italic> not as directly involved in translation, such as <italic>CCR4</italic>, <italic>PKC1</italic> and <italic>PUF5</italic>, did not display this phenotype. We also showed that over-expression of <italic>CAF1</italic> but not that of <italic>CCR4</italic> could suppress phenotypes associated with a defect in translation factor eIF4E. In addition, a <italic>caf1&#x00394;</italic> slowed <italic>in vivo</italic> protein synthesis, although how it does this is not clear. Taken together, these data point to a role for CAF1 in functionally interacting with translationally important proteins.</p><p>A possible role for translation or factors involved in translation in being required for deadenylation was supported by the observation that the PAB1-134 variant slowed the rate of deadenylation when combined with a <italic>caf1</italic> deletion. PAB1-134 did not affect deadenylation by itself and had no effect on deadenylaton when combined with a <italic>ccr4</italic> deletion. The PAB1-134 protein is known to be defective for <italic>in vitro</italic> translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), and we showed that it reduced <italic>in vivo</italic> translation when combined with defects in translation initiation factors. Previous studies have indicated that defects in translation initiation factors accelerated the CCR4 deadenylation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). In these cases, interference with translation initiation would appear to predispose the mRNP for deadenylation and should not necessarily inhibit it. In contrast, the <italic>PAB1-134 caf1&#x00394;</italic> effect on deadenylation implies that both PAB1 and CAF1 are required for deadenylation. As PAB1 has been suggested to both inhibit and be required for deadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>), additional studies are necessary to clarify how other factors of the mRNP, such as PAB1, actually affect CCR4 deadenylation. Their analysis may shed light on the means by which CAF1 affects the mRNA degradation process.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm196_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-powerpoint" xlink:href="nar_gkm196_nar-02733-a-2006-File011.ppt"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-powerpoint" xlink:href="nar_gkm196_nar-02733-a-2006-File012.ppt"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-powerpoint" xlink:href="nar_gkm196_nar-02733-a-2006-File013.ppt"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-powerpoint" xlink:href="nar_gkm196_nar-02733-a-2006-File014.ppt"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We would like to thank R.

The apparent increased abundance of caf1-2 protein in the gel that is presented is artifactual and no significant differences in the abundance of these proteins were observed in numerous other experiments. Vector control refers to pJG4-5 without the CAF1 protein.
