We reported previously that in the mammalian retina, FIZ1 interacts with NRL (Neural-Retina Leucine-zipper), an essential transcriptional activator of rod photoreceptor-specific genes. The concentration of FIZ1 in the retina increases during photoreceptor terminal maturation, when two key transcription factors NRL and CRX (Cone-Rod Homeobox) become detectable on the promoters of photoreceptor-specific genes (i.e. <italic>Rhodopsin, Pde6b</italic>). To determine if FIZ1 is involved in regulating CRX-mediated transcriptional activation, we examined FIZ1 subcellular location in mouse neural retina, its ability to interact with CRX, and its association with CRX/NRL target genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>FIZ1 is present in the nucleus of adult photoreceptors as well as other retinal neurons as shown by transmission electron microscopy with nano-gold labeling. FIZ1 and CRX were co-precipitated from retinal nuclear extracts with antibodies to either protein. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that FIZ1 is part of the protein complex on several rod and cone gene promoters, within photoreceptor cells of the mouse retina. FIZ1 complexes with CRX or NRL on known NRL- and CRX-responsive elements, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays with FIZ1 antibody. FIZ1 can directly bind to CRX, as demonstrated using yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays. Co-transfection assays demonstrated that FIZ1 increases CRX-mediated activation of <italic>Opsin </italic>test promoters. Quantitative ChIP analysis revealed an increased association of FIZ1 with the <italic>Rhodopsin </italic>promoter in adult (P-25) neural retina versus immature (P-3) neural retina. The quantity of transcriptionally active RNA Polymerase-II within the <italic>Rhodopsin </italic>gene (<italic>Rho</italic>) was significantly increased in the adult neural retina, compared to the immature retina.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>FIZ1 directly interacts with CRX to enhance CRX's transactivation activity for target genes. Developmentally, in neural retina tissue, the increased association of FIZ1 with CRX target genes corresponds to an increased association of transcriptionally active Pol-II within the <italic>Rho </italic>gene. Together with previous findings, our results suggest that FIZ1 may act as a transcriptional co-regulator of photoreceptor-specific genes, recruited by at least two photoreceptor-specific transcription factors, CRX and NRL. Further studies are underway to elucidate the exact role of FIZ1 in photoreceptor gene expression, development and maintenance.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The mammalian retina is an excellent paradigm to study both differentiation and maturation of neurons from common precursor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Several transcription factors are clearly essential for photoreceptor development, and their mutations cause retinal degenerations: NRL, CRX, Otx2, Tr&#x003b2;2 (thyroid hormone receptor &#x003b2;2), and NR2E3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. NRL, CRX and NR2E3 are present in photoreceptor progenitors quite early (E-14-18 in the mouse) when they influence photoreceptor type. While present in photoreceptor progenitors, they are not associated with the <italic>Rhodopsin </italic>(<italic>Rho</italic>) promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>, until these neurons begin to mature and <italic>Rho </italic>is expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Regulators of photoreceptor-specific gene promoters appear to form a transcriptional complex supported by their multiple protein-protein interactions. NRL and CRX can interact directly with each other, and they synergize to activate the <italic>Rho </italic>promoter <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Likewise, NR2E3 interacts with CRX, and supports CRX-mediated activation of rod-specific gene promoters, and repression of cone-specific gene promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Through efforts to map protein interactions involved in regulating retinal gene expression, FIZ1 was found as a protein that interacts with NRL, and co-purifies with NRL from nuclear extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. While FIZ1 mRNA is found in most human and mouse tissues, FIZ1 protein content is lower in immature postnatal mouse retina and its concentration increases ten-fold (after P-5) as retinal neurons mature to full functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Immunohistochemistry has revealed increasing FIZ1 concentration in photoreceptors, the inner plexiform layer, and the ganglion cell layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Functionally, FIZ1 can synergize with NRL and CRX to increase the activation of the <italic>Rho </italic>and <italic>PDE6B (human rod Phosphodiesterase beta subunit) </italic>promoters <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Is FIZ1 recruited to the regulatory protein complex on the <italic>Rhodopsin </italic>promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>? To address this question, we wanted to determine the subcellular localization of FIZ1 in the neural retina at the ultrastructural level. We utilized transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with nano-gold labeling to accomplish this goal. To determine if FIZ1 is part of the protein complex, with NRL and CRX, on photoreceptor specific gene promoters <italic>in vivo</italic>, we employed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with retinal nuclear extracts, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays.</p><p>Knowing that members of these transcriptional complexes (i.e. NRL, CRX, NR2E3) are typically involved in several protein-protein interactions, we carried out a set of assays to determine if FIZ1 could interact with CRX. These included yeast two-hybrid assays, GST pull-down assays, co-immunoprecipitation assays, and promoter activation assays with two test <italic>Opsin </italic>promoters (<italic>M- </italic>and <italic>S-Opsin</italic>). Lastly, we employed quantitative ChIP (Q-ChIP) assays to compare the association of FIZ1 with the <italic>Rho </italic>gene in immature retina (poised to transcription) versus mature retina (actively transcribed). A novel technique to directly monitor the transcriptional state of the <italic>Rho </italic>gene, based upon the presence of transcriptionally active RNA Polymerase-II within the gene, was adapted successfully for tissue analysis.</p><p>We report that FIZ1 is present in the nucleus of rod and cone photoreceptors as well as other mature retinal neurons. FIZ1 is part of the regulatory protein complex associated with active rod- and cone-specific gene promoters, but only in photoreceptor cells. Furthermore, FIZ1 can bind directly to CRX, and modify CRX's activation potential at two <italic>Opsin </italic>(M and S) promoters <italic>in vitro</italic>. Q-ChIP revealed that FIZ1 association with the <italic>Rho </italic>gene increases in maturing photoreceptors and this correlated with a greater amount of actively transcribing RNA Polymerase-II moving through the <italic>Rho </italic>gene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Studies were carried out with the approval of Oakland University's Animal Care and Use Committee and Washington University's Animal Studies Committee.

Mouse retinas, immature (P-5) and mature (P-35), were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 4 hours and washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) over night. Retinas were dehydrated with ascending N, N-dimethyl formamide and infiltrated with Lowicryl-K4M (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

FIZ1 associated chromatin was immunoprecipitated from wild-type retina using anti-bFIZ1 antibody which is specific for FIZ1 protein in immunoblots of mouse retina.

Input chromatin DNA served as a positive control, while pre-immune serum, no antibody and no DNA (mock) samples served as negative controls. Follow up ChIP assays compared FIZ1 association with gene promoters in retinas from wild-type and rodless/coneless mice. The antibody was anti-FIZ1-I, an affinity-purified rabbit IgG that targets a conserved peptide (mouse and human) in domain-I (Proteintech Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and detects the same band as anti-bFIZ1 on immunoblots (data not shown).

This included nuclei of both rod and cone photoreceptors. Labeling of FIZ1 was present throughout the entire area of photoreceptor nuclei. While previous immunofluorescence study showed a distribution of NRL throughout rod-photoreceptor nuclei in human retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], the photoreceptors of nocturnal species (mouse) have compact nuclei with an inverted pattern of chromatin density. In mouse, dense chromatin fills the central nucleus, leaving lower density chromatin at the periphery. Evidence is mounting that this periphery corresponds to euchromatin, where active photoreceptor-specific genes are located. Fluorescent labeling of the mouse <italic>Rho </italic>gene has demonstrated a location in the periphery of most photoreceptor nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Some immunohistochemistry reports show detection of CRX throughout photoreceptor nuclei (mouse) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], while immunofluorescence labeling with confocal imaging shows an intense peripheral labeling for CRX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Immunofluorescence of NR2E3 in the mouse retina also shows an intense labeling in the nuclear periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Mice expressing a fusion protein of GFP with OTX2, another transriptional activator present in photoreceptors, display a ring-like distribution of the GFP tag in their photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. It is clear that this region correlates with the expression of active genes in mouse photoreceptors.</p><p>Recent reports also indicate that NRL and CRX have roles in the transcriptional repression of cone-specific genes in addition to their roles as transcriptional activators of rod-specific genes. The ectopic expression of NRL in mouse cone progenitors, results in the conversion of cone-precursors to rod photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. CRX is also present on cone-opsin promoters in rod photoreceptor cells, and NR2E3 inhibits the CRX-mediated activation of cone-opsin promoters, <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The later could explain why NR2E3 deficient mice develop extra cone-opsin expressing photoreceptors in the form of hybrid cone-rod photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. As such, NRL and CRX, two transcription factors that can bind FIZ1, could recruit FIZ1 to both euchromatin and heterochromatin regions of mouse photoreceptors.</p><p>Significant labeling of FIZ1 was also present in the inner segments of photoreceptors in mature retina. The packing of photoreceptor cells to high density is facilitated by the location of ribosomes and mitochondria in the inner-segments. As the location for much of the protein synthesis in photoreceptors, many proteins should be present in this region. We did not detect FIZ1 by immunogold staining in ultra thin sections of P-5 retina, which is likely due to the low sensitivity of this particular technique and a much lower level of FIZ1 protein in P-5 retina. This is consistent with previous findings, showing that FIZ1 concentration in immature neural retina is less than 10% of that found in the mature tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The inability to detect this lower level of FIZ1 does not indicate that FIZ1 is absent. The more sensitive Q-Chip analysis confirmed this. FIZ1 association with the <italic>Rho </italic>promoter at P-3 was much lower than at P-25; however, the level of FIZ1 at P-3 was detectable above the background, as represented by an untranslated control region on the same chromosome (Chr-6).</p><p>Previously we have shown that FIZ1 could alter activation of a <italic>Rho </italic>test-promoter, suggesting that FIZ1 could have some direct or indirect interactions with CRX in addition to NRL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. CRX is present in all rod and cone photoreceptors, placing FIZ1 in a biologically relevant location for interaction with CRX. Our co-IP experiments from bovine retina nuclear extract, confirmed that native FIZ1 and CRX could be isolated as part of the same nuclear protein complex. Co-IP with antibody to FIZ1 captured CRX from nuclear protein preparations. Conversely, antibody to CRX co-precipitated FIZ1.</p><p>Peng and Chen (2005) have reported that NRL, CRX and NR2E3 are part of the transcriptional complex on several photoreceptor-specific genes <italic>in vivo</italic>, including <italic>Rho</italic>, <italic>Pde6b</italic>, <italic>Rbp3</italic>, <italic>M-Opsin </italic>and <italic>S-Opsin </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Our chromatin immunoprecipitation results indicated that FIZ1 is also associated with the proximal promoter regions of these genes. Our results here, and those previously reported, indicate that FIZ1 can alter the activation potential of NRL and/or CRX at four of these promoters <italic>in vitro</italic>: <italic>Rho, PDE6B, M-Opsin</italic>, and <italic>S-Opsin</italic>. Additionally, ChIP analysis found that FIZ1 occupies the regulatory complex of photoreceptor-specific genes in wild-type retina, but not in rodless/coneless mice (rd<sup>1</sup>). This result indicates that FIZ1 recruitment to the regulatory protein complex at photoreceptor-specific genes is an event specific to adult photoreceptors. While FIZ1 is present in bipolar and ganglion cells, it is not associated with photoreceptor-specific gene promoters in these neurons.</p><p>Our EMSA results indicate that FIZ1 is also a component of retinal nuclear protein complexes that can bind to the NRL-binding element (NRE), and the two CRX-binding elements (BAT-1, Ret-4). NRL binds to an extended AP-1 like element, the NRE, in the <italic>Rho </italic>gene's proximal promoter region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The CRX homeodomain can bind to two promoter elements, BAT-1 and Ret-4, that flank the NRE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Historically, the Ret-4 element was used in a yeast 1-hybrid survey to discover CRX from a bovine retina library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>Rehemtulla et al., demonstrated that the NRE probe is shifted into two major complexes with bovine nuclear protein extract, and the higher shifted complex can be removed by antibody to NRL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In our tests here, FIZ1 antibody was also able to remove the larger probe/protein complex. While this element is relatively short and will be covered by NRL, stable protein-protein interactions could involve non-DNA binding proteins in the overall complex. FIZ1 is capable of direct and stable interaction with NRL <italic>in vitro</italic>; therefore, FIZ1 may associate with the NRE element indirectly through its interaction with NRL. This would be consistent with the fact that the higher shifted band, diminished by incubation with antibody to FIZ1, is also disrupted by antibody to NRL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Similarly, it is conceivable for FIZ1 to associate indirectly with CRX-binding sites (BAT-1 and Ret-4) by association with CRX. BAT-1 has two core elements that can bind the K50-type HD of CRX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Consistent with the presence of two potential binding sites, Chen et al., have demonstrated that the BAT-1 probe can be shifted into two major bands by recombinant CRX-HD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The BAT-1 site is crucial for CRX mediated activation of the <italic>Rhodopsin </italic>proximal promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>Here, using bovine retina nuclear extract, two major shifted bands were also seen, similar to the pattern reported for recombinant CRX-HD. It is possible that these major shifted bands represent the association of one and two molecules of CRX. In our case, a third higher shifting faint band was removed after complex formation by treatment with FIZ1 antibody, while the two major bands remained. This suggests FIZ1 was not required for formation of the smaller complexes.</p><p>In contrast to BAT-1, the Ret-4 probe contains one K50-type HD binding element, and shifts to a doublet band with bovine retina nuclear extract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Our EMSA here, with bovine retina nuclear extract, also resulted in a single major shifted complex. This intense band was efficiently removed by FIZ1 antibody, suggesting the presence of FIZ1. The disruption of only a higher shifting faint band with the BAT-1 probe, suggests that there could also be a different affinity for FIZ1 between a CRX dimer and monomer. This is interesting in the context of the <italic>Rho </italic>promoter, where the potential CRX-dimer binding site (BAT-1) and the monomer-binding site (Ret-4) flank the NRE site.</p><p>What could be the benefit of two different CRX-binding sites in such a small region? There is evidence that several other proteins interact with CRX at the <italic>Rho </italic>promoter, including NRL, NR2E3 and BAF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Two CRX binding elements, binding in different stoichiometry, may provide a mechanism to have different CRX molecules participating in different protein interactions.</p><p>Our Co-IP and EMSA results indicated that FIZ1 might interact directly with CRX; therefore we explored this with yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays. Both assay methods confirmed the ability for a direct and stable interaction of FIZ1 and CRX <italic>in vitro</italic>. This suggests that FIZ1 has at least two interaction partners in photoreceptor neurons (NRL and CRX) that could recruit it into transcription factor complexes on photoreceptor specific genes. Multiple protein-protein interactions are consistent with our knowledge of other proteins that complex at the <italic>Rho </italic>promoter. CRX participates in interactions with NRL and NR2E3, resulting in activation of rod genes and repression of cone genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. NR2E3 also has multiple interactions, including CRX and the circadian clock protein NR1D1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>While we previously demonstrated that FIZ1 could modify NRL's transactivation potential at a <italic>PDE6B </italic>test promoter, it only modified transactivation potential at the <italic>Rho </italic>promoter when both NRL and CRX were present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. To examine FIZ1 effect on CRX, we used two test promoters that are activated by CRX, but not NRL: <italic>M- </italic>and <italic>S-Opsin </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Alone, FIZ1 effect on the activation of either promoter was insignificant compared to empty vectors. However, FIZ1 was able to modify CRX's transactivation potential at both test promoters by over 100% of the activity seen with CRX alone. It is possible that FIZ1's presence could influence the overall activation potential of promoter complexes involving CRX.</p><p>The scale of FIZ1's effect on CRX-mediated activation is biologically significant. Mature photoreceptors must continue to precisely regulate the average expression of genes like <italic>Rho </italic>to maintain viable photoreceptors. In mouse neural retina, Rhodopsin mRNA levels vary at least 25% in a circadian fashion, to coordinate with the rhythm of outer-segment formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Heterozygous knockout of <italic>Rho </italic>reduces its average expression by 50%, which results in a slow degeneration of photoreceptors. Likewise, transgenic mice with elevated expression of normal Rhodopsin, also have a slow photoreceptor degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>Developmentally, the increased availability of FIZ1 does concur with maturation of the neural retina and the activation of many photoreceptor-specific genes. While mRNAs for <italic>M- </italic>and <italic>S-Opsin </italic>are detected a few days earlier than for <italic>Rho </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], the initial formation of photoreceptor outer-segments of both rods and cones begins in the maturation period. This increases the demand for all three Opsin proteins as well as Pde6b, Arrestin, and other phototransduction proteins.</p><p>Test promoters are not perfect models for native gene promoters in their chromatin context, and FIZ1 can promote or inhibit NRL/CRX mediated activation of the <italic>Rho </italic>promoter <italic>in vitro</italic>, depending on the relative amount of FIZ1 compared to NRL and CRX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. With this in mind, it would be premature to state unequivocally whether FIZ1's role is that of promoting activation of these promoters <italic>in vivo</italic>, or if it may have a role in maintaining a precise level of their expression in the mature retina.</p><p>Our ChIP analysis indicates that FIZ1 is part of the regulatory protein complex on genes that become more active in adult photoreceptors. <italic>Rho </italic>is a fundamental marker of photoreceptor-specific gene expression; its expression increases dramatically as photoreceptor neurons mature to the adult state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Is there an increase in the relative quantity of FIZ1 recruited to the <italic>Rho </italic>promoter complex in the adult retina? This would be expected if a prior association of NRL and CRX recruits FIZ1. Relative association of FIZ1 at the <italic>Rho </italic>promoter region was 7-fold greater in adult neural retina (P-25), as compared to the immature tissue (P-3) when only a small fraction of photoreceptor precursors are starting to express <italic>Rho</italic>.</p><p>The increased association of FIZ1 at the <italic>Rho </italic>promoter also correlated with a 23-fold increase in the amount of actively transcribing Pol-II in adult neural retina (P-25) compared to the immature tissue (P-3). The total Pol-II associated with the <italic>Rho </italic>proximal-promoter region increases during maturation of the mouse retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. While the presence of Pol-II in the promoter region often correlates to transcription, it is possible for a gene to be pre-loaded with inactive Pol-II, as recently reported for many genes in human embryonic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Our assays here specifically monitored actively transcribing Pol-II (serine-2 phosphorylated) in intron-2, about 3 Kb downstream of the <italic>Rhodopsin </italic>gene's transcription start site.</p><p>The increased expression of several photoreceptor genes, during maturation of photoreceptors, certainly involves regulation at the level of transcription. Rhodopsin and Arrestin mRNA levels increase dramatically during this process, and this is documented in mammalian species that complete retinal development postnatal (mouse) or prenatal (bovine) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. A previous study of bovine retinal development, using nuclear run-on assays, suggested that elevated transcription has a prominent role during this maturation period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Our quantitative measurement of transcriptionally active Pol-II within the <italic>Rho's </italic>transcript region, confirms that the amount of activated Pol-II enzyme is elevated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Recently, Peng and Chen (2007) demonstrated that CRX and NRL are not present on the <italic>Rhodopsin </italic>promoter until the start of <italic>Rho </italic>expression, even though both transcription factors are abundant in rod-precursors before this time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This suggests that additional factors are involved with the formation of a stable regulatory protein complex on these promoters as the retina matures to the adult state. Our results suggest that FIZ1 is one of the additional proteins recruited by NRL and CRX to these transcription factor complexes, and both its bioavailability and association at the <italic>Rho </italic>promoter are increased substantially as the neural retina matures. While FIZ1 does not appear to be a direct transcriptional activator, it can significantly alter the CRX-mediated activation of cone Opsin promoters <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>In a mouse hematopoietic cell line, engineered to over express FLT-3 (FMN like tyrosine kinase) and FIZ1, FIZ1 association with FLT-3 was reported to increase upon receptor activation. While the downstream consequences are not known, those studies also found FIZ1 to be present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Our results here showing FIZ1 recruitment to gene promoter complexes, suggest a potential role in signal transduction between receptors and genes. While the expression of FIZ1 is ubiquitous in mammals, the reported interactions thus far are tissue specific. Additional tissue-specific interactions await discovery for organs not yet explored regarding FIZ1 function. The data gathered so far justifies the production of animal models for over and under expression of FIZ1, which will be required to explore its tissue-specific functions.</p><p>Q-ChIP was successfully applied to neural retina tissue to directly detect an increase in the transcriptionally active form of RNA-Polymerase-II moving through <italic>Rho's </italic>transcriptional region. This analysis provides a novel way to directly quantify the activation state of a gene in the context of neural development, and is applicable to any gene of interest. Finally, we note that the presence of FIZ1 in the nuclei of all mature retinal neurons suggests that FIZ1 may also be recruited to non-photoreceptor specific genes that become active in the adult retina. Further studies to find more target genes for the FIZ1 protein will shed light on this possibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>FIZ1: (Flt-3 Interacting Zinc-finger); NRL: (Neural Retina Leucine-zipper); CRX: (Cone-Rod homeoboX); <italic>Rho</italic>: (Rhodopsin); <italic>Pde6b</italic>: (Phosphodiesterase 6 beta subunit); NR2E3: (PNR/photoreceptor-specific nuclear receptor); <italic>Rpb3</italic>: (Inter-Retinoid Binding Protein); <italic>GluR6</italic>: (metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype-6); ChIP: (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation); FLT-3: (FMS like tyrosine kinase -3).</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RM carried out Co-IP, GST pull down, yeast two-hybrid, and EMSA experiments, participated in design and execution of transfection promoter assays, and drafted the manuscript with KM.
