The behaviour in yeast of plasmids containing Drosophila ARS elements was studied and compared to that exhibited by the archetypal yeast ARS-1 plasmid. ARS functions were localised by subcloning and BAL-31 deletion analysis. These studies demonstrated the structural and functional complexity of Drosophila ARSs. Each Drosophila ARS element has at least two domains, one essential for replication (the replication sequence, RS) and a second (the replication enhancer, RE) which is essential for maximum function of the RS. The RS of three Drosophila ARSs was shown to contain a sequence identical to an 11 bp yeast ARS consensus sequence (5' A/T TTTATPuTTT A/T 3'). These observations lend support to the hypothesis that heterologous ARS elements may be of biological significance.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00285-0291.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6633"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00285-0292.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6634"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00285-0293.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6635"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00285-0294.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6636"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00285-0295.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6637"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00285-0296.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6638"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00285-0297.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6639"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00285-0298.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6640"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00285-0299.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6641"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00285-0300.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6642"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00285-0301.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6643"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00285-0302.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6644"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00285-0303.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6645"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00285-0304.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6646"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00285-0305.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6647"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00285-0306.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6648"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
