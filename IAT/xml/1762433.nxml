Its transcriptional regulation is well understood. However, the mechanism underlying cyclin D1 ubiquitination and its subsequent degradation is not yet clear. We report that cyclin D1 undergoes increased degradation in the cytoplasm during S phase in a variety of cancer cells. This is mediated by phosphorylation at Thr286 through the activity of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade and the F-box protein FBXW8, which is an E3 ligase. The majority of FBXW8 is expressed in the cytoplasm during G1 and S phase. In contrast, cyclin D1 accumulates in the nucleus during G1 phase and exits into the cytoplasm in S phase. Increased cyclin D1 degradation is linked to association with FBXW8 in the cytoplasm, and enhanced phosphorylation of cyclin D1 through sustained ERK1/2 signaling. Depletion of FBXW8 caused a significant accumulation of cyclin D1, as well as sequestration of CDK1 in the cytoplasm. This resulted in a severe reduction of cell proliferation. These effects could be rescued by constitutive nuclear expression of cyclin D1-T286A. Thus, FBXW8 plays an essential role in cancer cell proliferation through proteolysis of cyclin D1. It may present new opportunities to develop therapies targeting destruction of cyclin D1 or its regulator E3 ligase selectively.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cyclin D1 regulates G1 progression in cancer cells and is overexpressed in various malignant neoplasms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000128-Malumbres1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Comparable data were obtained from SW480, U-2 OS, and T98 cells (not shown).</p><p>To confirm that cyclin D1 accumulation was due to increased cyclin D1 stability, we performed pulse-chase analysis on metabolically labeled-cyclin D1 after using siRNA to deprive HCT 116 cells of FBXW8, CUL1, or CUL7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000128-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>). Levels of metabolically labeled-cyclin D1 were estimated as described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000128-g004">Fig. 4G</xref>). Reducing FBXW8, CUL7 or CUL1 led to a stabilization of cyclin D1. The half-life of cyclin D1 was 27.8 min in control cell, and was extended by FBXW8, CUL7, or CUL1 siRNA treatment (T<sub>1/2</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;79.7, 58.7, or 46.2 min respectively). These data confirmed that accumulation of cyclin D1 through depletion of FBXW8, CUL1, or CUL7 was caused by increased cyclin D1 stability. We conclude that cyclin D1 stability is regulated by complexes containing FBXW8, through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Increased cyclin D1 degradation in cancer cells is linked to increased cyclin D1-E3 ligase association</title><p>We demonstrate that cyclin D1 undergoes increased degradation in the cytoplasm during S phase in a variety of cancer cells. We hypothesized that enhanced cyclin D1 degradation in S phase is associated with an increase in the association of E3 ligase with cyclin D1. To test this hypothesis, we determined the subcellular localizations of FBXW8 and cyclin D1 during the cell cycle in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000128-g004">Figs. 4H and I</xref>). HCT 116 cells were transfected with V5 epitope-tagged FBXW8. The cells were rendered quiescent 24 hours later by serum starvation for a period lasting a further 24 hours, and then stimulated by adding medium containing serum. This process allowed synchronization of cell cycle progression. Cell cycle profiles were determined by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000128-g004">Fig. 4I</xref>). At times corresponding to the G1 and S phases, cells were fixed and labeled with fluorescent V5 epitope tags and cyclin D1 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000128-g004">Fig. 4H</xref>). The majority of FBXW8 was expressed in the cytoplasm during G1 and S phase. In contrast, cyclin D1 accumulated in the nucleus during G1 phase and exited into the cytoplasm in S phase, in agreement with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000128-Diehl1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000128-Diehl2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000128-Baldin1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. The separation of FBXW8 and cyclin D1 during G1 phase suggested that ubiquitination and degradation of cyclin D1 is prevented in G1.

FBXW8 recognizes cyclin D1 through a WD40 repeat motif in an ERK/MAPK-mediated Thr286 phosphorylation-dependent manner. SKP1 interacts with FBXW8 together with CUL1 or CUL7 via a domain in the N-terminus of FBXW8, called F-box. CUL1 or CUL7 recruits RBX1, which in turn conscripts E2, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, to add a multiubiquitin chain to cyclin D1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0000128.g005"/></fig><p>A recent study demonstrated that cytoplasmically expressed cyclin D1 competes with nuclear cyclin D1 and translocates CDK4 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000128-Diehl3">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. The consequence is a growth arrest. We tested whether reduced cell proliferation due to knocking down FBXW8 expression is caused by cyclin D1 accumulation and subsequent cytoplasm sequestration of CDK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000128-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>).

We subsequently fractionated nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000128-g005">Fig. 5B</xref> shows that depleting FBXW8 caused cytoplasmic cyclin D1 accumulation. Cyclin D1 was mostly phosphorylated at Thr286, suggesting that cyclin D1 degradation is linked to enhanced phosphorylation of cyclin D1 by MAPK (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000128-g002">Figs. 2H&#x02013;K</xref>). This process resulted in relocalization of CDK1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

ERK/MAPK is a proline (Pro)-directed serine or threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000128-Macdonald1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Many proteins contain Ser/Thr-Pro sequences; however, most of them are not phosphorylated by ERK, suggesting that there is a strict relationship in ERK substrate specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000128-Bardwell1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. MAPK requires D-domains on the substrate to increase the efficiency of phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000128-Sharrocks1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. In this report, we identified a stringent D-domain at amino acids 179-193 of cyclin D1. Deleting this domain significantly reduced phosphorylation of cyclin D1 in cultured cells and dramatically inhibited ubiquitination of cyclin D1 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000128-g002">Figs. 2E and F</xref>), again demonstrating that ERK/MAPK plays a significant role in cyclin D1 regulation, as GSK3&#x003b2;, another proline-directed protein kinase responsible for cyclin D1 phosphorylation at Thr286, should not require the MAPK D-domain for phosphohrylation of its substrates. This possibility suggests that high levels of MAPK activity in cancer cells may make the requirement of GSK3&#x003b2; redundant for cyclin D1 phosphorylation at Thr286. We also found that similar D-domain sequences were conserved in cyclin D1s from mouse, rat, chicken, xenopus, and zebrafish. Alignment of cyclin D1 with other D-type cyclins has shown that Thr286 in cyclin D1 corresponds to Thr280 in cyclin D2 and Thr283 in cyclin D3 in their proximity to the carboxyl termini immediately followed by prolines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000128-Diehl1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000128-Diehl2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, we found very similar sequences of D-domains in the equivalent sites of cyclin D2 and cyclin D3. We therefore suggest that all D-type cyclins can be classified as ERK/MAPK substrates. In fact, cyclin D3 protein shows a very similar expression profile to cyclin D1 during cell cycle progression in colon cancer cells released from quiescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000128.s001">Figs. S1</xref> &#x0005b;H&#x0005d; and &#x0005b;I&#x0005d;).</p><p>We have also demonstrated that ERK/MAPK-mediated cyclin D1 degradation through FBXW8 is required for proliferation of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000128-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>). Our discoveries therefore suggest that the Ras/MAPK pathway may play an important role in neoplastic transformation through two distinct effects on cyclin D1 expression: the pathway turns on transcription in response to oncogenic signals via the MAPK signaling cascade, leading to accumulation of cyclin D1 and its assembly with CDK4/6. Progression into S phase requires removing cyclin D1 through relocalization and degradation. This process is initiated by sustained MAPK signaling, a feature unique to cancer cells. Thus, our results provide a better understanding of the roles of MAPK and cyclin D1 in cell cycle regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture, vectors, and site-directed mutagenesis</title><p>Cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.
