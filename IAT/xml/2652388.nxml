In mammals, two aggressive human cancers derive from tissues where ATOH1 instructs cell fate commitment, namely Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and colorectal cancer (CRC).

As MCC is a very rare cancer, only four samples were available for analysis. Seventy percent of the CRC samples show a significant decrease of <italic>ATOH1</italic> mRNA expression compared to tissue-matched colon samples from normal controls as analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR), suggesting that loss of <italic>ATOH1</italic> expression is a highly common feature of CRC oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g003">Figures 3</xref>F and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg004">S4</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>ATOH1</italic> mRNA levels are significantly lower in adenocarcinoma samples compared to adenomas (<italic>t-</italic>test: <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.017), indicating progressive loss of ATOH1 expression levels with increasing tumor severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g003">Figure 3</xref>A).

At least one deletion in the locus was detected in 57&#x00025; of the samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g003">3</xref>F).

Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array experiments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; on three samples did not show a deviation of the clones flanking the <italic>ATOH1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg005">Figures S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg006">S6</xref>), indicating that the deletions observed in patients are likely to be <italic>ATOH1</italic>-specific microdeletions. When only one copy is deleted, complete loss of gene function could be achieved by point mutations in the remaining allele. Sequencing of the <italic>ATOH1</italic> open reading frame of 24 samples, however, did not reveal any mutations in any of the samples (unpublished data). Together with the loss of <italic>ATOH1</italic> mRNA expression in patients, these results suggest that an epigenetic silencing mechanism may be involved&#x02014;a possibility we tested in further detail.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>The <italic>ATOH1</italic> Locus Is Methylated in CRC and MCC Patients</title><p>To address a putative epigenetic transcriptional silencing mechanism, we began by asking whether transcription could, in principle, be initiated from the <italic>ATOH1</italic> locus in cancer cells. <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila ato</named-content> and mouse <italic>Atoh1</italic> are both known to be autoregulatory &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. This provides the opportunity to test whether transcription could be activated from the <italic>ATOH1</italic> locus by ATOH1 itself in normal versus cancer cells. We took advantage of expressing the mouse ortholog in human cells to distinguish the expression of endogenous <italic>ATOH1</italic> from that of <italic>Atoh1</italic>. For the tests in human cancer cell lines, we used the MCC14.2 cell line, which is derived from MCC and has strongly reduced expression of <italic>ATOH1</italic>. Surprisingly, <italic>Atoh1</italic> overexpression failed to activate endogenous human <italic>ATOH1</italic> expression in the MCC14.2 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g003">Figure 3</xref>C), despite the virtually complete conservation of the two proteins. This may be due to a key difference between the two proteins, or to a possible disruption of the autoregulatory loop during oncogenesis. To test whether Atoh1 can activate <italic>ATOH1</italic> expression in normal noncancerous skin cells, we transduced normal human primary keratinocytes with an Atoh1 expression vector and tested the expression of endogenous <italic>ATOH1</italic> 40 h after lentiviral transduction. In contrast to the cancer cell lines, endogenous <italic>ATOH1</italic> is up-regulated 38-fold by Atoh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). This indicates that the expressability of the <italic>ATOH1</italic> locus is inhibited during oncogenesis.</p><p>Genomic database searches show that all known <italic>ATOH1</italic> orthologs, from human to <italic>Drosophila</italic>, reside in a CpG island covering at least the promoter and the transcription start site, suggesting that CpG methylation may be a mechanism of <italic>ATOH1</italic> loss of function. We therefore assayed all patient samples and both cell lines for <italic>ATOH1</italic> methylation using three independent assays: pull-down of methylated DNA, methylation-sensitive restriction digest, and methylation-specific PCR for bisulfite DNA modification. We found that up to 81&#x00025; of the patients, as well as both cell lines, show methylation of the <italic>ATOH1</italic> locus in both the coding sequence and the promoter sequences directly upstream of the ATG. In contrast, none of the control samples show <italic>ATOH1</italic> methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g003">Figures 3</xref>D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g003">3</xref>F, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg007">S7</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg007">S7</xref>C). This suggests that methylation is likely causal to the transcriptional silencing of the locus during oncogenesis as this is accompanied by lower <italic>ATOH1</italic> expression. In a few cases, however, the correlation was not observed. In two cases (samples 27 and 30), this may be due to the presence of a putative duplication, which is yet to be methylated. Alternatively, but not exclusively, it may be due to heterogeneity of the degree of methylation in different cells comprising the tumor samples analyzed. To provide evidence that methylation silences the <italic>ATOH1</italic> locus, we inhibited DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) with 5-azadeoxycytidine in the Ht29 cell line. This results in an approximately 8-fold increase in <italic>ATOH1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g003">Figure 3</xref>E). Thus, the <italic>ATOH1</italic> locus is methylated in cancer patients and derived cell lines, and this methylation can be reversed, resulting in the transcriptional reactivation of the locus. The autoregulatory function of <italic>ATOH1</italic> combined with the methylation of its regulatory sequences might hint to the involvement of <italic>ATOH1</italic> in the silencing of its own promoter. To gain some insight into whether this may indeed be the case, we asked whether Atoh1 can physically interact with Dnmt proteins. We tested the binding of Atoh1 to Dnmt1 (ENSG00000130816), Dnmt3a (ENSG00000119772), and Dnmt3b (ENSG00000088305) using GST pull-down assays. We find that Atoh1 binds to all three Dnmts. This is further supported by the ability of GST-Atoh1 to pull down DNA methyltransferase activity from nuclear extracts, similar to the positive control (EED: embryonic ectoderm development, ENSG00000074266) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. Focusing on Dnmt1, the maintenance DNA methyltransferase, we confirmed this observation using coimmunoprecipitation experiments in 293T cells transfected with HA-tagged Atoh1. Lastly, mapping experiments identified several regions of Dnmt1 as mediating the association with Atoh1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg008">Figure S8</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg008">S8</xref>D).</p><p>In summary, deletions and epigenetic silencing via methylation combine to cause loss-of-function mutations of the human <italic>ATOH1</italic> locus in primary human cancers.

Given the high deletion and methylation rate of ATOH1 in human tumor samples, loss of <italic>ATOH1</italic> function is likely to be an early event in these tumors.

In addition, cell type&#x02013;specific RTK differentiation genes are up-regulated upon overexpression of <italic>Atoh1</italic> in CRC and MCC cell lines. Importantly, these markers of differentiation are necessary for the anti-oncogenic effect of <italic>ato</italic>/<italic>ATOH1</italic>.</p><p>It is tempting to speculate that in other tissues, similar loss of differentiation factors is involved in oncogenesis. In this sense, the loss of differentiation factors has already been implicated in late stages of tumor progression as with GATA-3 (ENSG00000107485) in breast cancer &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;.

We, therefore, wonder whether loss of other differentiation factors, perhaps bHLH proteins, might play a role in earlier stages of breast cancer development.</p><p>Tumor suppressor genes are defined by the fact that (1) loss-of-function mutations make the cells more prone to malignant transformation, (2) overexpression leads to inhibition of the malignant phenotype, and (3) spontaneous somatic mutations are found in patients with cancer. &#x0201c;Classical tumor suppressor genes,&#x0201d; such as <italic>p53</italic> (ENSG00000141510), are special in the sense that when mutated, the cell is more prone to accumulate additional mutations, and thus actively drive malignant progression as opposed to just &#x0201c;taking away the brakes&#x0201d; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;.
