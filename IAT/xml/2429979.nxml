The four experimental groups were: (1) non-transfected/non ER stressed control; (2) non-transfected/ER stressed; (3) rAAV2-P58<sup>IPK</sup>-transfected/ER stressed; and (4) pGIPZ- P58<sup>IPK</sup> RNAi transfected/ER stressed. ER stress was induced by treating cells with tunicamycin. Expression of P58<sup>IPK</sup> was determined in transfected cells. Expressions of the following factors were assessed: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78).

P58<sup>IPK</sup> expression was not different between the control transfected cells (rAAV2-GFP and pGIPZ-GFP). Following ER stress, expression levels of ATF-4, GRP78, CHOP, and VEGF in cells overexpressing P58<sup>IPK</sup> were not different from those in unstressed control cells. This inhibitory effect of P58<sup>IPK</sup> on the expression of ER stress-related factors was suppressed in cells transfected with pGIPZ-P58<sup>IPK</sup> RNAi. Apoptosis was significantly increased in cells transfected with pGIPZ-P58<sup>IPK</sup> RNAi but not with rAAV2-P58<sup>IPK</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The study demonstrates that P58<sup>IPK</sup> inhibits ER stress and plays an important role in maintaining balance and stability of the ER in HRCECs.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is thought to be a contributing factor underlying many human diseases. In pathologic conditions, accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER can lead to ER stress or initiate the unfolded protein response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. If protein folding or degradation fails to occur in response, apoptotic pathways are initiated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>].</p><p>Studies in mice have indicated that ER stress can lead to islet cell apoptosis through induction of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and contribute to the development of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. ER stress has also been implicated as a mediator of diabetic retinopathy (DR), a major microvascular complication of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. Roybal and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>] reported that ER stress increases the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by activating the transcription factor 4 (ATF4) pathway. Further, Xu and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>] noted that both VEGF and protein kinase C expression were elevated in the early stages of DR using a rat model. These findings are significant as VEGF has been demonstrated to be involved in regulating a variety of pathologic changes associated with DR including neovascularization, vascular permeability, and thrombosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Given the evidence linking the development of DR with ER stress, it is pertinent to further elucidate the precise mechanisms/pathways involved so potential therapeutic interventions may be designed to treat/prevent DR by inhibiting ER stress.</p><p>P58<sup>IPK</sup>, a member of the Hsp40 family, was first discovered as an inhibitor of eukaryotic initiation factor 2&#x003b1; (eIF2&#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. Since this time, findings from several studies have indicated that P58<sup>IPK</sup> plays an important role in ER stress protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. For instance, Yan and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>] reported that decreases in P58<sup>IPK</sup> activity were associated with increased expression of several ER stress-inducible genes such as <italic>CHOP</italic>. It has also been demonstrated that mice lacking the <italic>P58<sup>IPK</sup></italic> gene exhibit gradual onset of glycosuria, hyperglycemia, and hypoinsulinemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. The number of &#x003b2;-cells in the islets of these mice was significantly reduced, and the expressions of a variety of apoptosis-related genes were increased. This suggests that an apoptosis pathway is activated in the absence of P58<sup>IPK</sup>, leading to a decrease in the number of &#x003b2;-cells and loss of functionality. The ER stress-inhibiting effects of P58<sup>IPK</sup> appear related to its capacity to inhibit phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1;, which is involved in eliciting the previously mentioned unfolded protein response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, no study has examined the relationship between P58<sup>IPK</sup> and ER stress in cells isolated from human eyes. Characterizing this relationship is important as it may help identify possible targets for pharmaceutical intervention (i.e., P58<sup>IPK</sup> modulation) in the treatment/prevention of DR. In the present study, we sought to examine the effects of P58<sup>IPK</sup> on ER stress in human retinal capillary endothelial cells (HRCECs) by assessing the expression of ER stress-related factors, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), ATF4, and CHOP. We also examined the possibility that P58<sup>IPK</sup> may be able to ameliorate diabetes-associated blood vessel damage by assessing changes in VEGF expression and cellular apoptosis. Our working hypothesis was that P58<sup>IPK</sup> would inhibit ER stress in HRCECs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Human retinal capillary endothelial cells culture and characterization</title><p>Donor eyes (12) were obtained from the Tongji Hospital Eye Bank.

In the early stages of DR, increased expression of CHOP, GRP78, and other factors closely correlate with apoptosis in retinal pericytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. Hence, it has been suggested that ER stress plays a key role in the initiation and development of DR.</p><p>Taking into account previously reported findings; we conducted a study of HRCECs transfected with P58<sup>IPK</sup> to examine the effects of P58<sup>IPK</sup> on the relief of ER stress (a mediator of diabetes and DR) and apoptosis. We found that HRCECs overexpressing P58<sup>IPK</sup> exhibited decreased expression of the ER stress-related factors, GRP78, ATF4, and CHOP, following ER stress. Importantly, when P58<sup>IPK</sup> expression was silenced by co-transfecting HRCECs with RNAi against P58<sup>IPK</sup>, the previously noted inhibition of ER stress was abolished i.e., expression of the aforementioned factors were increased. These findings suggest that P58<sup>IPK</sup> plays an important role in maintaining the balance and stability of the ER in HRCECs.</p><p>P58<sup>IPK</sup> is purported to be an important factor in maintaining balance within the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. In the present study, we demonstrated that when endogenous P58<sup>IPK</sup> expression was increased by transfection, expression of ATF4 and VEGF was decreased in HRCECs following ER stress. Given these findings, we speculate that P58<sup>IPK</sup> has the capacity to downregulate the activity of the ATF4/VEGF pathway during ER stress. We also noted that increased P58<sup>IPK</sup> expression was associated with decreased CHOP expression in HRCECs. Given that CHOP is an initiator of apoptosis, it is hardly surprising that apoptosis levels also decreased in cells that overexpressed P58<sup>IPK</sup>. With regards to the development of DR, the current findings lead us to suggest that enhanced P58<sup>IPK</sup> expression may help to decelerate or prevent the process of retinal vessel damage caused by upregulated VEGF expression.</p><p>In summary, to our knowledge, this is the first paper to describe the effects of P58<sup>IPK</sup> on ER stress in human retinal capillary endothelial cells in vitro. The results of the present study indicate that the overexpression of P58<sup>IPK</sup> in HRCECs can effectively ameliorate ER stress by inhibiting expressions of GRP78, ATF4, VEGF, and CHOP and decreasing apoptosis. Further study is warranted to clarify precisely how P58<sup>IPK</sup> interacts with VEGF-biologic pathways during ER stress. Confirmation of these findings using an in vivo animal model is also needed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the National Nature Science
