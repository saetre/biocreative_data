AlkB is a member of the non-heme iron (II) &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase superfamily, which removes the alkyl group through oxidation eliminating a methyl group as formaldehyde. We have developed a fluorescence-based assay for the dealkylation activity of this family of enzymes. It uses formaldehyde dehydrogenase to convert formaldehyde to formic acid and monitors the creation of an NADH analog using fluorescence. This assay is a great improvement over the existing assays for DNA demethylation in that it is continuous, rapid and does not require radioactively labeled material. It may also be used to study other demethylation reactions including demethylation of histones. We used it to determine the kinetic constants for AlkB and found them to be somewhat different than previously reported values. The results show that AlkB demethylates 1mA and 3mC with comparable efficiencies and has only a modest preference for a single-stranded DNA substrate over its double-stranded DNA counterpart.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA can be damaged by many endogenous and exogenous agents leading to mutations, disease or death. A major source of damage to DNA occurs from reaction with alkylating agents, endogenous sources of which include lipid peroxidation and exogenous sources include atmospheric halocarbons. These agents cause damage through nucleophilic additions to the nucleic acid bases and the phosphodiester backbone of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Cells contain multiple mechanisms for the repair of alkylation damage to DNA, including removal and replacement of the damaged nucleotides, and direct reversal of the damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). The importance of these repair activities is demonstrated by their conservation from bacteria to mammals.</p><p>The AlkB protein of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and its orthologs in other organisms, catalyzes the removal of alkyl groups from DNA through oxidation in the form of aldehydes and its major substrates are 1-methyladenine (1mA) and 3-methylcytosine (3mC). Additionally, it also repairs 3-methylthymine, 1-methylguanine, 1,<italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-ethenoadenine and 3,<italic>N</italic><sup>4</sup>-etheno cytosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6">4&#x02013;6</xref>). These lesions occur preferentially in single-stranded (SS) DNA due to the availability of affected atoms (N1 of purines and N3 of pyrimidines) to participate in S<sub>N</sub>2 type additions. In duplex DNA, these atoms are involved in Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairing and are inaccessible. AlkB is a member of the non-heme iron (II) &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase superfamily, which reverses alkylation damage to DNA through oxidation of the attached alkyl group creating a hydroxyalkyl intermediate that is unstable and decomposes to an oxidized alkylgroup (an aldehyde) and the regenerated base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The general scheme for this reaction is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Oxidative demethylation of DNA by AlkB coupled with FDH reaction. The demethylation#of 1mA or 3mC in DNA by AlkB and production of formaldehyde are shown schematically.

In the process, coenzyme NAD<sup>+</sup> is converted to NADH.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm1031f1"/></fig></p><p>Some of the previous assays developed to characterize the activity of AlkB class of DNA dealkylating enzymes have relied on gel electrophoresis of radiolabeled DNA, or analysis of non-radioactive DNA using HPLC or mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11 B12">8&#x02013;12</xref>). These methods are discontinuous, time-consuming, require special sample preparation and waste handling, and in some cases require highly specialized equipment. These assays have been used to determine some kinetic constants for AlkB and its orthologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>).</p><p>To facilitate studies of this important class of DNA repair enzymes, we developed a much simpler assay for DNA demethylation. This assay relies on the production of a fluorophore coupled to the repair of alkylation lesions in DNA by AlkB and is a significant modification of an assay developed to detect formaldehyde (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Demethylation of DNA by AlkB creates one formaldehyde molecule for every methyl group oxidized. Formaldehyde can then be oxidized to formate by formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FDH) and in the process coenzyme NAD<sup>+</sup> becomes reduced to NADH. Lizcano <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) monitored NADH production using its absorption at 340 nm, a wavelength at which NAD<sup>+</sup> does not show significant absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). This property has been used previously to detect production of formaldehyde in the AlkB reaction, but has not been used for quantitative studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). We have made two important changes to this assay, replacing NAD<sup>+</sup> with a more stable analog and using the fluorescence property of the reduced cofactor for quantifying the reaction. These and other changes have led to signal stability and greater sensitivity allowing us to use this assay for studies of enzyme kinetics. We have used this assay to determine the <italic>E. coli</italic> AlkB substrate preferences and kinetic constants for four different DNA substrates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and genomic DNA</title><p>HK82 [thr-1 araC14 leuB6(Am) DE(gpt-proA)62 lacY1 tsx-33 qsr&#x02032;-0 glnV44 galK LAM- Rac-0 hisG4(Oc) rfbC1 mgl-51 rpoS396(Am) rpsL31(strR) kdgK51 xylA5 mtl-1 argE3(Oc) thi-1 nalA alkB22] was a kind gift from M.

During this conversion NAD<sup>+</sup> is converted to NADH, and the latter molecule is usually detected based on its UV absorbance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In our experiments, we used APAD<sup>+</sup> instead of NAD<sup>+</sup> as the cofactor for FDH because of its higher redox potential leading to greater stability of the reduced form at various pHs and a higher extinction coefficient which contributes to greater sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). We also chose to use fluorescence properties APADH to develop the demethylation assay because of its greater sensitivity over UV absorbance by a factor of &#x0223c;30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Consequently, we were able to lower the amount of methylated DNA base used for the assay from several nanomoles&#x02014;for a typical UV-absorbance assay&#x02014;to subnanomole amounts. This allowed us to use synthetic oligonucleotides containing methylated bases in a defined sequence context as substrates for kinetic studies. Most previous studies have used randomly methylated poly-dA (or poly-dC) or DNAs containing both 1mA and 3mC for their assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Absorbance and fluorescence properties of APADH.

This is probably because FDH also acts on some alcohols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Tris contains three primary alcohol groups that may be converted to acidic form by FDH. To avoid the contribution of this reaction to background fluorescence, HEPES was used as buffering agent in the reactions instead of Tris. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Tris is a substrate for FDH.

This is the time period before the coupling reaction converts the product of the first reaction (formaldehyde, in this case) to the final product (formate). This can affect the measurement of initial rates. However a &#x02018;rule of thumb&#x02019; is that this lag period is negligible if a doubling of the coupling enzyme does not affect the rate of the overall reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). This was found to be the case under the conditions used here (data not shown). In addition, if the maximal velocity of the coupling enzyme (FDH here) is much greater than the enzyme being studied, the lag time becomes inconsequential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In this case, the high specific activity of FDH (&#x0003e;250 &#x000b5;mol formaldehyde oxidized min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) as compared with the specific activity for AlkB (&#x0003c;0.14 &#x000b5;mol min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) satisfies this criterion.</p><p>However, we found that commercially available preparations of FDH were not homogeneous and contained material that contributed to background fluorescence even when DNA and AlkB were omitted from the reaction (data not shown).

While this shows that the enzyme does not have a strong preference for any one of the substrates, it did show a small preference for 1mA over 3mC and SS DNA over DS DNA. These results are qualitatively similar to some of the reported substrate preferences for AlkB, but they do show some important differences from the previous reports.</p><p>Falnes and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) reported that AlkB prefers SS DNA over DS by a factor of 2 to 5. This conclusion was based on experiments where specific activity of AlkB was determined over a range of concentrations using DNA oligomers containing both A's and C's that were randomly labeled with <sup>3</sup>H-methyl groups. In contrast, we find that the ratios of catalytic specificities (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) of the enzyme for the SS DNA to DS DNA substrates is only 1.4 for the 1mA and 1.9 for 3mC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). It is possible that these differences in the conclusions from the two studies may reflect the differences in the base sequences of DNA used in the two studies. Additionally, we also note that the experiments reported by Falnes <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) were only semi-quantitative and hence the numbers presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> are likely to be more representative of substrate preferences of AlkB.</p><p>Koivisto and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) studied AlkB using a randomly methylated poly-dA substrate and reported <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values respectively to be 11.7 &#x000b1; 1.3 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 1.4 &#x000b1; 0.2 &#x003bc;M. This <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> value is &#x0223c;3-fold higher, while the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value is &#x0223c;4-fold lower than the values reported for SS 1mA-containing DNA we studied (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Thus the catalytic specificity of AlkB for methylated poly-dA substrate appears to be &#x0223c;11-fold higher than the 1mA-containing substrate used here. These differences may reflect sequence differences between the two DNAs, but may also be due to secondary structure differences. While the substrate we used is likely to form secondary structure through intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds, poly-dA cannot adopt such conformations. Thus the preference of AlkB for SS DNA may partly explain the differences between the two studies. Additionally, AlkB may act processively on substrates containing multiple methylated DNA bases. If so, the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme for demethylation of randomly labeled substrate would be higher than that containing a single methylated base such as the substrates used in our studies.</p><p>The results reported above add two additional useful insights into AlkB action. First, they show that both 1mA- and 3mC-containing DNA substrates are better substrates in SS form than DS form. Previous work on substrate specificity of AlkB have generally used DNAs containing more than one methylated base. Second, no catalytic constants have been reported for AlkB using a substrate containing 3mC as the only methylated base. The results reported here show that AlkB acts with roughly the same efficiency on the two methylated bases tested, regardless of whether they are in SS or DS form (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Summary and future prospects</title><p>We have presented here a new assay for DNA demethylating enzymes and illustrated its use by determining AlkB kinetic parameters. The assay uses subnanomole amounts of DNA substrate per reaction, is continuous, rapid and non-toxic. We have done preliminary experiments with human orthologs of AlkB, ABH2 and ABH3 and these experiments show that these enzymes should also be amenable to study using this technique (data not shown). The assay may be adapted to stopped-flow studies and hence should be particularly useful to study the reaction mechanism of this class of enzymes. It may also be used to study mutant enzymes or to study inhibitors of this class of DNA repair enzymes. We have also adapted this assay to 96-well microtiter plate reader (data not shown) and in this format it may be used for high-throughput analysis of demethylating enzymes or their mutants.</p><p>We note that this assay is not specific for enzymes that demethylate DNA. Oxidative demethylation of histones methylated at lysines can also generate formaldehyde (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), which can be detected using FDH and APAD<sup>+</sup> as described here. In fact Shi <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) used FDH and the generation of NADH to monitor the production of formaldehyde by the histone demethylase LSD1. However, they used UV absorption at 340 nm to quantify NADH. Instead, using APAD<sup>+</sup> and measuring fluorescence would improve the sensitivity and stability of this assay. Finally, many oxidative detoxification reactions in the liver also create formaldehyde and these enzymes could also be studied using the same assay. Thus the fluorescence-based assay for DNA demethylation described here may be adapted to the study of a wide variety of cellular enzymes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We would like to thank David Rueda (Wayne State University) for the use of his fluorescence spectrophotometer and the laboratory of Janusz Bujnicki for assistance in cloning <italic>alkB</italic><sup>+</sup> gene into the pET28 vector.
