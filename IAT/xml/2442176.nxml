Kainate receptor channels in which all of the subunits are in the edited (R) form exhibit strong inhibition by these compounds, whereas wild-type receptors that include a glutamine (Q) at the Q/R site in one or more subunits are resistant to inhibition. In the present study, we have performed an arginine scan of residues in the pore loop of the GluR6(Q) subunit. Amino acids within the range from &#x02212;19 to &#x0002b;7 of the Q/R site of GluR6(Q) were individually mutated to arginine and the mutant cDNAs were expressed as homomeric channels in HEK 293 cells. All but one of the single arginine substitution mutants yielded functional channels. Only weak inhibition, typical of wild-type GluR6(Q) channels, was observed for substitutions &#x0002b;1 to &#x0002b;6 downstream of the Q/R site. However, arginine substitution at several locations upstream of the Q/R site resulted in homomeric channels exhibiting strong inhibition by fatty acids, which is characteristic of homomeric GluR6(R) channels. Based on homology with the pore loop of potassium channels, locations at which R substitution induces susceptibility to fatty acid inhibition face away from the cytoplasm toward the M1 and M3 helices and surrounding lipids.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: AMPA, &#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid; AA, arachidonic acid; Con A, concanavalin A; DHA, docosahexaenoic acid; GluR6, glutamate receptor subunit 6; HEK, human embryonic kidney.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Glutamate receptor subunits combine to form tetrameric ion channels in the surface membrane of neurons and several other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dingledine et al., 1999</xref>). Pharmacology of native and recombinant receptors, as well as cDNA sequence analysis, indicates that the 14 homologous ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits contribute to three distinct receptor subfamilies, which are named for the agonists NMDA, &#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA), and kainate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dingledine et al., 1999</xref>). All of these subunits are thought to share the same transmembrane topology, with the agonist binding site formed by portions of the N-terminal domain and by an extracellular loop between the third and fourth hydrophobic segments, which span the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wollmuth and Sobolevsky, 2004</xref>). For several GluR subunits this agonist binding unit has been crystallized as a soluble fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armstrong et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mayer, 2005</xref>). Crystal structure for the transmembrane portion has not yet been reported, but its overall organization is thought to resemble an inverted potassium channel pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wo and Oswald, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wood et al., 1995</xref>). In particular, the M2 hydrophobic segment is believed to loop into the membrane from the cytoplasmic side in a manner similar to the extracellular pore loop of bacterial and mammalian K channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Panchenko et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuner et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>For both AMPA and kainate receptors, previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dingledine et al., 1999</xref>) demonstrated that RNA editing at a site within the channel pore controls ion permeation and channel pharmacology. The genes for all AMPA and kainate receptor subunits encode for a glutamine (Q) at this site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hollmann and Heinemann, 1994</xref>); however, mRNAs for AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 and kainate receptor subunits GluR5 and GluR6 can undergo editing at this location to encode for an arginine (R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sommer et al., 1991</xref>). Channels made up only of unedited subunits exhibit voltage-dependent block by intracellular and extracellular polyamines and are permeable to sodium, potassium, and calcium ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dingledine et al., 1999</xref>). In contrast, channels that include one or more edited subunits show reduced single channel conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Howe 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Swanson et al., 1996</xref>), reduced permeability to calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">K&#x000f6;hler et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burnashev et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">1996</xref>), and weaker block by polyamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowie and Mayer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kamboj et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>A variety of different ion channels are modulated by direct interactions with cis-unsaturated molecules, including arachidonic acid (AA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and endocannabinoids, which are derived from membrane phospholipids. In some cases, these lipid-derived mediators exert positive modulation, causing potentiation of channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fink et al., 1998</xref>), whereas other channels are strongly inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poling et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilding et al., 1998</xref>) or exhibit changes in their gating kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oliver et al., 2004</xref>) upon exposure to free AA or DHA. We have previously demonstrated that Q/R site editing controls susceptibility of kainate receptors to inhibition by cis-unsaturated fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilding et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast to block by polyamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowie and Mayer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kamboj et al., 1995</xref>), recombinant kainate receptors only display strong inhibition by fatty acids if all of the subunits are in the edited (R) form; channels that include unedited wild-type subunits resist fatty acid inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilding et al., 2005</xref>). To explore the basis for kainate receptor inhibition by fatty acids in more detail, we have substituted other amino acids at the Q/R site and generated a series of mutant GluR6(Q) subunits that include an arginine at other locations within the pore loop. Our results show that susceptibility to fatty acid inhibition does not require a positively charged side chain at the Q/R site, or anywhere else within the pore. Instead, our results suggest that vulnerability to fatty acid inhibition depends on the pore loop conformation, which can be modified by specific side chain replacements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>cDNA Constructs</title><p>Wild-type GluR6 cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Egebjerg et al., 1991</xref>), provided by S.

Despite recognized limitations on the speed of solution exchange in the whole cell mode (tau &#x0223c;5-15 ms), whole-cell recordings were used to analyze desensitization because of the small maximal current amplitude observed for a number of the mutant subunits.</p><p>Fatty acids stock solutions (50 mM) were prepared in DMSO and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C in aliquots under argon gas; fresh dilutions were prepared each day for recording.

Outside-out patches pulled from transfected HEK cells were superfused with external solution (160 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH to 7.4 with NaOH) containing either 0.1% BSA (control) or 30 &#x003bc;M kainate or 30 &#x003bc;M kainate plus 15 &#x003bc;M DHA. For most patches it was possible to cycle through these three solutions repeatedly, demonstrating that the currents evoked by kainate were reproducible and that the effect of DHA, if any, was consistent and reversible. Patches that exhibited unitary currents when equilibrated in control solution were discarded. Single channel currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200A amplifier in the patch (integrating) mode, filtered at 1&#x02013;2 kHz (&#x02212;3dB, 4 pole Bessel) and digitized at 10&#x02013;20 kHz. Patch recordings were analyzed with P-clamp (Axon instruments) to obtain distributions of unitary current amplitudes and open and shut durations. Sojourns with duration &#x0003e;200 &#x003bc;s were accepted as transitions between open and shut levels and dwell times were corrected by post-hoc interpolation. Amplitude histograms were fitted with Gaussians and the unitary current amplitude calculated from the difference between peaks. Histograms of the logarithm of open and shut durations were plotted using a square root transformation and normalization to the total event count. Distributions were fitted with a combination of exponential probability density functions. The minimal number of exponential components required for an adequate fit was determined by an F-test on residuals.</p><p>Consistent with previous work on GluR6(Q) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Swanson et al., 1996</xref>) and native kainate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith and Howe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gebhardt and Cull-Candy, 2006</xref>) agonist applications evoked channel openings to multiple subconductance levels for all of the mutant subunits tested. The T576R substitution was selected for detailed analysis because the majority of openings were to one main conductance level. Patches used for analysis displayed no more than two or three channels open simultaneously at any point during the recording. Open and shut periods were evaluated over 5&#x02013;10-s recording segments when it appeared that only one channel was active. Open periods included dwell time at any subconductance level, except the closed level.</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular Modeling</title><p>Sequence alignments and homology modeling were performed using the Modeller program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sali and Blundell, 1993</xref>) available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://salilab.org/modeller/modeller.html">http://salilab.org/modeller/modeller.html</ext-link>.

We first analyzed the specificity of the Q/R site to this effect by substituting glutamine (Q590) with the positively charged lysine (K), as in arginine (R), and with the negatively charged but similarly sized glutamate (E). We also tested an asparagine (N) substitution because an N resides at the homologous position of all NMDA receptor NR1 and NR2 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moriyoshi et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Monyer et al., 1992</xref>), and NMDA receptor-mediated currents are potentiated by AA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 1992</xref>) and DHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nishikawa et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>As illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, homomeric GluR6 Q590K channels resisted strong inhibition by DHA typical of GluR6(R), and instead displayed an intermediate level of inhibition, which was greater than observed for GluR6(Q) (P &#x0003c; 0.001) yet less than GluR6(R) (P &#x0003c; 0.0001) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;C</xref>).

Thus, an R side chain at the Q/R site yields stronger inhibition than other positive (K) or negative (E) substitutions.

Residues downstream of the Q/R site are thought to constitute the narrow selectivity filter, which is followed by a short cytoplasmic loop leading into the M3 transmembrane helix (Fig. S1 B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200810009/DC1">http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200810009/DC1</ext-link>). Among the downstream mutants tested, only the GluR6(Q) P597R mutant was inhibited by DHA. Sequence alignment indicates that a proline residue is highly conserved at this location among pore loop&#x02013;containing channels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), including all ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits and the majority of potassium-selective channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuner et al., 2003</xref>). Because structural constraints on proline bond angles might help to stabilize the pore loop configuration, we tested whether substitution of GluR6(Q) with an uncharged alanine residue at location 597 might also confer sensitivity to DHA. As described below (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), we observed that homomeric GluR6(Q) P597A channels displayed intermediate inhibition by DHA, weaker than observed for GluR6(Q) P597R but significantly stronger than for wild-type GluR6(Q). Thus, positive charge at location 597 is not required to allow for DHA inhibition.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Positive charge is not required for strong DHA inhibition.

Arginine substitutions at positions 4, 8, 11, 12, and 16&#x02013;19 residues upstream of the Q/R site showed no increased inhibition by DHA as compared with wild-type GluR6(Q), whereas replacing almost any of the other upstream amino acids (&#x02212;1 to &#x02212;15) with R resulted in inhibition that was essentially equivalent to wild-type GluR6(R) channels. Substitution of A587 or M589 (positions &#x02212;3 and &#x02212;1 relative to the Q/R site, respectively) yielded channels with an intermediate level of DHA inhibition. The upstream amino acids are believed to form a helix that begins &#x0223c;15 residues before the Q/R site, and which is preceded by a cytoplasmic loop arising from the end of TM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Panchenko et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuner et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, all of the locations at which R substitution failed to increase sensitivity to DHA are predicted to lie along one face of the pore loop helix (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Studies of accessibility to cysteine-modifying methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuner et al., 1996</xref>, 2001) indicate that this face of the helix is oriented such that these residues are accessible to modification and therefore likely to be exposed to the cytoplasm. Thus, R substitution enhances DHA inhibition at residues that point away from the cytoplasm, toward the transmembrane helices or surrounding lipids (Fig. S2), where they may alter the pore loop conformation in such a way as to render channels susceptible to modulation. Importantly, substitutions that allow for strong inhibition of GluR6(Q) are spread along the entire length of the predicted pore loop helix but do not extend far into the presumed cytoplasmic loop that precedes M2. These results raise the interesting possibility that the difference in DHA susceptibility between wild-type edited (R) and unedited (Q) channels may primarily reflect alterations in the overall conformation of the pore loop helices within the channel tetramer, rather than a specific interaction involving the side chain of the Q/R site.</p></sec><sec><title>Other Substitutions in the Pore Loop of GluR6(R) and GluR6(Q)</title><p>In a study of polyamine block of homomeric GluR6(Q) channels, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Panchenko et al. (2001)</xref> observed a substantial reduction in blocker affinity when alanine (A) was substituted for residues at several locations within the pore loop including F583, G592, and E594. Similarly, Williams and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Williams et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kashiwagi et al., 2002</xref>) observed changes in permeation and a reduction in Mg and organic ion block of NMDA receptors for substitutions at residues homologous to W582 and Q591. To begin testing whether these residues are important for fatty acid inhibition we prepared four mutant versions of the GluR6(R) subunit with single alanine substitutions at the following locations: W582A, F583A, G592A, and E594A (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). In contrast to polyamine block of GluR6(Q), which is dramatically reduced by all four of these substitutions (Panchenko et al., 2001), we observed only modest reduction in DHA inhibition of GluR6(R). Thus, substitutions that limit channel pore block by polyamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Panchenko et al., 2001</xref>) in GluR6(Q), or by Mg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Williams et al., 1998</xref>) and MK-801 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kashiwagi et al., 2002</xref>) in NMDA receptors, do not prevent inhibition of GluR6(R) by DHA.</p><p>Although W582A and F583A did not act as loss of function mutations for DHA inhibition of GluR6(R), we tested whether these same substitutions might induce gain of function for DHA inhibition of GluR6(Q). Importantly, alanine substitution for F583 resulted in strong inhibition of GluR6(Q) to a level comparable to GluR6(R) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), whereas W582A exhibited an intermediate level of inhibition and W582E, as for GluR6(Q) W582R (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), showed no increase in DHA inhibition. As noted above, alanine substitution at position P597 of GluR(Q) also yielded channels with intermediate inhibition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Collectively, these results show that insertion of positive charge within the pore loop helix is not required for strong inhibition by DHA. Because homomeric GluR6(Q) F581R yielded currents that were too small to test for DHA inhibition (see above), we also evaluated F581K and F581A. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, DHA did not affect currents mediated by GluR6(Q) F581A but inhibited F581K to the same extent as GluR6(R). Thus, replacing hydrophobic F581 with a positively charged lysine supports DHA inhibition similar to adjacent S580R and nearby F583R, whereas the smaller uncharged side chain of alanine is particularly conducive to DHA inhibition at location F583, with little or no effect when substituted at positions W582 or F581, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Editing Sites in M1</title><p>In addition to the Q/R site, GluR6 can be edited at two locations in the first transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">K&#x000f6;hler et al., 1993</xref>).

To test whether the naturally occurring V536I or C540Y substitutions could affect susceptibility to fatty acid inhibition, we prepared single point mutations of GluR6(R) and GluR6(Q). As shown in Fig. S3, neither of the substitutions reduced DHA inhibition of GluR6(R) or increased inhibition of GluR6(Q), suggesting that in vivo editing at these locations will have little effect on channel modulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Lack of Correlation between Permeation Properties and DHA Inhibition</title><p>As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 (C and E)</xref>, differences in rectification induced by amino acid substitutions at the Q/R site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Panchenko et al., 1999</xref>) did not correlate with susceptibility to DHA.

Although several of the R substitution mutants of GluR6(Q) displayed reduced rectification relative to wild-type GluR6(Q), there was no significant correlation between rectification and relative inhibition by DHA. These results indicate that sensitivity to DHA is totally unrelated to configurations of the channel that allow for pore occupancy by polyamines, which is the mechanism of inward rectification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowie and Mayer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kamboj et al., 1995</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Permeation properties do not correlate with DHA inhibition.

Wild-type GluR6(R), which is permeable to Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burnashev et al., 1996</xref>), and five additional mutants (GluR6 Q590K and the W582A, F583A, G592A, and E594A substitutions of GluR6(R)) displayed a &#x0002b;5 to &#x0002b;58-mV shift in reversal potential when glucuronate was substituted for external chloride. This change is consistent with reduction in net outward current by elimination of inward flux of negatively charged chloride ions. Importantly, every channel with positively charged side chains at the Q/R site, and only these channels, exhibited a positive shift in reversal potential upon glucuronate substitution. In contrast, glucuronate substitution shifted the reversal potential for GluR6(Q) and all of the other mutants by &#x02212;1 to &#x02212;36 mV relative to extracellular NaCl, possibly owing to reduced Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> activity in equimolar glucuronate relative to Cl. Taken together, these results demonstrate that susceptibility to DHA inhibition does not depend on the ability of the channel to conduct chloride ions. In addition, our results suggest that a positively charged side chain at the Q/R site is particularly effective in supporting chloride permeation relative to any other location within the pore loop.</p></sec><sec><title>DHA Inhibition Correlates with the Mean Amplitude of Whole-Cell Current</title><p>In contrast to the lack of correlation between DHA inhibition and channel rectification or chloride permeation, we observed a significant negative correlation between inhibition by DHA and the mean amplitude of control whole-cell current, recorded before DHA was applied. As mean control current increased, relative inhibition by DHA decreased (Fig. S4 B). One possible way to explain this relation would be if inhibition was reduced in cells with very large currents because the number of channels exceeded the effective local concentration of DHA within the membrane. To test this possibility, we asked whether inhibition by DHA was correlated with control current amplitude on a cell-by-cell basis for each mutation. As illustrated in Fig. S4 C, there was no consistent relationship between the amplitude of control current and the extent of DHA inhibition among all of the cells expressing a specific cDNA construct. For the 41 genotypes tested, one mutation displayed significant negative correlation (GluR6(Q) M596R) whereas three were positively correlated (GluR6(R) W582A, GluR6(Q) V571R, and L577R); correlation in the remaining 37 genotypes was not significant (P &#x0003e; 0.05) (Fig. S5). These results suggest that inhibition by DHA does not depend on the absolute number of channels in the membrane, which most likely underlies the range of current amplitudes for any given subunit genotype; but, they leave open the possibility that subunits that are susceptible to DHA may, on average, be expressed at lower density. Because whole-cell current amplitude (I) is the product of channel number (N), unitary current (i), and open probability (p<sub>o</sub>): I &#x0003d; i &#x000d7; N &#x000d7; p<sub>o</sub>, differences in mean current amplitude from one substitution mutant to the next could reflect differences in i, p<sub>o</sub>, N, or some combination of these parameters.</p></sec><sec><title>Fluctuation Analysis</title><p>Homomeric GluR6(R) receptors have a very low estimated unitary conductance (&#x0223c;225&#x02013;260 fS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Howe, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Swanson et al., 1996</xref>), which precludes a detailed single channel analysis of DHA inhibition at wild-type receptors. To gain insight into the underlying differences between channels that were susceptible versus resistant to inhibition by DHA, we used analysis of whole-cell current fluctuations evoked by a saturating concentration of kainate to estimate the unitary current amplitude, open probability, and N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huettner, 1990</xref>). For several of the substitution mutants, we evaluated kainate-evoked current fluctuations both in control external solution and after equilibration with DHA. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> presents a representative example from the GluR6(Q) T576R substitution mutant of currents recorded before (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>) and after (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>) exposure to DHA. The plot of variance versus mean current (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>), and the summary plots for the other constructs tested (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), provides evidence for several important conclusions. First, exposure to DHA does not reduce the estimated unitary conductance but does significantly lower the estimated open probability to an extent sufficient to account for the reduction in whole-cell current amplitude by DHA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). This result supports the idea that DHA primarily affects channel gating, not the flux of ions through channels that are open. Second, the majority of GluR6(Q) substitution mutants, including many that are strongly inhibited by DHA, exhibit estimated unitary conductance levels that are significantly larger than wild-type GluR6(R) channels. This result indicates that susceptibility to DHA inhibition is not restricted to channels with small unitary conductance typical of wild-type GluR6(R). Third, comparison of the estimated i and <italic>N</italic> values for GluR6(R) to the R substitution mutants of GluR6(Q) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, A&#x02013;C</xref>) suggests that for these two parameters GluR6(R) more closely resembles the mutants with substitutions downstream in the loop that forms the selectivity filter than mutants with substitutions in the upstream helix. Thus, GluR6(R) and GluR6(Q) Q591R and E594R display the lowest estimated unitary conductance and the highest estimated number of channels. In contrast, upstream R substitutions in the pore helix that confer susceptibility to DHA inhibition are predominantly associated with lower estimated channel numbers and higher estimated unitary conductance values than adjacent substitutions that resist inhibition by DHA.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Inhibition by DHA is not restricted to channels with low unitary conductance.

Without Con A exposure, both GluR6(Q) and GluR6(R) homomeric receptors exhibit rapid and nearly complete desensitization. In addition, our previous work has shown that inhibition by DHA displays similar selectivity for the R versus the Q form of homomeric receptors when evaluated with or without Con A treatment, although the potency of DHA inhibition appears to be somewhat higher at receptors that have not been exposed to Con A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilding et al., 2005</xref>). To test whether any of the pore loop substitution mutations altered receptor desensitization and whether inhibition by DHA was correlated with the time course of current absent modification by Con A, we used rapid solution exchange to apply brief pulses of 300 &#x003bc;M kainate to transfected HEK cells that were not treated with Con A. As illustrated in Fig. S6 A, the different substitution mutant receptors desensitized at different rates and to different steady-state current levels. The summary plots in Fig. S6 (B&#x02013;D) indicate that no significant correlation exists between susceptibility to DHA and either the onset or the steady-state level of desensitization.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have used scanning mutagenesis to analyze the structural requirements for kainate receptor inhibition by the omega-3 fatty acid DHA. Our experiments focused on homomeric channels formed by wild-type or mutant versions of the GluR6 subunit expressed in HEK cells. In previous work, we showed that inhibition of wild-type receptors by DHA depends on mRNA editing at the Q/R site within the channel pore. Unedited subunits (Q590) resist inhibition, whereas channels in which all subunits derive from edited RNA (R590) are strongly inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilding et al., 2005</xref>). Other investigators have shown that NMDA receptors, which have an asparagine (N) at the position homologous to the Q/R site, are potentiated by exposure to AA or DHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nishikawa et al., 1994</xref>). Our results in the present study support a number of different conclusions about the structural basis and mechanism of channel modulation by DHA. First, our experiments show that the presence of an N at position 590 is not sufficient for potentiation by DHA. Second, we find that strong inhibition by DHA is not precluded by the presence of a Q at this location and does not require the presence of a positively charged side chain at position 590 or at any other location within the pore. Thus, modulation cannot be explained by a simple interaction between DHA and the side chain at position 590. Instead, as discussed below, our results support the idea that susceptibility to inhibition by DHA likely depends on the conformation of the pore loop helix relative to the adjacent M1 and M3 transmembrane helices. In addition, our whole-cell fluctuation analysis and single channel recordings indicate that exposure to DHA does not reduce unitary conductance but significantly decreases channel open probability.</p><sec><title>Pore Helix Conformation</title><p>By systematically introducing R substitutions at each residue of GluR6(Q) from V571 to P597 we detected a periodic pattern in the locations that confer susceptibility to DHA inhibition in the 15 amino acids immediately upstream of the Q/R site. Based on homology between glutamate receptors and potassium channel subunits this segment of the GluR6 pore loop is believed to form an &#x003b1; helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Panchenko et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuner et al., 2003</xref>). All of the upstream substitutions that allow for DHA inhibition of GluR6(Q) can be arranged along one side of this helix, while locations where R substitutions do not promote inhibition lie along the opposite side. In addition to structural predictions from homology modeling, previous analysis of NMDA and AMPA receptor subunits by the substituted cysteine accessibility method provides evidence about the orientation of the pore loop helix within channels of the glutamate receptor family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuner et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2001</xref>). Modification by methanethiosulfonate reagents applied from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane is restricted to cysteines substituted along one face of the upstream helix at positions &#x02212;3 to &#x02212;4, &#x02212;7 to &#x02212;8, &#x02212;12 and &#x0003e;&#x02212;14 relative to the Q/R site, essentially the same locations where R substitution fails to promote inhibition by DHA. Collectively, these results argue that this side of the helix faces away from the transmembrane helices that form the outer wall of the channel, and that R substitution along this face may have less of an impact on the pore loop conformation. In contrast, upstream locations where R substitutions confer susceptibility to DHA appear to be oriented away from the cytoplasm, toward the adjacent segments of M1 and M3 and the surrounding lipids (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> and Fig. S2). In these locations either the size or the charge of the arginine side chain apparently perturbs the pore loop conformation in a way that is similar to the change introduced by Q to R editing at location 590. Understanding how this change in pore loop conformation translates into a difference in susceptibility to inhibition by DHA will require further study. A variety of evidence points to dynamic conformational changes in the pore loops of potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cordero-Morales et al., 2007</xref>) and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu and Siegelbaum, 2000</xref>) that are thought to underlie physiological alterations in channel conductance or gating. Differential sensitivity of pore loop conformational changes to the local lipid environment could potentially explain the selective inhibition by DHA of wild-type GluR6(R), and the susceptible substitution mutants of GluR6(Q).</p><fig position="float" id="fig9"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Substitutions that confer susceptibility to DHA lie along one face of the pore loop helix.

Functionally as well, the Q/R site appears to represent a transition point for several different aspects of channel operation. First, maximal whole-cell current was more severely reduced by substitutions at upstream locations, particularly those that conferred DHA susceptibility, than for wild-type editing to R590 or by R substitution at the &#x0002b;1 to &#x0002b;6 positions. Second, the unitary conductance and number of channels estimated from fluctuation analysis displayed an inverse relationship for upstream and downstream substitutions. As a group, the upstream substitutions exhibited relatively higher estimated conductance and lower channel number, whereas the opposite was true for GluR6(R) and the next six downstream R substitutions. Third, DHA inhibition of GluR6(Q) is entirely unaffected by R substitutions at the six downstream residues, yet strong inhibition results from substitution at the majority of locations up to 15 positions upstream. In this respect, wild-type edited GluR6 R590 matches the phenotype for upstream substitution, whereas in the other properties, channels with R at position 590 more closely resemble the downstream substitution mutants.</p><p>In addition to this transition in properties, there are some respects in which the Q/R site appears to be unique when compared with adjacent residues either upstream or downstream. For example, among the 39 subunits that we tested only those with positively charged R or K at position 590 displayed apparent permeability to chloride ions, as evidenced by a positive shift in reversal potential upon exchange of extracellular glucuronate for chloride. All six of the subunits with positive charge at position 590 shared this property. Positively charged R or K side chains extending from this location at the tip of each pore loop may have a greater impact on anion stability in the central cavity of the channel, possibly by counteracting the negative pore helix dipoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>), than would charged residues upstream or downstream of the apex.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of Mutant Channels</title><p>Structure&#x02013;function studies of potassium channels have shown that many pore loop substitutions result in a loss of functional channel expression. Some point mutations in the pore loop disrupt subunit tetramerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heginbotham et al., 1997</xref>), whereas in other cases channels are delivered to the cell surface, as determined by voltage-dependent gating charge movement, but potassium ion conduction through the pore is eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Perozo et al., 1993</xref>). Glutamate receptor channels appear to tolerate a larger repertoire of substitutions, possibly owing to their larger pore dimensions. Estimates of pore size at the selectivity filter based on permeation of organic cations suggest a diameter of &#x0223c;5.5 &#x000c5; for NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Villarroel et al., 1995</xref>), 7.5&#x02013;7.6 &#x000c5; for both Q and R forms of kainate receptors and &#x0223c;7.8 &#x000c5; for AMPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burnashev et al., 1996</xref>). In contrast, potassium channels exhibit a narrower pore diameter of &#x0223c;3 &#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hille, 2001</xref>). With some notable exceptions, single amino acid substitutions involving small or hydrophobic side chains in the pore loops of NMDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Williams et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kashiwagi et al., 2002</xref>), AMPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuner et al., 2001</xref>), and kainate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Panchenko et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2001</xref>) receptor subunits yield functional channels. On the other hand, cation-selective cyclic nucleotide-gated channels have an estimated pore diameter in the range of 5.8 to 6.4 &#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goulding et al., 1993</xref>), yet scanning mutagenesis of bovine rod cGMP-gated channels revealed that cysteine substitution abrogated channel expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sun et al., 1996</xref>) or dramatically reduced open probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becchetti and Gamel, 1999</xref>) at more than half of all pore loop residues. Therefore, pore size alone may not entirely explain the ability of glutamate receptors to tolerate side chain substitutions.</p><p>Before undertaking our scan we were concerned that the larger size and positive charge of the arginine side chain might be tolerated less well than smaller or more hydrophobic residues. Indeed, homomeric tetramerization of AMPA receptor subunits is known to be disfavored by the presence of R at the Q/R site or at several other positions in the pore loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greger et al., 2003</xref>), providing an explanation for the meager current amplitude when GluR2(R) is expressed alone (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burnashev et al., 1996</xref>). In addition, R substitution at position M589 of GluR6, or at several locations in AMPA receptor subunits GluR1 (M located &#x02212;1 relative to the Q/R site) or GluR3 (M and A, &#x02212;1 and &#x02212;3 residues relative to the Q/R site, respectively), was shown to exert a dominant-negative phenotype. The mutant subunits exhibited very little current when expressed alone and suppressed currents mediated by wild-type subunits in neurons and in cotransfected heterologous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dingledine et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Robert et al., 2002</xref>). Our results are broadly consistent with these earlier studies. Several of the R substitution mutants, particularly those susceptible to DHA inhibition, displayed lower maximal whole-cell current amplitudes and lower estimated channel number than for wild-type GluR6(Q), suggesting reduced delivery or stability of these channels at the plasma membrane. Following treatment with Con A we were able to record sufficient current to analyze DHA inhibition for all but one of the R substitutions (F581R), however we noted that for several of the mutants (F575R, S580R, F581R, G584R, M589R, and P597R) kainate evoked very little current (&#x0003c;100 pA) without prior exposure to Con A (compared with &#x0003e;200 pA for all but F581R after Con A). Importantly, this trend for smaller currents does not hold for homomeric channels formed by wild-type edited subunits or for unedited subunits with R substitutions at positions 591&#x02013;596. Cells expressing GluR6(R) display robust kainate-evoked currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Partin et al., 1993</xref>) and our fluctuation analysis indicates a higher level of surface expression for GluR6(R) than for GluR6(Q), suggesting that future experiments to examine the trafficking of edited, unedited, and mutant versions of GluR6 should be informative.</p></sec><sec><title>Lipid&#x02013;Protein Interactions</title><p>It is not yet known exactly how the functional properties of ion channels and other membrane proteins are regulated by AA and DHA or by other lipid-derived modulators such as lysophospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patel et al., 2001</xref>). Mechanisms involving relatively large-scale deformations such as changes in elasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bruno et al., 2007</xref>), curvature, and lateral tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patel et al., 2001</xref>) have been proposed to account for the gating of mechanosensitive channels as well as for the modulation of NMDA receptors by DHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Casado and Ascher, 1998</xref>). On the other hand, a variety of studies suggest that bulk lipids exert substantially less influence on the function of membrane proteins than do annular lipids, which directly surround and contact the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Powl and Lee, 2007</xref>). Crystal structures of bacterial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Valiyaveetil et al., 2002</xref>) and mammalian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Long et al., 2007</xref>) potassium channels include partially resolved lipids, indicating that close interactions with the protein surface are sufficient to constrain the inherent disorder of alkyl chains. Indeed, detergent-purified KcsA channels include phosphatidylglycerol in contact with the pore helix and downstream M2 helix at the interface between each subunit. In addition, the presence of phospholipid is required for proper refolding of fully denatured KcsA subunits, and negatively charged phospholipids are necessary for functional reconstitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Valiyaveetil et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, specific lipid interactions can have a direct impact on the structural integrity and operation of channel proteins.</p><p>Neuronal membranes are particularly rich in lipids that include cis-unsaturated fatty acyl chains, typically at the sn-2 position. Studies of synaptosomes and retinal membranes indicate &#x0003e;30% DHA content in gray matter phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Salem et al., 2001</xref>). Recent molecular modeling studies highlight the dynamic flexibility of DHA relative to saturated alkyl chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zimmerberg and Gawrisch, 2006</xref>), which may underlie the preferential ability of DHA-containing lipids to conform to the uneven outer surface of membrane-embedded proteins and to modify associations between adjacent helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grossfield et al., 2006</xref>). The physiological effects of free DHA, whether delivered experimentally or liberated by endogenous phospholipase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farooqui et al., 2006</xref>), may result from displacement of annular lipids or from a distinct mode of association that cannot be attained when DHA is constrained as part of an intact lipid molecule.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to David Sept for advice on homology modeling, to Colin Nichols, Decha Enkvetchakul, and Fernanda Laezza for critical reading of the manuscript, to Steve Heinemann for providing channel subunit cDNAs, and to David Clapham for L3T4 cDNA.</p><p>This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NS30888).</p><p>Olaf S.
