The anti-apoptotic effects of these factors are mediated by their influence on the balance of expression and localisation of pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. Among the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, the expression level of Bcl-2 itself and its interaction with the pro-apoptotic protein Bim are now regarded as crucial for the regulation of survival in activated T cells. We studied the changes in Bcl-2 levels and its subcellular distribution in relation to mitochondrial depolarisation and caspase activation in survival factor deprived T cells. Intriguingly, the total Bcl-2 level appeared to remain stable, even after caspase 3 activation indicated entry into the execution phase of apoptosis. However, cell fractionation experiments showed that while the dominant nuclear pool of Bcl-2 remained stable during apoptosis, the level of the smaller mitochondrial pool was rapidly downregulated. Signals induced by anti-apoptotic cytokines continuously replenish the mitochondrial pool, but nuclear Bcl-2 is independent of such signals. Mitochondrial Bcl-2 is lost rapidly by a caspase independent mechanism in the absence of survival factors, in contrast only a small proportion of the nuclear pool of Bcl-2 is lost during the execution phase and this loss is a caspase dependent process. We conclude that these two intracellular pools of Bcl-2 are regulated through different mechanisms and only the cytokine-mediated regulation of the mitochondrial pool is relevant to the control of the initiation of apoptosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Bcl-2</kwd><kwd>Cytokines</kwd><kwd>Survival</kwd><kwd>Lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>Programmed cell death</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the absence of external survival signals activated T cells enter apoptosis spontaneously. Anti-apoptotic signals include cytokines such as Type I interferons, IL-6 and those that signal through the common &#x003b3; chain (IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-15 and IL-21) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Several lines of evidence suggest that commitment to apoptosis under conditions of survival signal deprivation occurs in mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential is associated with the release of pro-apoptotic factors including cytochrome c. This complexes with pro-caspase 9, ATP and the adapter protein APAF to form the apoptosome, which cleaves and activates executioner caspases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins regulate entry to apoptosis by regulating mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This family includes pro-apoptotic molecules such as Bax, Bad, Bak, Bim, Puma, Noxa and Bid, and anti-apoptotic molecules, such as Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, A1, Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 itself, which are upregulated by anti-apoptotic cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. One current model suggests that the main role of Bcl-2 lies in counterbalancing the pro-apoptotic signal induced by the cooperation of Bim with either Bax or Bak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Alternative explanations for the pro-apoptotic role of Bim involve mechanisms that are independent of binding Bax and Bak at the mitochondrial level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. All of these models however assume a key role for the interaction of Bim with Bcl-2. Bim and Bcl-2 appear to from stable complexes directly on the mitochondrial surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Loss of Bcl-2 rather than an increase in the level of Bim levels is thought to be the triggering process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Cleavage of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x by caspases during the execution phase of apoptosis can generate cleavage products that facilitate apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Reduced transcription of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members is thought to be a trigger for apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, previous reports have suggested that the level of Bcl-2 is very stable in murine T cells during cytokine deprivation-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In these reports, the total level of Bcl-2 in whole cell lysates was studied, but the location of Bcl-2 within the cell was not. Several groups have shown that Bcl-2 is found in sites other than the mitochondria, with a large proportion in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In the present study, we report changes in the intracellular location of Bcl-2 during the entry of activated T cells into apoptosis following cytokine withdrawal. The smaller mitochondrial pool of Bcl-2 is lost early, during commitment to apoptosis, in a caspase independent manner. It is this mitochondrial pool that is actively regulated by anti-apoptotic cytokines. In contrast, the larger nuclear pool is actively cleaved by caspases during the execution phase of apoptosis and is not involved in the initiation of this process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>T cell culture and stimulation</title><p>Non-transformed CD4<sup>+ve</sup> T cell lines were generated by phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation of CD4<sup>+ve</sup> T cells isolated by negative selection from the peripheral blood of normal individuals as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].

We analysed the time course of activation of caspase 3 in relation to the changes of Bcl-2 expression in this experimental system by western blotting (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). In parallel experiments mitochondrial depolarisation and caspase 3 activation were assessed by flow cytometry (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Activation of caspase 3 and mitochondrial depolarisation showed a maximal rate of change between 4&#x000a0;h and 12&#x000a0;h. This corresponded well with the appearance of the cleaved form of caspase 3 and loss of the pro-form of caspase 3. The active fragment of caspase 3 was detected as a faint band at 4&#x000a0;h and as a strong band at 8&#x000a0;h. Members of the Bcl-2 family are thought to regulate T cell apoptosis at the mitochondrial level. Induction of expression of Bcl-2 by cytokines signalling through the shared &#x003b3;-chain of the IL-2 receptor is an important regulator of T cell survival. The changes in Bcl-2 expression following survival factor withdrawal were investigated by western blotting. Intriguingly, whilst low levels of the cleavage product of Bcl-2 were detectable after 8&#x000a0;h, levels of intact Bcl-2 remained largely unchanged over time. These experiments suggested that a significant loss of Bcl-2 did not precede mitochondrial depolarization and caspase 3 activation.</p><p>The caspase inhibitor ZVAD.fmk was used to test if the appearance of the short form of Bcl-2 was caspase-dependent. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a the appearance of the short form of Bcl-2, within 12&#x000a0;h of cytokine withdrawal, was efficiently blocked by the caspase inhibitor. Loss of the full-length form of Bcl-2 was only apparent at the latest time point (48&#x000a0;h) and the caspase inhibitor had little effect on this. The effect of the caspase inhibitor on mitochondrial depolarisation is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b. There was a minor delay of mitochondrial depolarisation at the earlier time points, but by 48&#x000a0;h no effect of caspase inhibition on mitochondrial depolarisation was observed. The efficiency of caspase 3 inhibition under these culture conditions was tested by assessing the enzymatic activity of caspase 3 in lysates of the T cells. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c shows that at all time points investigated, ZVAD.fmk effectively blocked caspase 3 activation. These data are consistent with a model of T cell apoptosis in which detectable loss of overall Bcl-2 does not play a key role in the regulation of mitochondrial integrity, because it is lost only after mitochondrial depolarisation has taken place. At this stage the cells have fully activated caspase 3 and have entered the execution phase of apoptosis.</p><p>The anti-apoptotic role of Bcl-2 may be restricted to specific sites within the cell. To test this hypothesis, T cells were fractionated by centrifugation at different g/forces into the nuclear, cytosolic, light membrane and heavy membrane fractions. The heavy membrane fraction contained most of the mitochondrial membrane, while the light membrane fractions contained the plasma membrane. The efficiency of fractionation was tested by western blot detection of marker proteins characteristic of the respective fractions. Lamin B, a constituent of the nuclear envelope was exclusively found in the nuclear fraction. Actin was found in the cytosolic fraction, and TIM 23 a mitochondrial membrane transporter protein was detected in the heavy membrane, or mitochondrial fraction. Pan-cadherin, a molecule expressed on the plasma membrane was found in the light membrane fraction (data not shown). The majority of the cellular Bcl-2 was detected in the nuclear fraction (ca. 60%, by densitometric analysis of western blots). The mitochondrial fraction contained about 30% of the cellular Bcl-2 and a minor amount was detected in the cytosolic fraction. In the experiment shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, T cells were fractionated after deprivation of survival factors. Intriguingly, the cleaved fragment of Bcl-2 was only detected in the nuclear fraction, a consistent finding throughout all fractionation experiments performed in this study. This cleavage product appears to be very susceptible to proteolytic degradation as it appeared as a single band in the experiments in which we directly lysed the cell pellets in SDS-PAGE running buffer, while multiple bands became apparent in the samples after the fractionation process.</p><p>A striking observation was that while the level of full length nuclear Bcl-2 remained stable for the duration of the experiment, the level of mitochondrial Bcl-2 decreased at an early stage following cytokine deprivation. This loss of Bcl-2 from the mitochondrial fraction was clearly seen as early as 6&#x000a0;h and therefore coincided with the sharp increase in mitochondrial depolarisation and caspase 3 activation. These observations suggest that while no obvious change occurred in the total level of Bcl-2 within the cell (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) there was an early loss of Bcl-2 from the mitochondrial fraction, which was masked by the stability of the larger nuclear pool. While the SDS-PAGE gels had been loaded on the basis of cell equivalents in the initial experiments, we repeated the experiment by loading equal amounts of protein. We used an antibody to the Voltage Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC-1), which is localised in the outer mitochondrial membrane, control for equal loading of mitochondrial proteins. The result of these experiments is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b. The loss of Bcl-2 from the mitochondrial fraction, is again apparent under these conditions. Presence of IL-2 in the cultures counteracted the loss of Bcl-2 from the mitochondria.</p><p>Similar results were obtained using immunofluorescence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). Initially, Bcl-2 was seen on the nuclear envelope and the mitochondria. By 6&#x000a0;h, loss of Bcl-2 from the mitochondria was observed, but staining of the nuclear envelope remained stable.</p><p>These data suggest that two separate pools of Bcl-2 in T cells are regulated at different stages of apoptosis.</p><p>The mechanism of this regulation was investigated in subsequent experiments. Mitochondrial Bcl-2 appeared to be less stable than that in the nuclear pool. To test whether the mitochondrial pool was more dependent on continuous synthesis of Bcl-2 than the nuclear fraction, T cells were cultured in the presence of IL-2 and cycloheximide. Cell fractionation experiments showed that Bcl-2 in the nuclear fraction remained stable under all conditions tested in the experiments, but that the mitochondrial fraction maintained stable Bcl-2 levels only in the presence of IL-2 and the absence of cycloheximide (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). These results suggest that the mitochondrial pool of Bcl-2 depends upon constant replenishment by induction of de novo synthesis of Bcl-2 by anti-apoptotic cytokines. However, the stable Bcl-2 expression in the nucleus was independent of protein synthesis over the time period studied. While cycloheximide did inhibit the survival effect of IL-2 it did not appear to have an added toxic effect above that of IL-2 deprivation within these experiments (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b), but protein synthesis was effectively inhibited (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c).</p><p>These data indicate that the mitochondrial pool of Bcl-2 is critically dependent on anti-apoptotic cytokines in the microenvironment and support a role for mitochondrial Bcl-2 in the regulation of T cell apoptosis by cytokines.</p><p>The caspase dependent cleavage fragment of Bcl-2 was restricted to the nuclear fraction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). This suggested that only the loss of nuclear Bcl-2 was mediated by caspase dependent cleavage. T cells were incubated with ZVAD.fmk and fractionated at specific time points. The short form of Bcl-2 was absent from the samples treated with ZVAD.fmk, but the loss from the mitochondrial fraction was unaffected by inhibition of caspases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). These data suggest that the loss of mitochondrial Bcl-2 is caspase independent. Therefore we conclude that the two intracellular pools of Bcl-2 are regulated by at least two different mechanisms at different stages in the apoptotic pathway.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>During the resolution of an immune response, loss of extracellular survival signals leads to a dramatic reduction in activated T cell numbers by apoptosis. Mitochondria are widely regarded as the regulators of this apoptotic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Their role in apoptosis is controlled by pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Many anti-apoptotic cytokines upregulate the transcription of genes for anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In the absence of these survival signals, activated T cells are programmed to enter apoptosis. There is very strong evidence suggesting a role for Bcl-2 itself in the regulation of T cell apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, Broome et&#x000a0;al. have shown that Bcl-2 levels remain stable after the induction of apoptosis in activated murine T cells and are not down-regulated even late in apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Our data brings these observations together by demonstrating two spatially distinct pools of Bcl-2 within T cells that are differentially regulated and are lost at different stages of apoptosis through distinct mechanisms. The survival signal IL-2 maintains mitochondrial Bcl-2 levels in a translationally dependent manner. Withdrawal of IL-2 leads to loss of mitochondrial Bcl-2. This loss is independent of caspase activation. In contrast, the larger nuclear pool remains stable until caspase 3 is fully activated and a small proportion is then cleaved in a caspase-dependent manner. If only the total cellular levels of Bcl-2 are assayed, the stability of the larger nuclear pool can mask the loss of the smaller mitochondrial pool at an early stage of apoptosis. We conclude from these observations that only the smaller cytokine-regulated mitochondrial pool of Bcl-2 is relevant to the initiation of the apoptotic pathway and that measuring the total cellular level of Bcl-2 is less informative. Bcl-2 degradation has been shown to be caused by targeting of Bcl-2 to the protesomal system by ubiquitinylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Ubiquitinylation appears to be regulated by at least two mechanisms. Phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at MAPK target sites protects it from ubiquitinylation and subsequent degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In a more recent report endothelial nitric oxide synthase, which is also expressed by T cells, was shown to generate nitric oxide which S-nitrosylates Bcl-2 and prevents its ubiquitinylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. It is not clear which of these mechanisms plays a dominant role in the regulation of Bcl-2 levels in T cells, but it is possible that Bcl-2 in the nuclear compartment is less accessible to ubiquitinylation or one of the mechanisms regulating it.</p><p>Bcl-2 is known to be a target for caspase 3. Intriguingly, we only found the caspase dependent cleaved fragment of Bcl-2 in the nuclear fraction. The majority of active caspase 3 is cytosolic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and Bcl-2 is localised on the leaflet of the mitochondrial membrane facing the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] so it was surprising that no cleaved Bcl-2 was detected in the cytosol or the mitochondria. This may reflect highly efficient degradation of mitochondrial Bcl-2 before caspase 3 activation. The cleaved fragment of Bcl-2 has been reported to have a pro-apoptotic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. If transfected into cells, it localises to the mitochondria and forms ion channel like structures that mediate cytochrome c release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, the role of this potentially pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 fragments in spontaneous T cell apoptosis has not been previously addressed. In the present study, the generation of the cleaved fragment was entirely dependent upon caspase activation and no cleaved Bcl-2 was detectable in the mitochondrial fraction. This data does not support the contention that cleaved Bcl-2 controls mitochondrial polarity during the initiation of spontaneous apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>While it is difficult to assess the functional significance of a stable nuclear pool of Bcl-2, a tightly controlled mitochondrial pool is likely to be necessary for the regulation of mitochondrial stability and the apoptotic pathway. The role of Bcl-2 on the nuclear envelope and the function of the cleaved fragment at this site during the execution phase of apoptosis remain unclear. Nuclear Bcl-2 may mediate the anti-proliferative effects associated with this protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Such a role would fit with its stability in the early stages of apoptosis. During the execution phase of apoptosis nuclear Bcl-2 is cleaved in a caspase-dependant manner to the pro-apoptotic form. It is therefore possible that in the nucleus, the cleaved fragment of Bcl-2 plays a role in the later phases of the apoptotic pathway, but not in regulating entry to apoptosis. Bim, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family has recently been shown to be involved in the initiation of survival factor deprivation induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Even though Bim can bind to components of the dynein motor system, in T cells most of the cellular Bim is bound to the mitochondria, where it directly interacts with Bcl-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The pro-apoptotic effect of Bim in T cells can be balanced by over-expression of Bcl-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. These data support the previously described anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-2 in the regulation of T cell numbers in&#x000a0;vivo. Bcl-2 deficient mice are severely lymphopenic and their lymphocytes show increased susceptibility to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Over-expression of Bcl-2 under the vav-promotor results in increased T cell numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The regulation of T cell survival by anti-apoptotic cytokines is fundamental in maintaining T cell numbers during inflammatory responses and in restoring a homeostatic balance during the resolution of inflammation. Dysregulation of this process contributes to the pathology of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have characterised the regulation of Bcl-2 levels in T cell apoptosis induced by cytokine withdrawal. The mitochondrial pool of Bcl-2 is modulated prior to the commitment to apoptosis, while the nuclear pool remains stable. Only the mitochondrial pool is regulated by the presence of anti-apoptotic cytokines. Consequently, we suggest that the role of anti-apoptotic cytokines in inhibiting T cell apoptosis by Bcl-2 induction is limited to the up-regulation of the mitochondrial pool of Bcl-2.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank D.
