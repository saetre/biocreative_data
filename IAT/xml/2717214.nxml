This variety of functions results from the existence of multiple chaperones with different structures. Chaperones bind to exposed regions of proteins to fulfil their function. The chaperone must hereby recognise a certain signal sequence on the substrate protein. The nature of the sequence that is exposed will determine the types of chaperones that can interact with it, and in the end will also determine the fate of the substrate protein: refolding, translocation, degradation or activation. Knowledge of the binding sequence determinants of molecular chaperones will shed more light on the mechanism of how each chaperone contributes to the cellular protein quality control system.</p><p>In this study we have made an algorithm which accurately predicts binding sites for the well studied <italic>E. coli</italic> Hsp70 chaperone, DnaK, which is implicated in folding efficiency and prevention of aggregation. The ability to detect and design high-affinity DnaK binding sites enhances our understanding of chaperone-substrate recognition and opens great opportunities to enhance protein solubility using protein-DnaK binding motif fusions.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hsp70 molecular chaperones are part of the quality control machinery that functions to assist protein folding.

With ATP bound, substrate affinity is low and Hsp70 resides in an open state, ready to receive a suitable substrate. Once the substrate is bound, ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and Hsp70 undergoes a conformational change to a high affinity state, subsequently trapping the substrate. The co-chaperone Hsp40 (DnaJ in <italic>E. coli</italic>) binds Hsp70 and stimulates the ATPase function, causing retention of the substrate. Hsp40 also recognizes hydrophobic stretches and may serve as a substrate delivery chaperone to Hsp70 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000475-Szabo1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000475-Rudiger2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

A significant chemiluminescence signal would be the result of antibody-peptide binding and thus a false positive. A total of 16 peptides with a false positive signal higher than half of the DnaK-peptide signal were removed from the sets for any further analysis. The false positive signal of the rest of the peptides was subtracted from their DnaK-interaction signal to correct for any antibody-peptide binding that might occur.</p><p>To build the learning sets of sequences (see below), the peptides were grouped as either binders or non-binders. Setting a single cut-off value of relative binding would create a twilight zone of peptides that show neither clear binding nor clear non-binding. Therefore we set a high and a low cut-off value per membrane/experiment. Peptides with a signal above the high cut-off are considered as binders, peptides with a signal below the low cut-off are considered as non-binders.</p><p>Out of a total of 172 peptides, there were 53 binders and 119 non-binders. A fraction of 15&#x00025; from each set was randomly selected to constitute an independent validation set. Sequences from this validation set were never implemented in any training sets of the predictor to allow an independent validation assessment. This set consisted of 9 binders and 19 non-binders. The remaining 144 peptide sequences will be referred to as &#x02018;benchmark&#x02019; sets.

As the aim of our DnaK predictor was to evaluate stretches of heptapeptides for DnaK binding affinity, we fragmented both positive (binders) and negative (non-binders) benchmark sets into heptapeptides to create the final learning sets. To generate the negative learning set we assumed that for peptides longer than 7 residues, each heptapeptide fragment of the peptide is a true non-binder. Therefore the final negative learning set consisted of all possible heptapeptides from the full length non-binding peptides.</p><p>Generating a heptapeptide learning set from the true binder peptides is less trivial as one or more heptapeptide stretches must be identified from each DnaK binding peptide that is assumed to occupy the DnaK substrate binding groove. To this end, we used the FoldX force-field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000475-Schymkowitz1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> to identify such potential stretches within each full peptide.

In this way, the binding energy of each possible heptapeptide from every full peptide was calculated with FoldX (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">material and methods</xref>). The best binding heptapeptide from each full peptide was selected to fill the positive learning set of heptapeptides. To allow multiple potential heptapeptide DnaK binders per full peptide, we also added those heptapeptides with a binding energy within 0.5 kcal/mol of the binding energy of the best binding heptapeptide.</p><p>The final negative and positive learning sets contained 443 and 56 heptapeptides, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and Matthews correlation coefficient as predictor performance markers</title><p>The performance of the intermediate and final predictor PSSMs was assessed by <italic>receiver operating characteristic</italic> (ROC) curves in which, for a certain score threshold, the percentage of false positive predictions is plotted against the percentage of true positive predictions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">material and methods</xref> for detailed explanation of data point generation). The performance of each PSSM was measured against the aforementioned benchmark sets of known true positive binders and true negative binders. The calculation of ROC curves allows finding a predictor with high specificity, i.e. to find a score threshold above which the amount of false positives remains acceptable, while still finding a large amount of true positives. In this study we aim at specificity between 90&#x02013;100&#x00025;, i.e. 0&#x02013;10&#x00025; false positives. The overall performance for a certain score threshold is calculated via the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">material and methods</xref> for formula).

The logarithm of the ratio of the observed frequency over the expected frequency was calculated and used as the PSSM value for each position of the heptapeptide (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">material and methods</xref> for formula).

The log odd score based PSSM has advantages over the frequency based PSSM; it accounts for the chance of randomly finding a specific residue and inherently puts more weight on (DnaK) motif specific residues.</p><p>The non-binders PSSM now represents a sequence profile which is unfavorable for DnaK binding, whereas the binders PSSM reflects residue preferences for binding. To incorporate both types of data, we generated the final sequence-based PSSM by subtracting the scores of the non-binders PSSM from the scores of the binders PSSM, hereby reaching a consensus profile from the experimental data.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Structure based PSSM</title><p>To generate the structure based residue profile of DnaK substrate binding, we used the high resolution crystal structure published by Zhu <italic>et al</italic> as a template structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000475-Zhu1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

To address the contribution of every possible amino acid at each of the seven positions in the heptapeptide, we used the FoldX force-field to perform a position scan on the heptapeptide. Firstly, the heptapeptide was mutated to poly-alanine. Next, each position was sequentially mutated to all other 19 amino acids, while the other 6 residues remained as alanine. The binding energy for each residue at every position was calculated and subtracted from the binding energy of alanine at the same position, resulting in the corresponding &#x00394;&#x00394;G for each residue and position. The more negative the &#x00394;&#x00394;G, the better the residue fits DnaK binding.

It seems thus that adding structural information broadens the generality of the predictor.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000475-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000475.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>ROC curves representing the performance of the different predictors before learning set optimization.</title><p>The graph visualizes the not cross-validated sequence-based predictor (open square), the not cross-validated sequence and structure-based predictor (closed square), the cross-validated sequence-based predictor (open circle), the cross-validated sequence and structure-based predictor (closed circle), the sequence based predictor on the independent validation set (open triangle) and the sequence and structure-based predictor on the independent validation set (closed triangle).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000475.g004"/></fig><p>Although the heptapeptides in the learning sets were selected on a methodologically acceptable basis, inconsistencies in the learning set selection could not be excluded. We recently developed a training algorithm in which learning set sequences are sequentially removed and the effect on the cross-validation is assessed (Maurer-Stroh <italic>et al</italic>, unpublished data). Only when the Matthews correlation coefficient in the high specificity area improved, removal of the learning set sequence was accepted. The algorithm removed 8 sequences from the learning sets when the sequence-based PSSM was used to evaluate the MCC. The final not cross-validated MCC became 0.919, whereas simulated cross-validation showed an MCC of 0.651 and the validation set had an MCC of 0.662, a huge improvement compared to the starting MCC values for the sequence-based PSSM (See suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000475.s002">Table S2a</xref> for PSSM). Next, we trained the algorithm with the combined sequence- and structure-based PSSM. Here, 6 of the 499 learning set sequences were removed. The not cross-validated MCC reached 0.819 and upon cross-validation we were able to obtain an MCC of 0.703. This optimized sequence and structure based predictor had an MCC of 0.759 on the validation set sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000475-g005">Figure 5</xref> for the ROC curves and suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000475.s002">Table S2c</xref> for PSSM)). The accuracy of the non cross-validated predictor was 92,4&#x00025; in which 77,3&#x00025; of the experimentally verified binding peptides were correctly predicted (true positives) with only 1&#x00025; false positives (or 99&#x00025; specificity). It is important to note that a higher rate of true positive detections can be achieved (93,2&#x00025; instead of 77,3&#x00025;) but at the cost of a lower specificity (91&#x00025;). These settings can easily be customized in the online version of the predictor. When ran over the validation set, the highest obtainable accuracy was 89&#x00025; with 66,7&#x00025; true positives and no false positives. The performance appears to be stable when analyzing benchmark sets of variable redundancy (Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000475.s003">Table S3</xref>, Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000475.s004">Figure S1</xref>).

We are able to define specific residue preferences and disfavors of each of the seven peptide positions (numbered N-terminally from 1 to 7). Positions 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 score high for hydrophobic residues, with all but position 4 having also preference for the aromatic resdues F and Y (W also at position 6). The basic residue preference is most apparent at position 7, where R is the most preferred residue, after the aromatic F. Positions 2, 3 and 5 also allow basic residues (preferably R), but this feature is not as pronounced as at position 7. Position 4 is the most restricted position, where only L, I, M and to a lesser extent T and V are observed. Most other amino acids are not allowed at this central position. Positions 2 and 3 are also very restricted in their residue preference. The majority of amino acids is not observed in binding sequences at these positions. Hydrophobicity (mainly L), aromaticity (mainly F,Y) and positive charge (R) seem to be the requirements here. The large aromatic residue W is strongly preferred at the first and sixth position. Overall there seems to be an underrepresentation of C and D. E is strongly disfavoured at the second position, but shows a positive score at the very first position. A graphical representation of the profile is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000475-g006">Figure 6</xref> (See Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000475.s002">Table S2c</xref> for PSSM).</p><fig id="pcbi-1000475-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000475.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Graphical representation of the final DnaK heptameric binding profile over all aminoacids and all residue positions.</title><p>The axes crossing point at score zero was chosen for convenience.

The final predictor performs well under cross-validated conditions.</p><p>The success rate was dependent on two main variables. Firstly, the training set was well optimised since the training set optimisation algorithm rectifies to a certain extent anomalies from in silico analysis. Our initial positive learning set was, in part, generated from in silico threading; from each full peptide the heptapeptide with the best binding energy was selected and also those heptapeptides with a binding energy within 0.5 kcal/mol of the heptapeptide with the best binding energy. The latter step is prone to some misclassification, since we allow multiple DnaK binding sites per peptide and this might not always be the case <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, our learning set training algorithm was able to remove 6 heptapeptides that appeared &#x02018;noisy&#x02019; to allow acceptable cross-validated prediction of the benchmark peptide set. The second and most profound variable is the initial perspective of this study, that combined sequence and structural data will complement each other to detect protein-protein interaction motifs. The ROC curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000475-g005">Figure 5</xref> illustrate the power of merging both approaches: the overall performance of the dual based predictor exceeds the individual sequence- and structure-based predictors (see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000475-t002">Table 2</xref>). Each approach must therefore, to a certain extent, contribute information that the other lacks. The sequence learning set or alignment of both binders and non-binders must inherently provide information on the ability of seven consecutive residues to adopt the extended conformation, since this represents the DnaK binding mode of a substrate peptide. The structural approach serves to further refine the sequence information by detecting direct peptide binding preferences based on amino acid sidechain volume, charge, hydrophobicity, etc. The major improvement in the cross-validation upon adding the structural information could also be explained as the ability of the structural data to cancel out some positional residue bias or any missing residue information inside the sequence data set.</p><p>It should be noted however, that the structural template was chosen according to its stand-alone MCC and ROC performance with the experimental benchmark sequence set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000475-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000475-t001">Table 1</xref>). Structure profiles based on NMR structures were unable to come close to the performance obtained with the X-ray structure. Moreover, the fact that out of three crystal structures the one with the highest resolution performed best should stress the use of high quality crystal structures to obtain a reliable structure-based profile.</p><p>Our dual approach DnaK profile confirmed in part the previously observed residue preferences for basic residues flanking a hydrophobic core region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000475-Rudiger1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. We extended this to show that positions 1 and 3 do not totally disfavour the negatively charged glutamate. Aspartate on the other hand is strongly rejected in all positions. The central position 4 prefers the aliphatic hydrophobic amino acids leucine, isoleucine and methionine. It is the most restricted position, which is not remarkable since the residue must fit in a well defined hydrophobic pocket of DnaK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000475-Zhu1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Aromatic residues, although not always evenly distributed, are very abundant at all sites, except at the central position which is neutral for phenylalanine and the last position which disfavors tryptophan. The second and third positions show a clear spectrum of aliphatic, aromatic and basic residues. The absolute last position prefers arginine, and phenylalanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000475-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Overall, phenylalanine is the only residue not to have a clear disfavored site.</p><p>We have compared our method with a previously published predicting algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000475-Rudiger1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> (see supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000475.s002">Table S2d</xref> for PSSM). To test the generality and possible overprediction of sequences that are not known DnaK binders, we added 200 randomly selected 15-mer peptides from real proteins to the negative benchmark set. Additionally, the peptides were selected with the prerequisite to have less than 50&#x00025; sequence identity to the learning set sequences. In this task, both methods perform comparably well at relevant levels of high specificity of 90.3&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000475-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). As can be seen in the ROC curve for this specificity, our method reaches a sensitivity of 68.2&#x00025; where the previously published algorithm has a sensitivity of 54.5&#x00025;. For the same amount of false positives, we predict thus more true positives compared to the algorithm of R&#x000fc;diger <italic>et al.</italic> in this experiment. We also compared the performance of both predictors on the validation set of peptide sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000475-g007">Figure 7B</xref>) and conclude that our method performs slightly better in terms of true positive predictions (sensitivity).
