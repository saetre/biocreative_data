Two isoforms of EPLIN have been identified known as EPLIN-&#x003b1; and EPLIN-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], which are different by the appearance of an additional 160 amino acids at the N-terminus of the beta isoform. EPLIN is located along the actin stress fibres and focal adhesion plaques, indicating a possible role in cell morphology, migration and adhesion. Indeed, it has been recently shown to cross link and stabilise cytoskeletal filaments and promote formation of stress fibres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], by doing so contributing to the inhibition of anchorage independent growth in transformed cells, but not in non-transformed cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>EPLIN has been demonstrated to express at low levels in a range of cancer cell lines. For example, 8 out of 8 of oral cancer cell lines tested, 4 of 4 prostate cancer cells and 5 of 6 breast cancer cell lines were found to have low levels of EPLIN transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Although the investigation into the biological function of EPLIN remains at preliminary stage, the information of their role in cells and the cytoskeleton and reduced expression in cancer cells indicate that the molecule may act as a tumour suppressor. However, there has been no clinical evidence to indicate as such. In a molecular screening programme, we identified EPLIN-<bold>&#x003b1; </bold>as one of the molecules whose expression was most aberrant.</p><p>The aim of the current study was to investigate the possible clinical implication of EPLIN-<bold>&#x003b1; </bold>in human breast cancer. Here, we first report that expression of EPLIN-<bold>&#x003b1; </bold>in human breast cancer is aberrant and that the levels of expression is linked to the clinical outcome of patients with breast cancer and provide evidence that by affecting cytoskeletal elements, EPLIN-<bold>&#x003b1; </bold>reduced cell growth <italic>in vitro </italic>and tumour growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is also a regulator of cellular migration as demonstrated by an ECIS based analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissues and patients</title><p>Breast cancer cell line MDA MB-463, MDA MB-435s, MDA MB-436, MCF10A. MCF-7, ZR 7&#x02013;51, MDA MB-468, BT-482, BT474, BT549, MDA MB-157, and MDA MB 231, human fibroblast cell lines IBTG3 and MRC5 were purchased from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (ECACC, Salisbury, England). These breast cancer cell lines represented panel of cells with high invasiveness (MDA MB-435s, MDA MB-231), low invasiveness (MCF-7, ZR 7&#x02013;51, MDA MB-463, MDA MB-436, MDA MB 468, MDA MB-157, BT549) and immortalised mammary epithelial cells (MCF-10A). Of the cell lines used, MCF-7, MCF-10A, BT-474, ZR 7&#x02013;51 are known ER positive, remaining are ER negative (except BT482 and MDA MB-463 of which ER status are not clear). Most breast cancer cell lines are from ductal carcinoma which is the main type of the tumour histological types in the present study, except MDA MB-435s, MDA MB 436, MDA MB-468 which were initially described as from adenocarcinoma of the breast. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were purchased from TCS Biologicals (Oxford, England). Human endothelial cell line (HECV) was obtained from the Biology and Cellular and Molecular Pathology Dept, Naples, Italy. Breast cancer tissues (n = 120) and normal background tissues (n = 32) were collected immediately after surgery and stored in the deep freezer until use. Patients were routinely followed clinically after surgery. The median followup period was 120 months. The presence of tumour cells in the collected tissues was verified by examination of frozen sections using H &#x00026; E staining by a consultant pathologist (ADJ).

Primers were designed using the Beacon Designer software (version 2, Biosoft International, Palo Alto, California, USA), to amplify regions of human EPLIN-<bold>&#x003b1; </bold>that have no significant overlap with other known sequences and that the amplified products span over at least one intron, based on sequence accession number AF198455. The primers used were: 5'AAGCAAAAATGAAAACGAAG'3 and 5'ACTGAACCTGACCGTACAGACACCCACCTTAGCAATAG'3. Reactions were carried out at the following conditions: 94&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes, 36 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 15 seconds, 55&#x000b0;C for 25 seconds and 72&#x000b0;C for 15 seconds. PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and photographed using a digital camera mounted over a UV transluminator. &#x003b2;-actin was used as a house keeping gene: 5'ATGATATCGCCGCGCTCG'3 and 5'CGCTCGTGTAGGATCTTCA'3.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative analysis of EPLIN-&#x003b1; transcripts</title><p>The levels of EPLIN-<bold>&#x003b1; </bold>transcripts from the above-prepared cDNA was determined using a real-time quantitative PCR, based on the Amplifluor&#x02122; technology, modified from a method previous reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Briefly, pairs of PCR primers were similarly designed using the Beacon Designer software to that of conventional PCR primers, but to one of the primer, an additional sequence was added, known as the Z sequence (5'actgaacctgaccgtaca'3) which is complementary to the universal Z probe (Intergen Inc., Oxford, England, UK). A Taqman detection kit for &#x003b2;-actin was purchased from Perkin-Elmer. The reaction was carried out using the following: Hot-start Q-master mix (Abgene), 10 pmol of specific forward primer, 1 pmol reverse primer which has the Z sequence, 10 pmol of FAM-tagged probe (Intergen Inc.,), and cDNA from approximate 50 ng RNA. The reaction was carried out on IcyclerIQ&#x02122; (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hemstead, England, UK) which is equipped with an optic unit that allows real time detection of 96 reactions. The following condition was used in the reaction: 94&#x000b0;C for 12 minutes, 50 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 15 seconds, 55&#x000b0;C for 40 seconds (the data capture step) and 72&#x000b0;C for 20 seconds. The levels of the transcripts were generated from an internal standard that was simultaneously amplified with the samples. Cytokeratin-19 (CK19) was used to normalise cellularity during the analysis and primers for CK19 were 5'CAGGTCCGAGGTTACTGAC3' and 5'ACTGAACCTGACCGTACACACTTTCTGCCAGTGTGTCTTC'3, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].

The sections were mounted on super frost plus microscope slides, air dried and then fixed in a mixture of 50% acetone and 50% methanol for 15 minutes. Staining for each molecule was conducted on all the slides at the same time in a single batch to avoid variance in experimental conditions. The sections were then placed in "Optimax" wash buffer (a Tween 20 containing washing buffer from Sigma, Poole, Dorset, England, UK) for 5 &#x02013; 10 minutes to rehydrate. Sections were incubated for 20 mins in a blocking solution that contained 10% horse serum and probed with the primary antibody (rabbit anti-human EPLIN, Calbiochem, used at dilution of 1:100, for 60 minutes). The dilution chosen here was based on the evaluation test run, during which the antibody was tested over a range of 1:10 to 1:1000. Primary antibodies were omitted in the negative controls. Following extensive washings, sections were incubated for 30 minutes in the solution containing the secondary biotinylated antibody (Multilink Swine anti-goat/mouse/rabbit immunoglobulin). Following washings, Avidin Biotin Complex (Vector Laboratories) was then applied to the sections followed by extensive washings. Diaminobenzidine chromogen (Vector Labs) was then added to the sections which were incubated in the dark for 5 minutes. Sections were then counter-stained in Gill's Haematoxylin and dehydrated in ascending grades of methanol before clearing in xylene and mounting under a cover slip.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of expression vector for human EPLIN-&#x003b1;</title><p>Full length human EPLIN-&#x003b1; cDNA was generated from a cDNA preparation of normal mammary tissues. The following primers which allowed amplification of the full length human EPLIN-<bold>&#x003b1; </bold>were used: 5'ATGGAAAATTGTCTAGGAGA'3(EPLINaExF1), 5'ATGGAAAATTGTCTAGGAGAA'3 (EPLINaExF2) and 5'TCACTCTTCATCCTCATCCTC'3 (EPLINaExR1). The reaction was carried out using high-fidelity master mix with proof reading enzymes (AbGene). Correctly amplified product was T-A cloned into a mammalian expression vector, pEF6/V5-his.

MDA MB 231 cells were transfected by way of electroporation using an electroporator (Easyjet, Flowgen). 48 hours after electroporation, selection medium which contained blasticidin (5 &#x003bc;g/ml final concentration) was used to select stably transfected strains. After verification of the expression, two stains that carried high level EPLIN-&#x003b1; expression were established and subsequently named as MDA-MB231<sup>EPLINexp3</sup>, and MDA-MB231<sup>EPLINexp4</sup>.

Cell modelling was carried out using the ECIS RbA modelling software, supplied by the manufacturer. The 8W10 arrays (8 well format with 10 probes in each well) were used in the present study. ECIS measures the interaction between cells and the substrate to which they are attached via gold-film electrodes placed on the surface of culture dishes. Following treating the array surface with a Cysteine solution, the arrays were incubated with complete medium for 1 hour. The same number of MDA-MB231<sup>wt</sup>, MDA-MB231<sup>pEF/His</sup>, MDA-MB231<sup>EPLINexp3</sup>, or MDA-MB231<sup>EPLINexp4 </sup>(250,000 per well) in the same volume of medium (400 &#x003bc;l) were added to each wells. After 3 hours when confluence was reached, the monolayer was electrically wounded at 6 v for 30 seconds. Impedance and resistance of the cell layer were immediately recorded for a period of up to 20 hours. For micromotion analysis, similarly prepared cells in the array were placed into the 1600R model. Micromotion was recorded at 4000 Hz for 15 minutes. Migration and micromotion were modelled using the ECIS RbA cell modelling software.</p></sec><sec><title>In vitro invasion analysis and cell growth assay</title><p>This was performed as previously reported and modified in our laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].

We also report that the levels of EPLIN-<bold>&#x003b1; </bold>are correlated with the clinical outcomes and long term survival of the patients with breast cancer. The study further demonstrates that expression of EPLIN-<bold>&#x003b1; </bold>linked to the reduction of growth of breast cancer cells <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and inhibition of cellular migration via an ERK dependent pathway.</p><p>EPLIN has been found to be transcriptionally expressed at lower levels in a limited number of tumour cells, including breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This is clearly seen in the present study in which only few of the breast cancer cell lines expressed the gene transcript. Perhaps the most important observation seen in the present study is the link between the level of EPLIN expression and the clinical outcome. An inverse correlation was seen between the level of the EPLIN transcripts and tumour grade, nodal status and tumour staging. A highly significant link was seen between low levels of expression and a poor clinical outcome and shorter disease free and overall survival. These data clearly indicate that EPLIN may act as a potential prognostic indicator and that the molecule may act as a protective factor in patients with breast cancer. Information of the clinical relevant of EPLIN in human cancers in the literature of any type is limited. In another recent study, there has been indication that EPLIN transcript may also lost in colorectal cancer tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The present study is the first to demonstrate a clear clinical relevance between EPLIN-<bold>&#x003b1; </bold>and clinical outcome.</p><p>This important clinical link has potential cellular explanations, as demonstrated in the present study and indeed in the literature. EPLIN-<bold>&#x003b1; </bold>protein was shown to be an actin cross linking protein that bundles actin in the cells and stabilises the cytoskeletal filaments. By doing so, EPLIN protein inhibits cell motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the present study, we have also shown that forced expression of EPLIN-<bold>&#x003b1; </bold>in the breast cancer cell line, MDA MB-231 which is negative in EPLIN-<bold>&#x003b1; </bold>expression, resulted in the cells to be less aggressive, namely with reduced migration, invasion and <italic>in vitro </italic>growth. The EPLIN-<bold>&#x003b1; </bold>expressing cells also displayed a significantly reduced rate of growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. Collectively, the present study shows that EPLIN, a potential cell migration regulating protein, is inversely associated with the aggressiveness and clinical outcome of human breast cancers. This is likely via its inhibitory role on cell growth and migration.</p><p>Although EPLIN has been shown to be an actin bundling protein, the precise mechanism is yet to be fully established. It has been shown that EPLIN inhibits the ARP2 mediated nucleation of actin filaments. During the preparation of the manuscript, two reports have shown that EPLIN also mediates the linkage between the Cadherin/catenin complex and F actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and that one potential pathway in these links is the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These recent findings support the present study which demonstrates that inhibition of ERK pathway resulted in reversal of EPLIN mediated reduction of cellular migration. This is interesting, as ERK has becoming a therapeutic target in recent years.</p><p>In conclusion, EPLIN-<bold>&#x003b1; </bold>is a powerful regulator of the cellular motility of breast cancer cells. Breast cancer cells expressing EPLIN-<bold>&#x003b1; </bold>are less motile and grow slowly in <italic>vivo</italic>. Together with the clinical relevance as demonstrated in the present study, EPLIN-<bold>&#x003b1; </bold>is an important prognostic indicator and may be an important target when considering therapies. We are currently examining the molecular pathways involved in EPLIN-<bold>&#x003b1; </bold>mediated cell migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they
