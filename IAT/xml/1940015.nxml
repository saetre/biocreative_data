Optimal &#x003b1;4-mediated migration in leucocytes requires spatial regulation of &#x003b1;4 phosphorylation at Ser<sup>988</sup>, a post-translational modification that blocks paxillin binding to the integrin cytoplasmic domain.

These changes may promote regeneration in at least two different ways. First, by generating increased levels of molecules such as laminin (Ln) and fibronectin (Fn) that can promote neurite outgrowth in cell culture and are therefore likely to promote regeneration in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Second, by altering the pattern of alternative splicing so as to switch from isoforms of ECM proteins expressed in adult nerve to those expressed earlier during a time of axon growth in development. An example of the second mechanism is provided by Fn, whose primary gene transcript is alternatively spliced in three regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Two of these include or exclude single Fn type III repeats (EIIIA and EIIIB) while the third partially or completely excludes a region (V or IIICS) that contains a cell binding sequence Leu-Asp-Val (LDV) recognised by the integrin &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. While these regions are excluded from adult Fns in a cell and tissue specific pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], we have previously found that sciatic nerve injury and regeneration in the adult rat is associated with a change in the pattern of alternative splicing and the re-expression of embryonic Fns that include all these regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Recombinant Fns that include the entire V region promote neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons or PC12 cells (a cell line model of PNS neurones) more effectively than those containing only the RGD sequence present in the 10th type III repeat present in all Fns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. As the &#x003b1;4 integrin subunit is expressed on regenerating growth cones <italic>in vivo</italic>, we have therefore proposed that the re-expression of embryonic Fns following injury contributes to regeneration of the adult PNS by enhancing &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 integrin signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The identification of &#x003b1;4 integrins as part of the regenerative mechanism in the PNS is of particular interest as these integrins play an important role in cell migration in other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The adaptor protein, paxillin, which binds directly to the &#x003b1;4 cytoplasmic domain, is an important downstream signalling molecule in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Transgenic knock-in mice expressing only &#x003b1;4 integrin with a Y991A mutation within the paxillin binding site that blocks the interaction show impaired leucocyte recruitment during inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. A physiological modification that blocks binding of paxillin is generated by phosphorylation of the &#x003b1;4 integrin cytoplasmic domain, detected in certain T cell lines using an antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide containing phosphoserine at Ser<sup>988 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Phosphorylation is localised to the leading edge of migrating CHO cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and the reversibility of paxillin binding enabled by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of &#x003b1;4 may be important for migration, as both S988A (that inhibits phosphorylation) and S988D (that mimics phosphorylation) mutations inhibit migration in cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We have shown previously that paxillin is also associated specifically with &#x003b1;4 in DRG neurons and PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This suggests the hypothesis that paxillin also makes an essential contribution to &#x003b1;4-mediated growth cone motility and PNS regeneration by virtue of the association with the integrin cytoplasmic domain. Here we test this hypothesis by examining the requirement for the &#x003b1;4-paxillin interaction in neurite outgrowth and find that the interaction is required; however, in contrast to non-neuronal cell migration, &#x003b1;4 phosphorylation is dispensable for neurite outgrowth.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To examine &#x003b1;4-mediated neurite outgrowth we used PC12 cells as model neurons. These cells do not express &#x003b1;4 integrin and transfection with &#x003b1;4 enables them to manifest neurite outgrowth on Fn isoforms that contain the &#x003b1;4 integrin binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. To assess the requirement for paxillin binding to the &#x003b1;4 cytoplasmic domain for this neurite outgrowth, we first expressed &#x003b1;4 subunits into which alanine substitutions had been inserted into either or both of two amino acids essential for paxillin binding; Glu<sup>983 </sup>and Tyr<sup>991 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. As controls we expressed either full-length &#x003b1;4 or &#x003b1;4 lacking the cytoplasmic domain sequences C-terminal to the GFFKR motif (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). To demonstrate the expected effects of these mutations on paxillin binding, we immunoprecipitated lysates of the PC12 cells with antibodies against the extracellular domain of &#x003b1;4 and then western blotted the protein complexes pulled down with anti-paxillin antibodies. As shown in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, the &#x003b1;4 subunits were all expressed in the PC12 cells but bound paxillin to differing degrees; while full-length &#x003b1;4 complexed with high levels of paxillin, &#x003b1;4 with either single mutation bound much lower levels and &#x003b1;4 with the double mutation showed virtually no binding. As expected, the &#x003b1;4 subunit lacking the majority of the cytoplasmic domain did not bind paxillin, illustrating the specificity of the assay.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Mutations in the paxillin-binding region of the &#x003b1;4 cytoplasmic domain reduce paxillin binding A) The amino acid sequence of the cytoplasmic domains of the &#x003b1;4 integrins expressed in PC12 cells, starting at the conserved juxtamembrane GFFKR sequence. In all cases, the transmembrane and extracellular domains were wild-type human &#x003b1;4 integrin. The different mutations in the paxillin binding domain are underlined, and the cytoplasmic domain deletion (&#x003b1;4del) is also shown.

Note the similar expression of the different mutants. The right panel then shows the same immunoprecipitates western blotted with biotin-labelled anti-paxillin antibodies so as to examine paxillin binding to each integrin cytoplasmic domain in the PC12 cells. Note that the single amino acid mutations (&#x003b1;4E983A and &#x003b1;4Y991A) reduce binding, the double mutation (&#x003b1;4EY) even more so, and that no binding is seen following deletion of the &#x003b1;4 cytoplasmic domain (&#x003b1;4del).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2202-8-44-1"/></fig><p>To examine the effects of these mutations on &#x003b1;4-mediated neurite outgrowth, we then grew these PC12 cells on recombinant Fn fragments containing the V120 region for 24 hrs. The extent of neurite outgrowth correlated with the degree of paxillin binding to the &#x003b1;4 cytoplasmic domain (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Either single mutation reduced neurite outgrowth while the double mutation resulted in a complete loss of &#x003b1;4-mediated neurite outgrowth, with the degree of outgrowth now being identical to the low level seen with wild type PC12 cells or with PC12 cells expressing the &#x003b1;4 subunit lacking the majority of the cytoplasmic domain. To ask whether this effect of perturbing paxillin interactions was specific for &#x003b1;4-mediated neurite outgrowth, we repeated the experiments with cells expressing wild type &#x003b1;4 or the double mutation on laminin, collagen or Fn V120. Laminin and collagen bind to different integrins on the cell surface (&#x003b1;1&#x003b2;1, &#x003b1;3&#x003b2;1, &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1;7&#x003b2;1 for laminin, &#x003b1;1&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1 for collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]) and promote neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Expression of &#x003b1;4, either wild-type or mutant, had no effect on this neurite outgrowth while, as before, only the cells expressing wild-type &#x003b1;4 showed enhanced neurite outgrowth on Fn V120 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) confirming that the loss of the paxillin association with &#x003b1;4 only perturbs &#x003b1;4-mediated neurite outgrowth.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Mutations in the paxillin-binding region of the &#x003b1;4 cytoplasmic domain inhibit &#x003b1;4-mediated neurite outgrowth. A) Neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells expressing the different &#x003b1;4 constructs after 24 hrs plated onto recombinant Fn fragments containing the V120 sequence (Fn V120, 50 nM) within which the &#x003b1;4-binding LDV motif is present. In each experiments the longest neurites in at least 100 cells were measured and the results normalised to the median values seen in cells expressing wild type &#x003b1;4. The data shown are the mean &#x000b1; SEM of 6 experiments. Note the reduction in the single mutants (* = P &#x0003c; 0.01), and complete loss of any &#x003b1;4-mediated outgrowth with the double mutant and cytoplasmic domain deletion (** = P &#x0003c; 0.005), with levels now the same as those seen on mock-transfected PC12 cells. B) Neurite outgrowth from mock-transfected PC12 cells and those expressing wild-type &#x003b1;4 or the double mutant. Note that, as in A), outgrowth on Fn V120 requires a normal &#x003b1;4 cytoplasmic domain while outgrowth on laminin and collagen does not and is similar in all cell lines.

The structure of wild-type paxillin is shown in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, and the two different paxillin mutants used in the study are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>. One lacks the LD4 domain that promotes neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells grown on collagen substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The other has Tyr to Phe substitutions at Tyr<sup>31</sup>, Tyr<sup>118 </sup>and Tyr<sup>182</sup>. This prevents the phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>31 </sup>and Tyr<sup>118 </sup>implicated in cell motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] but has no effect on neurite outgrowth on collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Western blot experiments confirmed that tyrosine phosphorylation was not observed in the triple mutant paxillin, whilst the wild type and LD4 deletion mutant forms were recognised by the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). To determine the relative expression levels of expressed and endogenous paxillin, we performed western blots using antibodies against paxillin (that will recognise both the endogenous and expressed molecules) and against the FLAG-tag present only in the expressed form of paxillin. As shown in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, there were greater levels of the expressed paxillins than the endogenous paxillin, and the levels of the mutant paxillins were comparable with those seen with the wild-type construct (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). To confirm that the expressed paxillins associated with &#x003b1;4, we western blotted using anti-paxillin antibodies cell lysates immunoprecipitated first with anti-&#x003b1;4 and then with the anti FLAG-tag antibody that detects only the expressed paxillin. All the expressed paxillins associated with &#x003b1;4 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). Notably the LD4 deletion mutant associated with the integrin, even though the critical residues for &#x003b1;4 binding have been shown to be present in an Ala<sup>176 </sup>to Asp<sup>275 </sup>fragment containing the LD3 and LD4 domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Expression and binding to &#x003b1;4 of paxillin mutant isoforms.

All three contain a FLAG tag. C) Western blotting of lysates from PC12 cells expressing the different paxillin constructs. All three are expressed at a similar level, but the pax3Y mutant is not recognised by the anti-phosphotyrosine PY20 antibody. D) Western blots using anti-FLAG tag and anti-paxillin antibodies of lysates from PC12 cells expressing the different paxillin constructs with or without co-expression of wild-type &#x003b1;4 integrin, and from mock-transfected PC12 cells. The anti-FLAG (top panel) recognises only expressed paxillin, while the anti-paxillin antibody (middle panel) recognises both expressed and endogenous paxillin. Note that the normal endogenous levels of paxillin (seen in the mock-transfected cells with the anti-paxillin antibody) are lower than those seen following expression of the three constructs, with or without &#x003b1;4 (middle panel), and that all cell lines contain similar levels of expressed paxillin (top panel). A &#x003b2;-actin loading control is also shown in the lower panel. E) Lysates of biotin-labelled PC12 cells expressing either wild-type &#x003b1;4 alone, wild-type paxillin alone or wild-type &#x003b1;4 with the different paxillin constructs immunoprecipitated with anti-&#x003b1;4 as in Fig 1 and then re-immunoprecipitated (Re-IP) with anti-FLAG antibodies before western blotting with anti-paxillin antibody (top panel) or visualised by streptavidin-peroxidase/ECL (lower panel). All four cell lines transfected with &#x003b1;4 constructs express the integrin at similar levels (lower panel), and all expressed (wild-type and mutant) paxillins bind to the integrin equally well (upper panel). In the absence of any &#x003b1;4 integrin (wtpax only in upper panel), no expressed paxillin is detected, confirming the specificity of the assay. Note that the anti-FLAG antibody used to detect paxillin would not be expected to detect the endogenous paxillin associated with &#x003b1;4, and so no band is seen in the &#x003b1;4-only lane of the upper panel.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2202-8-44-3"/></fig><p>Next, we examined neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells co-expressing wild-type &#x003b1;4 and the different paxillins. In cells expressing wild-type paxillin, we found enhanced neurite outgrowth on Fn V120 compared with cells expressing &#x003b1;4 alone (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In keeping with the previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], no significant difference in the extent of neurite outgrowth on Fn V120 substrates was seen between PC12 cells expressing wild type and the triple tyrosine mutant paxillin, while the LD4 domain mutant supported neurite outgrowth to a significantly reduced extent (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These over-expression studies therefore confirm a role for paxillin in promoting neurite outgrowth on Fn V120 substrates. Taken together with the studies above showing that association of paxillin with the integrin cytoplasmic domain is required for outgrowth, they show that the recruitment of paxillin by &#x003b1;4 integrin represents an important mechanism for neurite outgrowth on these embryonic fibronectins.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>The LD4 domain of paxillin contributes to &#x003b1;4-mediated neurite outgrowth. Neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells expressing &#x003b1;4 and the different paxillin constructs, measured as in Fig. 1. The data shown are the mean &#x000b1; SEM of 3 experiments. Note that paxillin over-expression enhances neurite outgrowth, but the paxillin lacking the LD4 domain (LD4pax) does so less effectively than wild-type paxillin (wtpax) or paxillin with Tyr to Phe mutations of the 3 tyrosines (3Ypax) (** = P &#x0003c; 0.05 as compared to the level of outgrowth in cells expressing &#x003b1;4 and wtpax).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2202-8-44-4"/></fig><p>As outlined in the introduction, the binding of paxillin to the &#x003b1;4 integrin is inhibited by phosphorylation of Ser<sup>988</sup>. The temporal and spatial regulation of paxillin binding enabled by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation may have an important physiological role in cell motility, as both S988A (that inhibits phosphorylation) and S988D (that mimics phosphorylation) mutations inhibit migration in cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In the final part of this study, therefore, we examined the role of phosphorylation of Ser<sup>988 </sup>in neurite outgrowth on Fn V120 substrates. We transfected PC12 cells with either wild type &#x003b1;4 or &#x003b1;4 with S988A or S988D mutations. As an additional control, we used a control S990A mutation that does not alter paxillin binding (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). All four &#x003b1;4 constructs were equally expressed in PC12 cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Wild type &#x003b1;4 was not phosphorylated in PC12 cells as judged by immuno blotting with a phospho-&#x003b1;4 specific antibody whereas it was heavily phosphorylated in Jurkat cells (a T cell line) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). In contrast, the &#x003b1;4(S988D) was labelled by this antibody in PC12 cells suggesting that this mutation is also phospho-mimetic with respect to recognition by this antibody. We confirmed the effect of these mutations on the binding of paxillin to the &#x003b1;4 cytoplasmic domain by immunoprecipitating &#x003b1;4 from lysates of cells expressing each of the four different &#x003b1;4 subunits and detecting paxillin by immunoblotting. As expected, no associated paxillin was seen with the phospho-mimicking S988D mutation, whilst all others bound paxillin as expected (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Lastly, we examined neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells expressing each of the four &#x003b1;4 subunits on Fn V120. As before, wild-type &#x003b1;4 promoted neurite outgrowth and this was not affected by the S988A or S990A mutations. In contrast, however, the S988D mutation that blocked paxillin binding showed no &#x003b1;4-mediated neurite outgrowth, as the levels of outgrowth were identical to those of PC12 cells not expressing &#x003b1;4 integrin (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). We conclude that mutations that mimic phosphorylation of Ser<sup>988 </sup>will prevent paxillin binding in PC12 cells, and therefore inhibit the neurite outgrowth promoted by &#x003b1;4 integrin on Fn V120 substrates. However, the lack of detectable phosphorylation of wild-type &#x003b1;4 in the PC12 cells and the efficacy of &#x003b1;4(S988A) in promoting neurite outgrowth suggests that the reversibility of paxillin binding enabled by phosphorylation of Ser<sup>988 </sup>is not necessary for neurite outgrowth.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Mutations of Ser<sup>988 </sup>in the &#x003b1;4 cytoplasmic domain mimic phosphorylation.

In the absence of this association, the enhanced neurite outgrowth on Fn V120 is lost. Conversely, overexpression of paxillin enhances &#x003b1;4-dependent neurite outgrowth on this substrate. As alternative splicing of the Fn primary gene transcript following PNS injury increases the number of Fns containing V120 in the regenerating nerve, and &#x003b1;4 is expressed on regenerating growth cones <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], we suggest that the &#x003b1;4-paxillin interaction may play a key role in PNS regeneration. The upregulation of different ECM molecules during PNS regeneration suggests that other integrins will also contribute to regeneration. Two candidates are &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1, that is also expressed on regenerating growth cones in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and &#x003b1;7&#x003b2;1, a laminin receptor expressed on a subset of DRG neurons and also shown to be required for normal regeneration of motor neurones in the facial nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, as &#x003b1;4 and the closely related &#x003b1;9 are the only integrin &#x003b1; subunits reported to bind paxillin directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], it is likely that these integrins will activate different and parallel downstream pathways so providing an enhanced regenerative response triggered by the change in Fn splicing.</p><p>The demonstration of a functional requirement for paxillin binding to a specific integrin to promote neurite outgrowth extends previous work on signalling within growth cones. Paxillin is localised within neuronal growth cones within dynamic focal adhesions that assemble at the leading edge, enlarge and finally disassemble while remaining in place as the growth cone advances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It becomes tyrosine phosphorylated on neurite outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin at Tyr<sup>31 </sup>and Tyr<sup>118 </sup>provide a binding site for the adaptor protein Crk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Overexpression of Crk promotes neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and also promotes cell motility in a bladder cancer cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Surprisingly, therefore, but in agreement with others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], we find no evidence that inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation by expression of a paxillin with Tyr to Phe mutations in these residues inhibits the ability of over-expressed paxillin to enhance neurite outgrowth. Two other regions of paxillin have been implicated in neurite outgrowth signalling. First, Ser <sup>85 </sup>(Ser <sup>83 </sup>in the rat) that is phosphorylated by p38 MAPK. This phosphorylation promotes outgrowth that can be inhibited by a Ser to Ala mutation in this position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Second, the LD4 domain within the leucine-rich domains, that provides a binding site for a number of other signalling proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and deletion of which inhibits neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells growing on collagen substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Our results show markedly less neurite outgrowth following expression of the LD4 deletion mutant than full-length paxillin, suggesting an important role of the LD4 domain in &#x003b1;4 integrin-mediated neurite formation.</p><p>At least three possible mechanisms by which the LD4 domain might promote neurite outgrowth have been described. First, by the recruitment of the focal adhesion kinases FAK and Pyk2, both of which interact directly with the LD4 domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], are co-immunoprecipitated with paxillin in PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and are activated by interaction with the &#x003b1;4 cytoplasmic domain in T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Activation of these kinases occurs during growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, and inhibition of their activity by expression of a C-terminal construct (PRNK and FRNK, which act as dominant negative isoforms) blocks this outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Second, by recruitment of the Arf-GAP PKL. This in turn recruits the p21-associated kinase (PAK1) via a linking interaction with PIX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], and PAK1 localisation to the membrane in PC12 cells has been shown to promote neurite outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], potentially via the activation of cdc42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Third, by the regulation of the Rho GTPase Rac, as demonstrated by the prolonged levels of Rac activation, loss of directional migration and randomly-orientated lamellopodia formation in CHO cells expressing an LD4 deletion mutant of paxillin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. As expression of a constitutively active form of Rac in PC12 cells promotes cell spreading but not neurite outgrowth, whilst dominant negative Rac inhibits neurite outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], precise regulation of Rac activity is clearly essential for neurite formation by PC12 cells.</p><p>Directional cell migration is associated with high levels of Rac activity at the leading edge of the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. A key question for future studies will therefore be the role of paxillin and &#x003b1;4 integrin in the spatial control of Rac activity within the growth cone. The phosphorylated &#x003b1;4 integrins found in T cell lines will not bind paxillin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and are localised to the leading edge of migrating CHO cells, while non-phosphorylated integrins are found in the lateral edges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. As the &#x003b1;4-paxillin interaction inhibits Rac activity and lamellopodia formation, the extension of cellular protrusions driven by Rac and required for movement are therefore restricted to the leading edge of the cell and directionality of migration is achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. A mechanism by which the paxillin-integrin interaction reduces Rac activity is provided by recent work showing that recruitment of the Arf-GAP GIT1 inactivates Arf activity, which in turn results in decreased Rac activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Integrin phosphorylation therefore plays a key role in directional migration in some non-neural cells by providing a mechanism for the spatial regulation of paxillin dissociation from the &#x003b1;4 cytoplasmic domain.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Peripheral nerve repair is associated with a re-expression of embryonic isoforms of fibronectin that contain a binding site for the &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 integrin. This integrin is expressed on regenerating growth cones and promotes neurite outgrowth on embryonic fibronectins in cell culture. Using PC12 neuronal cells as a model system, we have shown here that the interaction of the adaptor protein paxillin with the integrin cytoplasmic domain is required for this outgrowth. We have also found that, in contrast to studies using T cells, there is no biochemical evidence for phosphorylation of &#x003b1;4 integrins in PC12 cells, suggesting that the dissociation of paxillin from the integrin mediated by this phosphorylation is either not required for growth cone motility or is achieved through different means. This points to potentially interesting differences between the mechanisms of two distinct forms of cell movement; directional migration in isolated cells and growth cone motility at the end of a cell process or axon.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-human &#x003b1;4, clone HP2/1 (Chemicon); hamster anti-rat &#x003b2;1, clone HA2/5 (Pharmingen), mouse anti-paxillin, clone 349 (Transduction Laboratories), mouse anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 (Transduction Laboratories).
