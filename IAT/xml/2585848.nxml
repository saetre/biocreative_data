This paradigm is particularly clear for the peripheral tissue effector lineages Th1, Th2, and Th17, which each control a distinct class of innate immune mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). These inflammatory effectors can be distinguished from T cells that perform the other essential and historically emblematic Th function, the regulation of antibody responses. However, our insight into the nature of such humoral effectors is relatively limited. The classical model that Th2 cells are responsible for antibody production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) has been criticized for failing to account for the production of the Th1-associated isotypes IgG2a and IgG2b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Further, although mice that lack the IL-4R signaling molecule STAT6 have severe defects in peripheral Th2 responses, they produce normal levels of the IgG isotypes upon immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>), indicating that Th2 development is dispensable even for IgG1 production.</p><p>More recently, consideration of the anatomy of antibody responses has provided insights into the specialized nature of B Th cells, although a comprehensive description of such CD4 Th subsets, which we refer to generally as humoral effectors, has yet to be achieved. The initial interactions between antigen-engaged CD4 T cells and B cells occur at the border of the T cell zone and follicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), and the early effects of Th cytokines can be observed there with the appearance of Ig heavy chain germline transcripts, the precursors to class switch recombination (CSR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Subsequently, subsets of B cells and Th cells migrate to the follicle and ultimately form the germinal center (GC), from which high-affinity, class-switched, and long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Localization of T cells around the GC light zone as well as an ongoing CD40L requirement for affinity maturation in the GC indicate that selection of mutant B cells is a critical function of T cell help at that site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). More recent work has provided the significant insight that this T cell function is mediated by a distinct follicular helper T (T<sub>FH</sub>) cell subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).</p><p>Characterization of the follicle-resident T<sub>FH</sub> cell subset in human tonsil has been facilitated by the identification of the surface markers CXCR5 and CD57 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). More recently, T<sub>FH</sub> cell differentiation has been achieved in vitro, allowing their further characterization in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). T<sub>FH</sub> cells do not produce Th cytokines such as IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-4, or IL-17 but likely mediate their function via CD40L and IL-21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Although multiple functions have been ascribed to IL-21 in vitro, data from in vivo experiments indicate that it is critical for IgG production. IL-21R&#x02013;deficient mice have decreased IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG3 levels, and IL-21R/IL-4 double-knockout mice have defects in the production of all switched isotypes, including IgG2a, although neither cytokine is necessary for the production of this isotype on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). In vitro, IL-21 promotes B cell apoptosis in the presence of anti-IgM, though death can be rescued by anti-CD40 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Exogenous IL-21 promotes CSR and IgG secretion in vivo and in vitro and is a potent inducer of B lymphocyte&#x02013;induced maturation protein 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), and the ability of human T cells to induce Ig secretion is largely dependent on IL-21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). These data are consistent with a role for IL-21 in T<sub>FH</sub> cell&#x02013;mediated centrocyte selection and differentiation into plasma cells. Still, it is not yet clear if IL-21 functions primarily within or outside the GC, or both.</p><p>How Th cells promote antibody-forming cell (AFC) differentiation outside the follicle is poorly defined. In addition to seeding the GC, a subset of B cells at the interface of the T cell zone and follicle up-regulate CD138, migrate to the red pulp border, and form the extrafollicular focus. At this site, clumps of proliferative AFCs, or plasmablasts, undergo CSR and differentiation into long-lived plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Because T cell localization to the extrafollicular focus has not been reported, current models do not include a role for local T cell help in those responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Instead, Th effects are thought to be exerted only before plasmablast migration from the T zone, though this idea has not been definitively demonstrated.</p><p>Clarifying the mechanics of the extrafollicular response is critical for understanding this important pathway for the production of autoantibodies. In normal mice, self-reactivity in B cells results in follicular exclusion and nonresponsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), and provision of T cell help to such autoreactive cells leads to extrafollicular AFC differentiation rather than GC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). A similar pattern of activation occurs spontaneously in some autoimmune strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>), the most well-characterized example being the MRL/MpJ-<italic>Fas<sup>lpr</sup></italic> (MRL<italic><sup>lpr</sup></italic>) model. In the spleens of MRL<italic><sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice, CXCR4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> plasmablasts form defined proliferative extrafollicular foci at the border of the T cell zone before migrating to the red pulp, in the absence of GC development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). This pattern of activation is in stark contrast to autoimmune sanroque mice, in which self-reactive T<sub>FH</sub> cells promote spontaneous GC development resulting in lupus-like pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Although IgG autoantibody production in MRL<italic><sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice is clearly T cell dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>), the details of this process are poorly defined. In addition to CSR, the extrafollicular focus of MRL<italic><sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice is also a site for somatic hypermutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>), a process that, in mammals, is dependent on T cell help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Importantly, how T cells support this GC-like activity outside the follicle is unclear. Recently, IL-21 has been shown to play a role in IgG autoantibody production and pathology in MRL<italic><sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>), though the relevant source of this cytokine remains loosely defined.</p><p>To investigate the mechanisms of T cell help for the extrafollicular autoantibody response genetically, we took advantage of the well-recognized requirement for the molecule inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS) for Th cell differentiation and IgG antibody responses. <italic>Icos</italic>-deficient (<italic>Icos<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>) animals have marked defects in GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>) and CSR to both IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013; and IL-4&#x02013;dependent isotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). A primary reason for these defects is that the development of T<sub>FH</sub> cells is ICOS dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Importantly, however, <italic>Icos<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> animals also have defects in IgG production early after immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>), suggesting that ICOS also plays a role in the extrafollicular response.</p><p>In this study, we find that <italic>Icos</italic> deficiency in MRL<italic><sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice causes an ontogenetic blockade of a population of effector T cells that down-regulate the surface glycoprotein P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1). In addition to expressing CD40L, PSGL-1<sup>lo</sup> T cells are the sole producers of IL-21 and are uniquely able to induce IgG secretion in B cells in an IL-21&#x02013; and CD40L&#x02013;dependent manner. In their absence, plasmablast expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and extrafollicular development of IgG<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> plasma cells are impaired. A substantial fraction of PSGL-1<sup>lo</sup> T cells express CXCR4 and localize to the extrafollicular sites in both MRL<italic><sup>lpr</sup></italic> and other autoimmune mice, and thus constitute a population of Th cells anatomically distinct from T<sub>FH</sub> cells.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>ICOS co-stimulation promotes isotype switching in the extrafollicular response</title><p>To assess the requirement for ICOS-dependent T cell help for the autoimmune extrafollicular response, we used intracellular staining to determine the number and isotype usage of plasma cells in the spleens of MRL<italic><sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice lacking the <italic>Icos</italic> gene. Spleen cells were stained for surface antigens and then fixed, permeabilized, and stained for both intracellular IgM and one of the four IgG isotypes. Plasma cells were identified by gating out TCR&#x003b2;/CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and autofluorescent cells (<italic>R3</italic>), and then gating on the B220<sup>lo</sup> CD138<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> population (<italic>R4</italic>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), and region <italic>R4</italic> was analyzed for intracellular Ig expression.

These data were in close agreement with serum anti&#x02013;double-stranded DNA antibody levels measured by isotype-specific ELISA (unpublished data), indicating that both Th1- and Th2-associated isotypes are ICOS dependent in this model.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>ICOS is required for generation of IgG<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> plasma cells.</bold> (A) Plasma cells were identified in the spleens of 23-wk-old <italic>Icos</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>Icos<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> MRL<italic><sup>lpr</sup></italic> animals (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 3&#x02013;5 for two experiments) by expression of CD138 and down-regulation of B220 (<italic>R4</italic>) after exclusion of T cells and autofluorescent cells (<italic>R3</italic>).

Although gut antigen&#x02013;driven GC cells in Peyer's patches were abundant and robustly ICOS dependent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), as expected, we indeed observed very few GC B cells in the spleens of MRL<italic><sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The GL7<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Ig&#x003ba;<sup>hi</sup> cells we observed and the few events falling in the GC gate are not reduced by <italic>Icos</italic> deficiency, and are unlikely to be true GC cells.

Because we did not observe a concomitant increase in IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> plasma cells with the decrease in post-switch cells in knockout animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>), it is likely that ICOS is also involved in the proliferation and/or survival of the cells that do undergo CSR.</p></sec><sec><title>ICOS is required for Th function and CXCR4 expression</title><p>The lack of IgG<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> plasma cells in mice lacking a CD4 T cell co-stimulator indicated a T cell defect ipso facto, so we proceeded to analyze the production of cytokines involved in the provision of B cell help, including the induction of CSR.

Another cytokine that can promote switching to IgG1 is IL-21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), and strikingly, the production of IL-21 was abolished in <italic>Icos</italic>-deficient cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). IL-21 is a Th cytokine that signals through a &#x003b3;<sub>c</sub> chain cytokine receptor family member, and its role in B cell plasmagenesis and class switching has recently emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). To directly assess the capacity of <italic>Icos<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> CD4 T cells to induce B cell class switching in culture, we sorted CD62L<sup>lo</sup> effectors, as described in the previous paragraph, and co-cultured them with sorted CD19<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B220<sup>hi</sup> CD44<sup>lo</sup> naive B cells from young MRL<italic><sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice, with or without stimulation by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. Under these conditions, <italic>Icos<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> effectors were significantly less efficient at inducing B cell class switching as assessed by ELISA on the culture supernatants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>), consistent with their impaired production of helper cytokines.</p><p>The inability of <italic>Icos<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> effectors to secrete IL-21 and efficiently promote IgG secretion was reminiscent of the finding that ICOS is required for T<sub>FH</sub> cell development in normal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). Because the spleens of MRL<italic><sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice are nearly devoid of GCs, however, the defect we observed in extrafollicular class switching was conceptually inconsistent with a loss of T<sub>FH</sub> cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that specialized humoral effector T cells may also act in the extrafollicular focus. As T<sub>FH</sub> cells express CXCR5 in similar fashion to follicular B cells, thus colocalizing to their site of interaction, we speculated that a population of Th cells might colocalize with extrafollicular plasmablasts through expression of CXCR4. Therefore, we analyzed CXCR4 and CXCR5 expression on B220<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> splenocytes and found that, indeed, a substantial percentage of CD4 T cells expressed CXCR4. Further, this CXCR4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> population was absolutely dependent on ICOS co-stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Conversely, CXCR5 expression was not only ICOS-independent but in fact elevated in its absence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). To interpret these data, it is important to consider that CXCR5 is not only expressed on T<sub>FH</sub> cells but is up-regulated on almost all CD4 T cells shortly after activation, mediating their initial localization to the T/B interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). Because CXCR5 expression in MRL<italic><sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice occurs largely on CD62L<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> effector cells (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), the accumulation of CXCR5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in <italic>Icos<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice likely represents effector cells in an early state of differentiation rather than T<sub>FH</sub> cells. Thus, these data suggest that this early migration program is unimpaired in the absence of ICOS but that further differentiation along an extrafollicular pathway is arrested. In combination with the defect in helper function in vitro and reduction in AID expression in vivo, the loss of CXCR4 expression suggested strongly to us that ICOS is required for the development of a T<sub>FH</sub> cell&#x02013;like CD4 effector subset that acts on plasmablasts.</p></sec><sec><title>Extrafollicular helper cells can be identified by down-regulation of PSGL-1</title><p>A parallel approach that we used to assess Th cell development in <italic>Icos<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice was to stain for other surface markers associated with Th cells in antibody responses. In the ovalbumin response, effector cells have been separated according to CD62L expression and P-selectin binding such that P-selectin ligand<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (P-lig<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) cells mediate delayed-type hypersensitivity, whereas P-lig<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD62L<sup>lo</sup> cells induce IgG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). P-lig, which is detected using a P-selectin&#x02013;Ig fusion protein, is generated by carbohydrate modification of PSGL-1, whereas unmodified PSGL-1 expression does not confer P-selectin binding. Because PSGL-1 has been reported to be constitutively expressed by T cells, we were surprised to find that among CD4 T cells that were negative for P-lig, a minor subset also down-regulated the PSGL-1 scaffold altogether (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Down-regulation of PSGL-1 was limited to the CD44<sup>hi</sup> and CD62L<sup>lo</sup> subset (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Thus, CD44<sup>hi</sup> antigen&#x02013;experienced CD4 T cells can be subdivided into three surface phenotypes according to the expression of CD62L and PSGL-1.

Thus, Th cells with a PSGL-1<sup>lo</sup> phenotype occur at high frequency in multiple autoimmune models, a subset of which can be found in extrafollicular regions.</p><fig position="float" id="fig9"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>PSGL-1<sup>lo</sup> extrafollicular T cells occur in other autoimmune models.</bold> (A) The percentage of CD44<sup>hi</sup> PSGL-1<sup>lo</sup> cells within the CD4 T cell compartment of RIP-LT&#x003b1;&#x003b2; and NZB/W F1 mice. 6&#x02013;10 mice at varying ages were analyzed, and representative plots of the indicated ages are shown.

Although the contribution of ICOS to GC responses has received significant attention, its role in extrafollicular responses has been neglected despite an early report that IgG production the first week after immunization, largely derived from the extrafollicular response, is ICOS dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). We have recapitulated these results in our own laboratory, where the percentage of CD19<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD138<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> surface IgG1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> plasmablasts 6 d after NP-CGG/alum immunization was substantially reduced in B6 <italic>Icos ligand<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice versus B6 controls (0.14 &#x000b1; 0.11% vs. 1.87 &#x000b1; 0.85%, respectively).</p><p>The ICOS-dependent Th cells that traffic to extrafollicular sites in MRL<italic><sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice were isolated and characterized based on their down-regulation of PSGL-1, though their essential features are expression of CXCR4, localization to the extrafollicular sites and B cell helper activity. Among the many effector cells that are generated in MRL<italic><sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice, the relatively small PSGL-1<sup>lo</sup> subset is remarkably unique in its ability to induce IgG secretion. One effector mechanism that is important for this function is the secretion of IL-21, an IL-2 family member previously shown to cooperate with IL-4 for IgG antibody production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). IL-21 has been implicated in GC responses, and there is also data to suggest that it functions in the extrafollicular pathway. Although extrafollicular isotype switching to IgG1 in response to NP-CGG can occur even in the dual absence of IL-4 and IL-13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), this early IgG1 production is completely blocked in IL-4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> IL-21R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> double-knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Thus, CXCR4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> extrafollicular Th cells might be a source of IL-21 in the normal extrafollicular IgG1 response. Our observation that PSGL-1<sup>lo</sup> T cells from MRL<italic><sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice, in contrast to T<sub>FH</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), also secrete IL-4 and IFN-&#x003b3; raises the possibility that isotype instruction by these switch cytokines may continue in the extrafollicular focus. Clarification of this point will require both single-cell analysis of cytokine production within the PSGL-1<sup>lo</sup> subset and histological examination of the location of IL-21 production. The former experiment has been hampered by the lack of an intracellular staining reagent for IL-21, and both experiments may be precisely addressed with an IL-21 reporter mouse.</p><p>PSGL-1 has been sensibly thought to be constitutively expressed on T cells, because P-selectin binding is regulated not by PSGL-1 expression but by inducible glycosyltransferases that modify the PSGL-1 glycoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>). We were surprised, therefore, to identify a population of activated CD4 T cells that had down-regulated the entire, presumably inactive, glycoprotein scaffold. Recently, however, PSGL-1 was also shown to participate in chemotactic responses to CCR7 ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>), providing a mechanistic reason why humoral effector T cells, which must leave the T cell zone to enter follicular or extrafollicular sites, down-regulate this molecule. Supporting a connection between PSGL-1 down-regulation and humoral effector function, CD4 T cells that are actively translating IL-4 protein in the lymph nodes of helminth-infected mice, as opposed to tissue-tropic effector cells requiring peripheral restimulation, also have a PSGL-1<sup>lo</sup> phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>).</p><p>In the MRL<italic><sup>lpr</sup></italic> autoantibody response, in which the extrafollicular pathway dominates, PSGL-1<sup>lo</sup> humoral effector T cells express CXCR4 and localize to the extrafollicular focus. In contrast, PSGL-1<sup>lo</sup> cells from NZB/W F1 and RIP-LT&#x003b1;&#x003b2; transgenic mice, which develop both extrafollicular and GC responses, were found to have both CXCR4- and CXCR5-expressing cells. Indeed, the expression of CXCR5, like CXCR4, was largely restricted to this population, indicating that the T<sub>FH</sub> cell subset also bears a PSGL-1<sup>lo</sup> phenotype. The follicular versus extrafollicular trafficking pattern of Th cells may be instructed by their cognate B cells, the latter differentiating along the GC or plasmablast pathway, as determined by factors such as strength of the BCR signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>).</p><p>The effector mechanisms we defined for extrafollicular PSGL-1<sup>lo</sup> cells from MRL<italic><sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice, IL-21 and CD40L, are also shared by T<sub>FH</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). These common features are not surprising given that T cell&#x02013;dependent CSR and plasmagenesis occur in both GC B cells and plasmablasts, and both IL-21 and CD40L regulate these processes. It is possible that the more distinct features of follicular versus extrafollicular responses, however, such as long-lived plasma cell and memory formation, may in part reflect unique products of follicular versus extrafollicular helper cells that have yet to be defined. Alternatively, the helper cells that support extrafollicular responses may not be ontogenetically or mechanistically distinct from T<sub>FH</sub> cells but simply exhibit an alternative trafficking pattern. Illuminating the relationships between these humoral effector cells will be aided by global comparison of their effector genes and lineage specification factors. In microarray experiments, T<sub>FH</sub> cells have been shown to express B cell leukemia/lymphoma 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>), an essential transcription factor in GC B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>). Whether non-T<sub>FH</sub> PSGL-1<sup>lo</sup> T cells from MRL<italic><sup>lpr</sup></italic> mice also express this transcription factor is currently under investigation.</p><p>Based on our data that PSGL-1<sup>lo</sup> CD4 T cells are absent in both <italic>Icos</italic> mutant and B cell&#x02013;deficient mice, we propose that the ICOS&#x02013; B7-related protein 1 interaction during T/B collaboration provides one of the critical signals for the development of humoral effector cells. Our observation that <italic>Icos<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> effectors are still reasonably potent at providing B cell help in culture may be attributed to the minimal requirements, such as CD40L and IL-4, for IgG induction in vitro. An alternative, though not exclusive, explanation is that humoral effector T cells fail to migrate appropriately to sites of B cell differentiation in vivo. In this view, the lack of PSGL-1<sup>lo</sup> cells could reflect a failure of humoral effector cells to down-regulate PSGL-1, rather than fail to develop per se, an interpretation that would be consistent with the reduced CXCR4 expression we observed in <italic>Icos<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> effectors. The severe defect in IL-21 secretion, however, indicates a broader block in helper cell differentiation. Still, whether ICOS provides a specific differentiation signal or simply allows humoral effector cells to expand and survive is not clear. In addition, signaling to B cells through the ICOS ligand, B7-related protein 1, itself could potentially regulate plasma cell differentiation, complementing the activity of IL-21 and CD40L. To what extent PSGL-1<sup>lo</sup> T cell effects on plasmablasts, such as AID induction, occur within the extrafollicular focus itself versus earlier at the T/B interface remains undefined.</p><p>Functional characteristics such as cytokine production are commonly used to stratify effector CD4 T cells such as Th1, Th2, or Th17. T<sub>FH</sub> cells, in contrast, are defined essentially by their trafficking pattern, though with a view to their functional specialty. We have characterized a novel population of B Th cells that occur in chronic autoimmunity that do not conform to effector cell categories as currently defined. It remains to be clarified whether these extrafollicular Th cells merit designation as a subset distinct from their follicular counterparts, or rather are T<sub>FH</sub> cells that are recruited to an alternative site of B cell activation in an autoimmune setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>MRL<italic><sup>lpr</sup></italic> animals were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory and were maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions at the Yale School of Medicine.
