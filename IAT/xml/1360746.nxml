The molecular mechanisms underlying its role in chromosome integrity, however, are largely unknown. To clarify the role of Mus81 in human cells, we deleted the gene in the human colon cancer cell line HCT116 by gene targeting. Here we demonstrate that Mus81 confers resistance to DNA crosslinking agents and slight resistance to other DNA-damaging agents. Mus81 deficiency spontaneously promotes chromosome damage such as breaks and activates the intra-S-phase checkpoint through the ATM-Chk1/Chk2 pathways. Furthermore, Mus81 deficiency activates the G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint through the ATM-Chk2 pathway and promotes DNA rereplication. Increased rereplication is reversed by the ectopic expression of Cdk1. Haploinsufficiency of Mus81 or Eme1 also causes similar phenotypes. These findings suggest that a complex network of the checkpoint pathways that respond to DNA double-strand breaks may participate in some of the phenotypes associated with Mus81 or Eme1 deficiency.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Precise replication of the entire genome during the S phase of the cell cycle is essential for cell survival. The progression of replication forks can be stalled in response to exogenous and endogenous sources, including depletion of deoxyribonucleotide pools, inhibition of replication proteins and aberrant DNA structures. Stalled replication forks can degenerate into broken forks, leading to chromosomal rearrangements and deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). To avoid such deleterious events, all eukaryotes have evolved cell cycle checkpoint machinery and DNA repair pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). The homologous recombination repair pathway contributes to the accurate repair of DNA damage; however, to promote cell survival, homologous recombination also participates in chromosomal rearrangements when replication forks are stalled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>).</p><p>Mus81 was originally identified as a member of the XPF family of endonucleases that physically interacts with Rad54 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and Cds1 (Chk2) in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The gene confers resistance to agents that lead to replication fork stalling or collapse, including ultraviolet (UV) radiation, methylmethane sulfonate (MMS), hydroxyurea and camptothecin, suggesting a role for Mus81 in the rescue of stalled and collapsed replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). In contrast, Mus81-deficient murine cells are not hypersensitive to camptothecin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). The functional binding partner of the protein is MMS4 in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) and Eme1 in <italic>S.pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). The synthetic lethality of <italic>mus81</italic> (or <italic>mms4</italic>) <italic>sgs1</italic> (or <italic>top3</italic>) double mutants suggests a functional link between Mus81 and Sgs1 helicases in the late steps of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, the Mus81&#x02013;Eme1 complex preferentially cleaves 3&#x02032;-flap structures, various aberrant replication fork structures, and nicked Holliday junctions, suggesting that the complex plays a role in stalled replication fork processing and DNA repair by homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).</p><p>Loss of Mus81, MMS4 or Eme1 results in a reduction in sporulation and spore viability in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Poor spore viability in <italic>mus81</italic> or <italic>eme1</italic> mutants of <italic>S.pombe</italic> is suppressed by eliminating Rec6 or Rec12, proteins required for the formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs), which initiates meiotic recombination. Expression of the bacterial Holliday junction resolvase RusA has been found to rescue the <italic>mus81</italic> meiotic defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Thus, Mus81, MMS4 and Eme1 have been implicated in the processing of homologous recombination intermediates in yeast meiosis. The role of the Mus81&#x02013;Eme1 complex in mitotic homologous recombination in mammals, however, remains uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Remarkably, both <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibit a profound predisposition to lymphomas and other cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), although a subsequent study found no increased susceptibility to cancer in a different <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>).</p><p>The role of Mus81 in genome integrity in response to replication stress has been proposed to be related to its physical association with Cds1 (Chk2) in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Cds1-dependent phosphorylation of Mus81 prevents it from cleaving stalled replication forks that lead to replication fork breakage and chromosomal rearrangements by dissociating it from chromatin in cells exposed to hydroxyurea. Spontaneous and mitomycin C (MMC)-induced DNA damage such as breaks and triradial exchanges is increased in <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse cells. In addition to these aberrations, the mutant cells have been shown to have an increased rate of aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>).</p><p>Despite accumulating evidence that Mus81 plays a role in the processing of aberrant replication fork structures, the molecular mechanisms underlying its role in chromosome stability remain unclear. To clarify the role of Mus81&#x02013;Eme1 in human cells, we deleted the genes in the human colon cancer cell line HCT116 by gene targeting. The advantages of using this cell line are that it allows efficient gene targeting in the presence of an intact p53 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) and the cellular ploidy is stable. Here we show that Mus81 deficiency activates the intra-S-phase and G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoints and promotes DNA rereplication. This promotion of DNA rereplication was reversed by the forced expression of Cdk1. These findings provide new insight into the role of the Mus81&#x02013;Eme1 complex in the control of human cell ploidy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Gene targeting at the Mus81 and Eme1 loci in HCT116</title><p>Targeting vectors were designed for in-frame insertion of promoterless drug resistance genes in exon 3 of <italic>Mus81</italic> or in exon 2 of <italic>Eme1</italic>.

Southern blot analysis using both 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-probes confirmed that both wild-type alleles had been correctly inactivated by gene targeting in the <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Northern blot analysis revealed no expression of the gene in these clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Because no additional bands were detected using the full-length <italic>Mus81</italic> cDNA as a probe, it is unlikely that aberrant transcripts were generated by the disruption of exon 3. The correct targeting events were confirmed by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Because knockout cells and some complemented cells grew slowly, we took the growth rate into account in the counting of colonies (see Materials and Methods). Modest sensitivity to MMC was observed in <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> cells (1.5-fold) and <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells (4-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We noted a similar mild sensitivity to cisplatin in <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells. Mus81 deficiency resulted in a slight sensitivity to UV radiation, MMS, hydroxyurea and ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B&#x02013;G</xref>). The expression of <italic>Mus81</italic> cDNA in <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells restored the sensitivities to DNA-damaging agents to the wild-type levels. A slight increase in sensitivity to cisplatin, UV radiation and hydroxyurea was observed in <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> cells. A similar sensitivity to MMC and hydroxyurea was found in <italic>Eme1</italic><sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> cells. The expression of Eme1 only partially complemented the sensitivity to MMC. This is probably explained by the level of Eme1 expression in complemented cells: even if levels comparable to the endogenous levels are achieved by constitutive expression, they may not be sufficient for full complementation in response to DNA damage. Furthermore, the level of Mus81 expression is strictly dependent on the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>), and the peak of Mus81 expression occurs in the S and G<sub>2</sub> phases. Like Mus81 expression, Eme1 expression may vary according to the stage of the cell cycle. These results indicate that Mus81 and Eme1 contribute to the resistance of human cells to DNA-damaging agents such as DNA crosslinking agents.</p><p>Rad51 plays a central role in the early stages of homologous recombination and forms nuclear foci in a DNA damage-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>).

To investigate the role of Mus81 in the Rad51-dependent recombination pathway, we examined damage-dependent focus formation of Rad51 and Rad54 by treating cells with 0.8 &#x000b5;g/ml MMC or 8 Gy of ionizing radiation.

Cyclin B kinase activity was increased 6 h after release in wild-type cells, whereas an increase in the kinase activity was not obvious at 6 h but was clear at 8 h after release in the mutant. Repeated experiments demonstrated that such a difference between the wild-type and mutant cells could be observed either 6 or 8 h after release, consistent with the results from the FACS analysis. There were no apparent differences in cyclin B and Cdk1 levels between wild-type and <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells, excluding the possibility that reduced cyclin B kinase activity was due to repression of these proteins. In addition, we noticed that the level of cyclin B expression was high even in the G<sub>1</sub> phase at 10 h in the HCT116 cell line. This aberrant expression of cyclin B has been observed in some human cancer cells, suggesting that it may be associated with abnormal proliferation of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). The high level of cyclin B may account for the sustained cyclin B kinase activity during the early G<sub>1</sub> phase in wild-type cells.</p><p>Activation of Cdk1 by association with cyclin B is essential for the initiation of the M phase. The delay of cyclin B activity in <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells may simply indicate that the cell cycle progression was delayed by the preceding S phase delay. Alternatively, G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint activation may be involved in the delay of cyclin B activity. Chk1 and Chk2 play a role in the G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint as effector kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). To investigate whether the G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint was activated in the mutants, we therefore examined Chk1 and Chk2 kinase activities using a recombinant GST-Cdc25C (200&#x02013;256) fusion protein as a substrate. These kinases preferentially phosphorylate Cdc25C on Ser-216 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). We examined the difference in Chk2 kinase activity in synchronized cells. Chk2 kinase activity was significantly increased in the Mus81 mutant 6 h after release, whereas an increase was not evident in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). There were no differences in the levels of Chk2. A more than 3-fold increase in Chk2 activity was also observed in two <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> cell lines as well as in two <italic>Eme1</italic><sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> cell lines, excluding the possibility that activation of Chk2 was due to a clonal variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Expression of <italic>Mus81</italic> or <italic>Eme1</italic> cDNA reduced this increase in Chk2 activity in the mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Chk2 kinase phosphorylation of Cdc25C was not clearly observed before 6 h, indicating that the increase in this activity at 6 h reflected the G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint activation rather than a delay of the cell cycle progression. The S phase checkpoint was activated in <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells from 0 to 4 h after release.</p><p>The increase in Chk2 kinase activity was abolished in the presence of 0.5 mM caffeine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Treatment with 0.5 mM caffeine for 1 h has little effect on DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>), excluding the possibility that the elimination of Chk2 activity by caffeine was due to the delay in cell cycle progression. Because caffeine inhibits ATM and ATR kinase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>), they are likely required for this increase in Chk2 kinase activity. For this reason, we further investigated the effect of siRNA silencing of ATM and ATR on Chk2 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>). Chk2 activity was reduced by silencing of ATM but not by silencing of ATR, indicating that the activation of ATM in response to DNA damage is responsible for the increase in Chk2 activity in <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells. In contrast, there was no clear difference in the phosphorylation of GST-Cdc25C (200&#x02013;256) by Chk1 in wild-type and <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

Consistent with this idea, many delayed cells eventually proceeded into the M and G<sub>1</sub> phases. These results show that, in addition to the intra-S-phase checkpoint, the G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint was activated in the Mus81 mutant cells via the ATM-Chk2 pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of Cdk1 prevents rereplication</title><p>Because deletion of Cdk1 promotes DNA rereplication in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>), reduced cyclin B kinase activity is likely to cause increased rereplication in Mus81 mutants. We examined this possibility by overexpressing Cdk1 in the Mus81 mutants. Cdk1 kinase activity is regulated by accumulation of Cdk1-associated cyclin B and removal of inhibitory protein phosphorylations. Western blot analysis revealed that levels of cyclin B were high in G<sub>2</sub>/M in <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells while the levels of Cdk1 were constant, suggesting that overexpressed Cdk1 may be associated with endogenous cyclin B. Given that overexpressed Cdk1 is not phosphorylated on inhibitory phosphorylation sites by overcoming Wee1 and Myt1 kinase activities, Cdk1 activity is expected to be increased. Because we showed that p21 is not induced in <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, it is not necessary to consider direct inhibition of Cdk2 activity by p21. Consistent with this hypothesis, the reduction of cyclin B kinase activity was reversed by the overexpression of Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). The increase in cyclin B activity by ectopic expression of Cdk1 reduced the frequency of tetraploidy from 2.46 to 0.50% and 0.54% in the two <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cell lines (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the increased rereplication in Mus81 mutants was reversed by ectopic expression of Cdk1.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the current studies, we demonstrated that Mus81&#x02013;Eme1 deficiency activates the intra-S-phase and G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoints in response to DNA damage and promotes DNA rereplication. In addition, we confirmed that the Mus81&#x02013;Eme1 complex contributes to the resistance against DNA-damaging agents in human cells. These assays show quite small differences, suggesting that there may be functional redundancy between the Mus81&#x02013;Eme1 complex and other repair proteins in the response to DNA damage. Consistent with extensive genetic studies in yeast, the results of the present study indicate that there is no functional difference between Mus81 and Eme1 in human cells.</p><p>Identification of the physiological substrates of the Mus81&#x02013;Eme1 complex has long remained elusive. However, a study showing the presence of resolvase activities in two separate fractions from human cell extracts has significantly enhanced our understanding of this complex system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). The Mus81&#x02013;Eme1 complex shows a greater activity for the 3&#x02032;-flap and three-way branched fork structures, whereas the Rad51C complex shows specific activity for Holliday junctions. These findings suggest that replication forks or 3&#x02032;-flaps may be the <italic>in vivo</italic> substrates of the Mus81 endonuclease. The present finding that the Mus81&#x02013;Eme1 complex confers resistance to DNA crosslinking agents, MMS and hydroxyurea supports this idea because these agents cause stalled replication forks. However, it is also possible that recombination intermediates such as D-loops and Holliday junctions are the <italic>in vivo</italic> substrates of the endonuclease. This possibility is supported by the observation that mutations in genes such as <italic>RAD51</italic>, <italic>RAD52</italic>, <italic>RAD55</italic> and <italic>RAD57</italic> that play early roles in recombination suppress the synthetic lethality of <italic>mus81</italic> (or <italic>mms4</italic>) <italic>sgs1</italic> (or <italic>top3</italic>) mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). If Mus81-Mms4 directly cleaves replication forks and does not play a late role, synthetic lethality would not be rescued by a defect in these genes. The physical interaction of Mus81 with Rad54 in yeast is consistent with this idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Furthermore, Mus81 has been shown to play a key role in the Rhp51-independent recombination repair pathway in fission yeast by resolving D-loops formed by Rad22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>).</p><p>We observed spontaneous activation of the intra-S-phase checkpoint through two independent cascades in <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells. The ATM-Chk2-Cdc25A-Cdk2 pathway has been shown to play a role in the intra-S-phase checkpoint in response to DSBs. In addition, the damage-dependent Chk1 pathway was activated by ATM but not by ATR. This finding strongly suggests that the Mus81&#x02013;Eme1 complex is involved in the processing of DSBs. This notion is also supported by the present finding that Mus81 or Eme1 deficiency led to the activation of the G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint through the ATM-Chk2 pathway. DSBs that escape the intra-S-phase checkpoint and/or DSBs generated in G<sub>2</sub> can activate the G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint. Thus, the recombination intermediates are likely to be the <italic>in vivo</italic> target of the Mus81&#x02013;Eme1 complex. It is also possible that stalled replication forks, if unprocessed, generate DSBs, which could activate the ATM-dependent checkpoint pathway. In contrast to ATM, ATR kinase activity is activated by several kinds of DNA damage, including those caused by UV radiation and chemicals that make bulky base lesions, as well as by stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). Although the present study demonstrated that Chk1 is not activated by ATR, it is very likely that ATR was activated in <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells. Despite the fact that cyclin A activity was strongly repressed, activation of Chk1 and Chk2 could account for the S phase delay only in a small proportion of the Mus81 and Eme1 mutant cells. In addition to the intra-S-phase checkpoint, the replication checkpoint initiated by ATR is likely to play a major role in the S phase delay resulting from Mus81 or Eme1 deficiency. Identification of the effectors that protect the replication fork will address this issue.</p><p>Mus81 has been shown to be physically associated with Cds1 (Chk2) in yeast and in human cells, suggesting a functional link between these proteins. We found that ionizing radiation- or MMC-induced phosphorylation of Chk2 on Thr-68 is not affected by a deficiency of Mus81 (data not shown), suggesting that Mus81 does not directly regulate the function of Chk2. Conversely, phosphorylation of Mus81 by Chk2 has been shown to be required for the maintenance of genome integrity during replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).</p><p>Evidence for the molecular mechanisms underlying checkpoint activation in response to DNA damage has largely come from studies in cells exposed to DNA-damaging agents. In contrast to these studies, our results provide new insight into the mechanism of checkpoint activation in response to DNA damage that spontaneously arises from a defect in a single process of DNA repair where there is no exogenous DNA damage. Reactive cellular metabolites are assumed to become endogenous genotoxic insults. Because the cells were more sensitive to DNA crosslinking agents than other agents, it is of interest to identify the sources of endogenous DNA interstrand crosslinks.</p><p>In addition to increased chromosomal aberrations such as gaps and breaks, we found increased frequencies of tetraploidy in the Mus81&#x02013;Eme1 mutants. In yeast, B-type cyclin-dependent kinases prevent rereplication by several overlapping mechanisms, including phosphorylation of ORC, down-regulation of Cdc6 and nuclear exclusion of MCM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). The ability of these kinases to prevent rereplication is also supported by the finding that cyclin B/Cdk1 is associated with replication origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). In human cells, deletion of Cdk1 by gene targeting results in increased levels of tetraploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). It is therefore likely that reduced cyclin B/Cdk1 kinase activity caused increased rereplication in the Mus81 mutants. This model is supported by our finding that the overexpression of Cdk1 prevents rereplication in Mus81 mutants, although we cannot exclude the possibility that Cdk1 overexpression plays an indirect role in preventing rereplication. Chromosomes in tetraploid cells are very unstable, as demonstrated by the finding that tetraploid-derived mouse tumors have numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). The aneuploidy observed in mouse <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells may result from chromosome instability in tetraploid cells. Recent evidence has suggested that aneuploid cells proceed through a tetraploid state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). This possibility may also account for the absence of a clear peak of 8C DNA content in <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells in FACS profiles. We observed extremely low frequency of DNA contents ranging from 4C to 8C at high magnification, which apparently concealed a small peak at 8C.</p><p>Haploinsufficiency of <italic>Mus81</italic> was found to cause phenotypes similar to those of a complete loss of the gene. Similar results were observed for <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Loss of heterozygosity is commonly observed in tumors. The human <italic>Mus81</italic> gene maps to chromosome 11q13.1. Although loss of heterozygosity at the <italic>Mus81</italic> locus in tumors has not been reported, normal or precancerous cells have a chance to lose one allele of <italic>Mus81</italic>. Given that cells lose one copy of <italic>Mus81</italic> during tumor progression, aberrant replication fork structures and recombination intermediates are expected to accumulate and eventually lead to further genomic instability. Haploinsufficiency of <italic>Mus81</italic> may contribute to tumor progression through this mechanism. It is noteworthy that predisposition to cancer was not observed over 15 months in another <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). This discrepancy may be explained by a difference in strains. However, it is most likely that Mus81 deficiency does not directly contribute to tumor formation but rather induces chromosome aberrations such as aneuploidy that do not directly lead to cancer. A long latency, during which chromosomal aberrations accumulate, may be required for tumor formation in such a situation. It is also possible that additional modifiers that promote different types of genomic instability are required for tumor formation.</p><p>The present finding that small changes in the gene dosage of Mus81&#x02013;Eme1 promote rereplication implicates the significance of small amounts of genotoxic insults in chromosome stability. Even in the absence of exogenous genotoxic sources, endogenous insults can lead to chromosome instability by damaging DNA. Aberrant fork structures and recombination intermediates are expected to accumulate in cells exposed to genotoxic insults. These cells suffer from increased rereplication in response to DNA damage, which does not immediately lead to tumor-associated genomic aberrations. Instead, this pathway can contribute to tumor development by inducing centrosome dysfunction and aneuploidy after numerous rounds of the cell cycle. This scenario may explain cases of radiation-induced carcinogenesis in which patients develop tumors after long periods of exposure to low-dose radiation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank M.
