The contribution of alternative splicing to proteomic diversity in the nervous system has been well documented, whereas the role of alternative polyadenylation in this process is less well understood. Since the CstF-64 polyadenylation protein is known to be an important regulator of tissue-specific polyadenylation, we examined its expression in brain and other organs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We discovered several closely related splice variants of CstF-64 &#x02013; collectively called &#x003b2;CstF-64 &#x02013; that could potentially contribute to proteomic diversity in the nervous system. The &#x003b2;CstF-64 splice variants are found predominantly in the brains of several vertebrate species including mice and humans. The major &#x003b2;CstF-64 variant mRNA is generated by inclusion of two alternate exons (that we call exons 8.1 and 8.2) found between exons 8 and 9 of the CstF-64 gene, and contains an additional 147 nucleotides, encoding 49 additional amino acids. Some variants of &#x003b2;CstF-64 contain only the first alternate exon (exon 8.1) while other variants contain both alternate exons (8.1 and 8.2). In mice, the predominant form of &#x003b2;CstF-64 also contains a deletion of 78 nucleotides from exon 9, although that variant is not seen in any other species examined, including rats. Immunoblot and 2D-PAGE analyses of mouse nuclear extracts indicate that a protein corresponding to &#x003b2;CstF-64 is expressed in brain at approximately equal levels to CstF-64. Since &#x003b2;CstF-64 splice variant family members were found in the brains of all vertebrate species examined (including turtles and fish), this suggests that &#x003b2;CstF-64 has an evolutionarily conserved function in these animals. &#x003b2;CstF-64 was present in both pre- and post-natal mice and in different regions of the nervous system, suggesting an important role for &#x003b2;CstF-64 in neural gene expression throughout development. Finally, experiments in representative cell lines suggest that &#x003b2;CstF-64 is expressed in neurons but not glia.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first report of a family of splice variants encoding a key polyadenylation protein that is expressed in a nervous system-specific manner. We propose that &#x003b2;CstF-64 contributes to proteomic diversity by regulating alternative polyadenylation of neural mRNAs.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Alternative mRNA processing is the mechanism by which multiple forms of mRNAs are generated from a common pre-mRNA via differential ligation of exons (alternative splicing, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]), or differential 3' end site choice (alternative polyadenylation, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). Alternative mRNA processing contributes to proteomic diversity by generating protein isoforms that have different biochemical and structural properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Both of these processes are regulated in a tissue-specific manner, with the highest incidence occurring in the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Not surprisingly, the processes of splicing and polyadenylation are coupled, leading to a high degree of interaction between the two processing machineries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, there have been only a few reports of alternative processing of mRNAs encoding critical proteins of the polyadenylation machinery: alternative splicing of poly(A) polymerase (PAP, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]) and alternative splicing and polyadenylation of the 77 kDa subunit of the cleavage stimulation factor (CstF-77) in Drosophila [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] have been reported. Alternatively spliced forms of these and other polyadenylation proteins could contribute to expansion of the proteome by promoting tissue-specific polyadenylation.</p><p>Like splicing, polyadenylation is an essential step in gene expression. The process of 3' end formation promotes transcription termination, mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytosol, mRNA stability, and translation initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In addition to having a constitutive role in gene expression, polyadenylation also contributes to the generation of mRNA isoforms in a tissue-specific manner, particularly in the nervous system. For example, the mRNAs encoding &#x003b2;-adducin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], huntingtin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], amyloid precursor protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], ferritin heavy chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], glutamate transporter EAAT2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], voltage-gated potassium channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], 68-kDa neurofilament [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and many other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] have alternative polyadenylation signals that lead to production of nervous system-specific transcripts. Nervous system-specific coupling of alternative splicing and polyadenylation of mRNAs encoding calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], neural cell adhesion molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and vesl-1/homer1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] proteins lead to generation of tissue-specific protein isoforms from a common pre-mRNA. It has been speculated that use of alternative polyadenylation signals in these mRNAs may be due to expression of nervous system-specific polyadenylation factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], although none have been reported. CstF-64 is a key subunit of the polyadenylation complex that is known to function in regulation of polyadenylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Important domains of CstF-64 include an RNA-binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], CstF-77 interaction domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], proline/glycine-rich domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], MEARA repeat domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], and a conserved C-terminal domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Furthermore, a paralogous form of CstF-64, &#x003c4;CstF-64, was previously discovered in mouse male germ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and was found to be essential for normal spermatogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>In this paper, we report the discovery of a family of alternatively spliced forms of the CstF-64 mRNA that are expressed in the nervous system of all vertebrate animals we have examined. These splice variants, which we collectively call &#x003b2;CstF-64, are due to inclusion of one or two alternate exons between constitutive exons 8 and 9. In mice, these alternate exons join to an alternative 3' splice site within exon 9. Mice express another minor splice variant, &#x003b1;CstF-64, which is formed by joining of exon 8 to the alternative 3' splice site in exon 9. However, the &#x003b1;CstF-64 splice variant was not observed in any other species including rats or humans. All the &#x003b2;CstF-64 splice variants are in-frame with the CstF-64 coding region and encode up to 49 additional amino acids in the proline/glycine-rich domain. The &#x003b2;CstF-64 splice variants are expressed in brains of many vertebrate species, including human and turtle, and the genome of simple vertebrates such as pufferfish and zebrafish contain homologous sequences. This leads us to hypothesize that the &#x003b2;CstF-64 variants have an important evolutionarily conserved role in brain function. Other experiments suggest that &#x003b2;CstF-64 is expressed predominantly in neurons, suggesting that it plays a role in expression of alternatively polyadenylated mRNAs important for neuronal function, thus contributing to proteomic diversity in the nervous system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Alternatively spliced CstF-64 mRNAs are present in mouse brain</title><p>Previous results from our laboratory indicated that CstF-64 mRNA could be subject to alternative splicing (B. Dass and A. M. Wallace, unpublished). In order to investigate this possibility, we conducted an RT-PCR survey of CstF-64 mRNA in mouse tissues using primers that together span the entire CstF-64 coding region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). RNA was isolated from various mouse tissues as indicated and subjected to RT-PCR using primer pairs A, B, C and D that span exons 1&#x02013;5, 5&#x02013;8, 7&#x02013;11 and 9&#x02013;14 respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). RT-PCR with primer pairs A, B, and D yielded a single PCR product in all tissues that corresponded to the reported form of CstF-64 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, panels <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold>, <bold>d</bold>, lanes 1&#x02013;8). This suggests little or no alternative splicing between exons 1&#x02013;8 and 9&#x02013;14. However, RT-PCR using primer pair C (which spans exons 7&#x02013;11) resulted in multiple PCR products (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, panel <bold>c</bold>). Every mouse tissue examined showed the presence of the reported form of CstF-64 (595 bp) and a shorter splice variant that we named &#x003b1;CstF-64 (panel <bold>c</bold>, lanes 1&#x02013;8). Cloning and sequencing of the &#x003b1;CstF-64 PCR product indicated that the shorter splice variant of CstF-64 was generated by joining of exon 8 to an alternative 3' splice site in exon 9 resulting in an mRNA molecule shorter by 78 nucleotides (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). We reported this alternatively spliced form to GenBank as &#x003b1;CstF-64, variant 4 (GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU616681">EU616681</ext-link>). The &#x003b1;CstF-64 splice variant is in frame with exon 9, and should result in a protein isoform that is shorter by 26 amino acids (not tested, but see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Since the &#x003b1;CstF-64 splice variant was not expressed in any other species we examined (see below), we chose not to characterize it further.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>An alternatively spliced mRNA of CstF-64 is present in mouse brain</bold>. <bold>A) </bold>Gene structure of CstF-64 and location of primer pairs.

Cloning and sequencing of the larger PCR product revealed that it contained an additional 147 nucleotides between exon 8 and the &#x003b1;CstF-64 splice site within exon 9 (see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> for nucleotide sequence). We named the alternate exons 8.1 and 8.2, and the longer brain-expressed variant CstF-64, &#x003b2;CstF-64. The above form of mouse &#x003b2;CstF-64 containing exons 8.1, 8.2 and use of alternative 3' splice site was given the GenBank nomenclature &#x003b2;CstF-64, variant 1 (GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU616682.1">EU616682.1</ext-link>). We compared the sequence of the &#x003b2;CstF-64 variant region to the mouse genome and determined that &#x003b2;CstF-64 was generated by splicing of two alternate exons (8.1 and 8.2, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) from the intronic region between exons 8 and 9 and selection of an alternative 3' splice site in exon 9. Exons 8.1 and 8.2 contained 60 and 87 nucleotides respectively. The alternative splicing patterns suggests that &#x003b2;CstF-64 remains in-frame with the CstF-64 coding region, and that it encodes an expressed protein isoform of CstF-64. The predicted domain structure of the protein isoform encoded by &#x003b2;CstF-64 mRNA is illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>; this predicted protein isoform would lack 26 amino acids in the proline/glycine-rich domain of CstF-64 encoded by exon 9 and contain an additional 49 amino acids encoded by exons 8.1 and 8.2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). BLAST comparison of the brain-expressed &#x003b2;CstF-64 domain to all sequences in GenBank revealed no other described proteins with similar features (not shown). Thus, these data suggest that mouse &#x003b2;CstF-64 mRNA encodes a protein in brain that is 23 amino acids longer than CstF-64, containing a unique 49 amino acid brain-specific domain.</p></sec><sec><title>The &#x003b2;CstF-64 protein isoform is expressed in mouse brain</title><p>In order to investigate whether the &#x003b2;CstF-64 protein was expressed in mouse brain, antibodies were raised against 16 amino acids of the unique 49 amino acid domain of the protein (Materials and Methods). The specificity of the anti-&#x003b2;CstF-64 antibody was tested using recombinant &#x003b2;CstF-64 and CstF-64 proteins expressed in HeLa cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Plasmids encoding epitope-tagged (3XFLAG)-&#x003b2;CstF-64 and CstF-64 proteins were transfected into HeLa cells as described in "Materials and Methods". Whole cell lysates were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using anti-&#x003b2;CstF-64 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, top panel), anti-FLAG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, middle panel), and anti-tubulin antibodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, bottom panel). This experiment demonstrated that the &#x003b2;CstF-64 epitope was not detected in HeLa cells (lane 1) or in HeLa cells transfected with FLAG-CstF-64 (lane 2) but was expressed at the predicted size in HeLa cells transfected with FLAG-&#x003b2;CstF-64 (lane 3) suggesting that the anti-&#x003b2;CstF-64 antibody could uniquely distinguish CstF-64 and &#x003b2;CstF-64 in mammalian cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The &#x003b2;CstF-64 protein is expressed predominantly in mouse brain</bold>. <bold>A) </bold>Whole cell extracts from HeLa cells transfected with 800 ng of either 3XFLAG (lane 1), 3XFLAG-CstF-64 (lane 2) or 3XFLAG-&#x003b2;CstF-64 (lane 3) were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-&#x003b2;CstF-64 (upper panel), anti-FLAG (middle panel), or anti-&#x003b1;-Tubulin (lower panel) antibodies.

Nuclear extracts from the indicated mouse tissues were subjected to immunoblot analysis using the anti-&#x003b2;CstF-64 and anti-CstF-64 antibodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Using the anti-CstF-64 antibody, CstF-64 was detected in all tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, lower panel). In contrast, using the anti-&#x003b2;CstF-64 antibody, a protein of approximately 68 kDa was detected in brain but not in other tissues examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, upper panel, compare lanes 1 and 2&#x02013;7). Detection of this protein was blocked by preincubation of the antibody with the 16 amino acid peptide that was used as an immunogen (lane 9). These results suggest that while the CstF-64 protein is expressed in most or all tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], the &#x003b2;CstF-64 isoform is restricted to brain and probably other neural tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003b2;CstF-64 and CstF-64 protein levels are similar in mouse brain</title><p>We wanted to investigate the relative levels of the CstF-64 and &#x003b2;CstF-64 proteins in mouse brain. Since we could not resolve &#x003b2;CstF-64 from CstF-64 proteins in a single dimension (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and data not shown), 2D-PAGE analysis was employed to investigate this. Nuclear extracts from mouse brain and liver were resolved in the first dimension by isoelectric focusing and in the second dimension by SDS-PAGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Using the anti-CstF-64 antibody, at least two closely opposed patterns of spots were detected in brain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, panel <bold>a</bold>) while a single pattern of spots was detected in liver (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, panel <bold>c</bold>). The basic to acidic range of spots most likely reflects differential phospohorylation of CstF-64 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Identical blots were probed with the anti-&#x003b2;CstF-64 antibody, and only a single pattern of spots was detected in brain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, panel <bold>b</bold>), while no signal was detected in liver (panel <bold>d</bold>). Alignment of the anti-CstF-64 blot (panel <bold>a</bold>) with the anti-&#x003b2;CstF-64 blot (panel <bold>b</bold>) confirmed that the anti-&#x003b2;CstF-64 pattern overlapped with the upper pattern in the anti-CstF-64 blot. This suggested that only the upper pattern detected in brain by the anti-CstF-64 antibody contained the &#x003b2;CstF-64 epitope. Judging by the relative intensities of the two patterns of spots in brain (panel <bold>a</bold>), we estimate that the protein levels of CstF-64 and &#x003b2;CstF-64 are approximately the same in mouse brain. Interestingly, a faint pattern of spots is seen in both brain and liver using the anti-CstF-64 antibody (panels <bold>a </bold>and <bold>c</bold>, asterisks). We speculate that this might represent the mouse-specific &#x003b1;CstF-64 protein isoform.</p></sec><sec><title>The &#x003b2;CstF-64 family of splice variants is evolutionarily conserved</title><p>In order to determine whether &#x003b2;CstF-64 was also expressed in brains of other mammalian species, RT-PCR analysis was conducted using human RNA samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). RT-PCR analysis using human-specific primers flanking exons 8 and 9 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) indicated that CstF-64 mRNA was present in brain, liver and testis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;3). A larger PCR product was detected in human brain RNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lane 1). Smaller amounts of this product were also detected in human testis (lane 3). Cloning and sequencing of the larger PCR product from human brain revealed a product that contained only exon 8.1 and lacked exon 8.2 and use of the alternative 3' splice site. This demonstrated that the alternatively spliced &#x003b2;CstF-64 isoform in human brain differed from that in mice. We named this isoform, &#x003b2;CstF-64 variant 2 (GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU616679.1">EU616679.1</ext-link>). However, EST database searches (NCBI) showed that mRNAs containing exon 8.1 joined to exon 8.2 were found in humans (Accession numbers: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AK095684.1">AK095684.1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DA513594.1">DA513594.1</ext-link> and wild boar (Accession number: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AJ959057.1">AJ959057.1</ext-link>). Therefore, using primers specific to the predicted exon 8.2, we detected mRNAs containing this exon in humans (data not shown). We have never observed a &#x003b2;CstF-64 variant mRNA (either by database searches or by cloning) containing exon 8 joined to exon 8.2 in either humans, mice or any other mammals. The &#x003b2;CstF-64 mRNA that contained both exons 8.1 and 8.2 but lacked use of the alternative 3' splice site in exon 9 was given the GenBank nomenclature, &#x003b2;CstF-64 variant 3 (GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU616680.1">EU616680.1</ext-link>). These data suggested that both &#x003b2;CstF-64 variant 2 (exon 8.1 only) and &#x003b2;CstF-64 variant 3 (exon 8.1 and 8.2) are expressed in human brain.

Additionally, survey of the whole-genome-shotgun sequence database at NCBI showed a high degree of conservation of exons 8.1 and 8.2 in the genomes of other mammalian species such as guinea pig, horse, cat, and others. Finally, using BLASTX and BLASTP searches at the NCBI database, amino acids encoded by exon 8.1 were predicted to be present in proteins from chimpanzee, cow, dog (eutherian mammals), platypus (monotreme), Xenopus (amphibian), pufferfish, and zebrafish (fish). We note that exon 8.2 was not explicitly observed in these species, but the incomplete nature of some of these genome data sets does not allow us to rule out its presence.

In mice, the predominant form of these splice variants includes two alternate exons (8.1 and 8.2) joined to an alternative 3' splice site in exon 9, encoding an additional 49 amino acids while deleting 26 amino acids from exon 9. Interestingly, a smaller splice variant, &#x003b1;CstF-64, which was expressed widely in mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), was not observed in non-rodent species, suggesting it arose independently of the &#x003b2;CstF-64 variants. We summarized the nomenclature of these isoforms in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>. Since our data demonstrate that the &#x003b2;CstF-64 protein is expressed in mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), and that the &#x003b2;CstF-64 mRNA family is present in all vertebrate species examined, we propose that the &#x003b2;CstF-64 protein variant has an ancient and essential role in neural function. We hypothesize that &#x003b2;CstF-64 regulates alternative polyadenylation in these tissues, leading to greater diversity of neural gene expression.</p><p>A survey of the EST and protein databases (BLASTX and BLASTP programs) indicated that exon 8.1 was predicted to be present in mammalian and non-mammalian genomes. In contrast, a similar analysis showed that exon 8.2 was predicted to be present only in mammalian genomes. This suggests the possibility that exon 8.2 appeared after the divergence of mammals and other vertebrates, and might serve to supplement the function of the more ancient exon 8.1. We also found that the intronic regions between exons 8.1, 8.2 and 9 were highly conserved between mice and humans (84% identity). Since the intronic regions and exons 8.1 and 8.2 likely contain splicing regulatory sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], this supports the notion that the region between exons 8 and 9 is a "hot spot" for alternative splicing during evolution. We failed to detect &#x003b2;CstF-64 exonic sequences in invertebrates such as Drosophila [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] and the simple chordate <italic>Ciona intestinalis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], leading us to hypothesize that &#x003b2;CstF-64 has a role in aspects of mRNA polyadenylation that are specific to higher vertebrates, perhaps being critical for important features of neural functions such as myelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>In surveying rodent and human neuronal and glial cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), we obtained data suggesting that &#x003b2;CstF-64 expression was restricted to neurons in the nervous system. Even though we did not detect &#x003b2;CstF-64 in any of the glial cell lines examined, we do not rule out the possibility that it might be expressed in normal glial cells. Detailed immunohistochemical analysis of brain slices will provide a better understanding of &#x003b2;CstF-64 expression in neurons and glia.</p><p>We obtained data suggesting that &#x003b2;CstF-64 was expressed in cell lines that represent neural progenitor cells and are neuroendocrine in nature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). For example, we found evidence for &#x003b2;CstF-64 expression in neural-crest derived cell lines such as CA-77 and thyroid carcinoma cells. We also obtained data suggesting that while &#x003b2;CstF-64 was expressed in undifferentiated and NGF-differentiated PC-12 cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), it was not expressed in adrenal gland (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). PC-12 cells, unlike adrenal chromaffin cells, are thought to possess the pluripotency of primitive progenitor cells such as neural crest cells. These data support the hypothesis that &#x003b2;CstF-64 is important for neuronal gene expression.</p><p>What might be the function of &#x003b2;CstF-64 in the nervous system? Our finding that &#x003b2;CstF-64 was expressed throughout the nervous system and at different stages of development suggests that it might be important for global neural gene expression and brain function. Several studies have indicated that many neural mRNAs have multiple polyadenylation sites in their 3' UTRs or use sites that differ from those in other tissues. Many of these mRNAs have regulatory elements surrounding the alternative polyadenylation sites. Differential use of polyadenylation sites within the 3' UTR has been shown to regulate translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], and rate of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] of these neural mRNAs. It has been hypothesized that tissue-specific use of polyadenylation sites in these mRNAs might be due to the expression of nervous system-specific polyadenylation factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Our discovery of the nervous system-specific &#x003b2;CstF-64 splice variant supports the above hypothesis, and leads us to propose that &#x003b2;CstF-64 might recognize alternative polyadenylation signals in these mRNAs contributing to their neural-specific expression. It is possible that &#x003b2;CstF-64 might also contribute to the generation of protein isoforms specific to the nervous system by use of internal poly(A) sites found in many neural mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>How might &#x003b2;CstF-64 function in neural mRNA polyadenylation? In one model, &#x003b2;CstF-64 might recognize RNA sequence elements that are specific to nervous system-expressed polyadenylation sites. A similar model has been proposed for the testis-expressed &#x003c4;CstF-64 variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. A bioinformatic survey revealed that the downstream U/GU-rich sequences in the pre-mRNA are enriched in nervous system-specific transcripts, lending plausibility to this model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. How might &#x003b2;CstF-64 recognize these variant RNA sequence elements if its RNA-binding domain is the same as CstF-64? The insertion in &#x003b2;CstF-64 in the proline/glycine-rich domain might alter the conformation of that domain which might in turn affect the conformation of the RNA-binding domain and alter the RNA binding specificities of &#x003b2;CstF-64 or otherwise affect the overall rate of polyadenylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. In another model, the insertion of the &#x003b2;CstF-64 domain might alter the overall structure of the CstF complex (for example, its dimerization, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]), affecting its interaction with CPSF or other components of the polyadenylation machinery.</p><p>For a final model, we note that the 49 amino acid &#x003b2;CstF-64 domain is not similar to any other known protein domains (data not shown). Based on this, we speculate that the &#x003b2;CstF-64 domain might be a previously undescribed protein-protein interaction domain. It is possible that &#x003b2;CstF-64 interacts with as-of-yet unknown nervous system-specific polyadenylation factors or brings about new interactions within the polyadenylation complex. It might also interact with the splicing machinery since splicing factors are known to modulate polyadenylation efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Any of these proposed interactions could help &#x003b2;CstF-64 in generating protein isoforms via recognition of internal intronic and exonic poly(A) sites thus increasing proteomic diversity in the nervous system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and RNA Samples</title><p>All animal studies were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines and all protocols were approved by the TTUHSC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Amplicons were resolved by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Ethidium bromide stained RT-PCR products were excised from the gel (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), cloned using Topo II system (Invitrogen), and identified by DNA sequence analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Cloning and Plasmids</title><p>The plasmid encoding full length &#x003b2;CstF-64 fused to the FLAG epitope tag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>] (3XFLAG-&#x003b2;CstF-64) was created as follows: mouse brain cDNA was subjected to RT-PCR using primers X and Y containing HinDIII, KpnI restriction sites (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and ligated into a 3X-HA vector encoding full length CstF-64 (kind gift of K. W. McMahon) digested by the same enzymes. Note that this vector also contained the MS2 RNA binding domain though that did not interfere with its expression or antigenicity. The 3XFLAG-&#x003b2;CstF-64 plasmid was created by amplifying full length &#x003b2;CstF-64 using primers E and F containing XbaI, BglII sites (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) using 3X-HA-&#x003b2;CstF-64 as template. This fragment was digested with Xba I and Bgl II, and ligated into a similarly digested 3XFLAG-CstF-64 vector. The cloning scheme of 3XFLAG-CstF-64 is described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Cell Culture and Transfections</title><p>HeLa cells were grown at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>in Dulbecco's Minimal Eagle Media (CellGro, Manassas, VA) containing 10% cosmic calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). HeLa cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 300,000 cells/well and transfected the next day with 800 ng of the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 48 hours post-transfection by rinsing with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in SDS loading buffer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-&#x003b1;-tubulin and anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma, St. Louis, MO); anti-CstF-64 antibody (3A7, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]) and anti-&#x003b2;CstF-64 custom antibody generated in rabbits by Genscript Corporation (Piscataway, NJ) by injection of the peptide GPAGPASIERVQGQRT representing part of the &#x003b2;CstF-64 insert.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein Analysis</title><p>For protein analysis, nuclear extract was prepared from indicated mouse tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>], boiled and sonicated in SDS loading buffer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Protein concentration was measured using the bicinchoninic acid (Pierce, Rockford, IL) assay. Equal amounts of protein from the indicated tissues (20 &#x003bc;g) or HeLa cells were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting. For immunoblotting using anti-CstF-64 antibody, membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween-20 (TBST) with 2% nonfat dry milk (TBST) for 2 hours and treated with anti-CstF-64 antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] at a dilution of 1:50. For immunoblotting using anti-&#x003b2;CstF-64 antibody, the membrane was first treated with 0.2 mM glycine-HCl, pH 2.6 for 30 minutes at room temperature, and rinsed extensively with TBST. Pre-treatment with glycine at low pH was found to enhance the effectiveness of this antibody while decreasing non-specific background. The membrane was then blocked with 2% nonfat dry milk in TBST for 2 hours. The anti-&#x003b2;CstF-64 antibody was used at a dilution of 1:5000 in 2% nonfat dry milk in TBST, 0.05% Empigen (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). In the peptide blocking experiment, the anti-&#x003b2;CstF-64 antibody (1 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;L) was incubated with 10 fold excess peptide (10 &#x003bc;g) in 2% nonfat dry milk in TBST for 2 hours at room temperature before addition to the membrane. Membranes were subsequently treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (1:2500) and immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using the Pierce SuperSignal kit (Rockford, IL).</p></sec><sec><title>Two dimensional-PAGE Analysis</title><p>Nuclear extracts from mouse brain and liver were prepared as described above. Protein concentration was estimated by BCA assay. 392 &#x003bc;L of rehydration buffer (9 M urea, 2% Triton X-100), 8 &#x003bc;L IPG buffer (pH 4&#x02013;7) (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and 0.5 &#x003bc;L 1 M DTT was added to 80 &#x003bc;g of nuclear protein. The mix was layered over a 7 cm pH 3&#x02013;10 immobiline strip (Amersham Biosciences) and allowed to rehydrate for 16 hours. The strips were then subjected to isoelectric focusing at the following voltages: 200 V for 1 minute, 500 V for 20 minutes, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500 V for 20 minutes and 3500 V for 60 minutes. The strip was equilibrated in equilibration solution (20% SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.8, 6 M urea, 30% glycerol) containing 65 mM DTT but no iodoacetamide for 15 minutes and then in equilibration solution containing 135 mM iodoacetamide but no DTT for 15 minutes. The strip was then placed horizontally on a 10% SDS gel, subjected to denaturing PAGE and immunoblot analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>GSS conducted all experiments except the ones described below and wrote the manuscript.
