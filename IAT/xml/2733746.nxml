In this study, we show that the <italic>Drosophila</italic><italic>melanogaster</italic> kinesin 13, KLP10A, is phosphorylated in vivo at a conserved serine (S573) positioned within the &#x003b1;-helix 5 of the motor domain. In vitro, a phosphomimic KLP10A S573E mutant displays a reduced capacity to depolymerize MTs but normal affinity for the MT lattice. In cells, replacement of endogenous KLP10A with KLP10A S573E dampens MT plus end dynamics throughout the cell cycle, whereas a nonphosphorylatable S573A mutant apparently enhances activity during mitosis. Electron microscopy suggests that KLP10A S573 phosphorylation alters its association with the MT lattice, whereas molecular dynamics simulations reveal how KLP10A phosphorylation can alter the kinesin&#x02013;MT interface without changing important structural features within the motor&#x02019;s core. Finally, we identify casein kinase 1&#x003b1; as a possible candidate for KLP10A phosphorylation. We propose a model in which phosphorylation of the KLP10A motor domain provides a regulatory switch controlling the time and place of MT depolymerization.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kinesins are defined by their &#x0201c;motor&#x0201d; domains, which are catalytically active domains of &#x0223c;350 amino acids that display ATPase- and microtubule (MT)-binding activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Vale and Fletterick, 1997</xref>). The motor domains of most kinesins convert the energy of ATP hydrolysis into movement along the MT lattice. However, some kinesins, particularly the kinesin 13s, do not actively translocate along MTs but instead bind to and destabilize their ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Desai et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Kinesin 13&#x02013;catalyzed MT depolymerization contributes to cellular processes ranging from mitosis to axon branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wordeman, 2005</xref>). Individual kinesin 13s are also reutilized for different tasks throughout the cell cycle, a characteristic exemplified by the <italic>Drosophila</italic><italic>melanogaster</italic> kinesin 13, KLP10A, which regulates spindle assembly and poleward flux during mitosis and interactions between MTs and the cell cortex during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Rogers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Mennella et al., 2005</xref>). It is now clear that the localization and catalytic activities of at least some kinesin 13s are subject to tight spatial and temporal control via phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Lan et al., 2004</xref>). Somewhat surprisingly, phosphorylation within the motor domain of kinesin 13s, or any other kinesin, has not been previously reported.</p><p>This study focuses on the phospho-regulation of KLP10A, which is a topic of interest given that kinesin 13 associates with polymerizing MT plus ends but stimulates their catastrophe only near the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Mennella et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Moore et al., 2005</xref>). This suggests that KLP10A associates with MTs in an inactive state and becomes activated only at specific cellular sites. The vertebrate kinesin 13, mitotic centromere-associated kinesin, behaves similarly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Moore et al., 2005</xref>). In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel phosphorylation site within the conserved &#x003b1;-helix 5 of the KLP10A motor domain. In addition, we identify casein kinase 1&#x003b1; (CK1&#x003b1;) as a potential kinase for KLP10A serine 573 (S573) phosphorylation and link this kinase to KLP10A&#x02019;s activity in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To identify sites of phosphorylation within KLP10A, endogenous KLP10A was immunoprecipitated from <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cell lysates and stained with the fluorescent dye ProQ Diamond to selectively recognize phosphoproteins.

The gel band corresponding to phosphorylated KLP10A was trypsin digested and analyzed by electrospray ionization MS. This identified a phosphopeptide corresponding to KLP10A sequence 572&#x02013;579 (DS-PO4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-FIGEKSK), which was confirmed by MS/MS sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902113/DC1">Fig. S1 a</ext-link>). The S573 phosphorylated in KLP10A is located within the conserved &#x003b1;-helix 5 of the core kinesin motor domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>) and near the kinesin&#x02013;MT interface according to cryo-EM&#x02013;based models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Tan et al., 2008</xref>). Mutagenesis experiments have indicated that &#x003b1;-helix 5 is important for MT binding in conventional kinesin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Woehlke et al., 1997</xref>). Interestingly, an alignment of the corresponding region of other kinesins revealed a serine at the analogous position in all three <italic>Drosophila</italic> kinesin 13s as well the vertebrate kinesin 13s, Kif2C and Kif2A, and some members of other kinesin subfamilies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of a novel phosphorylation site within the KLP10A motor domain.</bold> (a) Anti-KLP10A immunoprecipitate from S2 cell lysate separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with ProQ or transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting with anti-KLP10A antibodies.

Although phosphorylation of numerous kinesins from a variety of families has been reported, all previously identified phosphorylation sites lie outside of the core kinesin motor domain. Zen-4, a kinesin 6 in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, is phosphorylated within a class-specific N-terminal extension to the motor domain, and this regulates its affinity for MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Mishima et al., 2004</xref>).</p><sec><title>Phosphomimic KLP10A mutants display reduced MT depolymerase activity</title><p>The position of S573 suggests a mechanism of regulation based on a change of KLP10A&#x02019;s interaction with MTs. To evaluate this possibility, the enzymatic properties of purified neck/motor wild-type (wt), phosphomimic S573E, or nonphosphomimic S573A KLP10A constructs were studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, d and e</xref>). Somewhat surprisingly, MT cosedimentation assays indicated that all three constructs bound to MTs with a similar affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, f and g</xref>). However, KLP10A S573E displayed a significant reduction (&#x0223c;40%) in its ability to destabilize MTs compared with KLP10A wt and the S573A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, h&#x02013;j</xref>). In a similar vein, myosin I is also phosphorylated in its motor domain on a residue positioned near the actin-binding site, and this phosphorylation decreases motor activity without influencing binding to the actin filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ostap et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>KLP10A S573E/A mutants alter MT dynamics in cells</title><p>To determine whether and how S573 phosphorylation alters KLP10A&#x02019;s activity in cells, we analyzed MT dynamics in cell lines in which the endogenous protein was replaced by monomeric RFP (mRFP)&#x02013;KLP10A wt, S573E, or S573A mutants. We generated three cell lines stably transfected with (a) a constitutively expressed EGFP&#x02013;&#x003b1;-tubulin construct, allowing visualization of MTs, and (b) a construct encoding mRFP-KLP10A wt, S573E, or S573A protein whose expression was driven from an inducible promoter. Endogenous KLP10A was first depleted by RNAi using a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) oligomer against the 5&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) of the KLP10A mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Goshima and Vale, 2005</xref>). As the transgenic mRNA does not contain UTR sequences, mRFP-KLP10A levels remained unaltered after RNAi treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 b</xref>). To ensure the analysis of cells expressing similar titers of mRFP-KLP10A (wt or S573A/E mutants), the level of mRFP fluorescence was measured for each cell under identical imaging conditions (Fig. S1 b).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of the phosphomimetic KLP10A S573E mutant dampens MT dynamics during interphase S2 cells.</bold> (a, top) Interphase cell expressing EGFP&#x02013;&#x003b1;-tubulin and mRFP-KLP10A wt.

Replacement with mRFP-KLP10A wt or S573A restored this aspect of MT dynamics to normal, suggesting that either protein can functionally mimic endogenous KLP10A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 c</xref>). Both proteins also tip track on polymerizing plus ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902113/DC1">Fig. S2 a</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902113/DC1">Video 1</ext-link>).</p><p>In contrast, cells expressing S573E displayed dampened MT plus end dynamics with a 60% increase in cortical dwell time relative to the wt or S573A proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 c</xref>). This effect was both qualitatively and quantitatively indistinguishable from the knockdown condition (with no exogenous KLP10A). S573E also failed to tip track on plus ends and instead labeled longer stretches of the MT (Fig. S2 b). Altered tip-tracking behavior has also been reported for a phosphomimetic mitotic centromere-associated kinesin mutant displaying decreased depolymerase activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Moore et al., 2005</xref>). These data suggest that phosphorylation of KLP10A at S573 can largely inactivate its ability to promote MT plus end depolymerization in cells perhaps by altering its association with MT tips. However, additional inhibitory mechanisms are likely to exist, at least during interphase.</p><p>We also compared the impacts of KLP10A wt and S573E/A expression on mitosis. KLP10A is believed to depolymerize pole-focused MT minus ends to constrain mitotic spindle length and promote poleward tubulin flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Rogers et al., 2004</xref>). KLP10A also tracks the polymerizing plus ends of astral MTs and may regulate their dynamic behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Goshima and Vale, 2005</xref>). The KLP10A wt protein localized normally, concentrating on centrosomes, spindle poles, centromeres, and the tips of astral MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>, Fig. S2, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902113/DC1">Video 2</ext-link>), and had little impact on spindle morphology when present at low concentrations. However, increasing expression levels induced a corresponding elevation in the frequency of monopolar or collapsed spindles, which is an expected result given KLP10A&#x02019;s proposed role in the regulation of spindle length. By comparison, defects in spindle morphology were significantly reduced in cells expressing S573E and exacerbated in cells with S573A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, a and b</xref>). With regard to the latter, even very low expression levels strongly altered spindle morphology, suggesting that nonphosphorylatable S573A is not subject to normal regulatory control in mitotic cells.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>KLP10A S573 phosphomimetic and nonphosphorylatable mutants alter MT dynamics in mitosis.</bold> (a) Percentage of KLP10A wt&#x02013;, S573A&#x02013;, or S573E&#x02013;expressing mitotic cells with collapsed or monopolar spindles.

As with the wt protein, S573E associated with centrosomes, spindle poles, and centromeres (Fig. S2 d). However, S573E was quite different in its effects on and localization to astral MTs. Expression of S573E significantly increased the number and length of astral MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 c</xref>), and these lengthy astral MTs were extensively labeled by S573E in a fashion quite similar to interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, c and d</xref>; Fig. S2; and Video 2). This was distinguishable from the short comets of mRFP-KLP10A wt typically observed at MT plus ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, c and d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Mennella et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Moore et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we found that mRFP-KLP10A wt and S573E had distinct impacts on poleward tubulin flux. For a variety of reasons, these experiments were difficult to perform using our loss of function/rescue approach, so, in this case, they were performed in cells also containing endogenous KLP10A. Flux velocities were positively correlated with the level of expression of KLP10A wt protein, whereas the S573E protein significantly reduced flux rates when present at higher concentrations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902113/DC1">Fig. S3, a and b</ext-link>). Interpreting these data are problematic because analyzed cells also contain endogenous KLP10A but are generally consistent with the notion that phosphorylation of KLP10A at S573 impacts the cellular functions of the protein and could regulate KLP10A&#x02019;s activity at MT minus and plus ends.</p></sec><sec><title>KLP10A S573E fails to form MT-associated rings</title><p>To determine whether phosphorylation alters the structural relationship between KLP10A and the MT, we used EM to visualize MTs incubated with KLP10A wt or S573E/A neck/motor constructs. To enhance binding, experiments were performed in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMPPNP. Under these conditions, KLP10A, along with other kinesin 13s, has been found to assemble into rings or spirals around MTs; no other kinesins have been observed to form similar structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Moores et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Tan et al., 2006</xref>).

Meanwhile, the neck helix undergoes a significant rotation, causing the neck to fold into the back of the molecule, closer to the kinesin 13 class-specific tubulin-binding site involved in the formation of MT-associated rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Tan et al., 2008</xref>). This repositioning of the neck may underlie the observed inability of KLP10A S573E to form MT-associated rings.

The partial unfolding of the short helix (&#x003b1;5) containing S573 and its movements toward L8 might be responsible for the observed conformational changes in L8.</p></sec><sec><title>KLP10A is regulated by CK1&#x003b1;</title><p>Finally, to identify the kinase-phosphorylating KLP10A S573 in vivo, we used a bioinformatic approach to search for consensus sequences. The primary sequence surrounding S573 in KLP10A did not resemble any known kinase consensus sequence. However, Netphos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blom et al., 2004</xref>), a program that recognizes nonconventional consensus sequences by an artificial neural network, predicted KLP10A S573 as a substrate for CK1.</p><p>If CK1 phosphorylates S573 and thereby inhibits KLP10A in vivo, inactivation of CK1 should phenocopy the effects of KLP10A overexpression. To test this prediction, we added a series of cell-permeable kinase inhibitors to S2 cells and subsequently observed the impacts on spindle morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). After treatment with the CK1 inhibitors IC261 and D4427, the percentage of monopolar and collapsed spindles significantly increased similarly to KLP10A overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 a</xref>, P &#x0003c; 0.001; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902113/DC1">Video 4</ext-link>). To ensure that this effect was specific to CK1 inhibition, we repeated this assay using inhibitors that target kinases that may be affected by high concentrations of IC261 and D4427 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902113/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Regulation of KLP10A by CK1&#x003b1;.</bold> (a) The concentrations of kinase inhibitors applied to medium were chosen according to their reported K<sub>i</sub> values (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902113/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>).

To further distinguish the specific CK1 isoform responsible for the increase in monopolar spindles, we performed RNAi against each of the two candidates, <italic>&#x003b5;</italic> and &#x003b1;. When S2 cells were depleted of CK1&#x003b1;, but not CK1&#x003f5;, we also observed a dramatic increase in monopolar and compacted spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 b</xref>, P &#x0003c; 0.001; see Materials and methods).</p><p>To establish whether this spindle collapse phenotype was mediated by an elevated activation of KLP10A, CK1 was also inhibited in S2 cells depleted of KLP10A. Spindles of control RNAi&#x02013;treated cells were frequently collapsed in the presence of the CK1 inhibitor IC261, whereas in S2 cells depleted of KLP10A, normal spindle bipolar architecture was maintained in the presence of IC261 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, e and f</xref>). Thus, KLP10A depletion rescues the spindle collapse caused by CK1 inhibition. Spindle collapse induced by the MT-destabilizing drug colchicine was not rescued by KLP10A RNAi (unpublished data).</p><p>The CK1 inhibitor IC261 also had a dramatic effect on interphase MTs (Fig. S3 d), causing the plus ends of interphase MTs to rapidly shrink toward the cell interior, eventually resulting in the almost complete disappearance of MTs (Video 4). This effect was dependent on KLP10A activity, but not stathmin, another MT-destabilizing protein (Fig. S3 d). We note that CK1&#x003b1; is predicted to phosphorylate two additional sites within KLP10A (S699 and S697), which may explain why CK1 inhibitors produce a much stronger impact on interphase MT arrays than the expression of KLP10A S573A (which should presumably induce the same effect). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that CK1 acts upstream of KLP10A, inhibiting its activity by phosphorylation.</p><p>In summary, our findings provide new insights into the manner in which phosphorylation regulates the structure and function of kinesin 13s. The rapid and transient activation of the kinesin 13 motor domain provides an appealing mechanism for controlling the timing and place of efficient kinesin 13&#x02013;driven MT depolymerization. We propose that the majority of cytoplasmic KLP10A is phosphorylated at S573 by CK1&#x003b1; (and perhaps at other sites by additional kinases) and thus held in reserve in a low activity state. Local dephosphorylation of the protein (e.g., at the cell cortex) activates a small pool of the protein to induce the depolymerization of a subset of MT ends. KLP10A, like other kinesin 13s, is likely phosphorylated at multiple sites, and its specific mechanism of regulation involves the integration of these events.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and RNAi</title><p>Schneider S2 cells were cultured in Schneider&#x02019;s <italic>Drosophila</italic> medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS (Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin.
