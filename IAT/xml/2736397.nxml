First, a long primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) is cleaved by the Microprocessor, containing the RNA binding protein Dgcr8 and the RNAseIII enzyme Drosha, to produce a 60&#x02013;75 nucleotide hairpin precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) in the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Han1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Lee1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Denli1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Gregory1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Landthaler1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The pre-miRNA is translocated to the cytoplasm where it is cleaved to a miRNA duplex (&#x0223c;19&#x02013;25 nt in length) by the RNAseIII enzyme Dicer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Bernstein1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. A single strand of the duplex enters the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) with the help of another RNA binding protein, TRBP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Chendrimada1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Haase1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Dicer has roles outside of the maturation of canonical miRNAs. For example, in mouse ES cells, Dicer processes other subclasses of miRNAs including mirtrons and short hairpin RNAs as well as endogenous siRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Babiarz2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Consistent with these additional roles of Dicer, Dgcr8 knockout (KO) ES cells have less severe phenotypes than Dicer knockout ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Wang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The Microprocessor was recently shown to have an additional role in directly destabilizing a mRNA target. Specifically, it can cleave hairpins in the 5&#x02032;UTR and coding region of the Dgcr8 mRNA, which in turns destabilizes the mature transcript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Han2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Triboulet1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Pedersen1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. This negative feedback loop on Dgcr8 suggests the importance of tight homeostatic control of the Microprocessor in normal cellular function. The finding that the Microprocessor can directly influence <italic>Dgcr8</italic> mRNA levels raises the possibility that this mechanism may affect many other mRNAs.</p><p>To further test whether there is a broader role of the Microprocessor in the direct regulation of mRNAs, we evaluated the mRNA and small non-coding RNA profiles of wild-type, Dgcr8 KO and Dicer KO cells as well as a recently published data set of small RNAs less than 200 nucleotides from human Hela and HepG2 cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-ENCODE1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. While many mRNAs were differentially expressed between Dgcr8 and Dicer KO ES cells, there was no evidence for Microprocessor based processing of these mRNAs, with the striking exception of Dgcr8 itself. Similarly, analysis of the Hela and HepG2 data sets identified many sequence reads from the Dgcr8 hairpins showing a pattern consistent with Microprocessor activity, but none from any other predicted hairpins within spliced mRNAs. These findings suggest that the Microprocessor's role in directly regulating mRNA levels is specific to auto-regulation of Dgcr8, highlighting the importance of this negative feedback regulation of Microprocessor levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>mRNAs regulated by a direct Microprocessor cleavage mechanism should be upregulated in cells deficient for the Microprocessor, but not in Dicer deficient cells. Therefore, we evaluated coding mRNA profiling data from wild-type, Dgcr8 KO and Dicer KO mouse ES cells. Normalized mRNA levels in Dgcr8 KO and Dicer KO cells were compared to wild-type ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006971-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Most mRNAs that were upregulated or downregulated were similarly altered in both mutants.

The 5&#x02032;UTR hairpin in Dgcr8 was first identified by this method. EvoFold predictions are grouped based on their location in CDS, 5&#x02032;UTR, 3&#x02032;UTR, intron and intergenic regions. We determined mouse genome coordinates for EvoFold hairpins in CDS, 5&#x02032;UTR and 3&#x02032;UTR regions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), mapped them to the coding mRNA database, and compared the relative expression levels of all positive hits in Dgcr8 KO, Dicer KO, and wild-type ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006971-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). A total of 824 out of 23805 (3.5&#x00025;) coding mRNAs contained predicted hairpins. Of these 824, 43 mRNAs were specifically upregulated in Dgcr8 KO cells, while 24 mRNAs were specifically downregulated in the Dgcr8 KO cells. Therefore, there was a subset of genes specifically upregulated in Dgcr8 KO cells that contain predicted hairpins and hence could be direct targets of the Microprocessor.</p><p>If hairpins within the Dgcr8 KO- upregulated gene set are indeed cleaved by the Microprocessor, we hypothesized that there would be Dgcr8-dependent small RNAs that map to these hairpins. Therefore, we evaluated ultra-high throughput deep sequencing data representing small RNAs ranging from 18-32 nucleotides from the wild-type, Dgcr8 KO and Dicer KO ES cells. As expected, multiple sequence reads mapped to the EvoFold predicted 5&#x02032;UTR and coding region hairpins of Dgcr8 mRNA in WT cells <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006971-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. None of the reads mapping to the coding region hairpin were found in either Dgcr8 or Dicer KO libraries confirming their Dgcr8- and Dicer-dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006971-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>). Interestingly, two sequence reads mapping to the 5&#x02032;UTR hairpin were found in the Dicer KO library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006971-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). One of these reads mapped just 5&#x02032; to the hairpin. Such Dgcr8-dependent, Dicer-independent reads have been previously observed at miRNA loci in Drosophila and mouse small RNA sequencing studies and appear to be a 5&#x02032; remnant of Drosha cleavage that is further degraded by an unknown 5&#x02032;-3&#x02032; exonuclease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Babiarz2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Ruby1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

As Microprocessor activity is predicted to destabilize the mRNAs, we looked more closely at the 7 transcripts upregulated in Dgcr8 KO cells. The small RNAs that mapped within exonic regions of these annotated transcripts fell into two groups based on their distribution.

Therefore, analogous to Dgcr8, the host genes for these miRNAs might be expected to be downregulated by Microprocessor-induced cleavage. Upon examination of the exonic miRNAs, we found only 10 to fully lie within annotated exons <bold>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006971.s001">Table S1</xref>)</bold>. We were able to find small RNA reads to three of these exonic miRNAs (mmu-miR-21, mmu-miR-671, mmu-miR-147). However, the mRNA levels of the host genes of these three miRNAs were not altered in the Dgcr8 and Dicer KO ES cells. Therefore, production of these miRNAs does not appear to influence the overall levels of the annotated host mRNAs. Together, these detailed analyses of both mRNA expression profiling and small RNA sequencing data from ES cells failed to uncover any genes other than Dgcr8 that are directly destabilized by the Microprocessor.</p><p>It is possible that 18&#x02013;32 nucleotide small RNA sequencing missed Microprocessor-cleaved exonic hairpins that are sequestered and/or are not processed by Dicer. Microprocessor miRNAs are typically 60&#x02013;75 nucleotides in length. Therefore, to directly identify these hairpins, we analyzed ultra high-throughput sequencing data sequence sets produced from small RNAs less than 200 nucleotides in length from Hela and HepG2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-ENCODE1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The forty small RNA libraries generated in the study were derived from whole cell, cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, as well as from cells following enzymatic treatments that enrich for either mono-, di-, tri-phosphate modified or 5&#x02032; capped RNAs. Sequence reads from all forty libraries were mapped to exonic EvoFold hairpins. The largest number of hits, 184, mapped to the Dgcr8 5&#x02032;UTR hairpin and 4 mapped to the coding region hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006971-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). Most of these reads had a uniform 5&#x02032; end consistent with Microprocessor cleavage. There was an additional read just 5&#x02032; to the hairpin, a likely remnant of the Microprocessor cleavage, similar to that seen in the ES cell small RNA libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006971-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). A large number (166 out of 184) of the 5&#x02032; UTR reads were derived from nuclear libraries, consistent with previous work showing that the cleaved 5&#x02032;UTR hairpin is confined to the nuclear fraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Han2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

These findings show that the analysis of the Hela and HepG2 small RNA data sets should identify other hairpins that are cleaved by the Microprocessor even if they are not further processed.</p><fig id="pone-0006971-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006971.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Read distribution across hairpins in the first exon of Dgcr8 in &#x0003c;200nt small RNA sequencing data from HeLa and HepG2 cells.</title><p>Small RNA locations are presented as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006971-g002">Figure 2</xref>.

Only four of these hairpins had at least 5 sequence reads. Furthermore, none of the small RNA reads in these hairpins mapped in a manner consistent with Microprocessor cleavage. That is, they had heterogeneous 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;ends and/or the ends went beyond the extremes of the hairpins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006971-g005"><bold>Figure 5A&#x02013;D</bold></xref>). For example, the second highest-ranking hairpin, which mapped to the gene RPS3, had 14 reads. However, unlike the reads mapping to the Dgcr8 hairpins, they did not have a defined 5&#x02032; end, but instead mapped across the locus, more consistent with RNA degradation than Microprocessor cleavage. Therefore, analysis of small RNAs less than 200 nucleotides failed to identify any Evofold loci within exons other than Dgcr8 that are cleaved in a Microprocessor-like fashion.</p><fig id="pone-0006971-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006971.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Read distribution across hairpins positive for &#x0003e;5 small RNA reads in HeLa cell &#x0003c;200 nt small RNA sequencing data.</title><p>Small RNA locations are presented as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006971-g002">Figure 2</xref>.

Therefore, we mapped small RNAs from HeLa and HepG2 libraries to exons of transcripts upregulated over 2-fold with siRNA-mediated knockdown of both Drosha and Dgcr8 relative to siGFP. Expression information was extracted from recently published microarray data in HeLa cells (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Han2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. As expected, Dgcr8, which was upregulated in the Drosha knockdown sample, had 188 small RNAs mapping to the first exon. Upon examining protein-coding genes upregulated in both Drosha and Dgcr8 knockdown samples, 31 transcripts had &#x0003e;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10 small RNAs mapping to at least one exon (45 exons total<bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006971.s003">Table S3</xref></bold>). Notably, 15 out of the 31 were genes that encode ribosomal protein subunits, which are highly abundant in cells. Out of the 31, 11 transcripts had small RNA reads distributed over the exon, as would be expected for degradation products. The remaining 20 transcripts had small RNA reads clustering in small window(s) within exons. However, further examination of the regions in these 20 transcripts using RNAfold did not reveal the presence of any good hairpin structures, in contrast to the Dgcr8 small RNA mapping-regions. In summary, analysis of the ultra high-throughput sequence reads of RNAs less than 200 nucleotides, like the ES cell small RNA dataset, showed that a role of the Microprocessor in direct mRNA regulation is likely limited to Dgcr8.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings show a focused role for the Microprocessor in destabilizing coding mRNAs by the direct cleavage and destabilization of spliced transcripts.

We cannot exclude the possibility that rare examples of Microprocessor-mediated destabilization of mRNAs may be found in specific cellular contexts or at levels too low to be identified using current deep sequencing technology. However, in this study, we examined data from cell lines representing three different tissues: ES (inner cell mass of the blastocyst), Hela (kidney), and HepG2 (liver). Furthermore, in all deep sequencing datasets examined, we find numerous reads to the Dgcr8 hairpins but are unable to find a single additional similar candidate, suggesting that any additional examples would be extremely rare.</p><p>The absence of Dgcr8-dependent upregulation of the host transcripts carrying annotated exonic miRNAs is worth noting (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006971.s001">Table S1</xref>)</bold>. A number of these annotated exonic miRNAs were not present in our small RNA libraries even though the host gene is clearly expressed. This finding may be the result of mis-annotation of these sequences as miRNAs or that processing of the hairpins is somehow suppressed in ES cells. One example of an annotated exonic miRNA that is present in large numbers in ES cells is miR-21. Its host gene, Tmem49, is not upregulated in Dgcr8 or Dicer knockout ES cells. Possible explanations include: 1) there are alternative transcripts responsible for miR-21 production either from an alternative promoter or an alternative splicing event or 2) only a small subset of the Tmem49 transcripts is processed by the Microprocessor to produce the pre-miR-21 hairpin.</p><p>A very specific role for the Microprocessor in destabilizing Dgcr8 and hence providing a negative feedback on Microprocessor levels itself suggests that homeostatic control of microRNA processing is central to normal cellular physiology. This is consistent with recent findings showing that much regulation is occurring at the level of Microprocessor activity. For example hnRNAP, Lin28, and KSRP have been suggested to regulate Microprocessor activity on specific miRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Michlewski1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Viswanathan1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Newman1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Trabucchi1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, SMAD signaling alters the processing of pri- to pre-miR-21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Davis1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. A carefully controlled balance between the levels of the Microprocessor and these regulators are likely important for proper physiologic function.</p><p>Dgcr8 levels are differentially regulated during development and in cancers. Interestingly, some cancers have decreased, while other cancers have increased levels of Dgcr8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Ambs1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Merritt1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

A direct role for changes in processing activity in cancer is supported by a mouse model of lung cancer where heterozygous loss of Dicer promotes tumor progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Kumar1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Together, these findings suggest that the biogenesis of miRNAs is not simply a passive process, but rather a tightly controlled one. Therefore, it will be important to determine in greater detail how the level and the activity of the biogenesis machinery influence the molecular constitution of cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Solexa sequencing data for Dgcr8 KO, Dicer KO and WT cells were previously published<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006971-Babiarz2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.
