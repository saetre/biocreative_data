We hypothesized that CBR2 activation induces an anti-inflammatory phenotype in microglia by inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, via mitogen-activated protein kinase-phosphatase (MKP) induction. MKPs regulate mitogen activated protein kinases, but their role in the modulation of microglial phenotype is not fully understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>JWH015 (a CBR2 agonist) increased MKP-1 and MKP-3 expression, which in turn reduced p-ERK1/2 in LPS-stimulated primary microglia. These effects resulted in a significant reduction of tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF) expression and microglial migration. We confirmed the causative link of these findings by using MKP inhibitors. We found that the selective inhibition of MKP-1 by Ro-31-8220 and PSI2106, did not affect p-ERK expression in LPS+JWH015-treated microglia. However, the inhibition of both MKP-1 and MKP-3 by triptolide induced an increase in p-ERK expression and in microglial migration using LPS+JWH015-treated microglia.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results uncover a cellular microglial pathway triggered by CBR2 activation. These data suggest that the reduction of pro-inflammatory factors and microglial migration via MKP-3 induction is part of the mechanism of action of CBR2 agonists. These findings may have clinical implications for further drug development.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Microglia are the innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and as such act as the first glial responders after CNS or peripheral nerve injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The main responses of microglia to peripheral or CNS insults are increased expression of surface or cytosolic markers, pro-inflammatory factor production (e.g. cytokines, chemokines, nitric oxide, prostaglandins), morphological changes, enhanced phagocytic activity, migration and proliferation. In rodent models of pain including peripheral nerve injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], paw incision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], paw inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] or spinal cord injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], microglia become reactive and produce a pro-inflammatory spinal milieu, which may contribute to neuronal sensitization and behavioral hypersensitivity.</p><p>Cannabinoids exert most of their effects by binding to G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors (CBR) type 1 and 2. CBR2 are expressed in glia in normal human and rat brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and their glial expression increases especially during inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Using a rat paw incision or a peripheral nerve injury model we have previously shown that <italic>in vivo </italic>spinal CBR2 activation reduces glial reactivity, measured as a reduction in the expression of CR3/CD11b or ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1) in microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Iba1 is a cytosolic microglial marker that is associated with a pro-inflammatory phenotype and is involved in microglial migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Accordingly, <italic>in vitro </italic>CBR2 activation reduces tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF) and nitric oxide (NO) production in primary microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and is protective against neurotoxicity of human microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Nonetheless, the specific intracellular mechanism of action by which CBR2 activation alters the microglial phenotype has not been previously reported.</p><p>Microglial p-ERK plays a central role in the mechanisms underlying spinal cord injury-, nerve injury- and diabetes-induced hypersensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Microglial p-ERK inhibition reduces TNF production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition, spinal TNF blockade reduces peripheral nerve injury-induced allodynia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Cell migration is mediated by p-ERK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, the role of p-ERK in microglial migration is not known. We hypothesized that CBR2 activation reduces microglial p-ERK, and subsequently TNF production and cell migration.</p><p>Mitogen-activated protein kinase-phosphatases (MKP) regulate several pro-inflammatory pathways and display distinct substrate preferences for various mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. For example, MKP-3 is a selective ERK pathway negative regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and MKP-1 mainly down-regulates p38 or JNK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], but may regulate ERK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The role of phosphatases in microglial inflammatory processes has yet to be clarified. Therefore, we also hypothesized that microglial CBR2 activation reduces p-ERK by inducing MKP-1 and MKP-3. Herein, we study a specific signaling pathway in primary microglia to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of action of CBR2 activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Microglial CBR2 activation induces MKP-1/3 and reduces p-ERK and TNF</title><p>First, we determined the effects of JWH015 on MKP-1 and MKP-3 expression in LPS-stimulated microglia.

We further showed the functionality of this phosphatase modulation and microglial anti-inflammatory phenotype by demonstrating that JWH015-induced MKP-3 inhibited the ERK pathway, which in turn reduced TNF expression and microglial migration towards ADP. Together, these data support a novel mechanism of action of CBR2 agonists via MKP-3 that may explain their anti-inflammatory, anti-allodynic and/or glial modulatory effects <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Our results showed that JWH015-induced ERK dephosphorylation depends on a MKP-3 increase, rather than MKP-1. Triptolide, which blocked both MKP-1 and MKP-3 induction by JWH015, increased p-ERK in parallel. Triptolide alone has been shown to reduce inflammatory factors in LPS- or amyloid-&#x003b2;1&#x02013;42-stimulated microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, in our setting triptolide alone did not modify the expression of MKP-1/3, t-ERK and p-ERK in the presence of LPS. Triptolide is an effective MKP-1 inhibitor, and therefore a blocker of pharmacological anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-stimulated microglia and monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We extended these findings by showing that triptolide is also a MKP-3 inhibitor. Interestingly, the blockade of JWH015-induced MKP-1 by PSI2106 or Ro-31-822 did not affect p-ERK. Similarly, other anti-inflammatory drugs, such as dexamethasone induce MKP-1 and, in turn, dephosphorylate p38 and JNK without affecting p-ERK in LPS-stimulated primary microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. MKPs display distinct substrate preferences for various MAPKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In the present study, we showed that MKP-3 selectively targets the ERK pathway in microglia, as demonstrated previously in <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>human skin fibroblasts, or during chick, mouse and zebrafish limb/fin development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The fact that MKP-3 is pivotal to reduce p-ERK makes MKP-3 an attractive target for drug development.</p><p>Microglial p-ERK plays a key role in neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], but it is unknown by which specific mechanisms. Additionally, the intracellular molecular mechanisms and cellular functional effects from p-ERK modulation are not fully understood. Herein, we demonstrated that p-ERK is necessary for microglial TNF expression and migration. We confirmed that microglial CBR2 activation reduces TNF expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and ERK dephosphorylation results in a significant reduction of TNF in primary microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Multiple pathways are involved in the production of this pro-inflammatory cytokine, but our results show a time dependent effect of CBR2 activation on MKP induction (15 min incubation), ERK dephosphorylation (30 min incubation) and decreased TNF (60&#x02013;120 min incubation), suggesting that p-ERK is instrumental in TNF expression in LPS-stimulated primary microglia. TNF may be produced by spinal microglial following peripheral nerve injury and contribute to behavioral hypersensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The reduction of microglial TNF production by CBR2 activation may explain the antinociceptive effects of CBR2 agonists in rodent pain models. TNF significantly contributes to peripheral nerve injury-induced allodynia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and causes direct nerve sensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Additionally, TNF induces the phosphorylation of spinal microglial MAPKs (i.e. p38) that also contributes to neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. This positive feedback loop between TNF and MAPKs can enhance the expression of other pro-algesic factors which may contribute to chronic pain. In contrast, the reduction of TNF expression would disrupt this positive feedback loop, reducing behavioral hypersensitivity.</p><p>Cell migration is partially mediated by p-ERK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Herein, we demonstrated that LPS-stimulated microglial motility depends on p-ERK. Additionally, the reduction of LPS-stimulated microglial migration by JWH015 was blocked by triptolide (which also inhibits MKP-3 expression). Our data strongly suggest that the modulation of the MKP-3/p-ERK pathway is the mechanism by which CBR2 activation reduces microglial migration towards ADP. ATP/ADP is one of the major chemoattractants for microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and it is released from astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] or dorsal horn neurons following a pathological event, such as nerve injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that microglial migration contributes to neuropathic pain. We hypothesize that reducing microglial p-ERK and subsequently pro-inflammatory microglial trafficking to injured neurons following nerve injury, decreases the release of pro-inflammatory mediators (such as TNF) into the synaptic milieu, which prevents neuronal sensitization, the pathological correlate to chronic pain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Proposed hypotheses</bold>. (A) Scheme of the proposed hypothesis on the mechanisms by which p-ERK induces a pro-inflammatory phenotype in microglia and contributes to neuropathic pain. Peripheral nerve injury increases microglial p-ERK in spinal cord dorsal horn, which in turn leads to the expression of TNF and an increase in microglial motility. These pro-inflammatory microglia migrate towards the spinal injured neuron area attracted by chemoattractants, such as ATP/ADP. The enhancement of pro-inflammatory microglia sensitizes spinal nociceptive neurons by increasing the concentration of pro-algesic factors, such as TNF. (B) Scheme of the proposed hypothesis on the mechanisms by which CBR2 activation-induced MKP-3 promotes an anti-inflammatory phenotype in microglia and alleviates neuropathic pain. Microglial CBR2 are increased in microglia following peripheral nerve injury. Microglial CBR2 activation induces an anti-inflammatory phenotype in microglia by increasing MKP-3 expression, which selectively inhibits p-ERK in spinal cord dorsal horn. Subsequently, ERK dephosphorylation results in a reduction of TNF expression and microglial motility. The reduction in the migration of pro-inflammatory microglia reduces the source of pro-algesic factors, such as TNF preventing neuronal sensitization and alleviating peripheral nerve injury-induced allodynia.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1744-8069-5-25-8"/></fig><p>Our findings are in contrast with previous observations. First, it has been shown that MKP-1 induction by the non-selective cannabinoids, anandamide and WIN55,212-2 resulted in ERK dephosphorylation, which in turn reduced NO, but it did not affect TNF expression in BV-2 cells. Second, CBR2 activation by endocannabinoids seems to promote chemotaxis via ERK phosphorylation in BV-2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. We have demonstrated that immortalized microglial cell lines, including BV-2, may not mimic <italic>in vivo </italic>situations. They produce significantly lower amounts of TNF and MCP-1, and express significantly less p-ERK after LPS stimulation, and possess higher migratory rates towards ADP than primary microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Accordingly, BV-2 and primary microglia also have different cannabinoid enzymatic profiles; i.e. primary microglia, but not BV-2 cells, express monoacylglycerol lipase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Furthermore, contradictory findings have been reported regarding the chemoattractant effects of endocannabinoids using the microglial cell lines BV-2 or N11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Therefore, results obtained using BV-2 or other cell lines should be taken with caution until they are confirmed and directly compared with primary microglial cell experiments.

After incubation with the first primary and secondary antibodies, three blots were incubated for 25 min at 37&#x000b0;C in stripping buffer. Blots were visualized using SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce) for 5 min and we observed that the antibodies were completely removed. Therefore, the same stripping procedure was used to re-probe with another primary and secondary antibodies. This methodology allowed us to observe the effects of the drug treatments in different proteins from the same treated cells. Finally, blots were subsequently stripped and re-probed with mouse anti-beta-actin antibody (1:3000; Abcam, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA), and this was used as the protein loading control. Band intensity was assessed using the analysis software package provided with the Syngene G-Box and data were quantified as relative intensity of band of interest divided by intensity of beta-actin. Normalization of p-ERK and t-ERK were also conducted against beta-actin, then p-ERK data were quantified as relative intensity of band divided by intensity of t-ERK. Data were expressed as relative intensity normalized to beta actin control and to the control group for each experiment &#x000b1; SEM. Incubation of blots with only secondary antibodies did not show any protein band.</p><p>The following treatment groups were performed. Medium control (time 0) or LPS (5 ng/ml) alone groups were used as the control groups to compare the effects of selective microglial CBR2 activation on MKP-1/3 (n = 5&#x02013;7), t-ERK (n = 5&#x02013;7), p-ERK (n = 5&#x02013;7) and TNF (n = 4) using a group with LPS + JWH015 (1 &#x003bc;M). To test the specificity of the CBR2 agonist (JWH015), LPS + JWH015 (1 &#x003bc;M) group was compared to LPS + JWH015 (1 &#x003bc;M) + AM281 or AM630 (1 &#x003bc;M, n = 9) groups. The dependence of TNF production on p-ERK has been previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. To confirm this in our preparation, we used the MEK inhibitor, UO126 (1 &#x003bc;M, n = 6) in LPS-stimulated cells. Additionally, to probe that CBR2 activation reduces p-ERK by inducing MKP-1 and/or MKP-3, we challenged the effects of JWH015 (1 &#x003bc;M) in the presence of LPS with different drugs claimed to be MKP-1 inhibitors. Thus, the LPS + JWH015 (1 &#x003bc;M) group was compared with LPS + JWH015 (1 &#x003bc;M) + Ro-31-8220, triptolide or PSI2106 (1&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;M, n = 3). All data were normalized to control groups which were given a value of 1.</p></sec><sec><title>Migration</title><p>Our laboratory has previously characterized and optimized the incubation times and chemoattractants that allow optimum cell migration susceptible to pharmacological modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. We used Costar Transwell<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>plates (6.5 mm diameter insert, 8.0 &#x003bc;m pore size, polycarbonate membrane; Corning Inc., Corning, New York, USA). For this group of experiments, the bottom chamber of these plates contained 10 &#x003bc;M ADP, a potent microglial chemoattractant released from injured neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Confluent DIV 8 primary microglia were shaken, washed with PBS, counted using trypan blue, then placed in SFM (DMEM). Cells were resuspended at 100 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3 </sup>cells in 200 &#x003bc;L SFM and treated with different drugs. To assess the effects of cannabinoid or other pharmacological treatments on primary microglia, cells were pre-treated with drugs for 2 h in the presence of LPS (5 ng/ml). Then, cells were centrifuged, medium containing the drugs was discarded and fresh SFM was added. Cells were counted using trypan blue to insure survival post-treatment (&#x0003e; 95% viability).</p><p>Cells were added to the top chamber (100 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3 </sup>cells in 200 &#x003bc;L SFM) of a transwell plate with fibronectin-coated membranes with ADP (10 &#x003bc;M, 500 &#x003bc;L in SFM) in the bottom chamber. Cells were then allowed to migrate towards ADP for 1 or 2 h at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Following migration, the medium in the top chamber was aspirated and the membrane gently wiped with a cotton swab to remove the cells that did not migrate. The membranes were first rinsed with PBS, the cells were then fixed with 2% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.01% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS, and finally stained with crystal violet (Sigma). The membranes were then dried and mounted on microscope slides. Images of nine random fields (20&#x000d7; objective) for each membrane were captured via a Q-Fired cooled CCD camera attached to an Olympus microscope and counted by hand with aid of SigmaScan Pro imaging analysis software. Counts for all nine fields were averaged to give a mean cell count for each membrane. All experiments were completed at least three times (n = 3).</p><p>To study the effects of CBR2 activation on cell migration in LPS-stimulated microglia we used the following groups: LPS + JWH015 (0.01&#x02013;1 &#x003bc;M, n = 9). To test the specificity of the CBR2 agonist, we challenged its effects with specific CBR1 (AM281) and CBR2 (AM630) antagonists by using the following groups: LPS + JWH015 (1 &#x003bc;M) + AM281 (1 &#x003bc;M, n = 4) or AM630 (1 &#x003bc;M, n = 6). To test whether p-ERK is involved in microglial migration we used a specific MEK inhibitor, UO126 (1 &#x003bc;M, n = 6) in LPS-stimulated cells. We also used a positive control group using LPS-stimulated microglia + minocycline (60 &#x003bc;M, n = 6), a dose that our laboratory has shown to be effective in reducing microglial migration in non-stimulated microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. To further test whether JWH015's effects on MKP-1/3 were causatively linked with JWH015's effects on microglial migration, we used Triptolide (10 &#x003bc;M, 15 min pre-treatment, n = 6) in LPS-stimulated cells + JWH015 (1 &#x003bc;M) incubated for 2 hr in the migration well. It has been shown that JWH015 act as chemoattractant in human monocytes when used at 20 &#x003bc;M concentration in parallel to an induction in ERK phosphorylation. However, JWH015 does not induce chemotaxis at 5&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;M concentrations, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Therefore, we chose 1 &#x003bc;M as our highest JWH015 dose tested.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; SEM. Statistical analyses were completed using GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, California, USA). The effects of LPS and drug on proteins measured by western blot analyses and cell migration were examined using the repetitive measurements one-way analysis of variance. If significant effects were found, Dunnett's test was conducted. When appropriate (non-normally distributed), these data were evaluated using the Friedman Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance on Rank test. If significant effects were found, non-parametric Wilcoxon signed ranks tests were conducted comparing each time point to the medium control group. Between group differences were examined using two-way analysis of variance. If differences were found, Bonferroni post test was used. When appropriate (non-normally distributed), between group differences were examined at each time period using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Significant effects were followed using the Mann-Whitney U test comparing only the novel treatment to control or agonist group. Data are presented as mean &#x000b1; SEM.
