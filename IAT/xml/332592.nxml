Injected at very low concentrations, this plasmid could be established as an extrachromosomal genetic element. When injected in greater concentration, an early arrest of embryonic development resulted. In the present work, we have studied this toxic effect in more detail by microinjecting short synthetic oligonucleotides with sequences from the mouse insert. Lethality was associated with the nucleotide sequence GTCACATG, identical with the CDEl element of yeast centromeres. Development of injected embryos was arrested between the one-cell and the early morula stages, with abnormal structures and DNA contents. Electrophoretic mobility shift and DNAse foot-printing assays demonstrated the binding of mouse nuclear protein(s) to the CDEl-like box. Base changes within the CDEl sequence prevented both the toxic effects in embryos and the formation of protein complex in vitro, suggesting that protein binding at such sites in chromosomal DNA plays an important role in early development.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00183-0195-a" xlink:role="7246"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00183-0196-a" xlink:role="7247"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00183-0197-a" xlink:role="7248"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00183-0197-b" xlink:role="7248"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00183-0192.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7243"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00183-0193.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7244"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00183-0194.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7245"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00183-0195.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7246"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00183-0196.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7247"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00183-0197.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7248"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00183-0198.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7249"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00183-0199.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7250"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
