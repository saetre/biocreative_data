Unveiling the cross talks between SGT1 and other co-chaperones such as p23, AHA1 (Activator of HSP90 ATPase 1) or RAR1 (Required for Mla12 resistance) is an important step towards understanding the HSP90 machinery. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mutational analyses of HSP90 revealed the nature of its binding with the CS domain of SGT1. Although CS is structurally similar to p23, these domains were found to non-competitively bind to various regions of HSP90; yet, unexpectedly, full-length SGT1 could displace p23 from HSP90. RAR1 partly shares the same binding site with HSP90 as the CS domain, whereas AHA1 does not. This analysis allowed us to build a structural model of the HSP90&#x02013;SGT1 complex and to obtain a compensatory mutant pair between both partners that is able to restore virus resistance <italic>in vivo</italic> through Rx (Resistance to potato virus X) immune sensor stabilization.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>molecular chaperone</kwd><kwd>co-chaperone</kwd><kwd>disease resistance</kwd><kwd>resistance protein</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most eukaryotic organisms can recognize potential pathogens and induce defence responses to prevent disease. In higher plants, one of the most effective surveillance systems is controlled by immune sensors&#x02014;the so-called resistance (R) proteins&#x02014;which directly or indirectly recognize specific pathogen effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Jones &#x00026; Dangl, 2006</xref>). The R protein homologues in animals&#x02014;that is, the NOD/CATERPILLER family proteins&#x02014;are also important in pathogen recognition, chronic inflammation and human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Strober <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Ting <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Genetic and molecular biological studies have shown that, in plants, HSP90 (Heat-shock protein 90), SGT1 (Suppressor of G2 allele of skp1) and RAR1 (Required for Mla12 resistance) are the chief regulatory components of disease resistance that are triggered by many immune sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Schulze-Lefert, 2004</xref>). Similarly, in animals, HSP90 and SGT1 are essential for the immune responses triggered by NOD family proteins such as NOD1-dependent cytokine synthesis, NOD2-mediated activation of the transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B and NALP3 (Nacht domain-, leucine rich repeat-, and PYD-containing protein 3)-mediated inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Da Silva Correia <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Mayor <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). SGT1 and HSP90 are also important for the assembly of the kinetochore complex in yeast and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bansal <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Steensgaard <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>HSP90 (or Hsp82 in yeast)&#x02014;a highly conserved eukaryotic molecular chaperone&#x02014;is essential for the maturation and activation of many signalling proteins. The function of HSP90 depends on its ability to bind to and hydrolyse ATP, which is regulated by co-chaperones such as p23 and AHA1 (Activator of HSP90 ATPase 1). p23 binds to the amino-terminal domain of HSP90 (N-HSP90) and stabilizes the state required for client protein maturation or activation by slowing the rate of ATP turnover, whereas AHA1 binds to the middle domain of HSP90 and activates ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Meyer <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ali <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we characterized the solution structure of the CS domain of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SGT1a that interacts with the N-HSP90. Functional analysis of the CS mutations indicated that the interaction between SGT1 and HSP90 is required for R protein accumulation and resistance against pathogens. We found that the CS domain is structurally similar to p23, suggesting that SGT1 has a similar binding property and activity as p23; however, the CS domain does not affect the ATPase activity of HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bot&#x000eb;r <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Understanding the structure of the SGT1&#x02013;HSP90 complex is crucial to explain the molecular mechanism of how it functions with immune sensors. Here, we generated a three-dimensional model structure of the complex by using the HADDOCK program and data from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based interaction surface mapping and mutational analyses. Surprisingly, although structurally similar to p23, SGT1 binds to a surface of HSP90 different from the surface corresponding to the p23-binding site. Both the TPR and SGS domains of SGT1 indirectly compete with p23 for binding to HSP90, thereby explaining the difference between the effects of SGT1 and p23 on the ATPase activity of HSP90, and suggesting that SGT1 acts as a unique co-chaperone of HSP90.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results And Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>SGT1 binds to a new co-chaperone-binding site of HSP90</title><p>To study the structure and function of the SGT1&#x02013;HSP90 complex, the region of HSP90 that interacts with the CS domain of SGT1 was mapped by NMR using the previously assigned N-terminal domain of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Hsp82 (N-ScHsp82; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Salek <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>) and the CS domains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Sgt1 (ScSgt1) or <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SGT1a (AtSGT1a) produced in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. We reassigned 95&#x00025; of the backbone N, C and H atoms of yeast Hsp82 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S1A</xref> online). The <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) experiment provides a fingerprint of the protein structure the cross-peaks of which are sensitive to any structural or environmental variation on binding of a partner. The unlabelled yeast CS domain was added progressively to an N-ScHsp82 <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>15</sup>N-labelled sample up to a molar ratio of 1:3 between N-ScHsp82 and CS-ScSgt1. Perturbations in the N-ScHsp82 resonances were monitored from the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC and triple-resonance three-dimensional experiment recordings. The <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>1</sup>H resonances of a restricted set of amino acids were notably affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S1B</xref> online). Mapping their positions on the surface of N-ScHsp82 resulted in a continuous surface patch, which probably accounts for the interaction surface between the two domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig 1</xref>). The core&#x02014;the most perturbed region of this interface&#x02014;corresponded to the &#x003b1;4 helix. The surrounding positions in the strand &#x003b2;1, the acidic loop between the strands &#x003b2;4 and &#x003b2;5, and the short &#x003b1;3 helix were affected but to a lesser extent. By using the titration signals of L89, L93 and G94 as probes, we extracted a mean <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value of 27&#x000b1;3 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S2</xref>). We also monitored the formation of a heterologous complex between the N-ScHsp82 domain and the CS domain of AtSGT1a (CSa), and found that the same residues in N-ScHsp82 were the most perturbed, with some differences in the weakly affected residues (E4 and T85; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S3A,B</xref>). In the presence of 150 mM NaCl, the same resonances were found to be perturbed on CS titration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S3C,D</xref>).</p><p>The amino acids involved in the interaction were defined further by site-directed mutagenesis of HSP90 using wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) HSP90 (TaHSP90), which has 91&#x00025; amino acid similarity to yeast Hsp82 and is highly soluble <italic>in vitro</italic>. We achieved eight single amino-acid substitutions in TaHSP90 for solvent-exposed residues that are located inside the surface affected by SGT1 binding. On the basis of the glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) pull-down experiments, the mutations E6R, T87E, K88E, D90R, N93R, D145R and E146R disrupted the ability of TaHSP90 to bind to CSa, full-length AtSGT1a or AtSGT1b <italic>in vitro</italic>, whereas the R100E mutation enhanced the ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S1A,B</xref> online). To check the conservation of this interaction across species, we made equivalent mutations in the N-terminal domain of yeast Hsp82. K86E (K88E in TaHSP90) and D143R (D145R in TaHSP90) reduced the binding to CSa, as well as CS of ScSgt1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S5</xref> online).</p><p>The region defined by these mutations is a new co-chaperone interaction site of HSP90, as other well-known co-chaperones such as p23 (yeast Sba1) and AHA1 bind to different regions (see below). Consistently, none of the mutations affected the binding of HSP90 to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> orthologues p23 (Atp23) and AHA1 (AtAHA1) <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig 2B,C</xref>). However, E6R, D90R and D145R reduced the binding of HSP90 to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RAR1 (AtRAR1), another protein required for immune sensor function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig 2D</xref>), suggesting that in contrast to p23 and AHA1, the HSP90 region where SGT1 binds partly overlaps the RAR1-binding surface. Consistently, binding to the CHORD-I domain of RAR1 was also reduced in these mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S4C</xref> online), confirming the earlier report that the CHORD-I domain competes with SGT1 for HSP90 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bot&#x000eb;r <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>A pair of HSP90 and SGT1 mutations restores resistance</title><p>The SGT1&#x02013;HSP90 binding interface was confirmed by searching for mutants that showed specific charge compensation effects. We tested six CSa mutants&#x02014;R153D, E155K, K159D, K170D, K221E and E223K&#x02014;for which binding to TaHSP90 was notably weaker, with five TaHSP90 mutants&#x02014;E6R, K88E, D90R, D145R and E146R (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S6</xref> online). Only one of these mutations, namely E223K in AtSGT1a and K88E in TaHSP90, restored the binding between both partners, from either the isolated CSa domain or the full-length AtSGT1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S6</xref> online). This suggests that K88 in TaHSP90 binds to E223 in TaHSP90 or at least that these amino acids are located close to each other on the interface. Consistently, the K86E mutation in the N-terminal domain of yeast Hsp82, which is equivalent to K88E in AtSGT1a, also complemented the reduced binding of E223K mutant in CSa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S7</xref> online).</p><p>To test whether these mutants also showed a compensatory effect <italic>in planta</italic>, we depleted the endogenous SGT1 amounts by virus-induced gene silencing in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> plants containing a haemagglutinin (HA)-tagged immune sensor, Rx, to confer resistance against the potato virus X (PVX; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Azevedo <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). In this line, we transiently expressed Myc-tagged AtSGT1a, Myc-E223K or &#x003b2;-glucuronidase (GUS) with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged PVX. The Myc-AtSGT1a protein restored the resistance, preventing PVX-GFP accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig 3B</xref>). By contrast, the Myc-E223K protein did not complement the loss of endogenous SGT1, allowing PVX-GFP accumulation to levels similar to those of the GUS control (thus susceptible). Next, we coexpressed Myc-AtSGT1a or Myc-E223K with HA-TaHSP90 or HA-K88E and analysed the resistance against PVX-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig 3C</xref>). The Myc-E223K/HA-K88E combination restored the resistance against PVX-GFP, whereas the Myc-E223K/HA-TaHSP90 combination did not. We obtained the same results with Myc-E231K in AtSGT1b, another copy of SGT1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S8</xref> online). Rx resistance was restored by the Myc-E223K/HA-K88E pair probably owing to the recovery of the Rx protein levels as shown in the protein blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig 3D</xref>). In conclusion, the direct interaction of SGT1 with the new co-chaperone-binding site in HSP90 is crucial for stabilizing the immune sensor Rx and its resistance to PVX.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Structural model of the CS&#x02013;HSP90 complex</title><p>By using the HADDOCK docking program (see Methods), we performed a docking simulation to explore further the possible structural arrangements that are compatible with the interface residues identified from the NMR and mutational analyses. Initially, no specific restraints were applied to the CS&#x02013;E223/HSP90&#x02013;K88 compensatory pair to check for the robustness of the docking simulation; only two solutions were found to entirely satisfy the spatial constraints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S9</xref> online). Of the two, only one cluster accounted for the charge compensation effect between K88E in TaHSP90 and E223K in AtSGT1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig 4A,B</xref>). In the lowest energy model, the side chains of E223 and K88 point towards the same side of the helix, and the tips of their side chains are only 2.6 &#x000c5; apart (N&#x003b6;-O&#x0025b;2 distance). E223, located just at the periphery of the interface, might readily compensate for a charge reversal in K88; therefore, the E223&#x02013;K88 compensation effect supports the model that represents a mode of association between CS and N-HSP90.</p><p>Further inspection of the lowest energy structure shows that the interface of 1,390 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> comprises a central hydrophobic patch between Y157<sub>SGT1a</sub>, V164<sub>SGT1a</sub> and A87<sub>HSP90</sub> that is surrounded by a group of charged interactions located near the N terminus of the CS domain. A consistent set of charge complementarities can be observed at the interface for the mutated charged residues in AtSGT1a (R153<sub>SGT1a</sub>-D144<sub>HSP90</sub>, E155<sub>SGT1a</sub>-K57<sub>HSP90</sub>, K170<sub>SGT1a</sub>-E146<sub>HSP90</sub>, K221<sub>SGT1a</sub>-D145<sub>HSP90</sub> and E223<sub>SGT1a</sub>-K88<sub>HSP90</sub>). Most of these side chains are found to be highly conserved throughout evolution, emphasizing the consistency of these networks.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Steric hindrance in co-chaperone-binding modes to HSP90</title><p>We constructed a global model with yeast p23 and AHA1 superimposed onto the CSa&#x02013;HSP90 complex (using Protein Data Bank codes 2CG9 and 2USV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig 4C</xref>). The binding interface between HSP90 and p23 (shown in purple) overlaps largely with that of AHA1 (shown in green), resulting in structural and functional competition between the two co-chaperones for HSP90 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Harst <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). CSa has a two-layered &#x003b2;-sandwich structure similar to that of p23, and the HSP90-binding sites of CSa and p23 are on the same side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bot&#x000eb;r <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, our results showed that both SGT1 and p23 bind to distinct sites of the HSP90. The contact surfaces of CSa and p23 in HSP90 seem to be contiguous but not overlapping. Consistent with the model, the CSa domain did not compete with p23 for HSP90 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig 5A</xref>), and remote from each other, neither did AHA1 and CSa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig 5B</xref>). Next, we assessed whether full-length SGT1 competes with Atp23 and AtAHA1 for HSP90 binding using AtSGT1b rather than AtSGT1a because of the higher affinity of the former for TaHSP90 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Although neither CSa nor CSb inhibited the binding of Atp23 to TaHSP90, AtSGT1b inhibited this binding in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S10</xref> online). The unexpected inhibition is caused by the N-terminal TPR and the carboxy-terminal SGS domains of SGT1, as TPR-CSb and CS-SGSb fragments perturb the Atp23&#x02013;TaHSP90 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig 5E,F</xref>), indicating that although the binding sites of HSP90 with SGT1 and p23 are different, these two proteins are unlikely to function simultaneously. By contrast, the AtAHA1 interaction with TaHSP90 was not perturbed by AtSGT1b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig 5D</xref>). As a control, we showed that neither AtSGT1b nor AtRAR1 could bind to AtAHA1 or Atp23 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S11</xref> online).</p><p>SGT1 and p23 bind to distinct regions of HSP90 but still compete with each other for binding, suggesting that SGT1 functions differently from p23. When ATP binds to the N-terminal domain, the HSP90 homodimer forms a closed conformation by association of the N-terminal domains. p23 preferentially binds to HSP90 in the presence of ATP or the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue AMP-PNP and stabilizes the closed conformation by inhibiting ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Siligardi <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). By contrast, CSa does not affect the ATPase activity of HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bot&#x000eb;r <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, the binding of SGT1 to HSP90 is unaffected by AMP-PNP but is enhanced by geldanamycin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Fig S12</xref> online), whereas geldanamycin inhibits p23 binding to HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Sullivan <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>). The different binding site of HSP90 and the distinct nature of SGT1 as compared with p23 suggest a new mode of action of this co-chaperone, which is consistent with the recently discovered function of SGT1 that would bridge both the HSP70 and HSP90 systems through various domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Spiechowicz <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">N&#x000f6;el <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Further investigations should enlighten the detailed mechanisms by which the TPR and SGS domains contribute to the function of HSP90.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p><italic>NMR spectroscopy.</italic> NMR experiments of uniformly labelled N-ScHsp82 (1&#x02013;210) were performed on Bruker Advance 2 600- and 700-MHz spectrometers at 298 K and those for resonance assignment, using 1 mM protein (pH 8) and 10 mM Tris.

SGT1 consists of three domains, the TPR (a tetratricopeptide repeat) domain, the CS domain (CHORD-containing protein and SGT1) and the SGS domain (SGT1-specific motif). The CS domain binds to the amino-terminal domain of HSP90. N, M and C indicate the N-terminal, middle and carboxy-terminal domains of HSP90, respectively.

Secondary structures are labelled and highlighted with respect to the domain structure shown below. The grey arrowheads indicate the residues the resonances of which were not observed in the NMR spectra. The grey asterisks indicate the residues assigned in the free form but not unambiguously identified in the bound form.
