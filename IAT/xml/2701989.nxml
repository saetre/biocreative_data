In contrast to transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), XPC and G-NER have been reported to contribute only modestly to cell survival after DNA damage. Previous studies were conducted using fibroblasts of human or mouse origin. Since the advent of Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, no study has focused on the bone marrow of these mice. We used carboplatin to induce DNA damage in Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; and strain-matched wild-type mice. Using several independent methods, Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; bone marrow was &#x0223c;10-fold more sensitive to carboplatin than the wild type. Importantly, 12/20 Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice died while 0/20 wild-type mice died. We conclude that G-NER, and XPC specifically, can contribute substantially to cell survival. The data are important in the context of cancer chemotherapy, where Xpc gene status and G-NER may be determinants of response to DNA-damaging agents including carboplatin. Additionally, altered cell cycles and altered DNA damage signalling may contribute to the cell survival end point.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <italic>xeroderma pigmentosum</italic> Xpc gene is defective in a subset of human patients exhibiting the cancer-prone disease <italic>xeroderma pigmentosum</italic> which results from defective nucleotide excision DNA repair (NER). <italic>XPC</italic> patients are sensitive to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced DNA damage and skin cancers. They also exhibit internal cancers with advanced age. The gene products encoded by Xpc and other XP genes A-G have been characterized biochemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Specifically, the XPC protein (encoded by the xeroderma pigmentosum Xpc gene) is required and is rate limiting for global genomic nucleotide excision repair (G-NER). XPC is neither required nor apparently involved in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). Thus, studies of Xpc are good models for G-NER separate from TC-NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>).</p><p>Mice lacking Xpc genes (Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice) were generated some 10 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). A number of studies of carcinogenesis and mutagenesis have been conducted, consistent with the cancer-prone human genetic disease discussed above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). This is the first study to examine bone marrow in Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice.</p><p>Bone marrow is often dose limiting in response to cancer chemotherapy drugs including carboplatin. While cell survival is a complex end point, the goal of chemotherapy is to sensitize cancer cells while retaining bone marrow cellularity. Agents that can protect bone marrow are important adjuncts to chemotherapy. Presently, the cytokine granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor is administered which causes proliferation of bone marrow myeloid stem/progenitor cells and thus repopulates bone marrow after chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). The idea of G-NER as a protective mechanism in bone marrow is novel. Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mouse bone marrow was highly sensitive to carboplatin. Patients carrying mutant XPC genes may exhibit an adverse bone marrow response to carboplatin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>Mice originated from Sands <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) and were purchased from Taconic Farms and bred at Indiana University under licence agreement as B6;129s7-XPC<sup>tml/Brd</sup> mice. Female mice were 10 weeks old at the time of initiating the experiments. Bone marrow was directly harvested and cultured for 24&#x02013;72 h for indicated <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). For <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), carboplatin (Sigma, St Louis, MI, USA) was dissolved in sterile saline and administered intra-peritoneally at weekly intervals over 6 weeks as indicated in the figure (0.5-ml injections, 60 or 100 mg/kg body weight). White blood cell (WBC) counts were by weekly tail vein blood collection in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-treated haematocrit tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Counting was done using a Hemavet 950 (Drew Scientific, Dallas, TX). Statistical analysis was conducted using a <italic>t</italic>-test using Microsoft Office 2003 or GraphPad Prism software. All mouse treatments were in accord with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Indiana University. Mice were sacrificed after 41 days using approved methods.

Cell yields were lower in Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; compared to wild type; therefore, cell numbers were normalized to 10<sup>7</sup> viable cells per genotype. Flow cytometry was conducted using six different lineage markers. No significant differences were observed in the lineage markers in comparing 10<sup>7</sup> cells of each genotype. As shown in the pie graph, lineage markers tested were Gr1+, B220+, Lin&#x02212;, CD4+, CD8+ and the small subpopulation Lin&#x02212;/Sca1+/c-kit+.

Removal of DNA lesions was markedly slow in Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; bone marrow, consistent with the known rate-limiting role of XPC in G-NER. Pooled bone marrow of three or more untreated 10-week-old mice of each genotype was used. Cells were cultured in cytokine-containing medium for 15 h, irradiated with 20 J/m<sup>2</sup> 254 nm UV radiation in phosphate-buffered saline and returned to tissue culture.

A fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody to BrdU was used to gate the BrdU-labelled population, which were then assayed for PI content. Values for carboplatin-treated bone marrow were divided by values for untreated bone marrow conducted side by side. The data represent three pooled mice of each genotype.

We wanted to determine if the presence or absence of XPC would alter DNA damage signalling. Immunoblots were conducted using 50 &#x003bc;g of total cell lysates (lanes 1 and 2, upper and lower panels). Equal amounts of cellular proteins, 5 mg, were then affinity purified on a ubiquitin-binding resin and immunoblotting of bound proteins was conducted. The higher molecular weight ubiquitinated forms of CUL4A (upper panel) and CDT1 (lower panel) clearly differ between the two genotypes (lanes 3 and 4 of upper and lower panels). The data suggest a defect in CUL4A and CDT1 ubiquitin modification in Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice. To help identify ubiquitinated CUL4A and CDT1, we used <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Omission of ubiquitin from the reaction shows that mainly ubiquitinated CUL4A is detected by the CUL4A antibody (lanes 5 and 6, upper panel). Plasmid-encoded CDT1 protein was also used as a marker (lanes 5 and 6, lower panel). (<bold>B</bold>) Knocking down XPC in H1299 cells alters the ubiquitin modification of CDT1. We used transiently transfected H1299 cells expressing an shRNA to XPC to test if the results shown in panel (<bold>A</bold>) were due directly to loss of XPC. Although Xpc was not completely silenced, it was clearly decreased by the shRNA. Higher molecular weight ubiquitinated forms of CDT1 were largely absent where XPC was knocked down, consistent with a role for XPC in DNA damage signalling to the CDT1 cell cycle checkpoint protein.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mutagegep011f03_ht"/></fig><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Effect of carboplatin administration <italic>in vivo</italic> in bone marrow of wild-type and Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice.

Cells were washed and re-suspended in 2-ml phosphate-buffered saline and irradiated as a thin monolayer in 60-cm<sup>2</sup> dishes, then placed back in culture medium.

The first observation was that the number of viable cells recovered from untreated Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; bone marrow was always 2- to 3-fold lower than wild type. To remedy this problem, we normalized the number of viable cells for both genotypes for the cell culture experiments. Cell numbers were normalized typically to 10<sup>7</sup> cells representing pooled cells of three mice of each genotype. The normalized cell populations then were used as a source of cells for tissue culture experiments. Flow cytometric analysis was conducted both immediately after harvest and after tissue culture experiments, to ascertain if any one cell lineage was affected in the Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, no single lineage was uniquely affected in Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice. Populations representing lineage markers Gr-1+, B220+, Lin&#x02212;, CD4+, CD8+ and the triply gated Lin&#x02212;/Sca1+/c-kit+ population were not significantly different between wild-type and Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice when comparing equal numbers of cells of both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The relative distribution of the lineage markers did not change over the course of cell culture experiments (results not shown), although the cell culture experiments were typically conducted within 48 h and were therefore short-term cultures.</p><p>Mice of wild type and Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; genotypes were assayed for XPC expression and G-NER activity. Bone marrow was used directly for western blotting using an XPC antibody. Bone marrow was additionally cultured 24 h, UV irradiated and then subjected to an immunoassay for removal of DNA damage. Removal of DNA lesions was 80% complete in wild-type mice after 16 h, while Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice were defective in removal of the lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, the Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice exhibit the expected defective NER phenotype.</p><p>We reasoned that the Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; DNA repair defect might affect the cell cycle as a secondary consequence of lack of lesion removal. A comparison was made between wild type and Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; for cell cycle distribution in the presence or absence of carboplatin. The majority (80%) of bone marrow cells when freshly harvested were in the G1 phase of the cell cycle irrespective of genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). By PI staining alone, no cell cycle defect of Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; bone marrow or difference from wild type was observed in any cell cycle phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To further analyse the cell cycle, we grew the cells for 48 h in the presence of BrdU, thereby labelling proliferating cells. Cells were then treated with 10-&#x003bc;M carboplatin for 15 h, fixed and stained for PI. Cells were gated for BrdU positivity using a fluorescein-labelled antibody and then for PI staining. A modest but significant decrease in the G1 phase was observed in Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). A G2 arrest by carboplatin was observed in both genotypes, which was more pronounced in Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; than in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The flow cytometric profiles corresponding to the bar graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. The intent of the cell cycle experiments was to reveal cell cycle differences between wild-type and Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; bone marrow, while minimally causing apoptosis or other cell death. However, use of a higher concentration of carboplatin revealed a G2 population of 8% in the wild type and 26% in the Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212;. Moreover, the sub-G1 apoptotic populations were 21% for the wild type and 38% for Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212;. Thus, G2 arrest may precede apoptosis, both of which were more pronounced in the Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mutant bone marrow compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>We examined several key cell cycle regulatory proteins for differences between Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; and wild type, including Rb, cyclin D1 and cyclin E, which were unremarkable (results not shown). Our analyses by western blotting would reveal not only protein steady-state levels but also phosphorylation and/or other modifications that might be affected as a secondary consequence of lack of lesion removal in the Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mutant. Interesting results were obtained for CUL4A and CDT1 cell cycle checkpoint proteins, which are involved in DNA damage signalling. The rationale for studying CUL4A and CDT1 was that XPC is a key substrate for CUL4A after DNA damage; thus, in the absence of XPC, other downstream targets including CDT1 might be either exaggerated or attenuated. Higher molecular weight forms of CUL4A and CDT1 were largely absent in Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; bone marrow suggesting that Xpc may play a role in the DNA damage signalling mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The differences in higher molecular weight CUL4a and CDT1 were observed in untreated, freshly harvested bone marrow. Both CUL4A and its downstream substrate CDT1 are ubiquitinated as evidenced by binding to a ubiquitin-binding resin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), although we do not exclude other possible post-translational modifications that may occur as well. The differences are not merely reflective of cell cycle differences, as cell cycle differences in untreated cells are not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The differences are not merely reflective of bone marrow cell subpopulations, which could theoretically differ between wild type and Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212;. No significant differences were observed between wild type and Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; for any of the six lineage markers shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Thus, the apparent defective ubiquitination of CUL4A and its downstream substrate CDT1 appears to be a characteristic of Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; bone marrow. We used transiently transfected H1299 cells to test if knocking down Xpc would mirror the mouse bone marrow findings. H1299 cells in which Xpc was knocked down by an shRNA plasmid showed a decrease in ubiquitinated CDT1, similar to that observed in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). XPC may therefore affect DNA damage signalling to the cell cycle checkpoint protein CDT1, although further studies are needed.</p><p>Having conducted cell culture experiments to characterize Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), we conducted experiments to address carboplatin sensitivity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Twenty mice of each genotype were divided into four treatment groups and administered carboplatin at weekly intervals. Mice were 10 weeks old at the time of initiating the experiment. By day 41 of carboplatin regimen, 12/20 Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice had died unexpectedly. No deaths were observed in wild-type mice receiving carboplatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). No deaths were observed in saline-only control groups of either genotype (results not shown). During the course of carboplatin treatments, peripheral WBC counts were measured weekly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Peripheral WBC counts in Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice were significantly lower than in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Remaining mice were sacrificed on or after day 41 using approved protocols. Mice were evaluated by a veterinary pathologist. The most significant pathology was marked hypocellularity in bone marrow in 10/10 Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice examined by the pathologist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Brain lesions were observed in &#x0223c;50% of the mice which, however, occurred with equal frequency in wild type and Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; (results not shown). No significant lesions were found in cecum, colon, duodenum, heart, ileum, jejunum, kidney, liver, lymph nodes, spleen, stomach or thymus. Perivascular lymphoid infiltrates were observed in lung in both genotypes (results not shown).</p><p>To quantify and further characterize the hypocellularity in Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; bone marrow, we conducted colony-forming assays and cell viability assays using a vital dye. A hallmark of myeloid stem/progenitor cell populations is their colony-forming ability when placed in culture and stimulated with cytokines. Colony-forming assays of bone marrow were conducted as in ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). The data were plotted as total colonies per femur. In the absence of carboplatin, Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice exhibited a 3-fold decrease in colony-forming units compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). With carboplatin, the difference was 10- to 12-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We also used the vital stain thiazolyl blue to measure cell viability after 4 days in culture. Using this method, carboplatin concentrations corresponding to 50% cell yield (known as IC<sub>50</sub> dose) was approximately 10-fold lower in Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). It is likely that a higher fraction of apoptosis contributed to decreased cell yield in Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; bone marrow, evidenced by the sub-G1 (apoptotic) fractions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. We also conducted experiments utilizing annexin V, an indicator of apoptosis that is assayed by flow cytometry. The Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; bone marrow showed a higher apoptotic fraction by annexin V staining (results not shown), although neither of these findings of apoptosis can exclude other mechanisms such as irreversible cell cycle arrests that may also contribute to overall cell yield.</p><p>Untreated Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice always yielded 2- to 3-fold fewer cells per femur compared to wild type. We used equal numbers of viable cells for cell culture experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> reflect the difference in overall bone marrow yield between wild type and Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212;. All six lineage markers were decreased in proportion to total cell yield in Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; as compared to wild type, i.e. no single lineage was uniquely affected. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref> shows raw cell numbers of distinct lineages, per femur, recovered from bone marrow of wild type and Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; genotypes after 41 days receiving either saline only or carboplatin.

Essentially all studies were conducted in human or mouse fibroblasts which showed 2- to 3-fold differences in cell survival after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). The present study is the first to examine bone marrow in Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice. Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; bone marrow exhibited 10-fold greater sensitivity to carboplatin compared to strain-matched wild-type bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). The data indicate that the Xpc gene can contribute substantially (10-fold) to cell survival in bone marrow. The cell survival end point was biologically relevant as bone marrow myelosuppression was dose limiting for carboplatin, consistent with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) and the majority of Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice died during the course of the experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). No deaths were observed in wild-type mice irrespective of the carboplatin regimen and/or duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and results not shown).</p><p>Carboplatin and cisplatin produce a similar DNA damage spectrum, mainly 1,2 and 1,3 platinum diadducts that are substrates for NER <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). However, our data do not exclude that minor lesions such as platinum monoadducts, interstrand cross-links and/or base damage by reactive oxygen species may also contribute to the cell survival end point. Recent studies point to a role for XPC in repair of oxidative DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). A catalytic role for XPC in base-excision DNA repair (BER) was suggested by the finding that XPC enhanced the activity of the DNA glycosylase 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylate (OGG1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Colony-forming ability of Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; bone marrow was decreased 3-fold compared to wild type even in the absence of carboplatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). As endogenous base damage is removed by the separate BER pathway, the decreased cell yield in Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice may be due to the XPC role in BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Interestingly, Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; fibroblasts exhibited sensitivity to a 20% oxygen environment compared to wild-type fibroblasts consistent with a role in base damage repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>).</p><p>Cell survival though is a complex end point that involves cell cycle effects. We found that Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; bone marrow cells were defective in a G1 checkpoints and showed increased accumulation in G2 compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). One possibility is that Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; bone marrow cells exit the cell cycle after a prolonged G2 or may be irreversibly arrested in G2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We show that CUL4A and CDT1 cell cycle proteins exhibit defective ubiquitination even in untreated Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice. The data suggest an alteration in DNA damage signalling in Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), although further studies are warranted. Given that these data were obtained in the absence of carboplatin, it is possible that XPC signalling of oxidative base damage involves the CUL4A/CDT1 mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Thus, XPC may contribute to DNA damage sensitivity including base damage by (i) controlling the BER protein OGG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), (ii) altering cell cycles and (iii) affecting DNA damage signalling to downstream effectors including CUL4A and CDT1. Our data pertain to bone marrow; thus, it is not known if absence of functional XPC would exhibit these same features in other cell types.</p><p>Human patients with <italic>xeroderma pigmentosum XPC</italic> mutant alleles typically develop skin cancers well prior to age 20 and develop internal cancers with ageing. Similarly, Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice develop spontaneous lung cancers at &#x0223c;1 year of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). We used mice as young as possible for the current study. Perhaps human <italic>XPC</italic> patients would exhibit myelosuppression were they to live to advanced age. On the other hand, the mice are completely null for Xpc genes, while the human mutant <italic>XPC</italic> alleles probably exhibit variable penetrance. One study did show myelosuppression in an <italic>XPC</italic> patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Thus, cancer therapeutic regimens may require modification in the case of <italic>XPC</italic> patients.</p><p>In summary, the Xpc gene product protects mouse bone marrow from exogenous and probably endogenous DNA damage with cell survival as an end point. The biological relevance is indicated by the fact that 12/20 Xpc&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice receiving carboplatin died while 0/20 wild-type mice died. No deaths were observed in saline-only controls of either genotype. The proximal cause of death appeared to be bone marrow failure, although other tissues may have contributed. The XPC protein may be linked to the CUL4A/CDT1 cell cycle checkpoint, probably relevant to DNA damage signalling and may contribute to the cell death mechanism.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p><funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source> (<award-id>R01 HL086978</award-id>) to M.L.S.; <funding-source>American Institute for Cancer Research</funding-source> (<award-id>04B010</award-id>) to M.L.S.; <funding-source>US Department of Defense</funding-source> (<award-id>BC051172</award-id>) to J.L.F.
