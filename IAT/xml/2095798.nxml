The rapid external development and transparency of zebrafish embryos allow direct observation of developmental processes and the deployment of fluorescent reporter genes to facilitate examination of spatial and temporal gene expression patterns in living embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The availability of efficient techniques for manipulation of gene expression enables studies of gene function to be executed readily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The ease with which genetic and small molecule screens can be carried out has allowed the identification of novel genetic pathways involved in specific developmental processes and the isolation of novel chemical modifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7">4&#x02013;7</xref>). More recently, it has been suggested that many of these advantages might apply to the study of human diseases: valuable insights into disease pathogenesis, or leads to new therapeutic approaches, could be provided by high-content small molecule screens, genetic suppressor screens, observation of disease progression in real time <italic>in vivo</italic>, using fluorescent reporters to label cell populations of interest, and rapid hypothesis-testing experiments in statistically robust samples of larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>). Exploitation of these techniques could provide powerful means to analyse human disease. However, full realization of this potential will be critically dependent on the development of zebrafish models that faithfully recapitulate relevant pathological mechanisms.The long-term objectives of our work are to elucidate mechanisms of neurodegeneration and to identify novel neuroprotective compounds to treat patients with neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to accomplish these objectives by exploiting the advantageous features of the zebrafish as a model. The zebrafish is an appropriate organism in which to study neurodegeneration. As a vertebrate, the basic organization and divisions of the nervous system are similar to those of other vertebrates, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The zebrafish CNS contains specialized neuronal populations of direct relevance to human neurodegenerative diseases, for example, dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), cerebellar Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In addition to neurons, the zebrafish CNS contains oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), the human homologues of which may play central roles in neurodegeneration through critical neural&#x02013;glial interactions. Finally, there is extensive genetic and biochemical similarity between the zebrafish and human. Many genes involved in human neurodegenerative diseases have highly conserved orthologues in the zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19">17&#x02013;19</xref>). Zebrafish neurons are susceptible to toxins that target pathways implicated in sporadic neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22 B23">20&#x02013;23</xref>). These considerations suggest that it may be possible to recapitulate neurodegeneration in the zebrafish brain through similar biochemical mechanisms to those underlying human disease. Consequently, generation of representative disease models may be feasible, enabling the analyses described above to yield insights into pathogenic mechanisms and identification of therapeutic targets.</p><p>As a first step towards developing zebrafish models of neurodegenerative disease, we would like to test the hypothesis that zebrafish, engineered to express genes associated with neurodegeneration in humans, will develop histological and biochemical abnormalities reflecting those found in the relevant diseases. This hypothesis can be tested by generating transgenic zebrafish expressing appropriate genes in CNS neurons, and then carrying out analysis for evidence of neuronal cell death or dysfunction, and histopathological features or biochemical abnormalities reminiscent of the human diseases. Generation of transgenic models relies on the availability of <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements that drive transgene expression in an appropriate spatial and temporal pattern. For a neurodegenerative disease model, the regulatory elements should have the following properties: (i) expression in a wide variety of neurons, in order to study the differential vulnerability of specific neuronal subpopulations, which is a key feature of human diseases; (ii) expression commencing in differentiated neurons after the earliest stages of development, since a pathogenic transgene might provoke pathological changes in neuronal precursors through disruption of developmental mechanisms that are not relevant to late-onset neurodegeneration; (iii) expression persisting into adulthood, in order to examine the effects of aging on pathogenesis and disease progression; (iv) expression that is sufficiently robust to provoke a phenotype. The purpose of the present study was to isolate suitable <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements with these properties.</p><p>Mammals have three forms of the glycolytic enzyme enolase, each encoded by a separate gene. The mammalian ENO2 gene encodes the neuron-specific &#x003b3;-enolase isoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), which is expressed in mature neurons throughout the neuraxis; consequently, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) is frequently used as a marker to identify cells with neuronal differentiation in human histopathology samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). A 1.8 kb fragment of the rat ENO2 promoter drives transgene expression widely in mature neurons of the mouse CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and has been used to generate transgenic rodent models for the study of neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27 B28 B29 B30 B31">26&#x02013;31</xref>). Since endogenous zebrafish promoters have been associated with high transgenesis rates and reproducible expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), we decided to clone the zebrafish orthologue of ENO2 and to isolate its promoter as a resource for generating transgenic models of neurodegeneration in zebrafish.</p><p>In this study, we identified and characterized the zebrafish <italic>eno2</italic> gene. Zebrafish <italic>eno2</italic> is first expressed in the developing nervous system at 24 hpf; however, steady-state levels of the transcript become significantly more abundant later during development and robust expression persists through adulthood. We isolated the zebrafish <italic>eno2</italic> promoter region, and showed that its activity in driving GFP reporter gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic> was enhanced by the presence of the first intron, which contains a putative CpG island. Five independent lines of Tg(<italic>eno2:GFP</italic>) zebrafish, in which green fluorescent protein was expressed under the transcriptional control of a 12 kb zebrafish <italic>eno2</italic> promoter fragment, showed widespread neuronal GFP expression, including cholinergic, dopaminergic GABAergic and cerebellar Purkinje neurons. In order to assess the utility of this promoter element for constructing disease models, we replaced GFP with a cDNA expressing the 4-repeat isoform of the human microtubule-associated protein Tau. Stable transgenic Tg(<italic>eno2:Tau</italic>) zebrafish showed widespread CNS neuronal expression of Tau, at high levels compared with normal human brain. Human 4R-Tau was found within axons, neuropil and in ectopic accumulations in neuronal cell bodies of Tg(<italic>eno2:Tau</italic>) zebrafish. These data show that <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements from the zebrafish <italic>eno2</italic> regulatory region will be useful for stable expression of transgenes in neurons throughout the zebrafish CNS. The <italic>eno2</italic> promoter will enable us to test the hypothesis that biochemical and histological changes representative of human diseases may be provoked in susceptible neuronal populations by expression of mutant transgenes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Zebrafish and microscopy</title><p>Experiments were carried out in accordance with Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee regulations and approvals.

Further database searches identified ESTs and mRNAs corresponding to each of these four genes, but no additional zebrafish enolase sequences were found. The protein sequences predicted by the four zebrafish genes were aligned with the primary sequences of human, rat and mouse &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-enolases and evolutionary relationships between the proteins were inferred by construction of a dendrogram using the neighbour joining method of Saitou and Nei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). The enolase encoded by the zebrafish chromosome 19 gene locus was most closely related to human and rodent &#x003b3;-enolases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A).

The enolase encoded by the zebrafish chromosome 2 locus was most closely related to mammalian &#x003b2;-enolases, suggesting that this gene should be designated zebrafish <italic>eno3</italic>. The enolases encoded by the zebrafish chromosome 22 and chromosome 23 gene loci were highly homologous to one another, and to mammalian &#x003b1;-enolases, suggesting that there are two zebrafish <italic>eno1</italic> genes. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The zebrafish <italic>eno2</italic> orthologue.

Hybridization of an <italic>eno2</italic> antisense cRNA probe with a northern blot containing total RNA from adult zebrafish brain, muscle and gut revealed a single brain-specific <italic>eno2</italic> mRNA of 3.5 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization was used to localize expression of the <italic>eno2</italic> transcript within the adult brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). The <italic>eno2</italic> antisense cRNA probe hybridized with cells that showed neuronal morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, inset panel) and were located in grey matter nuclei and laminae throughout the brain and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, upper two panels). The most prominent labelling was seen in the telencephalon, deep laminae of the optic tectum, cranial nerve motor nuclei, granule cell and Purkinje cell layers of the cerebellum and brainstem reticular formation. Under identical conditions, a sense control <italic>eno2</italic> cRNA probe did not label sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B lower panel), and a probe for the oligodendrocyte marker <italic>mpz</italic> showed a non-overlapping hybridization pattern with <italic>eno2</italic>.

These controls confirm the specificity of the <italic>eno2</italic> expression pattern demonstrated by this technique, and show that the widespread hybridization pattern of the <italic>eno2</italic> cRNA probe to brain sections is attributable to pan-neuronal expression of <italic>eno2</italic> rather than non-specific probe hybridization. Northern blot analysis of total RNA samples from whole embryo lysates showed that the 3.5 kb <italic>eno2</italic> transcript was first detected at 48 h post-fertilization (hpf), but its expression level increased markedly between 48 and 72 hpf to reach a maximum at 72 hpf; expression continued at a similar level thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D).

Consequently, we proceeded to characterize the gene and isolate its <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements.</p><p>We employed 5&#x02032;rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), using the tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), in order to locate the <italic>eno2</italic> transcriptional start site and promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Amplification of cDNA derived from TAP-treated (TAP<sup>+</sup>), adapter ligated RNA, using a RACE adapter primer and a gene-specific primer, yielded several products of 300&#x02013;320 bp. Under the same conditions, no products were generated by amplification of cDNA derived from an identical RNA sample which was not subjected to TAP treatment (TAP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) before adapter ligation. Using two <italic>eno2</italic> gene-specific primers, instead of the RACE primer, amplification products were generated from both TAP<sup>+</sup> and TAP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> samples. These controls show that the RNA samples and reverse transcription were equivalent between the TAP<sup>+</sup> and TAP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> samples; however, adapter ligation and RACE amplification was dependent on cleavage of the mRNA cap structure by TAP. Consequently, the boundary between the RACE adapter and the <italic>eno2</italic> sequence in the RACE amplification product corresponds to the 5&#x02032; boundary of the <italic>eno2</italic> transcript and therefore the transcriptional start site of the <italic>eno2</italic> gene. We cloned the RACE products and sequenced 16 randomly chosen clones. Sequence analysis disclosed the presence of an untranslated first exon in the <italic>eno2</italic> gene, which is located 3.6 kb upstream of exon 2. There are four transcriptional start sites distributed over 28 bp of the promoter sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Examination of the 5&#x02032; genomic flanking region did not reveal canonical TATA or CAAT motifs. 3&#x02032;RACE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C) showed a single consensus AUUAAA polyadenylation signal at position 3232 in the transcript, with respect to the most 5&#x02032; transcription start site. The full transcript is 3259 nt in length, in agreement with the northern blot data, after allowing for addition of the poly(A) tract. Comparison of the full cDNA sequence with the genomic DNA sequence showed that zebrafish <italic>eno2</italic> is composed of 12 exons distributed over 18.6 kb of genomic sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). The boundary between intron 1 and exon 2 is a single nucleotide 5&#x02032; of the ATG translational initiation codon, such that the obligatory A residue at position &#x02013;3 of the Kozak consensus sequence is located within the 3&#x02032; end of exon 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). The genomic organization of zebrafish <italic>eno2</italic> is very similar to human ENO2, which also contains 12 exons, the first of which is untranslated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). The length of each protein-encoding exon is identical between human and zebrafish, as are the phases of the splice boundaries with respect to protein translation (Supplementary Data, Table 1). Exon 12 of the zebrafish gene encodes the C-terminus of the protein and a 3&#x02032;UTR of 1882 bp. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>The zebrafish <italic>eno2</italic> gene and promoter.

We analysed genomic DNA extracted from pooled embryos resulting from outcross of each microinjected fish with a wild-type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). A total of 132 adult F0 zebrafish fish were assayed for germline transmission in this manner.

Some groups of inhibitory GABAergic neurons also showed GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>F), although many of the clusters of small GABAergic neruons identified in the diencephalon did not show GFP expression. Catecholaminergic neurons were identified by their expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). The most robust GFP expression in catecholaminergic neurons was seen in dopaminergic cells of the olfactory bulbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D); dopaminergic neurons in the pretectal area also exhibited prominent GFP immunoreactivity. Other TH-positive groups showed variable expression of GFP; for example the large dopaminergic neurons of the periventricular hypothalamus did not express detectable GFP (data not shown).

Larvae from lines Pt401&#x02013;403 showed an identical expression pattern; examples from line Pt401 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A. Robust expression of GFP mRNA was seen in the nervous system and, between 30 and 48 hpf, in the developing fins. By 72 hpf GFP mRNA was no longer detected in the fins (except along the distal margins of the pectoral fins), corresponding to the transient GFP expression seen by epifluorescence microscopy. Expression outside the nervous system was not otherwise seen in lines Pt401&#x02013;403. In line Pt404, which showed the highest expression level of GFP in adult brain, GFP mRNA was also abundant in the larval brain and spinal cord. In addition, GFP mRNA was detected in the developing fins at 48 hpf and in the developing gut at 96 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). The weak signal in the gut was only apparent after prolonged development of the histochemical reaction. In line Pt405, widespread expression of GFP mRNA outside the nervous system was seen in a similar distribution to that observed by epifluorescence microscopy, in the fins, myospetae and developing head region. Next, we performed a northern blot analysis of non-neural tissues derived from adult transgenic fish from lines Pt404 and Pt401 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D), specifically asking whether the GFP transgene was expressed in the adult gut in line Pt404. Robust GFP expression in the brain was detected by this technique, but GFP mRNA was not detected in gut, muscle or testis from either line, even after 5-fold over-exposure of the blot. The &#x003b2;-actin loading control confirmed that equal amounts of mRNA were loaded in each lane of the blot. The failure to detect GFP mRNA in the gut of adult Tg(<italic>eno2:GFP</italic>)<sup>Pt404</sup> fish suggests that expression in the gut during development is transient, or that adult gut expression occurs at a very low level, beyond the limit of detection by this technique. Finally, we examined intact adult fish by epifluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E). Lines Pt404 and Pt405 showed persistent weak expression of GFP along the extreme distal margins of the fins. In addition, fluorescent sensory nerve axons in the peripheral nervous system were visible through the dermis of adult Tg(<italic>eno2:GFP</italic>)<sup>Pt404</sup> zebrafish. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>GFP expression outside the central nervous system of Tg(<italic>eno2:GFP</italic>) zebrafish.

MAP-Tau4R contains four carboxy-terminal tandem repeat sequences of 31&#x02013;32 amino acids within the microtubule binding domain, and is deposited in cerebral neurons in the human neurodegenerative disorders progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). In contrast to the <italic>eno2:GFP</italic> construct described above, which was generated by making a translational fusion between exon 2 of the <italic>eno2</italic> gene and GFP, we were anxious to avoid altering the primary sequence of MAP-Tau4R. Consequently, we used a cDNA encoding MAP-Tau4R to replace the ORF of <italic>eno2</italic> in its entirety, relying on accurate and efficient splicing of the intron present in the chimeric <italic>eno2:MAP-Tau4R</italic> transcript to generate an <italic>eno2:Tau</italic> transcriptional fusion with a Kozak consensus sequence at the translational initiation codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). In addition, we added an internal ribosome entry site and GFP sequence to the cassette, in order to allow visual genotyping of transgenic fish by fluorescence microscopy. We found that the IRES sequence functions too weakly in fish to be reliably used for this purpose (data not shown), and so we identified zebrafish carrying the transgene by PCR genotyping using the GFP primers shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B. Transgenic Tg(<italic>eno2:Tau</italic>) lines were generated as described above. Heterozygous Tg(<italic>eno2:Tau</italic>) zebrafish larvae comprised a Mendelian fraction of each clutch of eggs and were viable and fertile as adults. The adults are currently 12 months old and show no evidence of increased mortality or reduced fertility in comparison with wild-type zebrafish. A full histological, biochemical and behavioural characterization of Tg(<italic>eno2:Tau</italic>) zebrafish will be reported separately. In the present study, we concentrated on assessing the utility of the zebrafish <italic>eno2</italic> promoter for construction of this type of model, and here we report relevant findings in one line of transgenic zebrafish, designated Tg(<italic>eno2:Tau</italic>)<sup>Pt406</sup>.</p><p>First, we asked whether splicing of <italic>eno2</italic> intron 1 from the chimeric <italic>eno2:Tau</italic> transcript occurred with sufficient efficiency and fidelity to allow expression of the transgene. This is an important consideration, since the transgene sequence was inserted 2 nt downstream of the <italic>eno2</italic> exon 2 splice acceptor, potentially modifying the splicing event. Northern blots were constructed using total RNA from wild-type and Tg(<italic>eno2:Tau</italic>)<sup>Pt406</sup> zebrafish brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). An antisense cRNA probe to GFP hybridized with a single 2.5 kb band, which is the expected size of the transgene mRNA after splicing. A duplicate blot was hybridized with a cRNA probe to <italic>eno2</italic> exons 1&#x02013;3. As expected, this detected the endogenous 3.5 kb <italic>eno2</italic> transcript in both wild-type and transgenic samples, but also hybridized with a 2.5 kb RNA from transgenic brain, suggesting that the 2.5 kb species is formed by splicing of intron 1 from the chimeric transcript. The primary transcript derived from the transgene is predicted to be 6.5 kb in size, and a band of this size was not seen even after prolonged exposure of either blot, indicating that splicing occurred efficiently. It should be noted that the native <italic>eno2</italic> transcript presents 307 nt of sequence complementary to the probe, but the chimeric <italic>eno2-Tau</italic> transcript presents only 72 nt of sequence complementary to the probe. Therefore, the relative abundance of the two transcripts cannot be estimated from the relative signal intensities of the hybridizing bands. In order to examine the fidelity of splicing, we performed RT&#x02013;PCR, using a 5&#x02032; primer complementary to <italic>eno2</italic> exon 1 and a 3&#x02032; primer complementary to the human MAP-Tau4R cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). A single 400 bp product, the expected size of the PCR product after intron 1 splicing, was amplified from cDNA derived from Tg(<italic>eno2:Tau</italic>)<sup>Pt406</sup> zebrafish brain, but not wild-type brain. No other bands were generated, suggesting that splicing occurred accurately at the native boundaries. We cloned the RT&#x02013;PCR product and sequenced 10 randomly chosen clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C). All 10 clones showed identical sequence spanning the junction between <italic>eno2</italic> exon1 and human 4R-Tau. The junction occurred at an identical location to the exon1&#x02013;exon2 junction in the native <italic>eno2</italic> mRNA, and accurately re-constituted the Kozak consensus signal for translation of the 4R-Tau transgene. These data confirm that the native <italic>eno2</italic> intron 1 splice signals were operational even after the replacement of exon 2 with a heterologous transgene sequence. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Splicing of intron 1 from a chimeric <italic>eno2:Tau</italic> transcript <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Western blot analysis was undertaken using lysates from Tg(<italic>eno2:Tau</italic>)<sup>Pt406</sup> zebrafish brains, wild-type zebrafish brains and human post-mortem cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). Equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane and the blot was sequentially probed using: (i) a monoclonal antibody that recognizes all splice isoforms of human MAP-Tau, but which does not react with zebrafish microtubule-associated proteins, followed by: (ii) an actin antibody that recognizes both the human and zebrafish proteins. Bands representing the six reported human MAP-Tau isoforms were evident in the human cortex sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). A single abundant band corresponding to the MAP-Tau4R transgene was observed in the sample derived from Tg(<italic>eno2:Tau</italic>)<sup>Pt406</sup> zebrafish brain; this was not seen in the sample derived from control zebrafish brain. Densitometric measurement suggested that the transgenic fish brain expressed 8&#x02013;10-fold higher levels of MAP-Tau relative to the &#x003b2;-actin control than human cortex. These data suggest that the <italic>eno2</italic> promoter drives high-level transgene expression in adult zebrafish brain. To ascertain the expression pattern of transgenic 4R-Tau, we undertook a preliminary histological examination of adult Tg(<italic>eno2:Tau</italic>)<sup>Pt406</sup> zebrafish brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B). IHC, using the primary antibody used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A, showed widespread expression of human MAP-Tau4R throughout Tg(<italic>eno2:Tau</italic>)<sup>Pt406</sup>, but not wild-type, zebrafish brain. The transgene product was readily detectable owing to its abundant expression. For example, in the optic tectum, large afferent axons parallel to the pial surface of the brain in the superficial laminae, and large axons perpendicular to the pial surface in the deep laminae were densely labelled with the Tau antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B, lower left panel). In addition, the neuropil was heavily labelled, as were neurons in multiple laminae. High-power examination revealed abnormal cytoplasmic expression of Tau in many neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B, lower right panel). Neuronal somatic Tau immunolabelling was dense and showed a refractile pattern suggestive of fibrillar deposition in several areas, including the thalamus.

The genes are likely derived from a common ancestor, and the demonstration of other zebrafish enolase genes predicting proteins with homology to mammalian &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-enolase isoenzymes suggests that the gene duplications that presumably led to distinct functionally specialised enolase isoenzymes occurred before fish and mammals diverged in evolution. The conserved neuronal expression pattern of <italic>eno2</italic> suggests that &#x003b3;-enolase might have specific functions in neurons. Two putative <italic>eno1</italic> orthologues were found in zebrafish. An ENO1 processed pseudogene is present within the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), but it shows characteristics of sequence inserted by reverse transcription, in particular lacking introns. This was not the case in the zebrafish genes, and it seems likely that the zebrafish has two copies of the <italic>eno1</italic> gene.</p><p>Expression of an ENO2 orthologue in zebrafish has been previously described in a high-throughput <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization analysis (accessible on line: Thisse and Thisse 2004, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zfin.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-markerview.apg&#x00026;OID=ZDB-GENE-040704-27">http://zfin.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-markerview.apg&#x00026;OID=ZDB-GENE-040704-27</ext-link>). The expression pattern described in the present study is similar to the previous work, except that an earlier time of onset of expression in trigeminal ganglia, and expression in developing myotomes, was described in the earlier study. A likely explanation for these minor differences relates to the probe sequences used in the studies. We selected a short (307 nt) probe complementary to the 5&#x02032; end of the <italic>eno2</italic> transcript because it showed no cross-hybridization with other enolase transcripts, whereas probes complementary to the 3&#x02032; end of the <italic>eno2</italic> open reading frame showed cross hybridization with <italic>eno1</italic> and <italic>eno3</italic>. The probe used in the high-throughput study was generated from a plasmid containing 1379 bp of the <italic>eno2</italic> open reading frame. Although the greater length of this probe likely enhanced its sensitivity for detecting low-level expression at earlier time points, our data suggest that this may have been at the expense of specificity.</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>eno2</italic> regulatory region</title><p>Similar to the human and rat genes, the zebrafish <italic>eno2</italic> promoter lacks canonical TATA, CAAT or initiator sequences, shows multiple transcriptional start sites, and the gene contains an untranslated first exon that is spliced to a second exon containing the ATG translational initiation codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Approximately 40% human genes have untranslated first exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), and there are several examples of genes in which important regulatory elements lie in the first intron following an untranslated first exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). In the zebrafish gene, we found a putative 200 bp CpG island in the first intron; analysis of the rat and human first introns similarly showed short CpG islands. Although the introns from the three different species showed very limited sequence conservation overall, the CpG islands were more highly conserved (human-rat 64%, human-zebrafish 46%; Supplementary Data, Figure 2). A previously reported <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis of the rat NSE promoter suggested that there may be a neuron-specific enhancer sequence within the first intron of the rat gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Our data in transgenic fish <italic>in vivo</italic> are compatible with the similar presence of neuronal regulatory elements in the first intron of the zebrafish <italic>eno2</italic> gene, suggesting phylogenetic conservation of an intronic neuronal enhancer. The important elements could be delineated by deletion analysis, to establish whether the phylogenetically conserved sequences are necessary or sufficient for promoter activity and specificity.</p><p>Previous attempts to construct transgenic murine models of Alzheimer's disease used a 1.8 kb fragment of the rat NSE promoter to drive expression of the amyloid precursor protein &#x003b2;-APP. The transgene was expressed at insufficient levels to reproduce the full pathological profile of Alzheimer's disease in transgenic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). The 1.8 kb rat NSE construct likely contains a small subset of the <italic>cis</italic>-acting signals that contribute to physiological expression levels of the native transcript, and lacks the regulatory elements present in the first intron of the rat gene. This might account for its failure to drive expression at sufficient levels to provoke pathology. The 12 kb zebrafish <italic>eno2</italic> promoter fragment expressed the human MAP-Tau gene in hemizygous transgenic animals at 8-fold higher levels than in human brain. The 12 kb fragment contains the putative neuronal intronic enhancer; in addition a generic intron enhances transgene expression levels in transgenic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), possibly through mechanisms other than the presence of transcriptional regulatory regions within the intron, such as linked intron splicing and nuclear mRNA export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>).</p><p>Despite the 12 kb <italic>eno2</italic> promoter construct expressing transgenes at high levels, it does not contain all of the <italic>cis</italic>-acting signals present in the zebrafish gene, since the reporter transgene does not fully recapitulate the expression pattern of the endogenous transcript. Thus, in adult Tg(<italic>eno2:GFP</italic>) brain from each of the lines, little GFP expression was visible in the cerebellar granule cell layer, even though the endogenous transcript was abundantly expressed in this brain region. Large fragments of the regulatory region of the murine ENO2 gene are required to recapitulate the physiological gene expression pattern in mice; a 250 kb BAC reporter containing the entire murine ENO2 locus, showed expression of the transgene in a similar pattern to the endogenous gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Two further transgenic lines in which transgene expression was driven by a 25 kb genomic fragment only partially recapitulated the expression pattern of the endogenous transcript. Interestingly, one of the principal differences between the 25 kb and 250 kb regulatory elements was loss of transgene expression in the granule cells of the cerebellum with the smaller construct. This is similar to the pattern we observed in Tg(<italic>eno2:GFP</italic>) zebrafish, in which GFP expression was absent from the cerebellar granule cell layer, despite expression of the endogenous gene in this region. This suggests that sequences responsible for &#x003b3;-enolase expression in cerebellar granule cells lie remote from the immediate 5&#x02032; region of the gene in both mouse and zebrafish. We saw ectopic GFP expression in Tg(<italic>eno2:GFP</italic>) embryos in the distal margins of the fins in non-neural structures. This expression was presumably due to the absence of an important non-neural repressor element in the 12 kb <italic>eno2</italic> transgene construct, since we observed the finding in multiple independent transgenic lines. In addition, weak ectopic GFP expression was observed in the gut of Tg(<italic>eno2:GFP</italic>)<sup>Pt404</sup> larvae. It is unclear whether this is attributable to absence of an important promoter element or to an artefact arising from the site of genomic integration, since we did not observe expression in the gut of other transgenic lines. However, Pt404 shows the highest expression level and so might be the only line in which low-level &#x02018;leaky&#x02019; promoter activity was detectable in the intestine. Ectopic expression in myoseptae and cartilage of Tg(<italic>eno2:GFP</italic>)<sup>Pt405</sup> larvae was presumably a result of a genomic integration site artefact, since transgene expression was not seen in these locations in other lines. Interestingly, an unexpected <italic>eno2</italic> hybridizing band was seen on northern blot analysis of brain RNA derived from this line, in addition to the expected endogenous gene and transgene bands. This finding suggests an aberrant splicing event between the transgene and a gene in the vicinity of its genomic integration site, perhaps accounting for the ectopic GFP expression observed in this line.</p></sec><sec><title>Meganuclease-mediated transgenesis</title><p>The 12 kb <italic>eno2</italic> promoter fragment is sufficiently small that insertion of transgene sequences into the plasmid construct is straightforward; the resulting plasmid can be grown at high copy number in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and DNA preparations made with ease. In addition, the relatively compact nature of the construct allows for efficient transgenesis using the I-Sce1 technique. Had we pre-screened for GFP expression, the germline transgenesis rate amongst microinjection survivors would have been much higher than the 4% we observed; assuming the 4% was a subset of the &#x0223c;30% that expressed GFP, we might have expected to isolate 10&#x02013;15% germline transgenics from the GFP-expressing embryos.</p></sec><sec><title>Tg(<italic>eno2:GFP</italic>) zebrafish</title><p>The stable lines of Tg(<italic>eno2:GFP</italic>) zebrafish generated in the course of this work may be useful for applications demanding <italic>in vivo</italic> visualization of neurons and their axons.

GFP-expressing cells in Tg(<italic>eno2:GFP</italic>) embryos and larvae showed morphological features of mature neurons, and were visible throughout the neuraxis. Later stages of CNS development or the effects of neurotoxins or genetic mutations that cause neurodegeneration could be directly observed in these transgenic zebrafish <italic>in vivo</italic> by epifluorescence microscopy.

The data suggest that the <italic>eno2</italic> promoter fulfils many of the requisite properties for this application:</p><sec><title>Spatial expression pattern</title><p>We observed expression of the transgene in neurons of the brain, spine, retina and peripheral nervous system in five independent transgenic (<italic>eno2:GFP</italic>) lines. GFP expression was evident in neuronal populations of specific relevance to the study of neurodegeneration, for example cerebellar Purkinje cells, motor neurons and dopaminergic neurons. This spatial pattern is appropriate for studying the differential susceptibility of subgroups of neurons to proteins expressed ubiquitously in neurons. One possible concern for the use of the <italic>eno2</italic> promoter in transgenic disease models relates to ectopic expression of the transgene in non-neuronal cells at the distal margins of the fins and also at low levels in the developing gut. The fins are robustly regenerative in the zebrafish; we routinely use tail fin biopsy as a means to obtain genomic DNA to determine the genotype of transgenic zebrafish, and the fins regenerate rapidly afterwards. It is very unlikely that an adverse phenotype relating to the expression of transgene in the distal fin margins will impinge on the successful generation of fish with neurodegenerative disease biochemistry. It is also doubtful that the ectopic expression of transgenes in the intestine, at the low level we observed relative to robust CNS expression, will be deleterious to the future generation of disease models. Other promoters successfully used for generating rodent models of neurodegenerative disease show ectopic expression outside the CNS, for example weak expression of the PrP promoter in the kidney and heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Furthermore, many human neurodegenerative disease genes are expressed ubiquitously, but seem to exert toxic effects selectively in neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Temporal expression pattern</title><p>Expression of the 12 kb <italic>eno2</italic> promoter starts at 24&#x02013;28 hpf, but increases significantly between 48 and 72 hpf and persists through adulthood. The relatively late onset of high-level expression may avoid potentially deleterious effects of early transgene expression on the initial differentiation of neurons, but will encompass the later stages of larval development when screening approaches can still be deployed practicably. Persistence of expression into adulthood will allow examination of age-related progression of pathology in transgenic fish.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression levels</title><p>We were concerned that transgene expression from the 12 kb <italic>eno2</italic> promoter relies on accurate and efficient splicing of the <italic>eno2</italic> first intron from a chimeric transcript in which the second exon is replaced by a cDNA sequence of interest and the remainder of the <italic>eno2</italic> transcript is missing. However, our studies show that splicing of intron 1 from the chimeric transcript occurs with high efficiency and fidelity, accurately aligning the 3&#x02032; end of exon 1 with the ATG signal in exon 2, resulting in a Kozak consensus sequence. This allowed efficient translation of the transgene, with steady-state levels of the Tau transgene being several fold higher than the native protein in human brain tissue. We have now used this promoter to express a variety of transgenes and have observed similar findings in multiple transgenic lines. The presence of the intron in the promoter construct significantly contributes to robust transgene expression.</p><p>In summary, we have cloned and characterized a zebrafish <italic>eno2</italic> promoter fragment, demonstrated its utility in driving transgene expression in a neuronal pattern in stable transgenic animals, and used it to generate a zebrafish Tauopathy model. Our current studies are focussed on establishing whether Tg(<italic>eno2:Tau</italic>) zebrafish develop a full spectrum of phenotypic changes reminiscent of human Tauopathies.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm608_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkm608_nar-01060-w-2007-File010.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkm608_nar-01060-w-2007-File011.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkm608_nar-01060-w-2007-File012.tif"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are grateful to the following colleagues for generously sharing reagents: Dr Neal Copeland (NCI, Frederick, MA; DY380 cells); Dr Matthew Farrer (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL; 4R-Tau plasmid); Dr Michael Tsang (University of Pittsburgh, PA; pBS-I-Sce1) and Dr Steven T.
