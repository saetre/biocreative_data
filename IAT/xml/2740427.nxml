K38Q-MCT1 and K38R-MCT1 were inactive when expressed at the plasma membrane of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes, whereas K45R/K282R/K413R-MCT1 and K45Q/K282Q/K413Q-MCT1 were active. The former exhibited normal reversible and irreversible inhibition by DIDS, whereas the latter showed less reversible and no irreversible inhibition. K45Q/K413Q-MCT1 retained some irreversible inhibition, whereas K45Q/K282Q-MCT1 and K282Q/K413Q-MCT1 did not. These data suggest that the two DIDS SO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> groups interact with positively charged Lys<sup>282</sup> together with Lys<sup>45</sup> and/or Lys<sup>413</sup>. This positions one DIDS isothiocyanate group close to Lys<sup>38</sup>, leading to its covalent modification and irreversible inhibition. Additional mutagenesis revealed that DIDS cross-links MCT1 to its ancillary protein embigin using either Lys<sup>38</sup> or Lys<sup>290</sup> of MCT1 and Lys<sup>160</sup> or Lys<sup>164</sup> of embigin. We have modeled a possible structure for the outward facing (open) conformation of MCT1 by employing modest rotations of the C-terminal domain of the inner facing conformation modeled previously. The resulting model structure has a DIDS-binding site consistent with experimental data and locates Lys<sup>38</sup> in a hydrophobic environment at the bottom of a substrate-binding channel. Our model suggests a translocation cycle in which Lys<sup>38</sup> accepts a proton before binding lactate. Both the lactate and proton are then passed through the channel via Asp<sup>302&#x02212;</sup> and Asp<sup>306+</sup>, an ion pair already identified as important for transport and located adjacent to Phe<sup>360</sup>, which controls channel selectivity. The cross-linking data have also been used to model a structure of MCT1 bound to embigin that is consistent with published data.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4"><sup>3</sup></xref> is a member of the monocarboxylate transporter family (SLC16) of which there are 14 known members encoded by both the human and mouse genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). All of the members of this family are thought to have 12 transmembrane alpha helices (TMs) with a large loop between TMs 6 and 7 and the C and N termini facing the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The only members of the MCT family that have been shown to catalyze transport of monocarboxylates such as <sc>l</sc>-lactate across the plasma membrane are isoforms 1&#x02013;4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). This transport is proton-linked and leads to the net uptake or release of lactic acid from cells, which is critical for metabolic pathways such as anaerobic glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and lactate oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). MCT8 is a high affinity thyroid hormone transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), whereas MCT10 (TAT1) is an aromatic amino acid transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The other members of the MCT family remain to be characterized.</p><p>MCT1 is the most widely distributed member of the MCT family and was first identified as the lactate transporter present in red blood cells where its kinetics and substrate and inhibitor specificity were investigated in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). These studies revealed that MCT1 can be inhibited by stilbene disulfonate derivatives such as DIDS and 4,4&#x02032;-dibenzamido-stilbene-2,2&#x02032;-disulfonate (DBDS). DIDS was shown to exhibit a rapid reversible inhibition of transport that was competitive with respect to <sc>l</sc>-lactate. This is followed by a slowly developing irreversible inhibition that is not exhibited by DBDS and is thought to be caused by one of the isothiocyanate groups of DIDS attacking a lysine residue on MCT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Prolonged incubation with DIDS also led to a fraction of the MCT1 becoming cross-linked to a 70-kDa glycoprotein that was identified as embigin, also known as gp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Embigin has a short intracellular C terminus, a single TM sequence containing a glutamic acid residue, and a large extracellular N terminus containing two immunoglobulin domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Subsequent studies revealed that either embigin or, more frequently, the homologous protein basigin (also known as CD147) is required as a chaperone to take MCT1 to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) where the two proteins must remain associated for transport activity to be maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>Expression of MCTs 1, 2, and 4 in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes has enabled their further characterization and the effects of site-directed mutagenesis to be investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Such studies, together with homology modeling have enabled us to propose a three-dimensional structure of MCT1 based around the published structure of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> glycerol-3-phosphate transporter (Protein Data Bank <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1PW4">1PW4</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). This model can account for the effects of mutating a range of amino acids, including some that disrupt the interaction with basigin, and has led to the proposal that the single TM of basigin or embigin lies between TMs 3 and 6 of MCT1. The model also reveals exofacial lysines that are present in MCT1 that might be responsible for the irreversible inhibition of MCT1 by DIDS and the cross-linking of MCT1 to embigin. In rat MCT1 these residues are Lys<sup>38</sup>, Lys<sup>45</sup>, Lys<sup>282</sup>, Lys<sup>284</sup>, Lys<sup>290</sup>, and Lys<sup>413</sup>. In this paper, we use site-directed mutagenesis of these lysine residues to identify which of them are involved in DIDS binding to MCT1. In addition we use site-directed mutagenesis of embigin to demonstrate that Lys<sup>160</sup> and Lys<sup>164</sup> are involved in its cross-linking to MCT1. Our new data allow us to propose a modified structural model of MCT1 in its outward facing conformation that binds DIDS. This model is consistent with the site-directed mutagenesis data and also suggests a mechanism for the translocation cycle that involves Lys<sup>38</sup> as well as Asp<sup>302</sup> and Arg<sup>306</sup> that have already been identified as important for transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). We have also been able to model a structure of MCT1 bound to embigin that is consistent with published data.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>All of the reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated.

However, the substitution of lysine with arginine, but not glutamine, maintains the positive charge of the residue and thus might reveal whether this is important for either reversible or irreversible inhibition.

The double mutations K282Q/K284Q, K282R/K284Q, K45Q/K282Q, and K45Q/K413Q gave significant reductions in both reversible and irreversible inhibition, similar to that observed with the K282Q single mutation. The double mutations K45Q/K282Q and K282Q/K413Q also gave significant decreases in reversible inhibition, but in these cases the irreversible inhibition was totally lost. The data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic> also show that when these lysine residues were mutated to arginine rather than glutamine, there was no reduction in either reversible or irreversible inhibition; if anything inhibition was greater. These data suggest that it is the positive charge of Lys<sup>45</sup>, Lys<sup>282</sup>, and Lys<sup>413</sup> that plays an important role in DIDS binding. This is likely to be critical for the correct orientation of the isothiocyanate group of DIDS to react with another lysine residue such as Lys<sup>38</sup> and so cause irreversible inhibition. This conclusion was further strengthened by making triple mutants as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>. Thus the mutation of all three residues (Lys<sup>45</sup>, Lys<sup>282</sup>, and Lys<sup>413</sup>) to arginine maintained reversible and irreversible inhibition with a trend toward enhancement of inhibition as more lysine residues were replaced by arginines. However, replacement of these three lysine residues with glutamines caused a reduction in reversible inhibition while abolishing irreversible inhibition as predicted from the double mutants of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>.</p><p>Although rat MCT1 has a lysine at position 284, human MCT1 has a glutamine at the equivalent position, and thus our initial studies focused on Lys<sup>45</sup>, Lys<sup>282</sup>, and Lys<sup>413</sup>.

Thus, as predicted, when Lys<sup>45</sup>, Lys<sup>282</sup>, Lys<sup>284</sup>, and Lys<sup>413</sup> were all mutated to glutamine, irreversible inhibition was abolished, and reversible inhibition was greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>).

The ability to maintain irreversible binding even when Lys<sup>45</sup>, Lys<sup>282</sup>, Lys<sup>284</sup>, and Lys<sup>413</sup> are mutated to arginine implies that these residues are not involved in the covalent modification of MCT1. Rather their importance would seem to lie in their ability to mediate binding through their positive charges interacting with the negative charges of the sulfonate groups of DIDS. This suggests that Lys<sup>38</sup> may be the lysine that covalently binds DIDS. However, because this residue is essential for transport activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), it was not possible to confirm this conclusion using irreversible inhibition of transport by DIDS as a surrogate marker for covalent binding to Lys<sup>38</sup>. We attempted to use anti-DIDS antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), with or without immunoprecipitation of MCT1, to detect covalent binding of DIDS to wild type and mutant MCT1 expressed in COS-7 cells but found the antibody to lack sufficient potency and specificity to provide reliable data.</p><p>As an alternative strategy we used the ability of DIDS to cross-link MCT1 to embigin to establish the involvement of Lys<sup>38</sup> in covalent binding of DIDS. These experiments are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>. Where cross-linking to embigin occurs, a band of 120 kDa is seen with the MCT1 antibody. It should be noted that this is distinct from the MCT1 dimer that is observed at &#x0223c;85 kDa. Such dimers occur even in the absence of DIDS, and we have shown previously that this occurs as a result of aggregation of MCT1 in detergent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Our data suggest that the extent of this dimerization is variable and difficult to control. However, two factors appear to increase the intensity of the dimer band: the overall expression level of MCT1 and the absence of embigin. We suspect that excess MCT1 expression overloads the endogenous basigin, and thus in the absence of embigen this may lead to more incorrectly folded MCT1 that has a greater tendency to dimerize. We were unable to confirm the identity of the MCT1-embigin cross-linked product using the embigin antibody because of the presence of broad bands between 110 and 150 kDa induced by DIDS that overlapped the MCT1-embigin band. These bands probably correspond to dimers of embigin caused by DIDS cross-linking.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>The effect of lysine mutations of MCT1 on the DIDS-mediated cross-linking of MCT1 to embigin.</bold> COS cells were transfected with the indicated pCI<italic>neo</italic> MCT1 and embigin constructs and harvested after 48 h before incubating with or without 0.2 m<sc>m</sc> DIDS at 37 &#x000b0;C for 1 h.

No additional reduction in cross-linking was observed when the double mutants K45Q/K413Q and K282Q/K413Q were employed, but the K38Q/K45Q, K38Q/K282Q and K45Q/282Q double mutants almost totally abolished cross-linking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>) as did the triple mutants K45Q/K282Q/K413Q, K45Q/K282Q/K413R, and K45Q/K282R/K413R and the quadruple mutant K38Q/K45Q/K282Q/K413Q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>). Interestingly, the decrease in cross-linking was much less when lysines were mutated to arginines rather than glutamine. Thus the multiple mutants K45R/K282R/K413R, K38R/K45R/K282R/K413R, and K38R/K45R/K282R/K284R/K413R all maintained significant cross-linking, implying that rather than forming the cross-link themselves, it is the positive charge of these residues that plays an important role in DIDS binding prior to cross-linking. Only with the hextuple mutant K38R/K45R/K282R/K284R/K290R/K413R was cross-linking totally prevented. Taken together our cross-linking data suggest that DIDS may bind in two ways. Consistent with the inhibition data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) DIDS may bind using noncovalent interaction between its two sulfonate groups with the positive charges of Lys<sup>45</sup>, Lys<sup>282</sup>, and Lys<sup>413</sup> leaving one isothiocyanate group available to bind covalently to Lys<sup>38</sup>. The second isothiocyanate may then bind to embigin. However, there would appear to be a second mode of cross-linking that involves Lys<sup>290</sup> rather than Lys<sup>38</sup>. Thus the K38R/K45R/K282R/284R/K413R mutant still shows significant, although reduced, cross-linking, whereas the K38R/K45R/K282R/K284R/K290R/K413R mutant does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>). Further evidence to support the likelihood of DIDS cross-linking involving two different lysine residues on MCT1 is provided by studies on cross-linking of endogenous MCT1 and embigin in rat erythrocytes treated with DIDS.</p></sec><sec><title>DIDS Cross-linking of MCT1 to Embigin in Rat Erythrocytes</title><p>The data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> confirm the cross-linking of MCT1 to embigin in rat erythrocytes using four different antibodies: the normal C-terminal antibody, an antibody to residues 278&#x02013;293 of the 7/8 extracellular loop of MCT1, an antibody to residues 403&#x02013;418 of the 11/12 extracellular loop of MCT1, and an antibody raised against the purified MCT1-embigin cross-linked product (BP antibody). The latter detects both MCT1 at 45 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>arrow 4</italic>) and embigin at &#x0223c;70 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>arrow 3</italic>), with the cross-linked product running at &#x0223c;120 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>arrow 1</italic>).

All four antibodies detected the cross-linked product between MCT1 and embigin at 120 kDa, albeit with different sensitivities. However, after trypsin treatment the picture was more complex. As shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, trypsin will cleave at lysines within the 6/7 loop splitting the MCT1 into N- and C-terminal fragments of 21&#x02013;25 and 22&#x02013;28 kDa, the exact size depending on the extent of additional cleavage at lysines and arginines in the 6/7 loop and C terminus.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic> we show that detection of this band was enhanced if samples were partially deglycosylated using <italic>N</italic>-glycanase F, perhaps indicating that in the cross-linked product access of the antibody to the 7/8 loop of the MCT1 was impeded by glycosylation of the embigin. Trypsin treatment prevented the C-terminal antibody from detecting any MCT1 band consistent with the predicted proteolysis of the C-terminal tail of MCT1. Trypsin treatment also abolished MCT1 detection with the BP antibody, suggesting that the epitopes for this antibody are contained within the C terminus and/or 6/7 loop degraded by trypsin. The loss of the majority of the embigin detected by the BP antibody probably reflects the almost total digestion of both the extracellular and intracellular domains by trypsin because both are predicted to be accessible to the enzyme and contain many lysines and arginine residues. Unfortunately, we have no antibody that can detect a cross-linked product between the N terminus of MCT1 and embigin, and thus we cannot use erythrocytes to confirm the cross-link between Lys<sup>38</sup> of MCT1 and embigin deduced from the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Lys<sup>160</sup> and Lys<sup>164</sup> in Embigin Are Involved in DIDS-mediated Cross-linking to MCT1</title><p>To identify the residues in embigin involved in the DIDS-mediated cross-link with MCT1, we made a range of site-directed mutants of embigin and investigated their cross-linking with wild type MCT1 in COS-7 cells.

The inability of DIDS to cross-link MCT1 to basigin is confirmed in the data presented in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.014217/DC1">supplemental</ext-link> Fig. S1. Thus initially we focused our mutagenesis on lysine residues in embigin that were not present in equivalent positions in basigin. We first mutated Lys<sup>263</sup>, Lys<sup>252</sup>, Lys<sup>226</sup>, and Lys<sup>224</sup> that would be predicted to be quite close to the TM region of embigin (residues 265&#x02013;282) and thus likely to be within cross-linking range of the surface of MCT1. However, there was no diminution of cross-linking when any or all of these lysines were mutated to glutamine (data not shown). We then mutated additional lysine residues to glutamine, alone or in combination, but even when eight lysines in the immunoglobulin domains were mutated to glutamine (residues 104, 105, 120, 137, 141, 222, 226, and 252) cross-linking was still observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A</italic>). However, when we mutated either Lys<sup>160</sup> or Lys<sup>164</sup> to glutamine DIDS-mediated cross-linking was reduced with the greatest effect observed with K164Q, whereas the K160Q/K164Q double mutant showed no detectable cross-linking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>). These two lysine residues are in the region of embigin that links the two immunoglobulin domains. Protein sequence alignment revealed that in rat basigin, the residues equivalent to Lys<sup>160</sup> and Lys<sup>164</sup> of embigin were Arg<sup>106</sup> and Gly<sup>110</sup>, consistent with the inability of DIDS to cross-link MCT1 to basigin. The choice between Lys<sup>160</sup> and Lys<sup>164</sup> might depend on whether the cross-linking involves Lys<sup>38</sup> or Lys<sup>290</sup> on MCT1 as shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Lysine residues 160 and 164 of embigin are involved in DIDS-mediated cross-linking to MCT1.</bold> COS cells were transfected as detailed under &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures&#x0201d; with the following pCIneo vector constructs. <italic>A</italic>, <italic>first</italic> and <italic>second lanes</italic>, MCT1 + embigin; <italic>third lane</italic>, MCT1 + K104/105/120/137/141Q embigin; <italic>fourth lane</italic>, MCT1 + K104/105/120/137/141/222/226Q embigin; <italic>fifth lane</italic>, MCT1 + K104/105/120/137/141/222/226/252Q embigin. <italic>Arrows 1&#x02013;3</italic> indicate the positions of MCT1-embigin cross-linked product, MCT1 dimer, and MCT1 monomer, respectively. <italic>B</italic>, MCT1 plus the embigin mutant indicated.

This would be predicted to disrupt the disulfide bond stabilizing the second immunoglobulin domain, implying that correct folding of this domain is essential to bring the reactive lysine in close proximity to the DIDS. By contrast, disruption of the first immunoglobulin domain by mutation of Cys<sup>144</sup> that forms the disulfide bond had no effect on cross-linking (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.014217/DC1">supplemental</ext-link> Fig. S2).

Our data suggest that the positive charges of Lys<sup>45</sup>, Lys<sup>282</sup>, and Lys<sup>413</sup> are important for DIDS to bind in an orientation that allows the covalent modification of Lys<sup>38</sup> required for irreversible inhibition. Thus MCT1 in which all these three residues have been mutated to arginine is inhibited both reversibly and irreversibly even better than the wild type MCT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>). Mutation of Lys<sup>282</sup> but not Lys<sup>45</sup> or Lys<sup>413</sup> to glutamine reduces both types of inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>), suggesting that Lys<sup>282</sup> is the most critical residue. This is confirmed by the observation that both the K45Q/K282Q and K282Q/K413Q mutants show no irreversible inhibition, whereas the K45Q/K413Q mutant retains reduced irreversible inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>). Taken together our data imply a DIDS-binding site on MCT1 that involves the two sulfonate groups interacting with the positive charge of Lys<sup>282</sup> together with Lys<sup>45</sup> and/or Lys<sup>413</sup>. This brings one of the isothiocyanate groups into close proximity with Lys<sup>38</sup>, with which it can react covalently to produce irreversible inhibition. This Lys<sup>38</sup> residue appears to be essential for transport activity. The second isothiocyanate group is predicted to face outwards toward embigin, with which it can form a cross-link. With this information, we sought to model the DIDS-binding site of MCT1.</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular Modeling of MCT1 with the Substrate and Inhibitor-binding Site Facing Outward</title><p>We have previously proposed a molecular model of MCT1 that was based upon the published structure of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> glycerol-3-phosphate transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). This model could account for the available site-directed mutagenesis data and provided the starting point for identifying lysine residues involved in DIDS binding. However, our published model structure represents the conformation in which the substrate is bound on the intracellular side, whereas DIDS would be predicted to bind when the substrate-binding site is extracellular. Indeed we have shown previously that DIDS binding and inhibition is greater when cells are subject to a pH gradient (alkaline inside) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). This is consistent with the proposed kinetic model, which predicts that such a pH gradient would favor protonation of the transporter prior to monocarboxylate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Thus to model DIDS binding, we needed to generate a molecular model of MCT1 in the conformation with an extracellular binding site.</p><p>MCT1 is composed of a six-helix N-terminal domain and a similar six-helix C-terminal domain linked by a 30-residue loop of unknown, or no, structure. Hence it is reasonable to assume that modest reorganization of the interface between these domains is possible. Indeed, just such rearrangements have been suggested for the Lac-Permease during its catalytic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), and recent data provide further confirmation of this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). A similar rearrangement has also been suggested for MCT1, although no detailed modeling was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Our own modeling strategy was to juxtapose the N- and C-terminal halves to maximize the interactions between them while ensuring that the transmembrane channel can accommodate a small 2-hydroxy acid. This was achieved as follows. Initially, the six-helix C-terminal domain of the closed model was transformed relative to the six-helix N-terminal domain by two rotations around its center of mass, in the Cartesian axis system shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>. The transformations are a rotation of 20&#x000b0; in z followed by a rotation of &#x02212;20&#x000b0; in <italic>y</italic> and then translations of &#x02212;3 and &#x02212;4 &#x0212b; in <italic>y</italic> and <italic>z</italic>, respectively. This brings the helices in both domains approximately parallel to the <italic>z</italic> axis orientation. The second stage of the modeling is to straighten helix 11 at its kink point (characterized by a PP motif) and to remodel the loop connecting helix 11 to helix 12. Hydrogen atoms were added to this model corresponding to pH 7, a layer of water molecules was added around the structure to a depth of 10 &#x0212b;, and the whole system was relaxed by energy minimization while weakly tethering the backbone atoms to their initial positions, for a total of 3000 conjugate-gradient steps. Structures of DIDS and analogues were built with each sulfonate group carrying a single negative charge and then docked into the cavity on the extracellular face of the open MCT1 model by inspection, having removed the water molecules. A new 10-&#x0212b;-thick layer of water was added over the surface of the complex, and the whole system energy was minimized as described above.

This seals the farthest seam of the TM channel. In the inward facing structure helix 11 is bent (as it is in the homology modeling template 1PW4), but after applying the above transformation, the intracellular half of helix 11 is juxtaposed with the corresponding half of helix 2, sealing the lower half of the nearest seam of the TM channel. Helix 11 bends at a PP motif, and these helix-breaking residues can form a hinge between the two halves of helix 11. Straightening helix 11 allows the extracellular half to pack against the corresponding half of helix 2, completing the nearest seam and forming the whole TM channel. Following this manipulation, the loop connecting helix 11 to helix 12 requires remodeling. This loop contains Lys<sup>413</sup>, which is involved in DIDS binding; however, it points away from the TM channel in the closed MCT1 model. Remodeling the helix 11 to helix 12 loop allows Lys<sup>413</sup> to access the extracellular entrance of the TM channel.</p></sec><sec><title>The New Molecular Model Suggests a Potential Mechanism for the Translocation Cycle of MCT1</title><p>The open and closed conformations of MCT1 that we have modeled are entirely consistent with the &#x0201c;rocker switch&#x0201d; mechanism of substrate translocation suggested for other members of major facilitator superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In this model it is proposed that the N- and C-terminal halves of the protein rock back and forth against each other along an axis that runs along the interface between the domains within the membrane. This allows the substrate-binding site to have exclusive access to either side of the membrane in an alternating fashion. For MCT1 our model allows us to suggest critical residues that may be involved in binding the lactate and proton as the protein moves between the two conformations. The cross-section in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>C</italic> shows the model of the closed channel. The upper (extracellular) part of the channel has collapsed, removing the ability of the protein to bind and transport lactate. We might hypothesize that this is the resting state, prevalent at higher extracellular pH that inhibits MCT1 transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), and that in this state the buried lysine (Lys<sup>38</sup>), which is essential for activity, is neutral (unprotonated). Switching into the active state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>D</italic>) may be driven by protonation at lower pH. The active state has a complete TM channel, blocked only by Lys<sup>38</sup> itself. We suggest that the positively charged (protonated) Lys<sup>38</sup> binds a lactate ion from the extracellular medium and &#x0201c;passes&#x0201d; lactic acid onto the aspartate Asp<sup>302&#x02212;</sup> and arginyl Arg<sup>306+</sup> ion pair that have been implicated in proton translocation by Br&#x000f6;er and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Interestingly, the model places Phe<sup>360</sup> adjacent to this couple, and it has been shown that mutagenesis of this Phe to Cys allows the channel to transport the larger 2-hydroxymonocarboxylate, mevalonate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). This is consistent with the idea that the putative binding site formed by Asp<sup>302</sup>, Arg<sup>306</sup>, and Phe<sup>360</sup> controls channel selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Once Lys<sup>38</sup> is deprotonated (by passing lactic acid on to D302/R306) MCT1 relaxes back to the closed state, opening the Asp<sup>302</sup>/Arg<sup>306</sup> site to the intracellular medium and allowing the bound lactic acid to diffuse into the intracellular medium and the transport cycle to repeat. A schematic of this hypothetical mechanism is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>FIGURE 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Cartoon illustrating the proposed mechanism of lactic acid transport by MCT1.</bold> Lactic acid protonates Lys<sup>38</sup> (<italic>K</italic>) causing the channel to open. Lactate then moves into the open extracellular side of the pore and forms an ion pair with Lys<sup>38</sup>. In the next step the proton on Lys<sup>38</sup> is transferred to aspartate 302 (<italic>D</italic>-) neutralizing the aspartate side chain (<italic>DH</italic>). This is followed by migration of lactate through the pore where it forms an ion pair with R306 (R+). The size of the adjacent side chain of residue 360 (<italic>F</italic>) governs the ability of this site to bind the &#x003b1;-hydroxy acid. Once Lys<sup>38</sup> is deprotonated, and lactate is occupying the specificity filter, the transporter relaxes back toward the closed state and releases lactic acid into the intracellular space.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0340982750008"/></fig><p>On the basis of their mutagenesis studies Br&#x000f6;er and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) proposed that in the outward facing conformation of MCT1 there might be an ion pair between Arg<sup>143</sup> and Glu<sup>369</sup> that was broken in the translocation cycle. Although our new model reduces the distance between Arg<sup>143</sup> and Glu<sup>369</sup> from 22 to 17 &#x0212b;, the residues still remain too far apart to form a salt bridge. To bring them close enough to form such a salt bridge would require reregistering the residues on each helix and another 3 &#x0212b; movement between the N- and C-terminal domains. This would be hard to reconcile with all our other data.</p></sec><sec><title>The New Molecular Model Defines a Potential Binding Site for DIDS That Is Consistent with the Experimental Data</title><p>This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref> where views are given looking down from the extracellular surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>A</italic>) and in cross-section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>B</italic>). The model allows one of the two sulfonate groups on DIDS to bind to Lys<sup>45</sup> and Lys<sup>282</sup> and the other to bind to Lys<sup>413</sup>. This orients the DIDS such that one of the two isothiocyanate groups is brought into close proximity with Lys<sup>38</sup>, enabling it to react covalently (irreversible inhibition). Because the major role of Lys<sup>45</sup>, Lys<sup>282</sup>, and Lys<sup>413</sup> is to orient the DIDS through their positive charges interacting with the negative charges of the sulfonate, their mutation to arginine would not be expected to prevent binding, and this agrees with our experimental data. By contrast, the removal of the positive charge by mutation to glutamine would impair binding as we observed. An unexpected experimental finding was that both the K45Q/K282Q/K284Q and K282Q/K284Q/K413Q triple mutants showed some irreversible inhibition by DIDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>), whereas neither the K45Q/K282Q nor the K282Q/K413Q double mutant did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>). This might be explained if the positive charge on Lys<sup>284</sup> can act as an alternative binding site for the sulfonate in the absence of the positive charge of Lys<sup>282</sup>, causing preferential binding of DIDS in a different orientation such as that proposed below for cross-linking of MCT1 to embigin via Lys<sup>290</sup> of MCT1.</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>FIGURE 9.</label><caption><p><bold>The binding of DIDS to the open conformation of MCT1.</bold> The figure shows a side (<italic>A</italic>) and top (<italic>B</italic>) view of the extracellular part of the open MCT1 model. The color scheme is the same as that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, except that DIDS is colored according to atom type with the carbon atoms colored <italic>gray</italic>. The figure shows how one isothiocyanate group of DIDS is in close contact with Lys<sup>38</sup>, whereas the two sulfonate groups are bound to Lys<sup>45</sup>, Lys<sup>282</sup>, and Lys<sup>413</sup>. The <italic>inset</italic> in <italic>B</italic> shows the numbering of the TM helices in this view.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0340982750009"/></fig><p>It should be noted that the isothiocyanate group is not required for reversible inhibition by a variety of DIDS analogues in which the isothiocyanate is replaced by bulkier hydrophobic groups. Thus DBDS and TBenzDS are even more potent reversible inhibitors of MCT1 than is DIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). The model allows for this because Lys<sup>38</sup> is contained within a hydrophobic cavity that could accommodate these groups. By contrast, DADS and DNDS in which the isothiocyanate group is replaced by an amino or nitro group, respectively, are much poorer reversible inhibitors. This behavior is consistent with one of the <italic>N</italic>,<italic>N&#x02032;</italic> substituents binding into the hydrophobic cavity above Lys<sup>38</sup>. This favors bulky hydrophobic substituents over small hydrophilic substituents and is consistent with the observed potency of DIDS analogues as inhibitors of MCT1 activity (<italic>i.e.</italic> TBenzDS &#x0003e; DBDS &#x0003e; DIDS &#x0003e; DADS, DNDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>DIDS Cross-linking</title><p>Our data imply that cross-linking between MCT1 and embigin by DIDS can occur in two ways. The first is by DIDS binding in the manner shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>, allowing one isothiocyanate group on DIDS to bind to Lys<sup>38</sup> of MCT1 and the other to project out of the substrate-binding site sufficiently to interact with embigin. However, cross-linking is not totally abolished in the K38Q mutants, implying that some DIDS must be binding more promiscuously to other surface lysines. Lys<sup>290</sup> appears to be the residue that is covalently modified by the isothiocyanate group of DIDS under these conditions because mutation of lysine residues 38, 45, 282, 284, and 413 to arginines maintained some cross-linking, but this was prevented when Lys<sup>290</sup> was also mutated to arginine. We have modeled a possible alternative binding site that can account for our data (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.014217/DC1">supplemental</ext-link> Fig. S3), and in this model the free isothiocyanate group of DIDS emerges from the surface of MCT1 displaced by 14.5 &#x0212b; from its location in the primary binding site.</p><p>To identify the residue(s) on embigin involved in the cross-linking, we employed lysine and cysteine mutants of embigin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). These data implicate Lys<sup>160</sup> and Lys<sup>164</sup> in the cross-linking and suggest that the Ig-like V domain of embigin nearest to the membrane may bend over toward the extracellular surface of MCT1. This would bring Lys<sup>160</sup> and Lys<sup>164</sup> into close proximity with the mouth of the substrate-binding pocket in which DIDS binds. The equivalent residues in rat basigin are Arg<sup>106</sup> and Gly<sup>110</sup>, consistent with the inability of DIDS to cross-link MCT1 to basigin. Furthermore, we found that C180A/C182A embigin also failed to cross-link with MCT1 consistent with disruption of the disulfide bridge in the V domain, preventing its correct folding such that Lys<sup>160</sup> and Lys<sup>164</sup> are no longer correctly located for cross-linking.</p><p>On the basis of site-directed mutagenesis studies, we have previously proposed that the single transmembrane helix of basigin or embigin interacts with transmembrane helices 3 and 6 of MCT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The conformational changes we have predicted to occur in MCT1 during the translocation cycle are consistent with this model because TMs 3 and 6 remain on the outer face of the N-terminal helical bundle and would only be required to tilt slightly in the membrane. Recently, the crystal structure of the extracellular domains of basigin has been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), and we have used this structure to model the extracellular domains of embigin attached to the TM helix lying adjacent to TMs 3 and 6 of MCT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref>). The embigin model was constructed according to the published sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Subunit C was chosen for the model template because the nearly linear arrangement of domains in this structure allows the N-terminal domain to remain in solution after docking. The rat embigin model was built and refined in the standard manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The embigin model was docked onto the MCT1 model by inspection, and the complex was relaxed by energy minimization as above. The second domain and TM helix of embigin fit snugly against the N-terminal domain of MCT1, and the model illustrates how Lys<sup>160</sup> and Lys<sup>164</sup> are located over the face of MCT1 where the isothiocyanate group of DIDS emerges and thus would be available for cross-linking.
