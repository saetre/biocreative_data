We used the hind-limb suspension (HLS) rat model to simulate microgravity-induced bone losses for 45 days. In order to compare the resulting changes, mineralogical (bone mineral density [BMD], calcium [Ca], and phosphorus [P]), biochemical (osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase [ALP], and type I collagen), and histological (scanning electron microscopy) parameters were adopted. As a countermeasure to the above, the effect of PEMF and HAp application were examined. Three-month-old female Wistar rats were randomly divided into control (n = 8), HLS (n = 8), HLS with PEMF (n = 8), HLS with HAp nanoparticles (n = 8), and HLS with HAp and PEMF (n = 8). We observed: 1) significant decrease (p &#x0003c; 0.01) in BMD, Ca, P, type I collagen, and ALP activity in femur and tibia in hind-limb bone and serum osteocalcin in HLS rats as compared with the ground control. 2) Nonsignificant increase in BMD (p &#x0003c; 0.1), Ca (p &#x0003c; 0.1), P (p &#x0003c; 0.5), type I collagen (p &#x0003c; 0.1), and ALP activity (p &#x0003c; 0.5) in femur and tibia in hind-limb bone and serum osteocalcin (p &#x0003c; 0.5) in HLS + PEMF rats compared with HLS rats. 3) Significant increase in BMD (p &#x0003c; 0.02), Ca (p &#x0003c; 0.05), P (p &#x0003c; 0.05), type I collagen (p &#x0003c; 0.02), and ALP activity (p &#x0003e; 0.02) in femur and tibia in hind-limb bone with a nonsignificant increase in serum osteocalcin (p &#x0003e; 0.1) in HLS + HAp rats compared to HLS rats. 4) Significant increase in BMD (p &#x0003e; 0.01). Ca (p &#x0003e; 0.01). P (p &#x0003e; 0.01). type I collagen (p &#x0003e; 0.01). and ALP activity (p &#x0003e; 0.01) in femur and tibia in hind-limb bone and serum osteocalcin (p &#x0003e; 0.02) were also observed.

Efficacy of electrostimulation has been identified as a safe and noninvasive method to counter bone loss. Since the loss of HAp is inevitable, it is suggested that it should also be used as an input to control the regime loss. A small current induced due to electostimulation may be a trigger to precipitate HAp crystals at the affected site. In the present work, we have adapted a synergistic effect of these two methods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Female Wistar rats (90 days old and of similar mean weight, 230&#x02013;250 gm body wt.) were obtained from the animal facility of Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.

Before doing any scanning electron microscope (SEM) characterization, the bone samples were dried and mounted on circular disc stubs with adhesive. Gold coatings were applied at a thickness of about 20 nanometers, which is too thin to interfere with the dimensions of surface features. Coating was done with the help of sputter coater. The samples were placed in a small vacuum chamber. After introducing the argon gas in the chamber, an electric field was applied to cause removal of electron from the argon atoms and made them positively charged. The Ar ions were then attracted to a negatively charged piece of coated material. The Ar ions acted like sand in a sandblaster, which struck gold or carbon atoms from the surface of the foil. These gold atoms now settled onto the surface of the sample and produced a gold coating.

After 45 days of HLS, we observed a significant decrease in BMD in HLS rats compared to ground control rats. However, there was a significant increase in BMD in treated rats compared to HLS rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-4-133">Figure 2 a, b</xref>), Correspondingly a decrease in calcium and phosphorus levels in HLS rats and increased levels in the treated rats (except HLS+P) corroborate the loss and regain of bone mass, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-4-133">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-4-133">4</xref>).</p><p>Various crystallographic specifications for control and various treated samples were carried under identical situation. It may be noted that the 2&#x003b8; position for samples remained unchanged for a given intensity maximum. The crystal size and type indicated by <bold>c</bold> and <bold>a</bold> (axial distance or edge length) values and corresponding &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3; (axial angles) in control and treated samples are approximately the same. This provides support to our finding that treatment with nanoparticles and PEMF combined has a positive impact on restoring the bone loss. In HAp + PEMF treated sample rats, the peak position for the maximum intensity (100%) shift to slightly altered h, k, l and d values, while the 2&#x003b8; position remains unchanged. From <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-ijn-4-133">Table 4</xref>, it is apparent that due to the application of PEMF in HLS + P + N rats there is a change in density, volume of cell, and Z (charge). A change in the possible molecular composition may be caused by precipitation of HAp nanoparticles with negatively charged cationic region in collagen molecules at the osteoporotic site. An application of PEMF with the injection of HAp help in the deposition of extra carbon (C) and floride (F) in the bone matrix.</p><p>Alkaline phosphatase is produced in the bone&#x02019;s cycle formation phase and, is therefore an excellent indicator of bone formation activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ijn-4-133">27</xref> Osteocalcin is the most abundant noncollagenous protein in bone, and its concentration in serum is closely linked to bone metabolism and serves as a biological marker for the clinical assessment of bone disease, although its precise mechanism of action is unclear. Osteocalcin influences bone mineralization in part through its ability to bind with high affinity to the mineral component of bone, hydroxyapatite.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ijn-4-133">28</xref> It is observed that higher serum-osteocalcin levels are relatively well correlated with increases in BMD during treatment with anabolic bone formation drugs for osteoporosis. A significant increase in ALP and osteocalcin with increased BMD in HLS + HAp and HLS + HAp + PEMF rats compared to HLS rats indicate that enhanced bone formation has taken place. Although ALP and osteocalcin are the two primary bone markers for bone formation, use of type I collagen as reliable markers have also been tested. Increase in type I collagen in treated group rats suggests that mineralization has taken place with utmost fidelity.</p><p>An important but unsolved question is how the cells can recognize the particle size of HAp nanoparticles. It is well known that cells are inherently sensitive to their surroundings. It is suggested that the dissolution of HAp nanoparticles (small size and poor crystallinity) will increase concentrations of calcium and phosphate in the medium and thereby may alter the gene expression, alkali phosphate and proteins.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ijn-4-133">29</xref> We observed significant increase in ALP activity, type I collagen. and osteocalcin concentration in HLS + HAp group rats. It indicates that 20 mg/250 gm body weight of Si-HAp can induce and enhance the expression level of bone formation marker genes. Furthermore, the zeta potential measurements can provide the interfacial properties of the nanoparticles. HAP particles have a negative zeta potential in water at pH 7.4.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijn-4-133">30</xref> Since the electronic potential of cell membranes is known to be always negative; the positive or weakly negative particles are suitable for adsorption by cells. Another possible explanation is that the quantity of proteins adsorbed on particles positively correlates with their specific surface area.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ijn-4-133">31</xref> Nanosized particles adsorbed significantly greater amounts of proteins, and induce enhancement of subsequent cell adhesion and proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ijn-4-133">32</xref> in HLS + HAp and HLS + HAp + PEMF group rats. It is suggested that PEMF helps to accelerate the process.</p><p>The bilayer lipid structure of the plasma membrane and the electrical double layer at its inner and outer surfaces make the cell membrane a real capacitor, ie, a charge storage system. EMF exposure depolarizes the cell membrane of osteoblast to alter the uptake of calcium ions and increases the concentration of intracellular free calcium in osteoblast cytoplasm. Calcium influx is driven by induced polarization of plasma membrane when bone cells are exposed to external electric field via a classical second messenger mechanism and this eventually leads to a mitogenic effect. Electrical stimulation elevates the transmembrane voltage and results in the elevation of electrical conductivity of the cell membrane.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ijn-4-133">33</xref> Due to this effect, the function of cell membrane protein, lipids, as well as expression of genes alters and this leads to cell proliferation. In spite of four hours per day therapy by bone stimulator, in the PEMF-treated group (HLS+PEMF), we did not observe a significant increase in BMD, calcuim, phosphatase, or ALP activity. Type I collagen, osteocalcin, and also the cortical thickness of femur and tibia bone in HLS + P rats were less than in other treated rat groups (HLS + P + N, HLS + N). This is attributed to the lack of adequate calcium in the body system (HLS + P). However, the beneficial effect of low-intensity electric stimulation (PEMF) on bone has been demonstrated in other models, such as sciatic neurectomy and ovariectomy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijn-4-133">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijn-4-133">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ijn-4-133">34</xref></p><p>HAp and PEMF both have a propensity to enhance the expression level of bone formation marker by different mechanisms. PEMF increase growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), IGF-I, tumor growth factor- &#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) mRNA; modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to CaM, upregulation of mRNA for bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and BMP-4.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ijn-4-133">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ijn-4-133">36</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>HAp nanoparticles adsorb significantly greater amounts of proteins and induce enhancement of subsequent cell adhesion and proliferation. When we used them synergistically, an increase in BMD, calcuim, phosphatase, ALP, type I collagen, and osteocalcin levels in HLS + P + N treated rats were observed as compared to HLS + N and HLS + P treated rats. Also, the mineral levels achieved after (HAp + PEMF) are comparable to ground animal data, suggesting that the treatment closely offsets the bone loss induced by microgravity. Hence, PEMF along with HAp is a positive countermeasure to prevent osteoporosis in simulated microgravity.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no
