The crystal structure of the regulatory tetramer was recently solved, providing new insights into the structural basis for regulation. Here we describe the selection and characterization of two classes of Sin mutations that, respectively, bypass or disrupt the functions of the regulatory tetramer. Activating mutations, which allow the catalytic tetramer to assemble and function independently at site I (the crossover site), were found at &#x0223c;20% of residues in the N-terminal domain. The most strongly activating mutation (Q115R) stabilized a catalytically active synaptic tetramer <italic>in vitro</italic>. The positions of these mutations suggest that they act by destabilizing the conformation of the ground-state site I-bound dimers, or by stabilizing the altered conformation of the active catalytic tetramer. Mutations that block activation by the regulatory tetramer mapped to just two residues, F52 and R54, supporting a functional role for a previously reported crystallographic dimer&#x02013;dimer interface. We suggest how F52/R54 contacts between regulatory and catalytic subunits might promote assembly of the active catalytic tetramer within the synaptosome.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Sin is a resolvase of the serine recombinase family that is encoded by the <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> multiresistance plasmid pI9789 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Rowland <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>); it has many similarities to the archetypal resolvases of Tn<italic>3</italic>, &#x003b3;&#x003b4; and Tn<italic>21</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Grindley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Grindley <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Serine recombinases have diverse biological functions as resolvases, DNA invertases, transposases and integrases, and they have many potential applications in biotechnology and gene therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Akopian and Stark, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Calos, 2006</xref>). They are also model systems for studying how catalytic events at two or more DNA sites are coordinated to achieve a precise outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Krasnow and Cozzarelli, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Regulation of catalysis is a critical issue for all serine recombinases, because the catalytic tetramer makes transient DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the two synapsed crossover sites, and uses a potentially hazardous rotational mechanism for strand exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Stark <italic>et al</italic>., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Boocock <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Grindley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Dhar <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). In the Sin and Tn3/&#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolution systems, separate regulatory sites control the choice and alignment of two crossover sites, driving the resolution reaction in the forward direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A and B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Arnold <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Rowland <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Proposed architecture of the Sin synaptosome. A. Organization of the recombination sites (<italic>res</italic>) in the Sin and Tn3/&#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolution systems. DNA strand exchange occurs at the centre of the crossover site (site I). In the Sin system, there is only one regulatory binding site for a dimer (site II), compared with two in the Tn3/&#x003b3;&#x003b4; system (sites II and III). The second regulatory site in the Sin system is for an architectural protein (HU in <italic>resH</italic>, IHF in <italic>resF</italic>). The lengths of the recombinase binding sites, and of the site I&#x02013;site II spacers, are given (bp). B. Topology of the synaptosome and of the recombination reactions catalysed by Sin and Tn3/&#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase. The regulatory module is formed by synapsis of the regulatory sites; the catalytic module is formed by synapsis of the crossover sites. Since the synaptosome traps three negative supercoils, and strand exchange has a right-handed sense, the resolution product is a specific two-noded catenane. C. Stereo pair showing a model of the Sin synaptosome assembled by rigid-body docking of available crystal structures for Sin (pdb: 2R0Q; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase (pdb: 1ZR4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) and IHF (pdb: 1IHF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Rice <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). The two <italic>resF</italic> sites are shown in orange and blue, and the recombinase subunits bound to these sites are in shades of violet/magenta and green respectively; the IHF heterodimers are grey. Residues F52 (yellow) and R54 (red) are visible in the regulatory Sin dimer bound at the blue <italic>resF</italic> site. The catalytic and regulatory tetramers are in close proximity and could make contact, but the interface would be asymmetric (see text). See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Fig. 9F</xref> for a 90&#x000b0; rotated view of this model, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Fig. 9E</xref> for a modified model incorporating conformational adjustments that allow the catalytic and regulatory tetramers to make contact using the pseudo-symmetric F52/R54 interface. D. Subunit interfaces thought to be involved in contacts between the regulatory module and the catalytic module in the Sin and Tn3/&#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase systems. The F52/R54 dimer&#x02013;dimer interface of Sin (F52, yellow; R54, red; D57, orange) is compared with the 2&#x02013;3&#x02032; interface of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase (R2, magenta; R32, blue; K54, yellow; E56, red; D59, orange). Residues at equivalent positions in the secondary structure (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>) have the same colour. The F52/R54 interface has a cation/&#x003c0; stack, whereas the 2&#x02013;3&#x02032; interface has a stack of four arginine side-chains.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mmi0074-0282-f1"/></fig><fig id="fig09" position="float"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Proposed mechanism for cooperation between the F52/R54 interface and IHF in assembly of the site I tetramer within the synaptosome. The molecular models in (D), (E) and (F) are shown as stereo pairs. A. Proposed pathway for assembly of the synaptosome. Sin dimers in the &#x02018;closed&#x02019; conformation are shown as ovals; dimers in the &#x02018;open&#x02019; conformation, as in the site I synaptic tetramer, are shown as squares. Residues that form the F52/R54 interface are represented by yellow circles, and IHF is represented by a grey rectangle. B. The synaptosome in (A) viewed from below (i.e. rotated 90&#x000b0;). This is a cartoon representation of the molecular model in (E). C. Proposed looping interaction, mediated by the F52/R54 interface, between Sin dimers bound at sites I and II within the same <italic>resF</italic> site, shown out of the context of the synaptosome for clarity. Each cartoon is half of the model shown above it in (A), viewed from below (as in B). We suggest that the looping interaction stabilizes an &#x02018;open&#x02019; conformation of the dimer at site I (squares) relative to the &#x02018;closed&#x02019; conformation (ovals). A molecular model of the right-hand cartoon is shown in (D). D. Molecular model of the proposed looping interaction; this is one-half of the complete synaptosome model shown in (E). Two Sin dimers bound at the same <italic>resF</italic> site interact through the pseudo-symmetric F52/R54 interface as seen in the Sin site II crystal structure (pdb: 2R0Q). The site I dimer is in an &#x02018;open&#x02019; conformation, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8B</xref>. The DNA is in spacefill, and the Sin dimers (pale/dark green) and IHF heterodimers (grey) are in cartoon representation; the side-chains of Sin residues F52 (yellow) and R54 (red) are highlighted in spacefill. E. Molecular model of the synaptosome incorporating the F52/R54 interface (shown in cartoon form in B). This model is essentially equivalent to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">fig. 7C</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>. (2008</xref>), except that all four catalytic domains in the site I synaptic tetramer were modelled by fitting segments of the Sin structure onto the &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase co-ordinates (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8C</xref> here). The modelled synaptosome can be viewed as comprising two identical <italic>resF</italic> loops, held together by NTD interactions at site I, and CTD interactions at site II. The &#x02018;back&#x02019; loop is as shown in (D); in the &#x02018;front&#x02019; loop, the Sin dimers (lilac/purple) and the DNA (gold) are in cartoon representation (the IHF is omitted for clarity). Sin subunits at sites I and II make contact through the crystallographic F52/R54 interface, highlighted in spacefill (F52, yellow; R54, red). In order to create this interface, a conformational adjustment was made to the crystallographic site II tetramer: the NTDs were rotated towards the site I tetramer by straightening the kink in the E helix (of the pale green and lilac subunits). The positions of the regulatory site DNAs (relative to the site I DNAs) are slightly different from those shown in (F). F. The original molecular model of the synaptosome made by rigid body docking of known crystal structures, exactly as shown as in fig. 7A and B of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>. (2008</xref>) except that the IHF in the &#x02018;front&#x02019; loop has been omitted for clarity. Note that residues F52 (yellow) and R54 (red) in the Sin site II tetramer are distant from their potential partners in the site I tetramer. The site I tetramer here is the &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase structure (and not the modelled Sin tetramer shown in E). &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase residues K54 (yellow) and E56 (red), which correspond to F52 and R54 in Sin, are highlighted (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). The particular conformation of the Sin NTDs seen in the site II tetramer may result from crystal packing forces.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mmi0074-0282-f9"/></fig><p>Recombination by wild-type (WT) Sin requires an elaborate protein/DNA complex called the synaptosome, in which two 86 bp recombination sites, <italic>resH</italic>, are interwound to trap three negative supercoils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A and B</xref>). The synaptosome comprises the catalytic tetramer bound to the two crossover sites (site I) and a separate regulatory module, in which two regulatory sites (site II) are synapsed by a Sin tetramer, and the site I&#x02013;site II spacers are bent by an architectural protein, HU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Rowland <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">2005</xref>). HU can be functionally replaced by the sequence-specific DNA-bending protein IHF, if a cognate binding site is placed at the centre of the site I&#x02013;site II spacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>); the modified recombination site is called <italic>resF</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Rowland <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The <italic>resH</italic>/<italic>resF</italic> site is far more compact than the Tn3/&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<italic>res</italic> site, which has a second regulatory resolvase binding site instead of the HU/IHF site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p>Like other resolvases, Sin acts selectively on recombination sites that are arranged in direct repeat in a supercoiled DNA circle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Rowland <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Selectivity arises because recombination is contingent on assembly of the synaptosome, and thereby on synapsis of the regulatory sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Rowland <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), and this requires a substrate with the appropriate topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Stark and Boocock, 1995</xref>). The regulatory sites thus promote resolution, and block undesirable competing reactions such as inversion.</p><p>The protein&#x02013;DNA architecture of resolvase synaptosomes has been the focus of considerable research and conjecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Rice and Steitz, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Murley and Grindley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Sarkis <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Rowland <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). A recent crystal structure of the Sin regulatory tetramer at site II revealed an unexpected synapsis interface between the small C-terminal DNA-binding domains (CTDs), and genetic data established that this interface is needed in the functional synaptosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). The new structure enabled us to assemble a model of the complete Sin synaptosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), by rigid-body docking of available structures for Sin (site II synapse), &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase (site I synapse) and IHF, constrained by the known arrangement of the three binding sites within <italic>resF</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Rowland <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>)<italic>.</italic> This model successfully accounts for the interwound topology of the Sin synaptosome. The Sin regulatory tetramer has a &#x02018;DNA-in&#x02019; configuration that contrasts with the &#x02018;DNA-out&#x02019; configuration of the catalytic tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">N&#x000f6;llmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), and with the &#x02018;DNA-out&#x02019; configuration suggested for regulatory tetramers in previous published models of the Tn3/&#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase and Sin synaptosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Murley and Grindley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Sarkis <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Rowland <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Our new structure-based model of the Sin synaptosome thus places the large domains of the regulatory subunits bound at site II on the outside of the complex, in positions where they could readily contact two large domains of the catalytic tetramer from opposite sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Fig. 9F</xref> for a rotated view), whereas previous models of the Tn3/&#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase and Sin synaptosomes placed the large domains of the regulatory subunits in contact with each other on the inside of the complex.</p><p>It has been proposed that specific contacts between the regulatory and catalytic subunits within the synaptosome are needed to activate recombination at site I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Murley and Grindley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Sarkis <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). We previously reported that a directed mutation at Sin residue R54 can disrupt regulation without affecting synapsis of the regulatory sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). The rigid-body docking model of the Sin synaptosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C</xref>) predicts a contact interface that is asymmetric, involving side-chains around residues R54 and I40 in catalytic and regulatory subunits respectively. However, by making conformational adjustments to the regulatory subunits in the model, the contact interface can be modelled using the pseudo-symmetric &#x02018;F52/R54&#x02032; dimer&#x02013;dimer packing interface seen in the Sin crystals, in which the side-chains of residues F52 and R54 from two subunits are interdigitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). It was therefore important to investigate the potential role of the F52/R54 interface. An intriguing feature of this interface is its resemblance to the 2&#x02013;3&#x02032; regulatory interface of Tn3/&#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Salvo and Grindley, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Hughes <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Murley and Grindley, 1998</xref>). In the Tn3/&#x003b3;&#x003b4; system, the 2&#x02013;3&#x02032; interface is essential for recombination, and is important for resolvase-mediated looping within one <italic>res</italic> site and for synapsis of the regulatory sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Hughes <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Murley and Grindley, 1998</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism whereby the regulatory module stimulates recombination at site I is not known. Synapsis at site I involves dramatic conformational rearrangements in the recombinase, as illustrated by crystal structures of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase in an &#x02018;inactive&#x02019; pre-synaptic dimer, and in an &#x02018;active&#x02019; post-cleavage synaptic tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Yang and Steitz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). The intermediate steps in site I synapsis and DNA strand cleavage are less well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">N&#x000f6;llmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Kamtekar <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Recombination can occur at site I in the absence of the regulatory module, but this requires &#x02018;activating&#x02019; mutations in the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Arnold <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Burke <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Rowland <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). For Tn3/&#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase, multiple activating mutations are necessary for assembly of a stable site I synaptic tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Sarkis <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">N&#x000f6;llmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>), and this stabilization is the likely basis for the activation of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Olorunniji <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). We previously identified one activating mutation in Sin (I100T) that supports site I &#x000d7; site I recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Rowland <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). However, it is not yet clear whether the main function of the regulatory module in the WT systems is to control site I synapsis or later reaction steps.</p><p>Our aim in this study was to define protein&#x02013;protein interfaces that are critical for assembly of the synaptosome and regulation of recombination. We describe two distinct classes of regulatory mutations in Sin. We show that activating mutations map to diverse positions in the N-terminal catalytic domain, and can stabilize a catalytically active site I synaptic tetramer, and we suggest how they might have this effect. We also show that mutations that block activation by the regulatory module map exclusively to residues F52 and R54, demonstrating the functional relevance of the crystallographic F52/R54 interface. The data support a model of the Sin synaptosome that incorporates this interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), and we suggest a mechanism for the regulation of catalysis that may be applicable to other serine recombinases.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Selection and characterization of activating mutations in Sin</title><p>An activating mutation is defined here as any mutation that promotes recombination of site I &#x000d7; site I substrates, bypassing the requirement for the regulatory sites; we previously reported one such mutation in Sin (I100T; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Rowland <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). We have now identified activating mutations at an additional 26 residues, using four different criteria to screen large libraries of mutants with random changes in the entire Sin reading frame (screens W, X, Y and Z; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>) (see below). To select mutants, we used an <italic>in vivo</italic> recombination assay in which a substrate plasmid, containing a reporter gene (<italic>galK</italic>) flanked by directly repeated copies of <italic>resH</italic> or site I, is complemented with a Sin-expressing plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Rowland <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). On indicator plates, white colonies are seen if resolution (deletion of <italic>galK</italic>) is efficient, while red colonies are seen if resolution is slow or absent; WT Sin recombines a <italic>resH</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>resH</italic> substrate slowly, giving red colonies (e.g. see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>, plate 1).</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>The mutation R54E selectively inhibits <italic>resH</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>resH</italic> recombination <italic>in vivo.</italic> The assays show how R54E affects recombination of <italic>resH</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>resH</italic>, <italic>resH</italic> &#x000d7; site I and site I &#x000d7; site I substrates by WT Sin, various activated mutants.

A. The activating mutations listed were selected from libraries of random mutants generated in three different backgrounds (see text for details): WT (screen W), I100T (screen X) and R54E/I100T (screens Y and Z). Many mutations were selected in more than one background, as indicated: upper case (W, X, Y, Z) denotes mutations selected without secondary mutations; lower case (w, x, y, z) denotes mutations selected along with secondary mutations, but shown to confer a phenotype after separation. The &#x02018;activation score&#x02019; is a measure of how strongly a mutation activates recombination (see B). The location of each mutation in the secondary structure of Sin bound at site II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) is given. Structural interfaces on which mutated residues are predicted to reside in the inactive site I dimer, and in the active site I synaptic tetramer, are also listed (&#x02018;predicted interface in site I dimer/tetramer&#x02019;). Interfaces are defined in the accompanying cartoons, which subdivide each subunit into the &#x02018;core&#x02019; catalytic domains (containing helices A, B, C, D and D&#x02032;) the E helix, and the CTD: dim., interfaces between two subunits in the same dimer; cis, interfaces between helix E and the core domain of the same subunit, or between helix D&#x02032; and the remainder of the core domain of the same subunit; cis2, interfaces between helix C and helix D within the core domain; tet., the synapsis interface between the two dimers in the tetramer; &#x02018;?&#x02019; denotes residues that are disordered in the Sin structure (residue E41) or whose structural role is unclear. The assignments are based on the Sin site II-dimer structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), on the &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase site I synaptic tetramer structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), and on a Sin site I synaptic tetramer generated by homology modelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figs 1C and 8C</xref>). B. The &#x02018;activation score&#x02019; of a mutation is a convenient numerical measure of the extent to which the mutation activates recombination.

The WT and I100T Sin backgrounds provide different &#x02018;windows&#x02019; of sensitivity. For example, weak activating mutations such as N72D affect the phenotype in the I100T background, but not in the WT background.

The remainder of the &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase structure (residues 120&#x02013;183 and the site I DNA) was not altered.

With one exception (see below), the mutations that were selected on this basis also promoted recombination of a site I &#x000d7; site I substrate. The <italic>resH</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>resH</italic> screen therefore primarily identifies activating mutations that directly promote recombination at site I, rather than mutations that act indirectly through the regulatory sites. Note that the low rate of <italic>resH</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>resH</italic> recombination by WT Sin <italic>in vivo</italic> may be due to weak activation by the regulatory sites, perhaps because the available <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DNA-bending protein(s) do not function optimally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Rowland <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In the second selection procedure (screen X; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>), we looked for mutations that increase the efficiency of site I &#x000d7; site I recombination by I100T Sin.

Nearly half of the mutations were selected in more than one screen. All are in the N-terminal catalytic domain of Sin, and at six residues two or more different activating changes were identified. An &#x02018;activation score&#x02019; was assigned for each mutation (from 1 to 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>), based on how it affects recombination of <italic>resH</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>resH</italic>, <italic>resH</italic> &#x000d7; site I and site I &#x000d7; site I substrates <italic>in vivo</italic>, in WT and/or I100T backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>). All of the mutations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref> were shown to promote site I &#x000d7; site I recombination in a WT or I100T Sin background, either in the indicator plate assay or by plasmid DNA analysis (data not shown). With most of the activating mutations, recombination was nevertheless further stimulated by the regulatory sites when they were present in both partners (i.e. the <italic>resH</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>resH</italic> substrate; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>). Only four single mutations (T77I, V78A, K110R and Q115R) gave the maximum detectable level of activity with the site I &#x000d7; site I substrate in a WT background (i.e. white colonies, e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>, plates 7, 11 and 13).</p><p>In screen W, we selected I60M Sin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>) and also I60M/H166R Sin, and found that the double mutant recombines a <italic>resH</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>resH</italic> substrate more efficiently than the single mutant (data not shown). However, H166R (unlike I60M) does not promote recombination of a site I &#x000d7; site I substrate (data not shown). Interestingly, H166R was also selected in a screen for mutations that rescue <italic>resH</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>resH</italic> recombination by a CTD mutant defective in site II synapsis; H166 is located close to the CTD synapsis interface and the mutation probably stabilizes this interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). In summary, H166R is the only mutation identified here that stimulates <italic>resH</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>resH</italic> recombination by enhancing regulatory site functions, rather than by acting directly on site I functions; its effect is small compared with the &#x02018;classical&#x02019; activating mutations listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Activating mutations can rescue the recombination defect conferred by R54E</title><p>We previously reported that residue R54 of Sin is important for proper functioning of the regulatory tetramer assembled at site II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).

The site I substrates a&#x02013;d have different arm lengths, as depicted in (E). The synapse species designated S1 and S2 are named according to their component DNA substrates (e.g. b+b S2 contains two equivalents of substrate b). Reactions (24&#x000b0;C, 60 min) contained &#x0223c;12.5 nM site I with 125 nM Sin subunits. Only the part of the gel containing the synapses is shown (see C for a complete gel) and the lanes have been rearranged. Note that recombination intermediates present in the reaction mixtures (with mutant M in particular) may not all have been trapped as stable synapse intermediates visible on this gel (data not shown). B. Denaturing (+ SDS) gel analysis of samples from the same reactions as (A). Recombinant product and non-recombinant substrate DNA fragments (rec. and subs.) are indicated. The single-strand break (SSB) and double-strand break (DSB) products all have one Sin subunit covalently attached to the DNA, and are identified according to the attached DNA fragment. Note that when the DNA arms flanking site I are of sufficiently different lengths, the top and bottom strand SSB products migrate as a doublet of bands of equal intensity. C. Non-denaturing &#x02018;synapsis&#x02019; gel. The Q115R (Q) reaction is similar to that in lane 8 of the gel in (A), but with &#x0223c;80 nM substrate d and 500 nM Q115R Sin. Marker reactions used &#x0223c;12 nM substrate with enzyme dilution buffer (&#x02212;) or 250 nM WT Sin. Note that the synapse labelled &#x02018;subs. d 22-70 + rec. 70-70&#x02019; is a very minor species and has the mobility expected for a synapse containing three 70 bp half-sites and one 22 bp half-site; its rarity suggests that very little dissociation/reassociation of synapses occurs during the reaction.

We present data for two Sin mutants, Q115R and T77I/I100T/Q115R, which combines three activating mutations (abbreviated Q and M in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>). Both mutants formed site I<sup>AT</sup> synapses that could be trapped and separated by non-denaturing PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref>), and that migrate much more slowly than the site I<sup>AT</sup>&#x02013;dimer complex seen with WT Sin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6C</xref>). With the triple mutant, a single major species, designated S1, was seen with any given substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref>, lanes 1 and 3, and data not shown; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6E</xref> for substrate structures). In contrast, with Q115R Sin, a distinct slower-migrating species, S2, was seen, although species that co-migrate with the S1 synapse were also detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref>, lanes 4 and 6). When two substrates of different lengths were mixed, additional species of intermediate mobility appeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref>, lanes 2 and 5), confirming that S1 and S2 are synapses containing two copies of site I<sup>AT</sup>. When the left and right arms of the site I<sup>AT</sup> substrate were of very different lengths (i.e. substrates c and d; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6E</xref>), the Q115R S2 synapse &#x02018;split&#x02019; into a doublet of bands of equal intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref>, lanes 7 and 8). We interpret these as the &#x02018;parallel&#x02019; and &#x02018;antiparallel&#x02019; isomers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6D</xref>), which presumably separate on gels only when the DNA arm lengths are sufficiently different. All of these site I<sup>AT</sup> synapses are thought to contain a tetramer of Sin, because their gel mobility properties resemble those of Tn3/&#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase site I synapses (data not shown), for which the stoichiometry is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Sarkis <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">N&#x000f6;llmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Olorunniji <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), and because Q115R Sin, unlike WT Sin, can form a stable apo-tetramer and a site I synaptic tetramer in solution (K.W.

Both Q115R Sin and T77I/I100T/Q115R Sin generated recombinants of the predicted sizes, together with presumptive recombination intermediates in which Sin subunits were covalently linked to the DNA fragments. DSB intermediates accumulated to higher levels than single-strand break (SSB) intermediates, which represent partially cut substrates and partially re-ligated recombinants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B</xref>). The identities of the various species were confirmed by observing the effects of altering the arm lengths of the substrate (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B</xref>), and digesting with proteinase K (data not shown).</p><p>To investigate the composition of individual Q115R Sin synapse species isolated by non-denaturing PAGE, a reaction similar to that in lane 8 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref> was analysed by 2D-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6C and D</xref>). This showed that the &#x02018;parallel&#x02019; and &#x02018;antiparallel&#x02019; synapses consisted mainly of DSB intermediates, with Sin subunits covalently joined to the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6D</xref>, DSB 70 and DSB 22). Both synapses also contained uncut substrate (22&#x02013;70), and smaller amounts of SSB intermediates (SSB 22&#x02013;70). Only the faster-migrating synapse, thought to represent the &#x02018;antiparallel&#x02019; isomer, contained detectable amounts of the fully ligated recombinants (22&#x02013;22 and 70&#x02013;70) and an incompletely ligated recombinant (SSB 70&#x02013;70). Note that the &#x02018;parallel&#x02019; synapse is not expected to contain detectable recombinants (since they will be the same sizes as the substrates). A simple interpretation of these data is that each Q115R synapse &#x02018;species&#x02019; separated on the gel is in fact an equilibrating ensemble of all the catalytic intermediates, starting from a specific alignment of the uncut substrates, and proceeding through the SSB and DSB intermediates to the corresponding synapsed recombinants (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6D</xref>). Consistent with this scenario, the &#x02018;antiparallel&#x02019; synapse contains roughly comparable amounts of uncut substrate and ligated recombinant; however, other explanations cannot be ruled out.</p><p>The fast-migrating synapses designated S1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref> (seen with T77I/I100T/Q115R Sin, and to a lesser extent with Q115R Sin) are candidates for an &#x02018;early&#x02019; or pre-cleavage synapse intermediate. In support of this, synapses co-migrating with these S1 synapses were also formed in the absence of detectable DNA strand cleavage, for example, with the activated mutant T77I Sin (data not shown); the recombination intermediates detected with T77I/I100T/Q115R Sin in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B</xref> are thought to derive not from the S1 synapses seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref>, but from unstable synapses that dissociate during electrophoresis (data not shown). Interestingly, the S1 synapse did not &#x02018;split&#x02019; into a doublet with the 22&#x02013;70 substrate (substrate d; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref>, lane 9), in contrast to the S2 synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref>, lane 8). This could be due to a different configuration of the DNA arms in the synapse; alternatively, the parallel and antiparallel isomers might interconvert rapidly and thus migrate as a single species.</p></sec><sec><title>The mutation R54E interferes with the function of the regulatory module</title><p>To investigate the role of the F52/R54 interface in regulatory site function, we examined the effects of the mutation R54E on <italic>in vitro</italic> recombination by an activated Sin mutant, N72D/I100T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>). This mutant was chosen because it catalyses site I<sup>AT</sup> &#x000d7; site I<sup>AT</sup> recombination <italic>in vitro</italic> at an easily measurable rate (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>, plates 9 and 10 for <italic>in vivo</italic> data). Both N72D/I100T Sin and R54E/N72D/I100T Sin recombined a site I<sup>AT</sup> &#x000d7; site I<sup>AT</sup> substrate relatively slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;4), giving approximately equal amounts of resolution and inversion products and some intermolecular product, characteristic of an unregulated &#x02018;random collision&#x02019; reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Rowland <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Although the R54E mutation had no significant qualitative effect on recombination, it reduced the rate slightly (consistent with its effect on I100T Sin <italic>in vivo</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>, plates 3 and 4). (IHF was present in these reactions, but does not affect the products; data not shown.)</p><p>When site II was present (i.e. with a <italic>resF</italic><sup>AT</sup> &#x000d7; <italic>resF</italic><sup>AT</sup> substrate), but IHF was absent, recombination by both N72D/I100T Sin and R54E/N72D/I100T Sin was slower than with the site I<sup>AT</sup> &#x000d7; site I<sup>AT</sup> substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>, lanes 5&#x02013;8). This suggests that synapsis at site II inhibits recombination at site I when there is no IHF to bend the site I&#x02013;site II spacer (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Fig. 9A</xref> and <italic>Discussion</italic>). When a low concentration of IHF was added, N72D/I100T Sin and R54E/N72D/I100T Sin responded very differently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>, lanes 9&#x02013;12). With N72D/I100T Sin, 0.5 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> IHF strongly stimulated resolution, but not inversion, at initial times [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>, compare lanes 1 (no site II), 5 (no IHF) and 9 (site II + IHF)]. (Inversion product accumulated at later times, and may be a secondary reaction product.) In contrast, with R54E/N72D/I100T Sin, 0.5 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> IHF did not significantly stimulate resolution; the recombination products were similar to those seen with the site I<sup>AT</sup> &#x000d7; site I<sup>AT</sup> substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>, compare lanes 3&#x02013;4 and 11&#x02013;12), and raising the enzyme concentration had no effect (data not shown). The R54E mutation therefore largely blocked stimulation by 0.5 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> IHF. However, when the concentration of IHF was raised to 3.0 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, the effect of R54E was overcome, and resolution was selectively stimulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>, compare lanes 11&#x02013;12 and 15&#x02013;16). Similar results were obtained with a <italic>resF</italic><sup>AC</sup> &#x000d7; <italic>resF</italic><sup>AC</sup> substrate, when only resolution is possible: R54E abolished recombination at 0.5 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> IHF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>, compare lanes 17&#x02013;18 and 19&#x02013;20), but inhibited only weakly at 3.0 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> IHF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>, compare lanes 21&#x02013;22 and 23&#x02013;24).</p><p>In summary, at a low concentration of IHF, the R54E mutation has a dramatic inhibitory effect on the resolution reaction, whereas at a high concentration of IHF, it has little effect. Similar results were obtained with a <italic>resH</italic><sup>AT</sup> &#x000d7; <italic>resH</italic><sup>AT</sup> substrate and Hbsu as the cofactor (data not shown). The main effect of R54E is thus to raise the apparent &#x02018;K<sub>M</sub>&#x02019; for the DNA-bending cofactor in the resolution reaction (i.e. the concentration required for half-maximal stimulation).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Regulatory mutations in Sin</title><p>The objective of the random mutagenesis studies reported here was to identify protein interfaces that are involved in regulating recombination by Sin, thus providing insight into the architecture and function of the synaptosome. Our structure-based model of the synaptosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) calls for three distinct types of Sin dimer&#x02013;dimer interactions: (A) to assemble a &#x02018;DNA-out&#x02019; synaptic tetramer at site I, (B) to mediate contact between the dimers bound at site I and site II, and (C) to assemble a &#x02018;DNA-in&#x02019; synaptic tetramer at site II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figs 1C and 9E and F</xref>). We have now identified regulatory mutations that influence each of these three proposed interactions, and that map to specific crystallographic interfaces, providing strong experimental support for the model. Previously, we described a class of mutations that inhibit recombination by inhibiting site II synapsis, and that map to the crystallographic CTD interface at site II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Here, we describe two other classes of Sin regulatory mutations, affecting interactions of types (A) and (B) respectively: activating mutations, which bypass the requirement for the regulatory sites and stimulate recombination at site I, and mutations at F52 and R54, which reverse the activating effect of the regulatory sites on recombination at site I. The F52 and R54 mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>) map to a dimer&#x02013;dimer packing interface seen in the Sin crystals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).

As we discuss below, the activating mutations highlight residues likely to be involved in the large-scale conformational rearrangements needed to assemble the active catalytic tetramer at site I.</p></sec><sec><title>Activating mutations</title><p>Activating mutations are defined here as those that stimulate site I &#x000d7; site I recombination, bypassing the normal requirement for the regulatory sites. A total of 36 activating mutations in Sin were identified; overlapping sets of these were selected in screens based on <italic>resH</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>resH</italic> recombination, on site I &#x000d7; site I recombination, or on the suppression of R54E-mediated inhibition of <italic>resH</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>resH</italic> recombination (screens W, X, Y and Z; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>). To account for this, we suggest that all activating mutations directly stimulate events at site I that normally depend on the regulatory sites and the F52/R54 interface, and that the activating mutations and the regulatory sites can work together to promote recombination. Our data indicate that any Sin mutation that stimulates site I &#x000d7; site I recombination (i.e. in the absence of the regulatory sites) will also stimulate <italic>resH</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>resH</italic> recombination within the synaptosome, and vice versa; the one exception found is the CTD mutation H166R, which does not stimulates site I &#x000d7; site I recombination, and is thought to act by stabilizing the site II synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Activating mutations and synapsis at site I</title><p>Activating mutations were found at 27 of the 146 residues in the N-terminal catalytic domain of Sin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>).

In the Sin system, combinations of activating mutations have additive effects on site I &#x000d7; site I recombination in all cases tested (e.g. see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>, plates 3 and 5; data not shown), suggesting that these mutations all contribute to the same process. The positions of activating mutations in Sin correlate remarkably well with those in Tn3 and &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvases, and with mutations conferring FIS independence in the DNA invertases Hin and Gin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Klippel <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Haykinson <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Johnson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Burke <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>).

The Sin site II dimer structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) is thought to be a good model for the pre-synapsis site I dimer within the main part of the catalytic domain (residues 1&#x02013;126), where the two Sin subunits adopt conformations very similar to those seen in &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase dimers. When mapped onto the Sin site II dimer structure, the activating mutations do not define a single surface patch or a plausible synapsis interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8A</xref>).

While we cannot rule out the possibility that Sin site I synapsis is initiated by dimer&#x02013;dimer contacts of this type, analogous to those modelled <italic>in silico</italic> for &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), our data provide no support for the idea.</p><p>To explain how mutations at &#x0223c;20% of Sin NTD residues can activate recombination at site I, substituting for the function of the regulatory module, we suggest a simple &#x02018;two-state&#x02019; model for synapsis at site I; the supporting evidence is described below. We hypothesize that a Sin dimer bound at site I can interconvert between two major conformational states: a &#x02018;closed&#x02019; conformation similar to that seen in the &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase pre-synapsis site I dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Yang and Steitz, 1995</xref>) and in the Sin site II dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), and an &#x02018;open&#x02019; conformation (which may be short-lived) similar to that seen in the &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase synaptic tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Kamtekar <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). We propose that the &#x02018;closed&#x02019; dimer is refractory to synapsis, whereas the &#x02018;open&#x02019; dimer exposes a high-affinity synapsis interface needed to assemble the synaptic tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8B and C</xref>). According to this model, activating mutations could promote synapsis by destabilizing the &#x02018;closed&#x02019; dimer, and/or by stabilizing the &#x02018;open&#x02019; dimer or the synaptic tetramer itself.</p><p>The above model is supported by the following observations. Most of the activating mutations in Sin affect residues on or close to internal domain interfaces that are expected to stabilize the &#x02018;closed&#x02019; dimer, but need to be broken or rearranged to form the &#x02018;open&#x02019; dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8A and B</xref>). For example, various substitutions at Q115, which is at the dimer interface, all activated Sin (R, C, K and Y; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). A number of activating mutations (including three of the strongest, Q115R, K110R and V78A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>) map to interfaces within the &#x02018;closed&#x02019; dimer that are rearranged to create the dimer&#x02013;dimer synapsis interface in our model of the Sin tetramer (mainly one face each of the D, D&#x02032; and E helices; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8</xref>). The Q115R mutation could stabilize the tetramer by placing a basic residue close to an acidic residue (E122) across the synapsis interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8D</xref>). In contrast, the Q115E mutation was predicted to generate an unfavourable configuration of negatively charged residues across the synapsis interface, and was found to abolish recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). Also notable is the cluster of activating mutations on one face of helix D (residues 72, 75, 78, 82 and 83). In the &#x02018;closed&#x02019; dimer, these residues are involved in the &#x02018;cis&#x02019; interface between the core catalytic domain and helix E of the same subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8A</xref>); in the hypothesized &#x02018;open&#x02019; dimer, the interface is rearranged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8B</xref>) such that residues N72 and I75 can now contribute to the synapsis interface in the tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8D</xref>), as seen for the corresponding residues (A74 and I77) in &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Analysed in this way, the locations of these and other activating mutations appear consistent with the idea that their effect is to destabilize the pre-synaptic dimer relative to the synaptic tetramer. In the Tn3 system, an intra-subunit disulphide cross-link that should favour an &#x02018;open&#x02019; dimer conformation is strongly activating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Wenwieser, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Kamtekar <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), supporting our proposal that a conformational change in the site I-bound subunits is sufficient to trigger synapsis.</p></sec><sec><title>Activating mutations stabilize a catalytically proficient site I synapse</title><p>The activating mutation Q115R stabilizes a site I synapse with the properties of an authentic recombination intermediate. First, &#x02018;parallel&#x02019; and &#x02018;antiparallel&#x02019; isomers, formed in approximately equal yield, could be separated by PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref>), consistent with previous evidence that crossover site alignment is random in the absence of the regulatory sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Rowland <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Second, although each synapse isomer migrated as a well-defined band in PAGE, it contained site I in different states of DNA strand cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6D</xref>), suggesting that the strand cleavage and re-ligation steps may equilibrate within the synapse. Third, in the &#x02018;antiparallel&#x02019; synapse, comparable amounts of recombinant and non-recombinant site I were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6D</xref>), suggesting that the strand exchange steps also equilibrate on the timescale of the PAGE separation (we would otherwise expect to separate &#x02018;recombinant&#x02019; and &#x02018;non-recombinant&#x02019; isomers of the synapse). We therefore conclude that all the chemical and conformational steps of recombination take place within the Q115R Sin synaptic tetramer, and may be in a dynamic equilibrium. This contrasts with previous reports of synaptic complexes trapped with activated mutants of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase or Hin invertase, where DNA strand cleavage was quantitative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Dhar <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Sanders and Johnson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Kamtekar <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Activating mutations in Sin other than Q115R (e.g. T77I, I100T and K110R) also promoted site I synapsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref>; data not shown), and topological studies using supercoiled substrates confirmed that site I &#x000d7; site I recombination takes place within a site I synapse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>), as demonstrated previously for I100T Sin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Rowland <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Although our data support the idea that all activating mutations promote synapsis at site I, they may not all stabilize an &#x02018;S2&#x02019; synapse intermediate similar to that characterized with Q115R Sin. Specifically, T77I-containing mutants stabilized an &#x02018;S1&#x02019; synapse, which appears to have a different conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref>), and may be an earlier (pre-cleavage) intermediate. We anticipate that the various activated mutants will be useful for trapping different post-synapsis intermediates for biochemical and structural studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of the F52/R54 interface</title><p>In the Sin site II crystal structure, each Sin dimer contacts two neighbours using a pseudo-symmetric interface centred on residues F52 and R54 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Our data argue that this F52/R54 interface has an important role in promoting recombination at site I within the synaptosome. Previously, we showed that a designed substitution in Sin, R54E, can selectively block regulatory site functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). We have now selected a class of regulatory mutations with similar properties to R54E and shown that they map exclusively to the two major residues in the crystallographic F52/R54 dimer&#x02013;dimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>). Mutations were not found in a third residue, D57, which contacts R54 across the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1D</xref>); this residue is very highly conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>) and may be essential for the secondary structure.</p><p>Our initial structure-based model of the Sin synaptosome, assembled by rigid-body docking of the available crystal structures, is not compatible with formation of the F52/R54 interface between the Sin dimers bound at sites I and II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figs 1C and 9F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). However, the F52/R54 interface can be incorporated into the model by making conformational adjustments that include a rotation of the Sin catalytic domains at site II towards the catalytic tetramer (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Fig. 9E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). We suggest that the synaptosome adopts a conformation of this type during at least a part of the catalytic cycle.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanism of regulation</title><p>We argued above that the regulatory module is likely to stimulate the same critical reaction steps at site I as the activating mutations. We have shown that activating mutations can promote site I synapsis, and that the resulting site I synapse is proficient in recombination, at least in the case of Q115R Sin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6D</xref>). Recent studies using a novel suicide substrate have demonstrated that a change in the multimeric state of Sin is an essential step in switching on catalysis (K.W. Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., submitted). We have also shown that F52 and R54 are important for the control of recombination by the regulatory module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figs 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">7</xref>). Our model of the synaptosome suggests a specific mechanism whereby F52/R54 contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1D</xref>) could promote site I synapsis, and hence recombination, by mediating a &#x02018;looping&#x02019; interaction between Sin dimers bound at sites I and II within each <italic>resH</italic>/<italic>resF</italic> site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Fig. 9</xref>). We propose that this interaction stabilizes the &#x02018;open&#x02019; conformation of the site I dimer, which we suggest is required for assembly of the site I tetramer; modelling suggests that looping would not be compatible with a &#x02018;closed&#x02019; dimer at site I. The looping interaction is expected to require both the F52/R54 interface and the HU/IHF-induced DNA bend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Fig. 9C and D</xref>). We would therefore predict that, in the absence of HU/IHF, site II synapsis would simply &#x02018;tether&#x02019; the site Is in an unfavourable configuration for synapsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Fig. 9A</xref>), and that any defect in the F52/R54 interface would have a more severe effect on recombination at low concentrations of HU/IHF. This prediction is borne out by our <italic>in vitro</italic> data, which show that at a low concentration of HU/IHF (but not at a high concentration) a WT F52/R54 interface is essential for the stimulatory effect of the regulatory sites on recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>). The <italic>in vitro</italic> behaviour at low HU/IHF may reflect the situation <italic>in vivo</italic>, where the selective inhibition of <italic>resH</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>resH</italic> recombination by R54E is particularly clear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>In summary, in our working model for regulation, the &#x02018;closed&#x02019; dimer conformation of WT Sin bound at site I is resistant to synapsis and recombination. Synapsis at site II also helps to repress recombination, except when the regulatory module is active, i.e. when the F52/R54 interface and HU/IHF cooperate to &#x02018;open&#x02019; the site I dimers and assemble the catalytic tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Fig. 9A</xref>). This type of model for allosteric activation nicely fits the available genetic, biochemical and structural data, in particular our evidence that the activating mutations and the F52/R54 interface can work together to stimulate recombination. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the regulatory module and the F52/R54 interface act simply to &#x02018;recruit&#x02019; a high local concentration of correctly aligned site I-bound dimers, and play no further part in assembly of the catalytic tetramer.</p><p>Our model for regulation may be relevant to other serine recombinases, particularly the major families of resolvases, in which residues corresponding to the F52/R54 interface of Sin and the 2&#x02013;3&#x02032; interface of Tn3/&#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase are well conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Since these interfaces have very similar geometries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1D</xref>), we suggest that looping interactions within <italic>res</italic> sites (e.g. as described for &#x003b3;&#x003b4;<italic>res</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Salvo and Grindley, 1988</xref>) could bring the regulatory subunits into direct contact with the catalytic subunits, in positions similar to those shown in our model for Sin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Fig. 9E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Mutagenesis of Sin and selection of activated mutants</title><p>The construction of PCR-generated libraries of random mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Zaccolo <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>) of WT Sin has been described (libraries 7.1 and 7.4, both &#x0223c;600 000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).
