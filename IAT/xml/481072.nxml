The transformation of gastrointestinal epithelial tissue to carcinomas has been shown to be associated with the progressive inhibition of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The Bcl-2 family of genes appears to be important in the regulation of apoptosis. Members of this family are cellular homologues that are either pro-apoptotic (Bax, Bik and Bid) or anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Recently, BAK (a Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer) has been cloned as a Bcl-2-related gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The BAK gene encodes a 211-amino acid protein with a relative molecular weight (<italic>M</italic>r) of 23,400. Gene transfer mediated elevations in BAK protein levels accelerate apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation in murine lymphoid, lung cancer and breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], suggesting that BAK functions primarily as a promoter of apoptosis.</p><p>BAK expression has been reported in normal gastrointestinal epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Strong BAK immunoreactivity has been shown to be present in the gastric epithelial cells lining the gastric pits and parietal cells, whereas the self-renewing mucous cells located below the gastric pits in the gastric neck region are immunonegative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In gastrointestinal epithelial tissues, the up-regulation of BAK expression during differentiation may help to ensure that cell turnover occurs in a normal fashion. However, it has been reported that gastric tumors have reduced BAK levels when compared with the normal mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Moreover, mutations of the BAK gene have been identified in human gastrointestinal cancers, suggesting that a perturbation of BAK-mediated apoptosis may contribute to the pathogenesis of gastric cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Several recent reports have demonstrated the feasibility of using gene transfers to treat gastric cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In the current study, utilizing BAK gene transfer via plasmid vector, we investigated the apoptosis inducing effects of BAK overexpression on human gastric cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, in order to explore a novel strategy for gene therapy of gastric cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and reagents</title><p>The human gastric cancer cell lines, MKN-45 (wild-type p53) and MKN-28 (mutant type p53), were obtained from the Typical Culture Center of Wuhan University (China). Cells were maintained at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>in RPMI 1640 (Gibco PRL) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml, respectively) and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Restriction enzymes and DNA recovery kits were purchased from Promega Company. T<sub>4 </sub>DNA Ligase was purchased from the TaKaRa company. Propidium iodide was purchased from the Sigma company. TUNEL and caspase-3 activity detection kits were purchased from the Boster and Clontech companies respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Vector construction</title><p>Plasmid pET-BAK was kindly provided by Dr. Patty Wendel (Cold Spring Harbour, USA), which contained the BAK cDNA (633 bp) between the restriction sites for <italic>XhoI </italic>and <italic>HindIII</italic>. Prof. Shen Qu (Department of Biochemistry, Tongji Medical College, China) provided the eukaryotic vector pcDNA<sub>3</sub>. <italic>XhoI </italic>and <italic>Hind III </italic>digested the plasmids, pET-BAK and pcDNA<sub>3</sub>, to recover the BAK gene (633 bp) and linear vector fragments (5.4 Kb) respectively.

According to the physical maps of both the BAK gene and vector, <italic>XhoI</italic>, <italic>HindIII</italic>, <italic>XhoI </italic>and <italic>HindIII </italic>digested the recombinant respectively, for restrictive enzyme reaction assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene transfer and expression</title><p>For both MKN-45 and MKN-28 cell lines, untransfer control, pcDNA<sub>3 </sub>and pcDNA-BAK transfer groups were designed. Gene transfer was conducted with Lipofectamine 2000 (Gibco company, USA), according to the suggestion of the manufacturer. Cellular BAK mRNA expression levels were assayed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Cellular total RNA extraction was conducted with TRIzol (Life Technologies company). After the reverse transcription reaction, PCR amplification reaction was conducted with the following primers: BAK (502 bp) upstream 5'-CTGCCCT CTGCTTCTGA-3', downstream 5'-CGTT CAGGATGGGACCA-3'. &#x003b1;-Tubulin (295 bp) upstream 5'-CCCGTCTTCAGGGTCTCTTG-3', downstream 5'-TTAAGGTAAGTGTAGGTTGGG-3'. &#x003b1;-Tubulin served as an internal control for PCR. Amplification products were separated with 1% agarose electrophoresis and observed under ultraviolet light. The brightness ratios between BAK and &#x003b1;-Tubulin were evaluated with gel computer image system (Gel Doc 1000, Bio-Rad company). Cellular BAK protein expression levels were assayed via Western Blotting. The extraction, quantification and separation of proteins were conducted according to <italic>Molecular Cloning</italic>. Blots were incubated sequentially with 1% nonfat dry milk, mouse monoclonal anti-BAK antibody (Boster Company) and goat radish peroxidase-conjugated antimouse immunoglobulin G, and evaluated using an ECL Western blotting kit. &#x003b1;-Tubulin served as an internal control for the immunoblot. Protein band intensities were determined densitometrically using the Computer Imaging System.</p></sec><sec><title>Cellular growth assay</title><p>The MKN-45 and MKN-28 cells were seeded at 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>/ml density in 96-well chamber slides (each group had five wells). After transferring for 1d, 3d and 5d, cellular growth was detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-dimethyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Clontech) colorimetric method. Each well was given 20 &#x003bc;l of 0.5% MTT and cultured for another 4 h. The supernatant was discarded, then the pellet was given 100 &#x003bc;l of dimethyl sulfoxide. When the crystal dissolved, the optical density <italic>A </italic>values of the slides were read on an enzyme-labeled Minireader II at 570 nm.

Cells were washed twice with 0.01 mol/L phosphate-buffer saline (PBS) and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Then the cells were washed once with PBS, digested by 200 &#x003bc;l RNase (1 mg/ml) at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes, and stained with 800 &#x003bc;l propidium iodide (50 &#x003bc;g/ml) at room temperature for 30 minutes. The DNA histograms were assayed by flow cytometry (Becton Dickson company) and analyzed with CELLQEST software.</p></sec><sec><title>Cellular apoptosis detection</title><p>Cancer cells from the groups above were collected, rinsed by PBS, fixed using 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 30 minutes, and then washed with PBS. After routine embedment and slicing, cellular ultrastructure was observed under an electronic microscope. The TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) method detected the apoptotic rates. After blocking with 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>for 30 min, slices were digested by Proteinase K (20 mg/L) for 20 min, then incubated with the TUNEL reaction solution at 37&#x000b0;C for 60 min. Then, the slices were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated antibody at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min, stained with diaminobenzidine (DAB) and counterstained using haematoxylin. Instead of the TUNEL reaction solution, PBS was used as a negative control. Under a light microscope, the volume of the apoptotic cells became smaller, with shrinking nuclei and a specific palm-yellow color in the chromosome.</p></sec><sec><title>Caspase-3 expression and activities assays</title><p>Cellular caspase-3 protein expression determinations came from Western Blotting (as the same method above). 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells from above groups were collected, 50 &#x003bc;l of cellular lysis buffer was added, and then they were incubated on ice for 10 min.

There has been a clinical need to identify ideal candidate genes for use in treating gastric cancer patients with gene transfer strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. One promising group is the pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (Bax and BAK), which have been shown to induce apoptosis after gene transfer via plasmid vectors <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The pro-apoptotic BAK gene is located on chromosome 6 and shares homology with the entire Bcl-2 family, including the anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In fact, the family members interact through highly conserved areas of Bcl-2 homology (BH1, BH2, and BH3) that allow hetero- and homodimerization and the consequent close regulation of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In the case of Bax, this scheme has been well worked out in a rheostat model in which excess pro-apoptotic Bax suppresses Bcl-2 and induces apoptosis via cytochrome <italic>c </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Less is known about BAK, but there is evidence that BAK can form heterogenous dimers with Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL to inhibit their anti-apoptotic functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The deficiency in BAK was directly responsible for the arrest in cytochrome <italic>c </italic>release. This capability was restored to the BAK-deficient cells by the insertion of recombinant BAK into purified mitochondria from these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, synergistic activity was detected in the presence of combinations of suboptimal doses of recombinant BAK and Bax, suggesting, that in the presence of a low dose of recombinant BAK, the resistance of these mitochondria to Bax-mediated cytochrome <italic>c </italic>release was reversed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. As recently reported for hepatocytes from BAK-/- mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], BAK-deficient Jurkat cells were also resistant to tBid induction of cytochrome <italic>c </italic>release, suggesting that in these leukemic cells, BAK is involved in mitochondrial cytochrome <italic>c </italic>release induced by either tBid or Bax.</p><p>Current evidence indicated that deficiency of BAK expression is closely correlated with occurrence and development of tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Tomkova <italic>et al </italic>investigated the BAK expression in twenty cases of neoplastic skin diseases. They found seventeen were negative for immunostaining, and the other three cases showed only weak immunostaining in the regions of tumor formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Kondo <italic>et al </italic>found that positive ratios of BAK expression were negatively correlated with the pathological stages and clinical phases of gastric cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Many kinds of tumor therapeutic drugs, such as perillyl alcohol and &#x003b3;-interferon, function through up-regulating BAK expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Recently, Pataer <italic>et al </italic>reported that adenoviral-mediated overexpression of BAK could induce obvious apoptosis in lung and breast cancer cells, which provided a novel therapeutic strategy for cancer therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, high levels of BAK protein were induced in gastric cancer cell line MKN-45 and MKN-28 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B,1C</xref>). It was also indicated that BAK overexpression could arrest the cell cycle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) and induce apoptosis in cancer cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,3B</xref>). Current evidence indicated that the caspases, which are cysteine proteases of the ICE/CED-3 family, are the central components of the cell death machinery in various forms of apoptosis. Of course, caspase-3 is the most likely candidate for a mammalian cell death regulator by cleaving vital cellular proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In this study, we found that the inactive caspase-3 precursor was cleaved into the 20 kDa and 17 kDa subunits, forming the active protease during BAK overexpression-induced apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A,4B</xref>). In addition, our studies suggest that this process is p53 independent because BAK-induced apoptosis occurred equally well in p53 wild-type (MKN-45) or p53 mutant-type (MKN-28) cells. This observation may be explained by the fact that the Bcl-2 family members function downstream from p53 in the apoptotic cascade. Then the clinical use of the BAK vector may be independent of p53. If so, then the treatment of p53 mutant or resistant cancer cells with BAK gene transfer might be possible.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The data presented in this paper show for the first time that overexpression of BAK, mediated by plasmid vectors, leads to apoptosis of gastric cancer cells <italic>in vitro. </italic>This anticancer strategy does not appear to be dependent on p53 status. The action mechanism of BAK mediated apoptosis, however, correlates with activation of caspase-3. Consistent with other finding in BAK genes, we believe BAK plays a pivotal role in the process of apoptosis. This serves as a potential target for further therapeutic development of gastric cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None Declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' Contributions</title><p>QST conceived of the project, directed the experiments, analyzed the data and prepared the manuscript.
