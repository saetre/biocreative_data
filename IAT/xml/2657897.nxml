As neural progenitors proliferate, they are exposed to secreted inductive signals that initiate cell fate decisions by regulating expression of transcription factors. These transcription factors, in turn, impose developmental restrictions on multipotent progenitor cells before ultimately effecting their final differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Understanding how extracellular and cell-intrinsic mechanisms are coordinated during CNS development is important not only for understanding embryonic patterning but also for gaining insight into the developmental potential of neuronal stem cells and progenitors isolated from different regions of the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Neural progenitors from different CNS regions exhibit varying degrees of restriction during their development. Heterochronic transplantation studies have revealed that in the cortex and retina, where neurons are born in a temporal order, progenitors acquire critical aspects of their phenotype during their final cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Young cortical progenitors, which normally generate deep layer neurons in their normal environment, can respond to signals from an older host environment and generate superficial layer neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Similarly, young retinal progenitors are multipotent and can adopt cell fates characteristic of the host environment, whereas older progenitors are somewhat limited in their developmental potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, time-lapse lineage analysis <italic>in vitro </italic>has revealed that even young cortical or retinal progenitors have the intrinsic potential to recapitulate the correct sequence of laminar identities when grown as single progenitors in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Although clonal analysis has also revealed the importance of cell-intrinsic mechanisms for regulating progenitor cell fate decisions, the degree to which the intrinsic program can be modified by extrinsic cues has not been rigorously tested because the identities of the inductive signals as well as molecular markers for distinct progenitors are poorly defined.</p><p>In the vertebrate spinal cord, the signals involved in the conversion of progenitor cells to distinct neuronal subtypes have been defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], making it an excellent system to address if and when motor neuron (MN)-restricted progenitors arise during development and whether they can be isolated in culture. Moreover, the purification of MN-restricted cells has important implications for therapeutic efforts to treat neurodegenerative diseases that affect MNs. During spinal cord development, Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), secreted from the notochord and floor plate, induces the expression of several class II homeodomain (HD) proteins primarily belonging to the <italic>Nkx </italic>gene family (e.g. Nkx6.1/6.2/2.2) in a concentration-dependent manner within ventral neural progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The class II HD factors repress other class I HD proteins (for example, Pax7, Pax6, Dbx2 and Irx3) in ventral neural progenitors to establish, refine, and stabilize distinct progenitor domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Nkx6.1 protein is expressed throughout the ventral third of the neural tube, spanning three ventral progenitor domains: p3, pMN and p2. From these domains arise the V3 interneurons, MNs and V2 interneurons, respectively. Genetic studies have revealed an essential role for Nkx6.1 in MN and V2 interneuron fates, through repression of Dbx2 and establishment of a ventral region of the neural tube [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Establishment of the Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>region is followed by the expression of 'subtype determinants' that define specific progenitor domains and coordinate neuronal specification and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These subtype determinants include two closely related Nkx repressor proteins (Nkx2.2/2.9) that are expressed by p3 progenitors and specify V3 neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], as well as the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein Olig2, which is restricted to pMN progenitors and coordinates MN fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Therefore, labeling progenitors using the Nkx6.1 regulatory elements would allow the isolation and purification of MN and ventral interneuron progenitors.</p><p>Despite their uniform generation from the same progenitor domain within the spinal cord, MNs differ along the rostrocaudal axis by expression of Hox proteins that govern their acquisition of distinct motor columnar identities and ultimately their innervation of a variety of targets, such as limbs, intercostals muscles or sympathetic ganglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The expression of HoxC6 by brachial MNs, Hoxc9 by thoracic MNs and Hoxd10 by lumbar MNs depends on graded Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling from Hensen's node [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These transcription factors ensure that distinct MNs acquire lateral motor column identities at limb levels and a preganglionic, fate at the thoracic level, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Therefore, graded activities of Shh along the dorsoventral axis and FGFs along the rostrocaudal axis initiate expression of distinct transcriptional programs that are required for generation of generic and columnar identities of MNs.</p><p>Despite our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the establishment of ventral progenitor and neuronal fates, several issues pertaining to progenitor fate assignment remain unresolved. First, it is unclear whether all cells that express similar levels of transcription factors within a given progenitor domain are able to maintain their identities in a cell-autonomous manner when deprived of endogenous environmental cues. Second, it has not been established whether all pre-patterned MN progenitors exhibit restrictions in their developmental potential, and what the range of neuronal fates are that they can acquire when exposed to defined signals. Neural tissue explants are heterogeneous, which precludes an analysis of progenitor specification at the single-cell level. Third, if MN-restricted progenitors are present in the spinal cord, are they able to proliferate and generate MNs for a prolonged period in culture? Finally, what is the rostrocaudal identity of MNs born from a restricted progenitor in culture? Motor neurons that have been derived <italic>in vitro </italic>from embryonic stem cells share several features with those developing <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, embryonic stem cell-derived MNs have a cervical identity and do not form functional synapses with limb muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Isolating lineage-restricted progenitors that can generate MNs in culture may provide an alternative way to produce MNs that maintain their regional identity.</p><p>To address these questions, we have generated mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) under the control of the <italic>Nkx6.1 </italic>promoter to genetically label ventral progenitors. We prospectively isolated ventral progenitor cells from this strain by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), cultured individual Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>progenitors at clonal density, and analyzed the molecular identities of their progeny. We demonstrate that ventral Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>cells isolated after progenitor domains are established are heterogeneous in their ability to maintain their identity in culture. The majority of cultured progenitors lose their ventral identity after successive cell divisions without acquiring dorsal fates. A small subset of progenitors, including pMN progenitors, is able to maintain its identity, suggesting that subtype-restricted progenitors from the Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>region are present in the ventral spinal cord, although at a lower frequency than expected from the apparently uniform expression of transcription factors within these progenitors. The pMN-restricted clones have a Hox profile characteristic of thoracic MNs, despite their origin from either forelimb or thoracic levels. The fraction of subtype-restricted progenitors increases over time, suggesting that neural progenitors become progressively more independent of patterning signals. However, exposure of subtype-restricted cells to signals that specify dorsal fates leads to acquisition of some dorsal characteristics, revealing that lineage-restricted progenitor subtypes are not committed to their fate. These findings support a model whereby continuous Shh signaling is required to stably maintain progenitor domain identity after isolation and <italic>in vitro </italic>expansion.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation of <italic>Nkx6.1::IRES::eGFP </italic>mice and prospective FACS isolation of Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>ventral progenitors</title><p>We genetically labeled ventral progenitors expressing Nkx6.1, in order to prospectively isolate cells by FACS and determine the degree of their fate restriction and commitment.

We found that 14.6% of cells from e9.5 forelimb and thoracic regions expressed eGFP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,B</xref>). We analyzed the identities of these cells 2 hours after plating with the following markers: Irx3 (p2), Olig2 (pMN), Nkx2.2 (p3) and Hnf3&#x003b2; (floor plate). We found that 96% of sorted cells were eGFP<sup>+ </sup>and approximately 65% of the eGFP<sup>+ </sup>cells expressed the progenitor markers Sox3 and Nkx6.1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C,D</xref>; data not shown). The remaining 35% of the GFP<sup>+ </sup>cells were Hb9<sup>+ </sup>and Isl1/2<sup>+ </sup>MNs (data not shown), isolated due to the perdurance of eGFP protein in these cells. The majority of sorted Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>progenitors were pMN progenitors (approximately 58%) that expressed the bHLH protein Olig2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G,H,K</xref>). The rest of the progenitors fell into three classes: Irx3<sup>+ </sup>p2 progenitors (approximately 22%), Nkx2.2<sup>+ </sup>p3 progenitors (approximately 15%) and HNF3&#x003b2;<sup>+ </sup>floor plate cells (approximately 5%; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E&#x02013;K</xref>; data not shown). Therefore, the majority of sorted eGFP<sup>+ </sup>cells were precursors (65%), of which pMN progenitors comprised the largest population (37%), followed by p2 (14%), and p3 (10%) progenitors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2K</xref>).

To facilitate this analysis, we plated eGFP<sup>+ </sup>sorted cells at higher density (50 cells/well), because their proliferation and differentiation was not affected by the plating density.

We cultured single progenitors at clonal density and followed them over the course of 8 days in culture (DIV). We then analyzed the transcriptional identity of clones that were born from a single progenitor. Only a fraction (16%) of Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>progenitors (10% of eGFP<sup>+ </sup>cells) divided for more than 8 days in culture to generate clones containing precursor cells and neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A,F</xref>).

We found that most Nkx6.1-patchy clones were generated from a pMN progenitors because the Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>daughter cells within these clones expressed Olig2 (Figure S1A,B in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). We examined the expression of several HD transcription factors characteristic of more dorsal spinal progenitors (e.g. Nkx6.2, Dbx1/2, Pax7) to determine if Nkx6.1-negative daughter cells within Nkx6.1-patchy clones have acquired more dorsal fates. However, none of these factors was expressed in Nkx6.1-negative progenitors (Figure S1C-H in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Therefore, pMN progenitors that lose their ventral identities do not acquire dorsal identities in culture.</p><p>We then examined the identity of neurons present in Nkx6.1 and Olig2-patchy clones. HB9<sup>+ </sup>MNs in these clones represented only a subset (ranging between 5% and 60%) of the total number of Tuj1<sup>+ </sup>neurons (Figure S1I-K in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The Hb9-negative neurons in these clones did not express markers for dorsal neuronal subtypes such as Lmx1b, Lim1/2, Isl1/2 alone or Lhx2/9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] (Figure S1L-N in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>; data not shown). To extend our observations, we dissected ventral spinal cords from <italic>Hb9::eGFP </italic>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], dissociated them into single cells and cultured the resulting progenitors using our previously established conditions so that we could identify in live clones MNs arising from pMN progenitors, by virtue of their neuronal eGFP expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Approximately 60% of proliferating pMN progenitors generated eGFP<sup>+ </sup>MNs only during the first 2&#x02013;3 days <italic>in vitro </italic>(DIV), whereas neurons that were born subsequently were eGFP<sup>- </sup>and did not express markers for dorsal neuronal subtypes such as Lmx1b, Lim1/2, Isl1/2 alone or Lhx2/9 (Figure S1O-Q in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>; data not shown). Therefore, in Nkx6.1 and Olig2-patchy MN clones, the initial progenitor gradually loses its identity as it undergoes cell division and differentiation.</p><p>Next, we analyzed the molecular identity of progenitors and neuronal subtypes within the Nkx6.1-positive clones. These clones were further segregated into three distinct types that expressed either the p3 domain marker Nkx2.2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4N&#x02013;P</xref>), the pMN domain marker Olig2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4K&#x02013;M</xref>) or neither of these markers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H&#x02013;J</xref>) in all progenitors. The third type of clone did not express markers characteristic of more dorsal progenitors such as Nkx6.2, Dbx1/2, or Pax7 (data not shown). We did not find any clones that expressed both Nkx6.1 and Irx3, which is characteristic of the p2 domain (data not shown) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], nor mixed clones where progenitors expressed markers from two ventral domains. We then asked if the molecular identities of neurons present in these three types of Nkx6.1-positive clones correlated with those of neurons born from these three domains in the spinal cord. We found that the p3 domain clones contained exclusively Nkx2.2-expressing Tuj1<sup>+ </sup>neurons, but not Isl1/2<sup>+ </sup>or Hb9<sup>+ </sup>neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G&#x02013;I</xref>). In contrast, clones derived from a pMN progenitor had only Hb9<sup>+ </sup>and Isl1/2<sup>+ </sup>MNs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D&#x02013;F</xref>). The third type of clone, expressing only Nkx6.1 but not Irx3 contained Chx10<sup>+ </sup>neurons, but not Isl1/2<sup>+ </sup>neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A&#x02013;C</xref>) and was, therefore, most similar to a V2a interneuron identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Based on these findings, we presume that the third class is derived from p2 progenitors that have lost expression of Irx3 during proliferation, which does not affect the generation of V2a neurons <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In addition, we did not find neurons with mixed subtype identities in any Nkx6.1-positive clones that we examined during this analysis. Therefore, there is a complete match between progenitor and neuronal subtype identity within the Nkx6.1-positive clones, indicating that they were derived from lineage-restricted progenitors that are present in the three domains that express Nkx6.1. These three different clone types were present at distinct frequencies, with MN clones being the most frequent (approximately 60%), followed by V2 clones (approximately 22%) and V3 clones (approximately 18%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>). These proportions correspond to the initial abundance of each sorted precursor type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2K</xref>). Therefore, based on the molecular characterization of progenitors and neuronal subtypes, as well as the proportion of clones belonging to each lineage, we conclude that lineage-restricted progenitor subtypes are present in each progenitor domain of the Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>region in the spinal cord, although at a lower frequency than expected assuming that progenitors derived from the same domain are homogeneous at the time of isolation.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Clones derived from subtype-restricted ventral progenitors generate appropriate neuronal subtypes <italic>in vitro</italic>.

We decided to test whether the subtype frequency of clones that are derived from sorted Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>ventral progenitors changes when progenitors are isolated at different times. Therefore, we FACS isolated Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>progenitors from either e9.0 trunks, when dorsoventral patterning has just begun but no MNs are formed (Figure S2B,C in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>; data not shown), or from e10.0 trunks, when the majority of MNs are generated (Figure S2E,F in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>; data not shown). Approximately 5.9% of cells from e9.0 trunks expressed eGFP (Figure S2A in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), whereas the proportion of eGFP<sup>+ </sup>cells was approximately 18% from e10.0 trunks (Figure S2D in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). The fraction of sorted eGFP<sup>+ </sup>cells that proliferated in culture was similar between e9.0 (approximately 12%) and e9.5 (approximately 10%), whereas a smaller number of these cells (approximately 5%) generated clones by e10.0 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>), consistent with the <italic>in vivo </italic>timing of ventral neuronal differentiation. Moreover, the frequency of the three clone types that arose <italic>in vitro </italic>also changed over time. The fraction of Nkx6.1-negative clones decreased gradually over time. These clones were present at highest frequency at e9.0 (approximately 48%), whereas by e10.0 they represented the smallest fraction of clones (approximately 12%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). In contrast, the distribution of Nkx6.1-positive clones over time showed the opposite trend. At e9.0 and e9.5 the frequency of these clones was approximately 14% and approximately 13%, respectively, whereas these clones were very abundant by e10.0 (approximately 40%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). Finally, the Nkx6.1-patchy clones were less frequent at e9.0 (approximately 38%) when compared to e9.5 (approximately 59%) or e10.0 (approximately 48%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). These findings indicate that Nkx6.1-negative and Nkx6.1-patchy clones are likely derived from progenitors that are exposed to extracellular signals for a shorter time than progenitors that generate Nkx6.1-positive clones. We have tried to culture sorted Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>progenitors in the presence of various Shh agonist (ShhAg1.3) concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] to determine if all clones would express Nkx6.1 under these conditions. However, Shh induced differentiation of these cells and no clones were generated (DA and IS, unpublished data). These findings suggest that progenitors giving rise to Nkx6.1-positive clones are likely to be independent of Shh with respect to maintaining their ventral identity, whereas those that generate Nkx6.1-patchy and Nkx6.1-negative clones show varying degrees of Shh dependence.</p></sec><sec><title>Lineage-restricted pMN progenitors have limited neurogenic capacity</title><p>We next asked if progenitors from the p2, pMN or p3 domains are able to propagate and generate neurons over extended periods in culture. We counted the number of neurons present at 8 DIV in clones derived from the three different subtypes of lineage-restricted progenitors, in two independent experiments. The number of neurons in each clone was variable but most clones contained between 10 and 80 neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5J</xref>). A small fraction (approximately 15.6%) of MN clones that contained a high number of proliferating precursors had a large number of Hb9<sup>+ </sup>and Isl1/2<sup>+ </sup>neurons (more than 200 neurons). We then determined the timing of neuronal birth from pMN-restricted progenitors by following the formation of MNs at 4, 6, 8 and 12 days, using clones derived from pMN progenitors that had been isolated from <italic>Hb9</italic>::<italic>eGFP </italic>transgenic mice. We compared the number of MNs in these clones at three different DIV. All clones that we followed were relatively small by 4 DIV and contained between 6 and 48 neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5K,L,Q</xref>). After 6 DIV, only a subset of clones (31%) continued to generate MNs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5M,N,Q</xref>) and by 8 days, the fraction of MN-producing clones was further reduced (15.5%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5O&#x02013;Q</xref>). After 12 days in culture, no new MNs were born from the pMN-derived clones, but these clones generated a few O4<sup>+ </sup>oligodendrocytes (Figure S3 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). These observations are similar to those obtained from single cortical neural progenitor cultures <italic>in vitro</italic>, which generate neurons for a limited number of divisions before switching to generate glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition, we were unable to generate MNs from secondary progenitors obtained by passage and expansion of primary MN clones that were first grown for 8 DIV.

To test this possibility, we analyzed the rostrocaudal identities of MNs in lineage-restricted and patchy clones arising from either brachial or thoracic segments of the neural tube at e9.5. Motor neurons that were born from non-proliferating Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>progenitors isolated from either brachial or thoracic regions retained expression of HoxC6 or HoxC9 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A&#x02013;C,M&#x02013;O</xref>), two transcription factors that are normally expressed in MNs born from the brachial or thoracic region, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

Moreover, these clones expressed HoxC9 in neurons regardless of their ability to retain or loose their ventral identities (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G&#x02013;L</xref>). In contrast, pMN-patchy or restricted clones born from <italic>in vitro </italic>expansion of sorted thoracic Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>progenitors maintained expression of the thoracic marker HoxC9 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6P&#x02013;R,V&#x02013;X</xref>) and did not express HoxD10, a marker of lumbar MN identity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6S&#x02013;U</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

We have purified these progenitors by FACS after dorsoventral patterning is established and distinct progenitor domains have emerged, and determined the molecular identity of their clonal progeny after <italic>in vitro </italic>expansion. We demonstrate that subtype-restricted progenitors from all three progenitor domains are present in the spinal cord, although at low frequency. However, these progenitors are not committed to their ventral fates and can adopt alternative fates when exposed to dorsal fate-inducing signals. The low frequency of progenitor-restricted subtypes provides the first evidence for an unanticipated heterogeneity in the developmental potential of progenitors within a transcriptionally defined domain, despite seemingly uniform expression of the characteristic transcription factors at the time of isolation. We discuss these findings with respect to two major issues: lineage restrictions in the spinal cord and the timing of intrinsic cell identity programs within neural progenitors; and pattern formation and implications for the developmental potential of isolated CNS stem cells or progenitors.</p><sec><title>The identification of lineage-restricted progenitor subtypes and their emergence in the spinal cord</title><p>The onset of HD and bHLH protein expression by neural progenitors is a critical step in ventral patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The majority of these proteins function as transcriptional repressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and their mutual cross-repressive interactions are crucial for the establishment of progenitor domains within the neural tube [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Despite a detailed understanding of this process, it is unclear whether patterned spinal progenitors, in particular pMN progenitors, can maintain their regional identity after expansion in culture. This finding has significant implications for developing methods geared towards the production of large numbers of progenitors and MNs required for treating neurodegenerative diseases in the clinic. Moreover, it is not known if pMN progenitors are restricted with respect to the fates that they can acquire. Recent studies have shown that freshly sorted Olig2<sup>+ </sup>progenitors are not restricted when transplanted into the chick neural tube [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. However, only a small fraction of FACS-purified Olig2<sup>+ </sup>progenitors were able to graft in that case, and it is possible, therefore, that some Olig2<sup>+ </sup>cells may in fact be subtype-restricted progenitors.</p><p>Our molecular analysis of clones derived from single sorted Nkx6.1::eGFP cells has revealed the presence of subtype-restricted ventral progenitors from all three populations normally found within the Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>region, namely the p2, pMN and p3 progenitors. We provide the first evidence that only a subset of ventral progenitors that have received positional information can subsequently divide and transmit positional identities to their clonal progeny after <italic>in vitro </italic>expansion. Importantly, these progenitors are not committed to their ventral fate. They can acquire some, although not all, dorsal fates upon exposure to a dorsal fate-inducing signal, thus revealing a restriction in fate acquisition that is consistent with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Interestingly, the pMN-restricted progenitors acquire a uniform rostrocaudal thoracic identity in culture, as revealed by expression of HoxC9, despite their diverse origins from both brachial and thoracic segments. These results are not surprising in light of the established role for FGF signaling in both the expression of Hox genes and the assignment of rostrocaudal identities of MNs within the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Finally, pMN-restricted progenitors have a limited proliferating and neurogenic capacity in culture, and, therefore, their expansion using current methods is not adequate for generating a sufficient number of cells for replacement therapies. CNS endothelial cells are known to secrete factors that stimulate self-renewal and prolong neurogenesis of isolated cortical progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].

All Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>neural progenitors express apparently homogeneous levels at e9.5&#x02013;e10 of the transcription factors characteristic of the three progenitor domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. If these transcription factors are sufficient to confer lineage restrictions, then all progenitors should maintain their identities after <italic>in vitro </italic>expansion. However, we observed a strikingly heterogeneous behavior of Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>progenitors after expansion, independent of when they were isolated. This heterogeneity could result from an asynchrony in cell division cycles among progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], such that some are exposed for a longer time to Shh signaling than others and, as a result, have higher concentrations of intrinsic factors that define their regional identities. We postulate that, when a critical threshold of these factors is achieved within progenitors, cell-intrinsic mechanisms are activated that stably maintain their expression in progenitors, as reflected in the maintenance of progenitor identity <italic>in vitro</italic>. This model suggests that there are heterogenous levels of transcription factors within cycling progenitors from a given domain during development, although to date these have been difficult to substantiate using fluorescent immunohistochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>One prediction from our model is that the Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>progenitors exposed to Shh signaling for the longest time will give rise to Nkx6.1-positive clones when expanded <italic>in vitro</italic>, since the levels of intrinsic factors are above a threshold necessary for maintaining their identities. Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>progenitors that have been exposed for a shorter time, on the other hand, contain levels of intrinsic factors that are below the necessary threshold and will lose their identities when deprived of inductive signals. The latter category most likely gives rise to the Nkx6.1-negative and Nkx6.1-patchy clones observed in culture, and our clonal analysis at three developmental time points supports this model. The fraction of Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>progenitors that generate Nkx6.1-positive clones increases dramatically over the 12-hour period from e9.5 to e10.0, whereas Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>progenitors that cannot maintain their identities are present at decreasing frequencies over this period. We have attempted to culture single Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>progenitors in the presence of Shh, to determine if this would promote the Nkx6.1-positive subtype in the resulting clones. However, Shh induced differentiation of neural progenitors, precluding further analysis (DA and IS, unpublished data). Finally, although we cannot exclude the possibility that autocrine signals secreted by a subset of Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>progenitors reinforce their progenitor identities, Shh is an unlikely candidate for such a signal since it is not secreted by neural progenitors in culture (DA and IS, unpublished observations).</p><p>How can transcription factors regulate the maintenance of neuronal progenitor identity in culture? The majority of class II HD proteins functions in neural progenitors as transcriptional repressors that recruit a general co-repressor to regulate in turn the expression of progenitor HD proteins and subtype determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In addition, various Nkx6 proteins have repressive roles with respect to other progenitor HD proteins or neural subtype determinants during the acquisition of ventral cell fates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Therefore, high levels of Nkx6.1 and Olig2 in some progenitors may enable them to suppress genes that would otherwise block their transcription and the acquisition of ventral fates. One potential target would be repressors that are induced in response to activated FGF signaling in culture and that inhibit the expression of HD and bHLH proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In addition, chromatin modifications that regulate active or repressed states of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] can be transiently lost during cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and may change during progenitor maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. This could also explain the sensitivity of cells during cell division to signals that affect CNS regional patterning <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Neural patterning and the acquisition of identity by isolated CNS stem or progenitor cells</title><p>Studies of embryonic neural pattern formation in the CNS have revealed that the process of neuronal subtype determination begins with regional specification of progenitors within the ventricular zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Progenitors from different regions of the CNS express defined combinations of transcription factors in response to morphogens such as Shh, BMPs, FGFs and Wnts. Genetic studies have revealed essential roles for several transcription factors in cell fate decisions, in both the cortex and spinal cord. With the identification of neural stem cells in the adult brain and successful prospective isolation <italic>in vitro </italic>of embryonic and adult neural progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>], one of the major challenges has been to understand if isolated stem cells and progenitors maintain a cellular memory of their origin, as this may have implications for understanding their developmental potential and therapeutic uses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>].</p><p>Conflicting results have been reported on this issue, with some studies claiming that the majority of neural stem cells or progenitors isolated as early as e14.5 or as late as the adult, from different regions of the CNS, can maintain the expression of region-specific transcription factors when grown <italic>in vitro </italic>as neurospheres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. On the other hand, conservation of gene expression has not been detected in some other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>], and progenitors grown in the presence of mitogens such as FGF2 or Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) can undergo reprogramming and expand their developmental potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>]. One potential mechanism for this plasticity involves chromatin remodeling through repression of histone deacetylases, which expands the developmental potential of isolated progenitors or stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>]. Alternative models have attributed the expansion of developmental potential to the ability of FGF2 to deregulate expression of regionally restricted transcription factors within neural progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>].</p><p>Our findings have important implications for linking regional identity to the amplification of progenitors <italic>in vitro</italic>. First, we observed that the expression of class I transcription factors (for example, Irx3, Pax6) was lost in all clones derived from Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>progenitors in culture, and there was variable expression of class II proteins (Nkx6.1, Nkx2.2 and Olig2) in these clones, although they were derived from single cells that initially expressed these transcription factors. In addition, most forelimb-derived pMN-restricted clones change their Hox expression profile after <italic>in vitro </italic>expansion and acquire rostrocaudal identities characteristics of more posterior (thoracic) MNs. Together, these findings suggest that FGF2 can actively deregulate expression of several transcription factors expressed by neural progenitors, with class I HD proteins being most severely affected, as is also observed in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. This suggests that dorsal progenitors are more likely than ventral progenitors to lose their regional identity when grown in the presence of FGF2. Second, heterogeneity in Nkx6.1 expression within clones derived from Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>cells may explain the discrepancies among several reported attempts to culture specific CNS progenitors. Most clones derived from an Nkx6.1<sup>+ </sup>progenitor lose their ventral identity, even if they are isolated after dorsoventral patterning is established. Furthermore, these clones do not show any restrictions in the acquisition of neuronal fates from other regions of the dorsoventral neuraxis. Finally, the small percentage of lineage-restricted progenitors that we have identified are not committed to their identities, and can change fates upon exposure to dorsally derived signals. These findings may underlie the reprogramming and expansion of developmental potential for isolated CNS progenitors exposed to mitogens such as FGF and EGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have generated a mouse strain that expressed eGFP in ventral progenitors of the spinal cord. We have purified these progenitors by FACS after dorsoventral patterning is established and performed single cell clonal analysis <italic>in vitro</italic>, in order to test if CNS progenitors that have received positional information can maintain their cellular identity after <italic>in vitro </italic>expansion. We demonstrate that subtype-restricted progenitors from three spinal domains (p2, pMN and p3) are present in the spinal cord at a low frequency, and that they can transmit their subtype identities to their progeny. However, these cells are not committed to their fates and can adopt alternative fates when exposed to dorsally derived extracellular signals. The low frequency of progenitor-restricted subtypes provides the first evidence for an unanticipated heterogeneity in the behavior of progenitors within a domain, despite the apparently uniform expression of characteristic transcription factors at the time of isolation, and suggests that prolonged exposure of progenitors to Shh signaling is critical for the establishment of cell fates. Furthermore, most forelimb-derived pMN-restricted clones change their Hox expression profile after <italic>in vitro </italic>expansion and acquire new rostrocaudal identities that are characteristic of more posterior (thoracic) MNs. Together, these findings suggest that neural progenitors have a high degree of plasticity with respect to changing their dorsoventral and rostrocaudal identites after <italic>in vitro </italic>expansion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Generation of <italic>Nkx6.1::IRES::eGFP </italic>mice</title><p>We inserted an <italic>IRES::eGFP::ACN </italic>cassette [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>] immediately after the <italic>Nkx6.1 </italic>stop codon to ensure gene-dependent expression of <italic>eGFP</italic>. We constructed an <italic>Asc</italic>I site in the <italic>Nkx6.1 </italic>3'-genomic fragment by inserting a 43 bp oligomer adapter (5'CGC GTC GGA GGC CGA GGG CTC GTC CTG AGG CGC GCC CCG CGC G3') into the <italic>Mlu</italic>I site located 46 bp upstream of the stop codon, in order to clone the selection cassette (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The targeting vector was electroporated in embryonic stem cells and three recombinant clones were identified by the presence of two fragments: a 15.5 kb recombined fragment and a 12.5 kb wild-type fragment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Two of these recombinant clones were injected into blastocysts to generate chimeric mice. The ACN cassette was self-excised itself during male germ line transmission of the targeted allele, due to induced expression of Cre recombinase from the tACE promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. The <italic>Nkx6.1::IRES::eGFP </italic>knock-in homozygous animals were viable and were genotyped by PCR. The knock-in allele was screened for the presence of eGFP with the primers GFPF1 (5'CCC TGA AGT TCA TCT GCA CCA C3') and GFPR1 (5'TTC TCG TTG GGG TCT TTG CTC 3'), using an amplification protocol (94&#x000b0;C for 1 minute, 60&#x000b0;C for 30 s and 72&#x000b0;C for 1 minute; 30 cycles) to amplify a 500 bp product. The wild-type allele was screened with the primers Nkx6.1F1 (5' CCG ATG ACG AGA AGA TCA C3'), located 100 bp upstream of the stop codon, and Nkx6.1R1 (5'TCC TTT TCT CCT CAT CAG CG3'), located 180 bp downstream of the stop codon, for amplification of a 300 bp product. The following amplification protocol was used: 94&#x000b0;C for 1 minute, 57&#x000b0;C for 90 s and 72&#x000b0;C for 45 s, 30 cycles.

The neural tube with surrounding somites from the brachial and thoracic segments was dissected with a microsurgical knife (Surgical Specialties, Reading, PA, USA) and incubated in papain solution at 37&#x000b0;C for 30&#x02013;35 minutes. The tissue was triturated with a P200 pipette at regular intervals (8&#x02013;10 minutes) to mechanically break down the clumps and allow the enzyme to penetrate. The papain activity was inhibited by addition of culture medium containing 10% albumin-ovomucoid inhibitor.
