The degree of inflammation, tissue injury and lipid peroxidation caused by TNBS was substantially reduced in mice treated with all the doses of crocetin but of all the doses 50 mg/kg/day crocetin dose was most effective. After treatment, the cytokine profile in these mice indicated a switch from proinflammatory TH1 to anti-inflammatory TH2 pattern. Reactive NO radical is known to play a central role in human IBD. Increased production of NO, and the presence of iNOS protein and iNOS mRNA have been demonstrated in affected areas of the gut in patients suffering from UC or Crohn's disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT26">26</xref>] Prolonged production of high amounts of NO by iNOS is proinflammatory and inhibition of iNOS seems to ameliorate the inflammatory response and tissue injury in experimental colitis model. An <italic>in vivo</italic> study by McKenzie <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT27">27</xref>] provides direct evidence on NO-induced injury on gut epithelial cells, supporting the detrimental role of excessive NO in colitis. There is, therefore, good rationale to suggest that inhibition of excessive NO production by iNOS inhibitors will serve as promising approach in the management of IBD. We provide here the in vivo evidence that NO concentrations can be downregulated via suppression of proinflammatory cytokines by crocetin in TNBS-induced colitis, resulting in a significant amelioration of the disease. There is ample evidence in human IBD that the inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and IFN-&#x003b3; are overexpressed and this finding correlates with reports of excessive amounts of NO produced by activated iNOS in lamina propria mononuclear cells and colon epithelial cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT28">28</xref>] This prompted us to investigate whether manipulation of cytokine profile by crocetin would lead to reduced NO activities, and thus decrease mucosal damage. Crocetin treatment led to a marked suppression in IL-12 mRNA expression by mucosal cells of TNBS-administered mice, resulting in a reduced ability to induce IFN-&#x003b3; and perhaps, an increased ability to induce IL-4 in CD4+ T cells.</p><p>These results suggest that crocetin-mediated inhibition of IL-12 production led to the inhibition of TH1 and a possible enhancement of TH2 cytokine synthesis in CD4+ T cells. The mechanism by which crocetin inhibits IL-12 production is through the downregulation of NFkB-mediated activation and binding to the p40-kB site as crocetin can inhibit NFkB activity in electrophoretic mobility shift assay, using nuclear extracts of whole cells of the colonic tissue. NFkB activation is believed to play a major role in the regulation of proinflammatory gene transcription; therefore, suppression of NFkB activation crocetin may inhibit early steps of inflammation and modulate upregulation of multiple proinflammatory genes.</p><p>The curative effect of crocetin accompanied by reduced levels of nitric oxide and malondialdehyde is suggestive of the scavenging capability of both reactive nitrogen and oxygen species by this natural carotenoid. These results are consistent with previous data, indicating that certain carotenoids are capable of lowering the generation of both superoxide and nitric oxide from rat peritoneal macrophages.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT29">29</xref>] All these observations may have relevance on the beneficial effect of oral administration of crocetin in inflammatory disease of the bowel. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the degree of colitis caused by administration of TNBS is significantly attenuated by crocetin. The anti-inflammatory effects of crocetin are associated with a reduction in (i) upregulation of proinflammatory TH1 cytokine response leading to the suppression of iNOS and attenuation of the recruitment of neutrophils, (ii) lipid peroxidation and (iii) ultimately, tissue injury. Being a relatively nontoxic natural product, combined with its excellent anti-inflammatory activity via reducing inflammatory cytokines, iNOS and NF&#x003ba;B downregulation, crocetin could be useful in human IBD as a supplement therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="CIT1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
