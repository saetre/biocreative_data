However, effective screening methods that allow rapid noninvasive phenotyping of transgenic and knockout mice are still lacking. To identify murine models with bone alterations in vivo, we used flat-panel volume computed tomography (fpVCT) for high-resolution 3-D imaging and developed an algorithm with a computational intelligence system. First, we tested the accuracy and reliability of this approach by imaging discoidin domain receptor 2- (DDR2-) deficient mice, which display distinct skull abnormalities as shown by comparative landmark-based analysis. High-contrast fpVCT data of the skull with 200 &#x003bc;m isotropic resolution and 8-s scan time allowed segmentation and computation of significant shape features as well as visualization of morphological differences. The application of a trained artificial neuronal network to these datasets permitted a semi-automatic and highly accurate phenotype classification of DDR2-deficient compared to C57BL/6 wild-type mice. Even heterozygous DDR2 mice with only subtle phenotypic alterations were correctly determined by fpVCT imaging and identified as a new class. In addition, we successfully applied the algorithm to classify knockout mice lacking the DDR1 gene with no apparent skull deformities. Thus, this new method seems to be a potential tool to identify novel mouse phenotypes with skull changes from transgenic and knockout mice on the basis of random mutagenesis as well as from genetic models. However for this purpose, new neuronal networks have to be created and trained. In summary, the combination of fpVCT images with artificial neuronal networks provides a reliable, novel method for rapid, cost-effective, and noninvasive primary screening tool to detect skeletal phenotypes in mice.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Transgenic mice are key models to shed new light on gene function during development and disease. Reliable high-throughput screening tools will facilitate the identification of transgenic mice with distinct phenotypes. In particular, alterations of the skull are difficult to detect by visual inspection due to its very complex morphological structure. Here, we used high-resolution flat-panel volume computed tomography (fpVCT), a novel semi-automatic screening tool to image skull-shape features of mice. The resulting 3-D datasets were combined with artificial neuronal networks and complex nonlinear computational models to permit rapid and automatic interpretation of the images. Compared to the extremely laborious landmark-based analysis, the manual work in our approach was reduced to the control of skull segmentation of images obtained by fpVCT. We applied our approach to genetically altered mice and various mouse strains and showed that it is an accurate and reliable method to successfully identify mice with skeletal phenotypes. We suggest the new methodology will also be a valuable tool for an in vivo, rapid, cost-effective, and reliable primary screen to identify skull abnormalities generated by random mouse mutagenesis experiments.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Dullin C, Missbach-Guentner J, Vogel WF, Grabbe E, Alves F (2007) Semi-automatic classification of skeletal morphology in genetically altered mice using flat-panel volume computed tomography.

This means that a high second-order moment indicates that the mass of parts of the skull is distributed farther from the dedicated axis. Assuming that the mass density is nearly the same between the different skulls, a higher value second-order moment connotes the skull being more expanded perpendicular to that axis. Third-order moments impact the aberration from rotation symmetry perpendicular to the dedicated axis, and fourth-order moments impact the outliers.

Image comparison by visual inspection of C57BL/6 wild-type mice of different sex and age demonstrated minor interindividual differences within the complex skull morphology formed by the cranium and mandible. These minor variations in skull shapes are due to sexual dimorphisms and age dependent ossification. Individual skulls of mice from the control strain differ mainly in relative size and are characterized by the forming of the tympanic bulba, the infraorbital hiatus, and the grade of ossification of the frontal and occipital bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030118-g001">Figure 1</xref>, left panel).</p><p>Representative examples of skull images from the various knockout mice in comparison to controls are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030118-g001">Figure 1</xref>, right panel.

The delineation of the anatomical details of bone structures in mice by fpVCT imaging has been previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030118-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Comparative morphological analysis is typically difficult in the skull and extremely laborious due to its very complex skeletal structure &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030118-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. In our study, large 3-D fpVCT datasets were simplified to skull-shape features on the basis of high-order moments of the whole skull, making phenotyping of mouse models a much simpler, cost-efficient, and semi-automatic process &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030118-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. One of the benefits of this semi-automatic classification method is that the manual work is reduced to the control of the segmentation process of skulls for which anatomical knowledge is not necessary, resulting in a rapid and therefore high-throughput application.</p><p>Since each of the 34 skull-shape features are based on all skull voxels, and therefore the features include all possible skull alterations, the method was found to be very reproducible and reliable for mouse classification. Therefore, in order to analyze novel phenotypes with skull abnormalities the same feature space can consistently be applied. Although, other statistical methods might be appropriate to analyze these complex biological relationships, we have chosen neuronal networks for the classification process because of several advantages of this method. Neuronal networks are able to elucidate nonlinear problems and learn by example, so the details of the complex morphological skull structure on the basis of which the mice classification is made, are not needed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030118-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030118-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, the use of neuronal networks is highly favorable in our study, characterized by poorly conditioned features space and the comparison of mice types, in which the distinct alterations between the different skull phenotypes are not known yet.</p><p>Our results indicate that this computational-intelligence scheme based on 34 skull features is capable of identifying genetically modified mice with skeletal abnormalities observed on the five different trained mouse populations.</p><p>PCA and cluster analysis of these skull features were not able to discriminate between the different knockout mice demonstrating a poorly conditioned feature space and thereby showing that a nonlinear classification is a prerequisite to a correct determination of genetically altered mice models &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030118-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030118-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Here, features implemented in the ANNs were independent of skull sizes and orientations, thus making this method suitable to exclude interindividual variations of skull growth within mice of one group. Although features are related to age, this method is able to successfully discriminate between mice types when using mice older than 50 d. This goes in line with the observation that skull shapes of mice change with growth, but remain nearly constant 15 d postnatal &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030118-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. The high significance of these features is also shown by the fact that even the smallest differences can be automatically detected, such as alterations in skull shapes related to sex. The algorithm was first tested on a cohort of DDR2-deficient mice with a known skeletal phenotype displaying shortage of long bones and a shorter snout &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030118-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. In this study, this phenotyping method enables us to reliably detect DDR2-deficient mice within a cohort consisting of homozygous and heterozygous DDR2 mutants. Even heterozygous DDR2 mice with a subtle phenotype were correctly determined and identified as being different from their wild-type control by this method based on fpVCT imaging.</p><p>So far, no obvious skull abnormalities have been observed in DDR1-deficient mice. A reduced bone calcification has only been described in the fibula &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030118-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the imaging technique in combination with a neuronal artificial network trained only with skull-shape features generated from DDR1-deficient mice, and control mice were successful in discriminating clearly between DDR1-genotypes. With this method DDR1-deficient mice were identified as mice that show, in contrast to C57BL/6 wild-type animals, differences in skull formation. Landmark-based analysis of three distances and the occipital curvatures confirmed the presence of skull abnormalities of DDR2 knockout mice, thereby clearly defining a skeletal phenotype for these mutants. In contrast, DDR1-deficient mice with a subtle phenotype were not significantly altered in these features.</p><p>The screening tool based on skull-shape features is successful in discriminating between mouse strains displaying no overt differences in skull formation, for example distinguishing SCID mice from C57BL/6 wild-type mice. Even five double knockout mice for DDR1 and DDR2 not used in the training process, were identified by our semi-automatic classification method as a superposition of the classes related to the single features of DDR1&#x02212;/&#x02212; and DDR2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice. This suggests that the algorithm discriminates not only between trained mice, but identifies different skull-shape traits.</p><p>The imaging technique, in combination with a more complex neuronal network, was also valuable to reliably discriminate DDR2-deficient mice between five different mouse populations, including SCID mice and DDR1-deficient mice. The challenge of creating a network for all presented mouse genotype-related phenotypes together is to balance the combined feature space of all classes. Therefore, the application of this ANN trained with features out of datasets from DDR2-deficient mice with a marked skeletal defect did not allow discrimination between the heterozygous DDR2-deficient mice, SCID mice, or their controls, which all show similarity in skull bones. However, thereafter they were successfully classified by applying the more specialized neuronal network for the three subtle mouse phenotypes.</p><p>In conclusion, we have introduced a novel semi-automatic screening method for skeletal phenotyping by applying neuronal networks in combination with fpVCT, so far limited to five different mice models. This methodology seems to be a powerful tool for the rapid detection of living mice with skull abnormalities. In the future, this technique is expected to be a standardized, cost-effective, primary screen to identify mice with skeletal differences out of a wide spectrum of genetically altered mice on the basis of random mutagenesis as well as transgenic and knockout mice. For successful identification of novel mutant mice with bone abnormalities, skull-shape features have to be calculated to create and train a novel neuronal network. However, because the introduced features are calculated automatically and include information of every skull voxel, they should easily be implemented to new skull shapes. Even a minor training error will indicate the existence of alteration in skull shapes. The degree of reliance to predict a skull phenotype is directly related to the correspondence of the neuronal network response for a second set of mice to their genotype. Therefore, skull alterations of genetic modified mice in comparison to their control littermates are depicted by correct classification of the mutant mice in a separate class.</p><p>Though successful in predicting the corresponding phenotype of various mouse populations in the primary screen, this methodology is not suitable for defining the exact bone deformation underlying the gene defect. The challenge of the next step will be to characterize the anatomical phenotypes in mice in more detail with stereological parameters by nondestructive visualization of complex skull structures by fpVCT imaging. Comparative analysis of multiple datasets of bone images will then allow to us to identify differences in corresponding anatomical sites between control and mutant groups, which has been demonstrated recently for MR imaging &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030118-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Since the overall shape of the skull depends upon coordinated development of separate bony, dental, and cartilaginous elements and functioning of soft tissue components, the identification of knockout mice with skull abnormalities and their characterization will help to further understand the role of major genes that are involved in the cascade of developmental processes necessary for the proper development of a functioning skull.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0030118-sd001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><title>C&#x0002b;&#x0002b; Implementation of Transformation and Feature Generation Part</title><p>(6 KB TXT)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.0030118.sd001.txt" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to R&#x000fc;diger Klein for providing the DDR2-deficient mice.
