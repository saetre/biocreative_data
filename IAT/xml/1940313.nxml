Recently, we reported that CD83 also has a function on B cells: Ubiquitous transgenic (Tg) expression of CD83 interfered with the immunoglobulin (Ig) response to infectious agents and to T cell dependent as well as T cell independent model antigen immunization. Here we compare the function of CD83Tg B cells that overexpress CD83 and CD83 mutant (CD83mu) B cells that display a drastically reduced CD83 expression. Correlating with CD83 expression, the basic as well as the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced expression of the activation markers CD86 and MHC-II are significantly increased in CD83Tg B cells and reciprocally decreased in CD83mu B cells. Wild-type B cells rapidly upregulate CD83 within three hours post BCR or TLR engagement by de novo protein synthesis. The forced premature overexpression of CD83 on the CD83Tg B cells results in reduced calcium signaling, reduced Ig secretion and a reciprocally increased IL-10 production upon <italic>in vitro</italic> activation. This altered phenotype is mediated by CD83 expressed on the B cells themselves, since it is observed in the absence of accessory cells. In line with this finding, purified CD83mu B cells displayed a reduced IL-10 production and slightly increased Ig secretion upon LPS stimulation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that CD83 is expressed by B cells upon activation and contributes to the regulation of B cell function.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>CD83 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, a member of the Ig superfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Zhou1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Kozlow1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and was initially described as a highly specific marker for activated human dendritic cells (DC) in the peripheral blood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Zhou2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Zhou3">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Premature transgenic overexpression of CD83 on B cells at the beginning of stimulation resulted in reduced calcium signaling as well as reduced Ig secretion and reciprocally increased IL-10 production.

Therefore our data strongly suggest that CD83, expressed on activated B cells, plays a central role in the modulation of B cell function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mice and antibodies</title><p>All mouse strains employed were bred in the animal facilities of the Bernhard-Nocht-Institute for tropical medicine or in the university hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany) which are registered by the Federal Health Authorities of the State of Hamburg.

In line with these findings human CD83 transcription was shown to be regulated by NF&#x003ba;b <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-McKinsey1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Berchtold2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, a transcription factor that is induced as a consequence of either TLR or BCR signaling. We argue that the CD83 positive B cell population represents activated B cells within the spleen cell culture, since we did not detect B cells expressing the early activation marker CD69 without being also positive for CD83 within the first 12 hours of stimulation. Surface expression of CD83 on human DC was shown to be mediated by membrane translocation of the protein from intracellular stores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Cao1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> as well as by accumulation of an otherwise recirculating CD83 pool on the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Klein1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless and despite the rapid kinetics of upregulation we did not detect significant intracellular CD83 protein stores in resting murine B cells, arguing in favor of a de novo CD83 protein synthesis in activated murine B cells. Concurring with our results CD83 upregulation by maturing human DC was shown to be also mediated by de novo protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Prechtel1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In line with the defective humoral response and intact T cell response observed in CD83Tg mice <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Breloer1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> transgenic expression of CD83 resulted in a significant reduction of Ig secretion <italic>in vitro</italic> while the T cell proliferation was normal. Furthermore, as shown <italic>in vivo</italic>, the reduced Ig secretion of CD83Tg B cells <italic>in vitro</italic> was mediated by CD83 expression on the B cells themselves and not by accessory CD83Tg cells. Analyzing early signal transduction events we show that already the peak calcium signal after BCR ligation was significantly reduced in purified CD83Tg B cells. Again, this did not reflect a generalized defect in cellular calcium handling since TCR engagement induced comparable Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signaling in purified CD83Tg and wild-type T cells.</p><p>Strikingly, overexpression of CD83 did not result in an overall impaired function of CD83Tg B cell <italic>in vitro</italic> but induced a qualitative change in the phenotype of activated B cells: purified CD83Tg B cells were characterized by a significantly and reproducibly increased IL-10 production upon LPS stimulation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Although most of the pleiotropic functions IL-10 exhibits are anti-inflammatory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Moore1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Pestka1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> IL-10 is regarded as a growth and differentiation factor for B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Arpin1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Burdin1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. We consider it unlikely that the increased amount of IL-10 present in the CD83Tg B cell cultures caused the phenotype observed <italic>in vitro,</italic> since neutralization of IL-10 did not affect Ig secretion by IgHEL Tg B cells. Furthermore, the reduced calcium signaling observed in CD83Tg B cells takes place within seconds after BCR engagement i.e. well before the increased IL-10 concentration could affect B cell function. Therefore our data suggest that the increased IL-10 secretion observed in CD83Tg B cells is one feature but not the mediator of their altered phenotype. Future investigation will analyze a possible impact of increased IL-10 production by CD83Tg B cells <italic>in vivo,</italic> especially if CD83Tg B cells share features with IL-10 producing regulatory B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Lund1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Serra1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> that have been described to be beneficial in various autoimmune disease models such as the recovery from EAE in resistant B6 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Fillatreau1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Reporting a defective Ig response of CD83Tg B cells <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Breloer1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> we suggested that CD83 might represent an additional regulatory receptor such as CD22 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Nitschke1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> and CD72 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Pan1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> that is upregulated upon B cell activation and contributes to the regulatory mechanisms that prevent overstimulation of the B cell population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Nitschke2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. The interference of premature CD83 expression with early signal transduction events upon BCR engagement as well as the decreased Ig secretion and increased IL-10 secretion of CD83Tg B cells <italic>in vitro,</italic> that we describe within this study, strongly support our hypothesis. The fact that CD83<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice did not display an increased Ig response to DNP-KLH <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Fujimoto1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> as could be expected from mice lacking a putative negative B cell regulator does not contradict our hypothesis, since it can be explained by the reduced amount of CD4-positive T cells in these mice, as the Ig response to DNP-KLH depends on T cell help. We are currently analyzing <italic>in vivo</italic> B cell responses of CD83mu B cells in wild-type/CD83mu bone marrow chimeras that display a normal T cell population due to T cell maturation on wild-type thymic epithelium.</p><p>B cells derived from CD83<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice however, were also reported to display reduced MHC-II and CD86 upregulation upon <italic>in vitro</italic> activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Fujimoto1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings apparently contradict our hypothesis, since here CD83<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B cells themselves seem to display an impaired rather than an activated phenotype. Analyzing LPS activated CD83mu B cells we, within this study, reproduced the impaired MHC-II and CD86 expression shown for CD83<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B cells. Interestingly our results clearly show that decreased activation marker expression on CD83mu B cells was not correlated to impaired B cell function since proliferation was normal and Ig secretion by LPS activated purified CD83mu B cells was even slightly increased. We also demonstrate that an increase in CD83 expression was connected to an increased expression of MHC-II and CD86 on CD83Tg B cells that again was not correlated to an increased activation state at least with respect to proliferation and Ig secretion. Finally, expression of all other activation markers and costimulatory receptors investigated was unchanged in CD83mu and CD83Tg B cells. Therefore, we argue that the altered CD86 and MHC-II surface expression observed in CD83mu and CD83Tg as well as CD83<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B cells does not reflect their activation state.</p><p>We recognize that although increased CD83 expression led to a clearly reduced Ig and increased IL-10 secretion by CD83Tg spleen cells and purified B cells, reduced CD83 expression in purified CD83mu B cells only induced a slight increase in Ig and decrease in IL-10 secretion respectively. This &#x0201c;weaker&#x0201d; phenotype may either reflect the redundancy of negative regulation in B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Nitschke2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> but could also be due to the low residual CD83 expression by the CD83mu B cells employed. Analysis of CD83<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B cells that are completely devoid of CD83 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Fujimoto1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, would answer this question.</p><p>Furthermore, employing non-conditional transgenic and mutant models we cannot rule out the possibility that artificial CD83 overexpression or deficiency on pro- and pre-B cells or stromal cells during B cell maturation within the CD83Tg and CD83mu mice results in the generation of dysfunctional B cells. While the bone marrow resident pre B cell compartment appears to be normal in CD83Tg and CD83mu mice (L&#x000fc;thje et al., manuscript in preparation) the increased proportion of transitional B cells within CD83Tg spleens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Breloer1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> indeed suggest interference with final B cell maturation that may contribute to the phenotype. Since the maturation of B cells also depends on intact BCR signaling, this partial arrest in maturation of CD83 overexpressing B cells may again reflect a possible CD83 mediated regulation.</p><p>Taken together the combined findings presented within this manuscript that CD83Tg B cells displayed reduced Ig and increased IL-10 secretion whereas CD83mu B cells that express diminished amounts of CD83 displayed a slightly increased Ig and a decreased IL-10 production further suggests that B cell response is modulated by CD83 expression on B cells. Regarding the mechanism by which CD83 may modulate B cell function, a direct negative regulation through recruitment of Src-homology domain 2 containing proteins is not possible since CD83 lacks an ITIM motif in its predicted intracellular tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Zhou1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Twist1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless it is conceivable that CD83 is involved in modulation of BCR signaling through association with other signaling receptors as in the CD14/TLR4 system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000755-Poltorak1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively our data do not exclude the possibility that the interference with BCR activation is not transduced by CD83 but by a putative CD83 ligand on B cells that is engaged by overexpressed transgenic CD83. The identification of CD83 associated molecules and putative CD83 ligands will contribute to the elucidation of CD83 mediated regulation of B cell activation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are indebted to Prof. Dr. Fred Ramsdell for providing the CD83mu mice and Prof. Dr. Christian Kurts for providing the IgHELTg mice.
