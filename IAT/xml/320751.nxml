The complete DNA sequences of these clones have been determined and are presented. These new sequences are compared with other H3 and H4 DNA sequences both in the coding and 3' noncoding regions. We find that there is considerable non-random codon usage in ten H4 genes. In addition there are some sequence similarities in the 3' noncoding regions of H3 and H4 genes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00381-0179.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3769"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00381-0180.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3770"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00381-0181.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3771"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00381-0182.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3772"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00381-0183.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3773"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00381-0184.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3774"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00381-0185.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3775"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00381-0186.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3776"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00381-0187.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3777"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00381-0188.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3778"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00381-0189.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3779"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00381-0190.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3780"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
