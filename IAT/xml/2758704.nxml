The numerous HPV genotypes are subdivided into &#x0201c;low-risk&#x0201d; HPVs, which cause benign neo-formations, and &#x0201c;high-risk&#x0201d; HPVs, which cause lesions with a predisposition to carcinogenic transformation. High-risk HPVs are associated with ano-genital carcinomas (principally cancers of the uterine cervix) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007254-zurHausen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007254-Munger1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007254-DSouza1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, and cutaneous malignancies (non-melanoma skin cancers) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007254-Pfister1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In particular, HPV-16 and HPV-18 are the causative agents of at least 90&#x00025; of cervical cancers and are linked to more than 50&#x00025; of other ano-genital cancers. In a vast majority of these tumors, which are usually diagnosed several years after HPV infection, a physical integration of the viral genome into cancer cell chromosomes is observed. Such integration often partially disrupts the HPV genome, but the E6 and E7 viral genes are usually retained and constitutively expressed by the host cell. This suggests key roles for their respective gene products, the E6 and E7 oncoproteins, in inducing malignant transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007254-Munger1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007254-Whiteside1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007254-McLaughlinDrubin1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. These viral proteins act as multifaceted devices that re-program host cell functions at multiple levels, weakening the normally tight links between cellular differentiation and proliferation. In spite of being only 98 amino acids in length, the E7 protein of HPV-16 contains many features that have evolved to assist viral replication in the host cell. The expression of these oncoproteins favors the rise of and selection for clones with a high frequency of transformation. The most well understood and probably crucial role of HPV-16 E7 is its ability to neutralize the function of the RB family of tumor and growth suppressor proteins. In addition, several other HPV-16 E7 functions that can act synergistically to favor HPV replication in host cells have been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007254-Munger2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007254-Felsani1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The central role of HPV-16 E7 in human oncogenesis prompted us to search for novel cellular targets of this viral oncoprotein. We screened for the host cell proteins that interact with recombinant HPV-16 E7 (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot accession number P03129) by fishing with a tagged HPV-16 E7 construct, with subsequent identification by mass spectrometry. Using this approach, we identified glutathione S-transferase P1-1 (GSTP1; UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot accession number P09211) as the preeminent cellular partner of HPV-16 E7. Glutathione S-transferases (GST) are a family of homodimeric enzymes that play a pivotal role in cell detoxification by catalyzing the conjugation of many endogenous and exogenous hydrophobic electrophiles (such as xenobiotics) with reduced glutathione, thus neutralizing their effects within the cellular environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007254-Hayes1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Remarkably, GSTP1 also possesses a regulatory function: in form of reduced monomer, it interacts with the C-terminus of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and negatively regulates the ability of JNK to phosphorylate the Jun protein. In this way, JNK-mediated signal transduction, which can lead to apoptosis, is down-regulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007254-Adler1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007254-Wang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

The best HPV-16 E7 CR3/GSTP1 interaction model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007254-g003">Figure 3A</xref>. Interestingly, the strongly interacting peptide 49&#x02013;60 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007254-g002">Figure 2</xref>) corresponds to a portion of HPV-16 E7 that dwells nicely in a groove in the GSTP1 protein in our modeled complex (see below <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007254-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). This intermolecular interaction does not appear to be mediated by disulfide formation involving cysteines from the oligopeptide and GSTP1. The docking also suggests that the interaction with HPV-16 E7 involves the same GSTP1 surface region that participates in homodimerization with a second GSTP1 molecule, as seen in the native enzyme homodimer in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) structure 1AQW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007254-g003">Figures 3B and 3C</xref>).

In fact, the addition of excess reduced glutathione (GSH) (up to a 10-fold molar ratio between GSH and GSTP1) did not modify the amount of GSTP1 bound to the HPV-16 E7-derived oligopeptides (data not shown).

Interestingly, we also noticed that three hydrophobic amino acids are also present in other of the most aggressive HPV strains (18, 31, 33, 45 and 59) at positions corresponding to the residues Val 55, Phe 57 and Met 84 of HPV-16 E7, while the hydrophobic character of the same amino acid sites is poorly conserved across all HPV strains. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007254-g004">Figure 4A</xref> shows how the two strong interacting peptides found by means of the PepSets&#x02122; technique are positioned in the structure of the docked HPV-16 E7-GSTP1 complex.

In this setting, HPV-16 E7 Mut expression was only able to partially protect HaCaT cells from death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007254-g007">Figure 7B, bars 1 and 5</xref>), and this effect was drastically reduced in GSTP1-silenced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007254-g007">Figure 7C, bars 5 and 6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In HaCaT cells expressing either wild-type or mutant HPV-16 E7, it is possible to trace oxidative events, which are highlighted by an increase in lipid peroxidation. However, the increase of GSH content and of SOD, catalase, and GSH-Px activities demonstrates an active response from these cells to oxidative injuries. These results are confirmed by those from other studies in HPV-16 E7-transfected HaCaT cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007254-Shim1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> or HPV-16-infected keratinocytes, where viral oncoproteins expression is associated with increased resistance to UV radiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007254-Mouret1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. GSTP1 total protein level and its catalytic activity in HaCaT cells were not influenced by either the expression of HPV-16 E7 (a result in accord with other laboratories) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007254-Chen1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, or the expression of HPV-16 E7 Mut, a mutant form of the oncoprotein engineered to reduce its binding to GSTP1. In agreement with previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007254-Magal1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, the changes induced by expression of the viral oncoprotein appear associated with enhanced HaCaT cell survival after UV exposure.</p><p>In this scenario, the direct link observed between the HPV-16 E7 viral factor and the GSTP1 protein confers a pivotal role to this physical interaction in enacting the survival capabilities modulated by GSTP1. GSTP1 acts as an intrinsic negative regulator of apoptosis essentially through its inhibition of JNK signaling, and we envision a mechanism by which GSTP1 is activated via physical interaction with HPV-16 E7. Indeed, we have shown that HPV-16 E7 strongly decreases the levels of oxidized GSTP1, thus increasing the level of the reduced form, which interferes with JNK signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007254-Adler1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, the concomitant up-regulation of GSH levels in HPV-16 E7-infected cells might act synergistically to increase the concentration of reduced GSTP1.</p><p>Multimerization of GSTP1 through intermolecular disulfide formation, which occurs under oxidizing conditions, is associated with enzyme inactivation. Cys 47 is the residue with the highest reactivity towards thiol-specific reagents, and its covalent modification is accompanied by a loss of GST activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007254-LoBello1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. GSTP1 is also inactivated when Cys 47 forms an intramolecular disulfide bond with Cys 101 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007254-Ricci1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. On the basis of these observations, and as suggested by our model in which HPV-16 E7 occupies the space between Cys 47 and Cys 101 of GSTP1 and prevents both intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide formation, we propose that HPV-16 E7 binding might protect GSTP1 against inactivation via oxidative attacks at Cys 47 and/or Cys 101. According to our model, the binding of HPV-16 E7 to GSTP1 and GSTP1 homodimerization should be mutually exclusive, because these two different complexes involve mostly overlapping regions of the enzyme surface. Although we lack experimental evidence that allows us to state whether GSTP1 retains GST activity when bound by HPV-16 E7, it is remarkable how closely the conformation of this complex emulates the pattern of intermolecular contacts in the GSTP1 homodimer. We hypothesize that the role of HPV-16 E7 is to establish a subset of GSTP1 molecules that is inaccessible to oxidative attack, thus creating a reservoir of reduced monomeric GSTP1. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">results</xref> obtained from the expression in the HaCaT model system of a HPV-16 E7 mutant that binds GSTP1 less efficiently. Indeed, the mutant molecule we engineered, HPV-16 E7 Mut, while unable to bind 6-His-GSTP1 <italic>in vitro</italic> as a recombinant protein, displayed a certain residual effectiveness <italic>in vivo</italic> in binding native GSTP1, in safeguarding it from oxidation and in protecting the cells from UV-induced cell death. It is noteworthy that the peculiar perturbation we generated in the HPV-16 E7 mutant molecule by amino acid substitutions in the CR3 region did not appreciably affect binding with pRb, which interacts with HPV-16 E7 mostly via the CR2 region, though involvement of the C-terminal region has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007254-Felsani1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007254-Patrick1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">results</xref> we obtained in the GSTP1-deficient MCF-7 cell line further support the active role of GSTP1 in HPV-16 E7-related survival, where HPV-16 E7 expression did not protect MCF-7 cells from UV radiation-induced damage, unless GSTP1 was forcibly co-expressed in this model system. The central role of GSTP1 in mediating the pro-survival effects of HPV-16 E7 expression in HaCaT cells is also clearly outlined by the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">results</xref> obtained from silencing GSTP1 expression via siRNA, while the role of the physical interaction between these two factors is indicated by the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">results</xref> generated from the expression of the mutant form of the oncoprotein. Indeed, the survival of HPV-16 E7-expressing HaCaT cells after UV irradiation was significantly decreased when GSTP1 protein levels were reduced by RNAi.
