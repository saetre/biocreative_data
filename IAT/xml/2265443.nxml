The DNA damage checkpoint detects DNA damage, initiates protein kinase cascades, and inhibits the cell cycle. The SAC relies on kinetochore-dependent assembly of protein complexes to inhibit mitosis when chromosomes are detached from the spindle. The two checkpoints are thought to function independently. Here we show that yeast cells lacking the DNA damage checkpoint arrest prior to anaphase in response to low doses of the DNA damaging agent methyl methane sulfonate (MMS). The arrest requires the SAC proteins Mad1, Mad2, Mad3, Bub1, and Bub3 and works through Cdc20 and Pds1 but unlike the normal SAC, does not require a functional kinetochore. Mec1 (ATR) and Tel1 (ATM) are also required, independently of Chk1 and Rad53, suggesting that Mec1 and Tel1 inhibit anaphase in response to DNA damage by utilizing SAC proteins. Our results demonstrate cross-talk between the two checkpoints and suggest that assembling inhibitory complexes of SAC proteins at unattached kinetochores is not obligatory for their inhibitory activity. Furthermore, our results suggest that there are novel, important targets of ATM and ATR for cell cycle regulation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Genome integrity is assured, in part, by regulatory systems called &#x0201c;checkpoints&#x0201d; that assure that cells do not improperly progress through the cell cycle. The DNA damage checkpoint assesses the status of DNA replication and inhibits cell cycle progression when the cell makes mistakes in DNA replication or when the cell has been assaulted by a DNA damaging agent from the environment. The checkpoint allows the cell time to repair the DNA and then permits the cell cycle to resume. There is a separate &#x0201c;spindle checkpoint&#x0201d; that monitors whether chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle and if so, allows cells to proceed through mitosis. The DNA damage checkpoint and the spindle checkpoint assure that daughter cells receive the correct number of chromosomes that are identical in DNA sequence. Here we show that the two checkpoints are not independent but that they cooperate to restrict mitotic progression in the face of DNA damage. We show that the spindle checkpoint can be induced by DNA damage and that there is a novel kinetochore independent mechanism to activate the spindle checkpoint proteins. In addition, we implicate the ATM and ATR kinases as kinetochore-independent activators of the spindle checkpoint.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Two evolutionarily conserved checkpoints, the DNA damage checkpoint and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), control the fidelity of chromosome segregation.

The DNA damage checkpoint is a signal transduction network consisting of sensors, signal transducers and downstream effectors. Central to the signal transduction network in budding yeast are two phosphotidylinositol 3&#x02019; kinase-like kinases (PIKKs), Mec1 (the yeast homolog of ATM and Rad3-related protein, abbreviated ATR) and Tel1 (the yeast homolog of the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated protein abbreviated ATM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000015-Zhou1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000015-Nyberg1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000015-Kastan1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

The kinetochore has an integral role in the SAC and a popular model is that the kinetochore initiates checkpoint signaling by being the site of assembly of inhibitory complexes of SAC proteins that inhibit mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000015-Lew1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000015-May1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

The two checkpoints share a common target to regulate mitosis. Pds1 (securin in higher organisms) is an anaphase inhibitor that is stabilized by two different mechanisms when the two checkpoints are activated. Pds1 is phosphorylated and thereby stabilized by the DNA damage checkpoint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000015-Wang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Models to explain why such diverse mutants and treatments cause a SAC-dependent mitotic delay propose that kinetochores may be damaged or poorly assembled due to aberrant centromere DNA replication or defects in sister chromatid cohesion may result in a loss of tension across sister kinetochores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000015-Sugimoto1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000015-Garcia1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

We show that cells arrest prior to anaphase when grown in the presence of MMS and that the arrest requires the SAC proteins Mad1, Mad2, Mad3, Bub1 and Bub3. Surprisingly, temperature-sensitive <italic>ndc10-1</italic> cells that are devoid of kinetochores also arrest in response to MMS suggesting that the kinetochore is not required to convert the SAC proteins into inhibitors under these conditions. We show that the downstream effectors of the SAC (Cdc20 and Pds1) are required for the arrest suggesting that the inhibition by the checkpoint proteins works through the canonical SAC. Furthermore, we show that the SAC is capable of restraining anaphase in response to MMS in cells lacking the DNA damage checkpoint and that the yeast homologs of ATM (Tel1) and ATR (Mec1) are required for the SAC-dependent arrest suggesting that the PIKKs are required to activate both the DNA damage checkpoint and the SAC. These studies reveal an intimate relationship between the DNA damage and SAC pathways and highlight the importance of preventing anaphase in cells with damaged chromosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><p>We applied several different assays to measure the mitotic delay in cells treated with MMS.

The single mutants lacking either Mec1 or Tel1 may retain sufficient PIKK activity to activate the downstream effector kinases Rad53 and Chk1 and contribute to the pre-anaphase G2/M delay. Perhaps cells lacking both Mec1 and Tel1 do not activate Rad53 and Chk1 and in their absence the SAC is unable to restrain anaphase. This is an important distinction because it would affect the interpretation that the SAC is activated in a Mec1 and Tel1-dependent fashion. The <italic>MEC1</italic> gene is essential and <italic>mec1-1</italic> cells are viable in the presence of a second mutation, <italic>sml1</italic>, that suppresses the <italic>mec1-1</italic> lethality but does not suppress the DNA damage checkpoint phenotype. We used the same assay as described above for <italic>bub3, pds1</italic> and <italic>mec1 tel1</italic> cells to determine if there was a an effect of MMS on mitotic progression in a set of isogenic strains lacking Sml1 and proteins of the DNA damage checkpoint and the SAC. The <italic>sml1</italic> cells, treated with MMS, behaved like wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000015-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and arrested in mitosis prior to anaphase in contrast to the <italic>mec1 tel1 sml1</italic> cells described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000015-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). <italic>rad9 mrc1 sml1</italic> cells that lack the S-phase checkpoint delayed prior to anaphase when grown in the presence of MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000015-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). <italic>rad53 chk1sml1</italic> cells also delayed prior to anaphase when grown in the presence of MMS although a small percentage of cells entered into anaphase.

Therefore a partially activated DNA damage checkpoint is not sufficient to explain the entire pre-anaphase delay in MMS treated <italic>rad9 rad24</italic> cells. We conclude that the SAC is sufficient to delay anaphase in the absence of the DNA damage checkpoint and that the SAC is activated in a Mec1 and Tel1 dependent fashion.

Our data extend these previous studies in two important ways. We have shown that the SAC inhibits APC<sup>Cdc20</sup> when cells are grown in the presence of MMS and SAC-dependent inhibition does not require a functional kinetochore. In addition, we have shown that the SAC depends on the PIKKs Mec1 and Tel1. Our data are summarized in a model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000015-g004">Figure 4</xref>. Tel1 and Mec1, in response to MMS (and other mutations and treatments), activate both the DNA damage checkpoint and the SAC. The DNA damage checkpoint and the SAC converge on Pds1, by independent mechanisms, to restrain anaphase. One possible reason is that the DNA damage checkpoint recruits the SAC as a backup to assure that cells do not enter anaphase. MMS treatment causes stalled replication forks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000015-Lambert1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.

This threshold assures that the DNA damage checkpoint does not interfere with normal replication. A cell that enters into mitosis with stalled replication forks, below the threshold, could initiate a catastrophic mitosis. If cells arrest because of some threshold of stalled replication forks, then this would constitute a new checkpoint for the completion of DNA replication.

(C) Pds1-13 Myc stability of <italic>CDC20-127</italic> and <italic>CDC20-127 rad9 rad24</italic> cells. Endogenous Pds1 was tagged with 13 copies of the Myc epitope. Upper half was in the absence of MMS and lower half was in the presence of MMS. Western blots with anti-Tub2 (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-tubulin) were for loading control. (D) Budding was determined by phase contract microcopy and nuclear division was assayed using Sytox green staining and detected by epi-fluorescence microscopy.</p><p>(9.22 MB EPS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000015.s005.eps" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="postscript"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000015.s006"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study.</p><p>(0.05 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000015.s006.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Ted Weinert, Jasper Rine, Steve Elledge and Maria Longhese for providing strains and Frank Solomon for providing the anti-Tub2 antibody.
