CDK9 is maintained in dephosphorylated state by TFIIH and undergo phosphorylation upon the dissociation of TFIIH. Thus, dephosphorylation of CDK9 prior to its association with HIV-1 preinitiation complex might be important for HIV-1 transcription.

In cultured cells, low concentration of okadaic acid, inhibitory for PP2A, only mildly inhibited Tat-induced HIV-1 transcription.

In cell-free transcription assays Tat exclusively induces elongation of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In contrast, Tat induces initiation of transcription from the integrated HIV-1 promoter in the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In an early study by Jeang and Berkhout, self-cleaving ribozymes introduced into TAR RNA inhibited Tat transactivation when TAR RNA was cleaved quickly, but not when the cleavage was delayed, indicating that the initial contact between Tat and TAR RNA rather than RNAPII pausing was the rate limiting step in Tat transactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Recently Green and coworkers showed that Tat stimulates formation of transcription complex containing TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) but not TBP-associated factors (TAFs), thus indicating that Tat may enhance initiation of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This latter finding apparently agrees with the early observation by Kashanchi and colleagues that Tat binds directly to the TBP-containing basal transcription factor TFIID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Tat activates HIV-1 transcription by recruiting transcriptional co-activators that include Positive Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb), containing CDK9/cyclin T1, an RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and histone acetyl transferases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Whereas P-TEFb induces HIV-1 transcription from non-integrated HIV-1 template [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], histone acetyl transferases allow induction of integrated HIV-1 provirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Cyclin T1 interacts with the loop of TAR RNA and with Tat through a critically conserved cysteine; the mutation of which in rodent cells renders Tat transactivation inefficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. <italic>In vitro </italic>association of P-TEFb with Tat and TAR RNA is enhanced when CDK9 is autophosphorylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We previously showed that <italic>in vitro</italic>, unphosphorylated CDK9 associates with the preinitiation complex and its phosphorylation is directly inhibited by TFIIH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Upon dissociation of TFIIH during elongation of transcription, CDK9 undergoes phosphorylation that is induced by Tat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus, it appears that CDK9 might need to be dephosphorylated prior to its association with the transcription initiation complex. Previously, two serine-threonine phosphatases, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and protein phosphates-1 (PP1) were implicated in the regulation of HIV-1 transcription. PP2A and PP1 are a general phosphatases that belong to the PPP-family of protein phosphatases with predominant nuclear localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Nuclear PP2A and PP1 consist of a constant catalytic subunit and a variable regulatory subunits that determines the localization, activity and substrate-specificity of the phosphatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) positively regulates HIV-1 transcription as deregulation of cellular enzymatic activity of PP2A inhibited Tat-induced HIV-1 transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Expression of the catalytic subunit of PP2A enhanced activation of HIV-1 promoter by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), whereas inhibition of PP2A by okadaic acid and by fostriecin prevented activation of HIV-1 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. One of the major nuclear subunits of PP1 is Nuclear Inhibitor of PP1 (NIPP1) that binds to the catalytic subunit of PP1 and form an inactive holoenzyme complex which can be activated by phosphorylation of NIPP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. By using NIPP1 to inhibit nuclear PP1, we have demonstrated that protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) is a positive regulator of HIV-1 transcription <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We hypothesized that positive effect on HIV-1 transcription observed by either PP1 or PP2A could be a result of dephosphorylation of CDK9, which would increase the amount of active P-TEFb available for recruitment to the HIV-1 promoter. In the present paper we performed a comparative analysis of CDK9 dephosphorylation by PP1 and PP2A <italic>in vitro</italic>. Autophosphorylated CDK9/cyclin T1 was subjected to dephosphorylation by PP2A and PP1. Also we analyzed the effect of dephosphorylation of CDK9 by PP2A or PP1 on the complex formation between Tat, TAR RNA and CDK9/cyclin T1. Analysis of the effect of PP2A inhibition on HIV-1 transcription <italic>in vitro </italic>was carried out using okadaic acid, which inhibits PP2A at low concentration. To inhibit PP1 in HIV-1 transcription <italic>in vitro</italic>, we used recombinant NIPP1 protein. In cultured cell, okadaic acid was used to induce phosphorylation of CDK9, and the cells stably expressing central domain of NIPP1 were used to determine whether the okadaic acid induced phosphorylation was a PP1-dependent effect. Finally, we analyzed phosphorylation of CDK9 with mutations in the Thr 186 or with mutations in Ser-329, Thr-330, Thr-333, Ser-334, Ser-347, Thr-350, Ser-353, and Thr-354 residues involved in autophosphorylation of CDK9. Our results indicate that while PP2A dephosphorylates CDK9 <italic>in vitro </italic>and it is PP1 that dephosphorylates CDK9 <italic>in vivo</italic>, and thus might have a regulatory role in HIV-1 transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>PP2A dephosphorylates CDK9 in vitro</title><p>We explored whether PP2A or PP1 dephosphorylates CDK9 <italic>in vitro</italic>.

We explore here whether CDK9 might be already in the phosphorylated state in our preparation of the recombinant P-TEFb. We asked whether dephosphorylation by either PP2A or PP1 of CDK9/cyclin T1 would enhance phosphorylation of CDK9 in the following kinase reaction. Recombinant CDK9/cyclin T1 was incubated with increasing concentrations of PP1 or PP2A followed by inhibition of the phosphatases with 1 &#x003bc;M okadaic acid. Then the autophosphorylation reaction was carried out in the presence of &#x003b3;-(<sup>32</sup>P)-ATP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).

An HIV-1 LTR template that contains 308 nucleotides downstream of the transcription start was prepared by PCR using HIV-1 LTR-LacZ expression vector (see Methods). Purified Tat stimulated transcription on this template in the HeLa nuclear extract to approximately 5-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).

We used okadaic acid which selectively inhibits PP2A <italic>in vitro </italic>at concentrations below 1 nM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) but which would inhibit both PP1 and PP2A at higher concentrations. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with Tat-expressing vector and HIV-1 LTR-LacZ (JK2) and expression of &#x003b2;-galactosidase was analyzed using quantitative ONPG-based assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In these cells Tat potently stimulate transcription from HIV-1 LTR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2). Treatment of the transfected COS-7 cells with okadaic acid resulted in partial (about 30%) inhibition of Tat-induced transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The IC<sub>50 </sub>of the okadaic acid-mediated inhibition was 4 nM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Surprisingly, okadaic acid had no inhibitory effect on HIV-1 basal transcription from a mutant HIV-1 LTR with a deletion of the fragment encoding TAR RNA (HIV-1 LTR&#x00394;TAR) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). At the concentrations below 10 nM, treatment with okadaic acid did not affect viability of COS-7 cells (see supplemental Fig). These results indicate that PP2A has a moderate effect only on Tat-induced transcription in cultured cells. To analyze the contribution of PP1 to the control of HIV-1 transcription in COS-7 cells, vectors expressing NIPP1-EGFP WT or NIPP1-EGFP mutant (NIPP1 K193-197A/V201A/F203A/Y335D, NIPP1 mut) were transfected along with JK2 and Tat expression vector, as we previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In the mutant NIPP1 the PP1 binding sites in both the central and C-terminal domain of NIPP1 are mutated and it no longer interacts with PP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Co-transfection of wild type, but not the mutant NIPP1-EGFP, inhibited Tat-activated transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). In the absence of Tat, transcription from HIV-1 LTR or from a mutant HIV-1 LTR with a deletion of the fragment encoding TAR RNA (JK2&#x00394;TAR) was inhibited about 50% by both NIPP1 and mutant NIPP1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), indicating that this effect of NIPP1 was not due to its ability to bind PP1.

Previously PP2A has been shown to stimulate HIV-1 transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Because PP2A exists in multiply complexes it is still not clear what is the substrate for PP2A during HIV-1 transcription. Results presented in the present paper show that it is unlikely that PP2A dephosphorylates CDK9 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Previously, CDK9 phosphorylation was linked to the binding of CDK9/cyclin T1 to TAR RNA in the presence of Tat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Our <italic>in vitro </italic>data are clearly in agreement with the earlier observations. Recently, acetylation of the RNA binding region of Tat was shown to be important for Tat function <italic>in vivo </italic>and it was proposed to help in dissociating CyclinT1 from TAR RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Thus it is remained to be determined whether autophosphorylation of CDK9 is important for P-TEFb interaction with TAR RNA <italic>in vivo </italic>and whetherphosphorylation of the C-terminus of CDK9 is linked to the acetylation of Tat. In our study, PP2A affected both basal and Tat-induced HIV-1 transcription. This indicates that PP2A may be important for the early steps of transcription. Since &#x003b2;-galactosidase is quite stable, our experimental system allows us to measure only general cumulative effects and thus we may have overlooked the early transcriptional effects. The inhibitory effect of NIPP1 on Tat-dependent transcription <italic>in vitro </italic>agrees well with our previous observation that inhibition of PP1 blocks Tat-activated but not basal HIV-1 transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. But generally the effect of Tat <italic>in vitro </italic>in our system was relatively small, only 3&#x02013;5 folds induction, as compared to the 30-fold or more induction in the cells. Thus it is possible that either the basal transcription <italic>in vitro </italic>was artificially high, or that the Tat activation only partially reproduces the situation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our unpublished observations indicate that Tat may directly interact with PP1 <italic>in vivo </italic>and retarget PP1 within the cells, the effect that may not be seen <italic>in vitro</italic>. We chose for the analysis COS-7 cells in which HIV-1 transcription is not induced in response to the low concentration of the okadaic acid, likely because of the retargeting of PP2A by SV40 small T antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. We showed that low concentrations of okadaic acid (IC<sub>50 </sub>= 4 nM) mildly inhibit Tat-induced but not the basal HIV-1 transcription. The level of the achieved inhibition was only 30% indicating that phosphatases, including PP1 may also contribute to the regulation of HIV-1 transcription. Our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and the results presented here indicate that PP1 may be one of the candidate phosphate, as inhibition of nuclear PP1 potently blocked Tat-transactivation. Analysis of the CDK9 phosphorylation in cultured cells showed that its phosphorylation is likely to be controlled by PP1 because in the cells, that stably express central domain of NIPP1, there was no increase of CDK9 phosphorylation in the presence of okadaic acid. A more complex explanation is that PP1 might regulate PP2A activity and thus indirectly affect CDK9 phosphorylation. Although the moderate inhibitory effect of okadaic acid on HIV-1 transcription argues against this possibility, we cannot exclude it completely. CDK9/cyclin T1 was shown to bind to its inhibitors, 7SK RNA and MAQ1/HEXIM1 protein in phosphorylation-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Autophosphorylation of CDK9 takes place in the C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], whereas a yet unknown cellular kinase phosphorylates CDK9 within the regulatory T-loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. It was proposed that phosphorylation of Thr 186 inhibits the activity of P-TEFb and that its dephosphorylation reactivates P-TEFb by allowing dissociation of 7SK RNA and HEXIM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In a contradictory study, Price and colleagues showed that phosphorylation of Thr 186 is required for the kinase activity of CDK9 and argued against the regulatory role of dephosphorylation of Thr186 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Our study points to a possibility to resolve this discrepancy by determining the phosphorylation state of Thr 186 and the activity of endogenous CDK9 in the cells which continuously express central domain of NIPP1. Taking together, our study demonstrates that PP1 is likely to dephosphorylate CDK9 <italic>in vivo </italic>and that inhibitory effect of NIPP1 on HIV-1 transcription might be due to the deregulation of CDK9 phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>COS-7 cells, 293T cells and HeLa cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). 293T cells stably expressing NIPP1 (143&#x02013;224) were generated by transfection of NIPP1-143-224-EGFP, and limited dilution cloning in the presence of geneticin (0.5 mg/ml) (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD).
