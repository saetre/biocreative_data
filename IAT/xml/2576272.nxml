Five SS isoforms, SSI, II, III, IV and Granule Bound SSI, have been identified, each with a unique catalytic role in starch synthesis. The basic mode of action of SSs is known; however our knowledge of several aspects of SS enzymology at the structural and mechanistic level is incomplete. To gain a better understanding of the differences in SS sequences that underscore their specificity, the previously uncharacterised <italic>SSIVb </italic>from wheat was cloned and extensive bioinformatics analyses of this and other SSs sequences were done.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The wheat SSIV cDNA is most similar to rice <italic>SSIVb </italic>with which it shows synteny and shares a similar exon-intron arrangement. The wheat <italic>SSIVb </italic>gene was preferentially expressed in leaf and was not regulated by a circadian clock. Phylogenetic analysis showed that in plants, SSIV is closely related to SSIII, while SSI, SSII and Granule Bound SSI clustered together and distinctions between the two groups can be made at the genetic level and included chromosomal location and intron conservation. Further, identified differences at the amino acid level in their glycosyltransferase domains, predicted secondary structures, global conformations and conserved residues might be indicative of intragroup functional associations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on bioinformatics analysis of the catalytic region of 36 SSs and 3 glycogen synthases (GSs), it is suggested that the valine residue in the highly conserved K-X-G-G-L motif in SSIII and SSIV may be a determining feature of primer specificity of these SSs as compared to GBSSI, SSI and SSII. In GBSSI, the Ile485 residue may partially explain that enzyme's unique catalytic features. The flexible 380s Loop in the starch catalytic domain may be important in defining the specificity of action for each different SS and the G-X-G in motif VI could define SSIV and SSIII action particularly.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Starch is an important reserve of carbon and energy. It is the most widely used storage compound in plants and it makes up 50% of the calories humans eat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Further, starch has great utility in several industries as a cheap, versatile and biodegradable polymer and its demand in these niche markets is increasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In spite of its importance as a primary source of food for humans and its growing economic value as a raw material, our understanding of the mechanistic basis of starch biosynthesis is incomplete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Starch is deposited in the plastid as complex crystalline granules. It is made up of two &#x003b1;1&#x02013;4-glucan polymers; amylose is the smaller almost linear polymer, while amylopectin is larger and has a high frequency of &#x003b1;-1&#x02013;6-glycosidic linkages between glucan chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The branch pattern of &#x003b1;-1&#x02013;6-linked amylopectin glucan chains is polymodal and highly organised such that crystallisation of glucose molecules occurs, with the subsequent formation of a granular supra-macromolecule. Prokaryotes, fungi and animals do not store starch but accumulate glycogen. Although glycogen also has branched &#x003b1;-1,4-glucan chains, they lack the sophisticated polymodal organisation found in starch. The result is that glycogen is amorphous and water-soluble [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], while starch is a metabolically stable hydrocolloid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Starch synthases (SSs; EC 2.4.1.21 and EC 2.4.1.242) elongate the glucan chains of amylose and amylopectin. They catalyze the transfer of the glucose moiety of ADPglucose to the non-reducing end of an existing glucan chain via an &#x003b1;-1,4-glucosidic link. Five SS classes, SSI, SSII, SSIII, SSIV and Granule Bound SSI (GBSSI), have been identified among the DNA sequences available in public repositories and, in cereals, duplication of several SS-encoding genes gave rise to 10 isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Genome sequencing projects of unicellular green algae show that most of the SS classes found in higher plants are also present in algae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], suggesting that the gene duplication events that gave rise to the five main SS isoforms predated the evolution of higher plants. Prokaryotic glycogen synthases (EC 2.4.1.11; GS), like higher plant SSs, use the ADPglucose pathway for the synthesis of glycogen; however, surveying the genomic sequences of prokaryotes in DNA databanks leads to the conclusion that there may be no more than two GS isoforms in prokaryotes.</p><p>The coordinated activity of the different SS isoforms helps to build the starch granule and influence its architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Genetic, and some biochemical and <italic>in vitro </italic>kinetic studies, suggests that SSI elongates the short chains, SSII the intermediate, and SSIII and perhaps GBSSI elongate the long chains of amylopectin, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Only GBSSI activity is required to make amylose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A role for the SSIV isoform primarily in starch granule initiation in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>has recently been shown although it may also be involved in making short glucan chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. While it is largely held that each SS isoform has a unique role in starch biosynthesis, studies of some SS transgenic and mutant lines suggest that there may be functional overlap between isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In addition to chain-length preferences, SS isoforms also have distinct intra-plastidic locations. GBSSI is starch granule-localised, SSIII and SSIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] are exclusively in the stroma, while SSII and SSI are found distributed between stroma and granule. The partitioning of SS activity in these different regions may influence their individual kinetic behaviours through their interaction with substrate and other starch biosynthetic enzymes, with eventual repercussions for granule structure.</p><p>The basic metabolic activity of SSs and GSs is defined by a highly conserved region shared between these enzymes. This "core" region is in the C-terminus of plant SSs and is 60 kDa in length, but encompasses essentially the entire protein sequence of the prokaryotic GSs. The major variation among SSs in this region is an extension or "tail" of 20 amino acids found only in GBSSI proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Within the catalytic core is the conserved starch catalytic domain (Pfam PF08323) and the glycosyltransferase 1 domain (Pfam PF00534) characteristic of the GT5 glycosyltransferase superfamily according to CAZY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The starch catalytic domain is found in glycosyltransferases that use only ADPglucose as substrate. The glycosyl transferase 1 domain is found in proteins that transfer UDP, ADP, GDP or CMP-linked sugars to a variety of substrates, including glycogen, fructose-6-phosphate and lipopolysaccharides and is therefore not unique to GSs and SSs.</p><p>Our knowledge of how GT5 enzymes interact with the ADPglucose substrate was enhanced by the determination of the crystal structure of <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </italic>GS and modeling of its interaction with substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </italic>GS and perhaps all SSs and GSs are "retaining-type" glycosyltransferases with a GT-B-fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The GT-B-fold is characterised by two different Rossmann-like &#x003b1;-&#x003b2;-&#x003b1; domains, separated by a deep cleft that is predicted to be highly flexible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Within this fold is one of the two highly conserved K-X-G-G-L motifs that may play a role in catalysis and/or substrate binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Although there are no SS crystals available to enable definitive conclusions about SS three-dimensional (3D) structure, the sequence homology of bacterial GS and the catalytic core region of the plants makes it likely that the structural features described for <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </italic>GS may also hold true for plant SSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to the similarities at the C-termini, the N-terminal region upstream of the catalytic core, shows no sequence uniformity amongst SS isoforms. Further, SS N-termini vary greatly in length from 2.2 kDa in GBSSI to ~135 kDa in maize SSIII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and noticeably, is absent in prokaryotic GSs. The SS N-terminal extension does not appear to be directly involved in catalysis although it may alter SS kinetics and/or interaction with substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It could also play a crucial role in the ability of different SSs to form functional enzymatic complexes with other starch biosynthetic enzymes, which is proving to be key factor in determining amylopectin formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>This paper describes the cloning of a cDNA from wheat with high homology to the SSIV class of SSs, and the bioinformatics analysis of this and other SSs sequences in the database to investigate potential functional, structural and evolutionary relationships between SSIV, other SSs and GSs. The first aim was to gain a basic understanding of the <italic>SSIV </italic>gene in wheat &#x02013; its expression, genomic organisation and chromosomal location. The second aim was to identify similarities in the predicted protein sequences of GSs and SSs that may indicate important conserved characteristics critical to SS function. The third aim was to identify sequence differences that may denote evolutionary changes that serve as the basis for the specificity of action of these SS isoforms.</p><p>In this manuscript the different SS genes and their predicted proteins are described as follows: the prefix refers to the species name, e.g. <italic><underline>T</underline>riticum <underline>a</underline>estivum </italic>L. is referred to as <italic>Ta</italic>, and is followed by indication of the SS isoform, e.g. SSIV. For duplicated SS genes in cereals, we use the suffix <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b </italic>or <italic>c </italic>to indicate that sub-isoform, depending on the organ where the gene is primarily expressed; <italic>a </italic>refers to storage tissue and <italic>b </italic>and <italic>c </italic>to vegetative tissue.

Cloning and characterisation of SSIVb</title><sec><title>Identification and characterization of a wheat SSIV cDNA</title><p>An expressed sequence tag (EST) [Genbank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BT009276">BT009276</ext-link>] homologous to plant SSs and glycogen GSs at the amino acid level was identified from a developing wheat seedling cDNA. Using a 5'RACE-like procedure, contiguous cDNA fragments were amplified from wheat libraries that collectively gave a 3386 bps-long sequence containing a full-length ORF of 2806 bp [Genbank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY044844">AY044844</ext-link>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The amino acid sequence deduced from this ORF contains 914 residues and a predicted molecular mass of 103.1 kDa. A putative cleavage site between amino acids 45 and 46 was identified using the ChloroP neural network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] cleavage at which would result in a mature protein of molecular mass 98.3 kDa.

PCR fragments A, B and C were amplified by a 5'RACE-like procedure carried out with wheat cDNA libraries (see Methods) and represent the minimum tiling path of several sequences identified. The SSIV EST (EST-968 bp) and the cDNAs called 1600 bp RACE and 2100 bp RACE were isolated similarly to A, B and C and were assembled into different cloning vectors to test coding potential and/or glycosyltransferase activity. The starch catalytic domain (GT-5) and glycosyltranferase domain (GT-1) characteristics of the SS family are shown.

The starch catalytic and glycosyltransferase domains characteristic of SSs are present in the C-terminus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), and conservation of sequence identities at the two putative ADPglucose binding motifs, i.e. K<underline>V</underline>GGL and <underline>K</underline>TGGL, was found between this wheat cDNA and the rice SSIV and SSIII Classes. Expression of the 968-bp EST and 2100-bp RACE products in <italic>E. coli </italic>produced polypeptides of the expected size. In the latter case, glycosyltransferase activity could be detected, albeit at a low level [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]. Like all other SSs the N-terminus of <italic>Ta</italic>SSIVb is unique; an SSIV-specific region, from amino acids 1&#x02013;405, was detected and within this region two coiled-coil domains and a 14-3-3-protein recognition site were identified (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic analysis of starch and glycogen synthases</title><p>The deduced amino acid sequence of the wheat SSIV cDNA was compared to those of 36 other SSs and 3 GSs, two from <italic>Synechocystis </italic>and the other from <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>, using Clustal W [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].

Although this hypothesis has since been brought into question [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], our observations show a high level of intra-group conservation at this residue. It is a valine (non-polar) in Group B SSs, and a threonine or a serine (both polar) in the Group A SSs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). This appeared true in all 5 SS classes and for all 33 species compared (data not shown). Interestingly, like the Group B SSs, <italic>Sp</italic>GS1 and <italic>Sp</italic>GS2 both have non-polar residues (valine and alanine, respectively) at this site.</p><p>Variation in other amino acids believed to play a role in ADPglucose binding in <italic>Agt</italic>GS, may indicate specificities that help define the individual SS classes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). For example, in <italic>Agt</italic>GS, van der Waals forces among Ser298, Ser359 and Tyr354 are thought to stabilize the adenine heterocycle when ADPglucose binds the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In the Group A SSs, glycine (aliphatic) is substituted for the polar Ser298 in Motif V (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). It has also been predicted that the hydroxyl (-OH) side chain of threonine at residue 381 (Thr381) would form a hydrogen bond with the O<sub>2 </sub>atom of the ribose moiety of ADPglucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. However, in all of the GBSSIs analyzed, Thr381 is replaced by isoleucine, which has an aliphatic hydrophobic side chain and cannot form hydrogen or ionic bonds with other groups. Members of the GT5 family have two highly conserved glycines (Gly327 and Gly329 in <italic>Agt</italic>GS) in Motif VI (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). Interestingly, the G-X-G motif is not conserved in the GT3 family that uses UDPglucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The Gly329 residue is replaced by serine (polar) in the SSIV sequences and such a substitution would likely affect the functional properties of the protein. In <italic>Agt</italic>GS, His163 and Phe167 are involved in glycogen binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and would be predicted to be found in the GT-5 domain of SSs. However, a previous study stated that His163 is not present in SSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Our analysis shows that His163 is indeed present and highly conserved among SSs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). In contrast, the equivalent Phe167 residue in the SSI and SSII sequences examined are basic (His318 and His380, respectively) and not the aromatic amino acids found in <italic>Agt</italic>GS, the Group B SSs and GBSSIs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

The basis for this idea is that proteins are built up through modular exonic segments spliced together using introns and if an amino acid serves an important or critical functional role, these residues will remain relatively unaffected by evolutionary changes in splicing and/or exon re-arrangements.</p><p>The positions of introns relative to the positions of specific amino acids were compared within the SS subfamilies to look for evidence of evolutionary conservation. In most cases, these positions are conserved among orthologous SS isoforms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>). However, two consecutive intron positions are conserved among all Group B SSs, and one position is identical for the SSI and SSII sequences examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).

The conserved glutamine identical in SSI and SSII is within the 380s Loop between Motifs I and II (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>), and the consecutive positions for SSIII and SSIV (Group B SSs) occurs within Motif I at the variable residue in the K-X-G-G-L motif between the lysine and valine residues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).

If these sequences are invariant among SSs from diverse species, this may indicate that the corresponding amino acids may function similarly, as conserved sequence motifs suggests an evolutionary relationship between proteins. Structural analysis and alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences of SS and GSs revealed several amino acids potentially crucial in determining specific SS activity. These residues are presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. By extension, amino acids within conserved motifs that are distinct between SS isoforms may at least be partially explained, by the important differences in functionality. These will be discussed in turn.</p><sec><title>GBSSI</title><p>GBSSI is the only SS that makes amylose, but it can elongate amylopectin processively if it is bound to this polymer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Although the C-terminal "tail" present in GBSSI is unique to this isoform among SSs, it may only define GBSSI's ability to bind to amylopectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The only other difference that singled out GBSSI compared to other SSs was a Thr381 &#x02192; Ile amino acid substitution in the active site that was present universally among GBSSI proteins examined. Since this residue interacts with the hydroxyl group of ADPglucose it is easy to imagine that the aliphatic residue will not bind the glucose moiety of ADPglucose in the same way as in <italic>Agt</italic>GS and the other SSs, which have polar residues at this site. This non-conservative substitution would affect the interaction of protein with substrate and explain the low K<sub>m </sub>of GBSSI for ADPglucose and/or the ability of the enzyme to processively elongate maltooligosaccharides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. This hypothesis is worth testing using more direct methods such as site-directed mutagenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>SSI and SSII</title><p>The Phe167 residue in the 380s Loop is conserved in all SSs except the SSIs and SSIIs where it is a basic residue and not an aromatic amino acid found in the other SSs.

The conserved aromatic residue at this position in the GT5 superfamily stacks against the pyranose ring of the glucose molecule of ADPglucose in <italic>Agt</italic>GS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The substitution of a polar residue at this site in SSIs and most SSIIs may affect their ADPglucose-binding ability as compared to <italic>Agt</italic>GS and the other SS classes. The significance of the 380s Loop in SS proteins is unknown, however our findings make a case for a further examination of the role of this region in determining SS activity. This is because the other difference of note between SSI and SSII proteins and all other SSs is the identical intron-amino acid positioning at Glu168 conserved within these isoforms and not shared by the others. This glutamine residue may thus have faced strong selective pressure to be conserved in both SSIs and SSIIs. Furthermore, Glu168 lies immediately adjacent to the histidine which substitutes, again, only in SSIs and SSIIs, for the otherwise highly conserved Phe167 in <italic>Atg</italic>GS. Collectively these data implicate this region of the 380s Loop as potentially holding some functional significance in delineating SS activity, especially for SSIs and SSIIs.</p></sec><sec><title>Group A vs. Group B SSs</title><p>The apparent divergence of these &#x003b1;-glycosyltransferases can in part be explained by differences in the length and sequence homology of their GT-1 domains, substitutions in key amino acid residues and differences in secondary structure near or at the active/binding site that would lead to different spatio-conformational outcomes and possibly change interaction of protein with substrate. The GT-1 domains of the Group A SSs are identical in length while there is little conservation of GT-1 length among Group B SSs. The GT-1 domain interacts with the nucleotide sugars and differences in sequence homology in this region could produce different 3D-folds and variation in reaction mechanisms. Group B SSs also differ structurally from Group A SSs in the G-X-G Loop near &#x003b2;-15 that faces the nucleotide-binding cleft. This motif and Loop was previously believed to be absolutely conserved in all GT5 enzymes, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] including the Group A SSs, however, it has diverged in the Group B SSs. In SSIVs there is a non-conservative Gly &#x02192; Ser substitution and, since this is the only difference that distinguishes SSIVs from Group A SSs and SSIIIs, we suggest that this region may help define the unique activity of SSIVs and perhaps, by extension, their role in granule priming. Our conclusions differ from those drawn by Busi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] who inferred that the G-X-G motif is absent in plants SSs; however, their analysis included only <italic>At</italic>SSIII and no other plant SSs.</p><p>Within the region that is predicted to directly bind the substrate there are further distinctions between the two main SS groups. In the Group A SSs there is a non-conservative substitution within Motif V of glycine for serine that could alter the symmetry and spatial conformation of the binding site. Furthermore, there is an additional &#x003b2;-strand in the Group A SSs within Motif I which contains the conserved lysine of the K-X-G-G-L. &#x003b2;-strands have an extended conformation which promotes a more linear topography within the secondary structure of the proteins. This additional strand may, again, allow the Group A synthases to interact in a different way with the starch granule and/or substrate and could affect primer preference of these enzymes.</p><p>The identity of the variable residue in the K-X-G-G-L motif appeared to be dependent on whether the SS examined was classified as a Group A or B SS. The K-X-G-G-L motif is strictly conserved in all SSs and GSs and has been considered the ADPglucose active site in GSs and SSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Analysis of the crystal structure of <italic>Agt</italic>GS with and without ADPglucose confirms that Lys15 in this motif is involved in substrate binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Gao <italic>et al</italic>. (2004) put forward the idea that this amino acid may be a determinant of SS chain elongation specificity in plant SSs. Indeed, a major difference between the SSs sub-families is the preference for a primer of a specific chain length; thus, further scrutiny of differences in the sequence of this motif is warranted. Within the highly conserved K-X-G-G-L motif, the variable residue is non-polar in the Group B SSs and polar in the Group A SSs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Another essential consideration is the conservation of intron position with respect to the valine amino acid residue within motif I in the Group B SSs, highlighting, perhaps, that this valine residue is fundamental to the Group B SSs' metabolic action as there is evidence of strong evolutionary selective pressure for its conservation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).</p><p>A distinguishing feature that separates SSI and SSII of the Group A SSs from the Group B SSs and GBSSI is a conserved glutamine within the 380s Loop. As previously noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], the 380s Loop is highly variable in length among the different GSs and SSs. It is therefore probable that this Loop is not crucial for SS global activity but it could still confer specificity to individual SSs. The 380s Loop supports communication between the glycogen-binding and catalytic sites of <italic>E. coli </italic>maltodextrin and glycogen phosphorylase with an ensuing spatio-conformational change after substrate-binding ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and references therein). A role for this region in SSs or GSs has not yet been determined. Elements found in the equivalent region in glycogen phosphorylases necessary for binding to a carbohydrate are lacking in SSs and GSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. This raises questions about the role of the 380s Loop in SSs. Still, intron-amino acid positioning suggests that the Glu168 residue in this region is highly conserved in SSIs and SSIIs, which points some functional significance of this amino acid and region to SS enzymatic action.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Proposed role for 380s Loop</title><p>There is evidence to suggest that some SSs can catalyse the initiation and elongation of glucan chains. <italic>Agt</italic>GS is able to prime glycogen synthesis independent of a glycogenin protein and Roldan <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] drew a comparison between the priming functions of <italic>Agt</italic>GS protein and that of SSIV in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>based on the phenotype of the <italic>At</italic>SSIV mutant. Indeed, some SSs are able to prime starch synthesis <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. To explain this possible self-priming function a 2-point insertion mechanism was elaborated by Guan &#x00026; Keeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] whereby an SS would bind two ADPglucose molecules at different sites and &#x003b1;-1,4-glucan chain synthesis would occur <italic>de novo </italic>by the transfer of the glucose moiety of one ADPglucose to the other. Considering the position of Lys15 and the conserved Gly18 in Motif, I far from the catalytic core of the enzyme, it is initially difficult to see how they could determine primer specificity. However, these residues are invariant in the SS/GS family, suggestive of a functional role. One possibility is that after ADPglucose binding at the active site within the cleft or ADPglucose-binding pocket, the closed structure which results brings the &#x003b1;-1 and &#x003b2;-1 sheets containing the K-X-G-G-L motif and any primer it binds, e.g. another ADPglucose molecule or glucan chain, into proximity of the active site. If the 380s Loop functions in SSs in the way proposed for phosphorylases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], then the movement of this Loop during the open-close transition after ADPglucose binding may be an important part of the mechanism that drives the specificity of action of the SSs within the catalytic region. This mechanism would not require that the 380s Loop directly bind a carbohydrate. The only region that is consistently different among all SSs is the 380s Loop and these differences may possibly be translated, although indirectly, into different interactions with substrate and/or glucan primer.</p><p>Although it is suggested here that the 380s Loop could have a role in determining SS specificity, it does not rule out the possibility that other regions of SSs may also contribute or may be more important for SS functionality. In this study we focused our comparisons exclusively on the two-lobes of the C-terminus containing the GT1 and GT5 domains. It has been established that this region is responsible for catalytic activity and also, differences in substrate preference, affinity and reaction velocity between SSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However the function of the N-terminus in potentially defining SS activity is not yet known. This region may help to confer SS unique action by influencing or facilitating their interaction with other starch biosynthetic enzymes and/or substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The formation of starch biosynthetic enzyme complexes especially could modify the activity of each SS isoform and their relative contribution to starch glucan assembly.</p></sec><sec><title>Evolutionary relationship between cyanobacterial GSs and SSs</title><p>Analysis of algal SSs and cyanobacterial GS proved informative in helping to understand the function and relationship between the classes of these enzymes. Of particular interest, <italic>Ostreococcus tauri </italic>does not have SSIV but three isoforms of SSIII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Granule initiation does not seem to be essential in <italic>Ostreococcus </italic>as this alga partitions its starch granules from mother to daughter cells by binary fission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. If SSIV is part of the biological mechanism involved in granule initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], it is also possible that <italic>Ot</italic>SSIIIa performs a similar function. Sequence analysis of <italic>Synechocystis </italic>PCC 6803 GSs also clarified our view of SS relationships. <italic>Synechocystis </italic>has two forms of GS, one of which, <italic>Sp</italic>GS2, is closely related to the Group B SSs while the other, <italic>Sp</italic>GS1, is more similar to the Group A SSs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Interestingly, the C-terminal extension found only in GBSSI polypeptides is also present in <italic>Sp</italic>GS1. This raises intriguing possibilities about the evolutionary relationship between <italic>Sp</italic>GS1 and the GBSSIs, and, when it is considered that all members of the Group A SSs have the ability to bind to the starch granule, the functional association of <italic>Sp</italic>GS1 with the Group A SSs as a whole.</p><p>Phylogenetic analysis of the origins of starch biosynthetic genes in higher plants and green and red algae suggests there to be a complex set of evolutionary events with vertical and lateral gene transfers between host and endosymbiont cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In spite of this it is widely accepted that genes from a cyanobacterial endosymbiont are now present in plant host nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] and some of these genes have retained much of their sequence identity. The clear separation of GSs into two distinct clades, and sequence similarities between them and SSs from one group or the other, suggests that the Group A and Group B SSs evolved directly from the two independent GS types. The SSIV group could have evolved from <italic>Sp</italic>GS2, and subsequent gene duplication events might have led to the evolution of SSIIIs. One exon each in the wheat and <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>Class III SSs (exons III and I, respectively), contains a significant proportion of the coding region that is present in SSIII but not SSIV or other SSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. It is possible that the Class III SSs arose as a result of duplication of the SSIV followed by a single insertion event of a gene sequence represented by these exons. The resulting difference in gene structure, as well as subsequent changes selected for during evolution, might have led to two distinct gene products that are sufficiently diverged to constitute two different gene classes. High sequence similarity of intronic sequences and intron-amino acid positions is supportive of the notion that SSIII and SSIV followed a common evolutionary path.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The basic cloning and characterisation of <italic>TaSSIVb </italic>showed that the SS it encodes is similar to other SSIVs and has almost 50% similarity to prokaryotic GSs and higher plant SSIIIs. Phylogenetic and sequence analysis suggests that SSIs, SSIIs and GBSSIs have a distinct evolutionary origins as compared to SSIIIs and SSIVs. This bifurcation is supported by differences in secondary structure and amino acid residue substitutions in what are accepted to be critical and/or conserved regions for ADPglucose binding and/or catalysis. The 380s Loop is proposed to be potentially a determinant of SS-specificity and through its involvement in the open-closed transition of the active site during ADPglucose binding as has been suggested for glycogen phosphorylases. The valine residue within the highly conserved K-X-G-G-L motif appears to have faced strong evolutionary selection in SSIII and SSIVs and it may affect primer/substrate binding of these SSs compared to SSIs, SSIIs and GBSSIs. SSIII and SSIV also differ from other SSs at the highly conserved G-X-G motif near the nucleotide-binding cleft. We stress that although these predictions of structure-function characteristics of SSs must be confirmed by experimental data, they provide a useful framework for designing an in-depth investigation of the role of each SS in the construction of the 3D architecture of starch. Such studies can help with efforts to engineer starch with modified crystalline structure and physico-chemical properties.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant material</title><p>Wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum </italic>L. cv.
