Nevertheless, many SUMO-specific ligases do not exhibit much target specificity, and&#x02014;compared with the diversity of sumoylation substrates&#x02014;their number is limited. This raises the question of how SUMO conjugation is controlled <italic>in vivo</italic>. We report here an unexpected mechanism by which sumoylation of the replication clamp protein, PCNA, from budding yeast is effectively coupled to S phase. We find that loading of PCNA onto DNA is a prerequisite for sumoylation <italic>in vivo</italic> and greatly stimulates modification <italic>in vitro</italic>. To our surprise, however, DNA binding by the ligase Siz1, responsible for PCNA sumoylation, is not strictly required. Instead, the stimulatory effect of DNA on conjugation is mainly attributable to DNA binding of PCNA itself. These findings imply a change in the properties of PCNA upon loading that enhances its capacity to be sumoylated.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>clamp loader</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>PCNA</kwd><kwd>SUMO</kwd><kwd>SUMO ligase</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Through its reversible attachment to intracellular proteins the small ubiquitin-related modifier SUMO controls numerous biological processes, ranging from nucleo-cytoplasmic transport to the regulation of transcription and the maintenance of genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kerscher <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Geiss-Friedlander and Melchior, 2007</xref>). Modification by SUMO follows a mechanism closely related to that used by the ubiquitin system: the modifier's carboxy terminus is activated by a dedicated activating enzyme (E1), transferred to a conjugating enzyme (E2) and linked to a lysine residue of the substrate protein with the aid of a ligase (E3) that confers selectivity to the reaction. In the SUMO system, however, the single E2, Ubc9, often participates directly in substrate recognition, and some SUMO-specific E3s, such as mammalian RanBP2, stimulate the conjugation reaction in a substrate-independent manner by aligning the SUMO thioester on the Ubc9 active site in a conformation favourable for attack by an incoming lysine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Reverter and Lima, 2005</xref>). As a consequence, <italic>in vitro</italic> sumoylation reactions tend to be highly promiscuous, and even <italic>in vivo</italic> many substrates can be sumoylated by more than one E3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Reindle <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Selectivity and spatio-temporal control over the modification can sometimes be attributed to signalling cascades resulting in the phosphorylation of the E3 or the substrate, but more often the dynamic regulation of sumoylation is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Guo <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In eukaryotic cells, post-translational modifications of the replicative sliding clamp PCNA control the processing of replication intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Ulrich, 2005</xref>). In response to DNA damage, ubiquitylation of PCNA promotes the bypass of replication-blocking lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Hoege <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Stelter and Ulrich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kannouche <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). In budding yeast, PCNA (encoded by <italic>POL30</italic>) is also subject to damage-independent sumoylation during S phase, which enhances its affinity for an antirecombinogenic helicase, Srs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Papouli <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Pfander <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Recruitment of Srs2 by the modified clamp prevents unscheduled recombination events during replication. When progression of replication forks is stalled by DNA damage, Srs2 thus inhibits resolution by homologous recombination and allows damage bypass via the ubiquitin-dependent pathway. Sumoylation of PCNA occurs on two lysines, predominantly on K164 and to a lesser extent on K127. Modification at K164 <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> requires the E3 Siz1, but Siz1 also stimulates non-selective sumoylation at K127 and the formation of poly-SUMO chains on PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Hoege <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Stelter and Ulrich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Windecker and Ulrich, 2008</xref>). During most of the cell cycle, Siz1 is nuclear, with the exception of G2/M phase, when the E3 associates with the bud neck and participates in septin sumoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Johnson and Gupta, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). A conserved SAP domain, which often binds DNA in other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Okubo <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Notenboom <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), determines nuclear localisation or retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Takahashi and Kikuchi, 2005</xref>) and was found to be required for PCNA modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Reindle <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). SUMO is removed from PCNA by the isopeptidase Ulp1, which associates with nuclear pore complexes throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Li and Hochstrasser, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Panse <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Stelter and Ulrich, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Under physiological conditions, sumoylation of PCNA is limited to S phase, but it is unclear how this is controlled. We have therefore investigated the signals required for Siz1-dependent modification of PCNA <italic>in vivo</italic>. To our surprise, we found that SUMO conjugation to PCNA is governed less by the cognate enzymes than by the properties of the clamp itself, in particular its association with DNA. This mechanism of PCNA modification is accurately reproduced by a recombinant <italic>in vitro</italic> system and suggests a substrate-induced control over sumoylation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>PCNA sumoylation is controlled by conjugation and de-conjugation</title><p>To understand whether regulation of conjugation by Siz1 or of de-conjugation by Ulp1 was primarily responsible for the restriction of PCNA sumoylation to S phase, we analysed the cell cycle dependence of the modification in the relevant mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Synchronised cultures of <italic>ulp1</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> cells initiated sumoylation in S phase, but due to the slower cell cycle progression, the modification persisted throughout the experiment. The marked upregulation of sumoylation upon entry into S phase even under conditions where de-conjugation is compromised suggested that the cell cycle influences the conjugation reaction. As expected, sumoylation at K164 was abolished in the <italic>siz1</italic> mutant. Surprisingly, however, sumoylation at K127 still fluctuated with the cell cycle in this mutant, indicating that Siz1 alone cannot be responsible for upregulating PCNA sumoylation. To assess whether modification at K127 was mediated solely by Ubc9 or depended on a second E3, we deleted <italic>SIZ2</italic> in addition to <italic>SIZ1</italic>, and now conjugation was completely abolished. Therefore, S phase-specific sumoylation of PCNA is not strictly dependent on its cognate E3, Siz1, but can also be performed by the closely related Siz2 enzyme, albeit with lower efficiency and on a different lysine.</p><p>These data indicate that both conjugation and de-conjugation contribute to limiting PCNA sumoylation to S phase. However, the cell cycle-dependent fluctuation of the modification is unlikely to be regulated simply by a balance of the respective conjugating and de-conjugating enzymes in the nucleus: first, Siz2&#x02014;unlike Siz1&#x02014;remains nuclear in G2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), yet Siz2-dependent sumoylation is lost at this time in <italic>siz1</italic> mutants. Second, PCNA is not sumoylated in G1 despite its colocalisation with Siz1 and Siz2 in the nucleus. Therefore, selective modification in S phase appears to require cell cycle-dependent changes in either enzyme activities or substrate properties.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>PCNA sumoylation <italic>in vivo</italic> correlates with its loading onto DNA</title><p>In response to lethal concentrations of the alkylating agent methyl methanesulphonate (MMS), PCNA is strongly sumoylated in a Siz1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Hoege <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Windecker and Ulrich, 2008</xref>). We found that this reaction was independent of the cell cycle stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). Hence, given the appropriate signal, sumoylation of PCNA is not limited to S phase. We reasoned that the extraordinary levels of DNA damage inflicted by this treatment would likely cause an enhanced engagement of PCNA in repair activities and therefore a significant association with DNA even outside of S phase. Indeed, chromatin-binding assays after 0.3&#x00025; MMS treatment revealed strongly elevated amounts of PCNA in the chromatin-bound fraction in an S phase-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>). The observed correlation between PCNA hyper-sumoylation and chromatin association therefore suggested that loading onto DNA might exert an effect as a signal for PCNA sumoylation in undamaged cells as well. This notion was also supported by the sumoylation defect of the PCNA mutant encoded by the <italic>pol30-52</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>), which is known for poor loading onto DNA due to reduced trimer stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ayyagari <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>).</p><p>If loading were indeed a prerequisite for sumoylation, preventing PCNA association with DNA during S phase should in turn result in a failure to be modified. We therefore examined PCNA sumoylation in a temperature-sensitive <italic>cdc7</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> mutant. <italic>CDC7</italic> encodes an essential protein kinase required for the firing of replication origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Hartwell, 1973</xref>). Upon release from G1 arrest at the restrictive temperature, <italic>cdc7</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> cells do not initiate DNA replication, although budding pattern and cyclin-dependent kinase activities all resemble a passage through the cell cycle. We found that under these conditions, PCNA was not sumoylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>) at a time when the levels of the mitotic cyclin Clb2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>) and the budding pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>) indicated an S phase-like state. Siz1 was nuclear at this stage and accumulated at the bud neck only in G2/M phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>), when <italic>cdc7</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> cells were arrested due to a failure to undergo mitosis with an unreplicated genome. We excluded the formal possibility that the kinase activity of Cdc7 was required for PCNA sumoylation by confirming the modification in a <italic>cdc7</italic> deletion mutant, using a strain background in which <italic>CDC7</italic> was rendered non-essential by a mutation in <italic>MCM5</italic>, a subunit of the replicative helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Hardy <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, ongoing DNA replication rather than a particular cell cycle regulatory programme appears to bring about PCNA sumoylation, strongly suggesting that the clamp is modified only when it encircles DNA.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>PCNA loading stimulates sumoylation <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>We have previously demonstrated Siz1-dependent <italic>in vitro</italic> sumoylation of PCNA in the absence of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Windecker and Ulrich, 2008</xref>), but if clamp loading were the main prerequisite for modification <italic>in vivo</italic>, association with DNA would also stimulate the reaction <italic>in vitro</italic>. Loading of PCNA is ATP dependent and requires replication factor C (RFC), which opens the PCNA ring and positions the clamp around the DNA at nicks within double-stranded (ds)DNA or 3&#x02032; junctions of a primer terminus and single-stranded (ss)DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Majka and Burgers, 2004</xref>). After loading, PCNA can move freely on DNA, but cannot slide off a circular structure. We therefore examined the effect of purified RFC in the presence of multiply primed circular ssDNA at substrate concentrations that yielded barely detectable levels of Siz1-dependent modification in the absence of DNA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>, addition of DNA and RFC strongly stimulated the reaction. Importantly, neither RFC nor DNA alone enhanced SUMO conjugation, indicating that clamp loading rather than ring opening or the mere presence of DNA was important for stimulation. The same effect was observed with a linear biotinylated DNA containing a 3&#x02032; junction, provided that its ends were blocked by the addition of streptavidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). As RFC-dependent loading occurs in the presence or absence of streptavidin, this result implies that a stable DNA-bound state rather than the process of loading determines the efficiency of PCNA sumoylation. Consistent with the loading defect, modification of the mutant protein encoded by <italic>pol30-52</italic> was not stimulated by RFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>), whereas DNA-independent sumoylation at higher protein concentration proceeded with an efficiency comparable to the <italic>WT</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>). This again indicates that PCNA needs to encircle DNA as a trimer to be sumoylated efficiently.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Siz1 binds dsDNA by means of a SAP domain</title><p>Given that Siz1 contains a SAP domain required for PCNA sumoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Reindle <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), it appeared likely that the enhanced modification of loaded PCNA was attributable to DNA binding of the E3. We therefore asked whether budding yeast Siz1, similar to other members of the PIAS family, was indeed a DNA-binding protein. Recombinant full-length Siz1 was efficiently retained on a biotinylated 76-bp fragment of dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Its affinity for a 25-bp dsDNA was significantly reduced, and no signal was detected with a 15-bp fragment. Interestingly, binding was strictly limited to dsDNA. Siz1 did not exhibit enhanced affinity for ss&#x02013;dsDNA junctions or tailed structures when compared with linear dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that the protein primarily recognises ordinary dsDNA. To confirm the importance of the SAP domain for DNA binding, we constructed two Siz1 mutants: <italic>SAP&#x0002a;</italic>, by mutating three conserved residues within the SAP domain (G55A/K57A/L60A), and <italic>SAP</italic>&#x00394;, by deleting residues 34&#x02013;68. The purified proteins had no detectable affinity for the 76-bp dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>), indicating that the SAP domain is required for DNA binding.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The Siz1 SAP domain is dispensable for PCNA sumoylation</title><p>Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Reindle <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), deletion of the SAP domain resulted in loss of sumoylation at K164 <italic>in vivo</italic>, whereas the <italic>SAP&#x0002a;</italic> mutation had a partial effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). This pattern was mirrored in a genetic assay based on suppression of the DNA damage sensitivity of <italic>rad18</italic> mutants by loss of <italic>SIZ1</italic> function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Stelter and Ulrich, 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). The PCNA sumoylation defect of <italic>siz1(SAP</italic>&#x00394;) had previously been attributed to a defect in nuclear localisation or retention, possibly due to a lack of Siz1 association with the chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Reindle <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). However, western blot analysis of the mutated Siz1 proteins marked with a 9myc-epitope revealed strongly reduced signals for <italic>SAP</italic><sup>&#x0002a;</sup> and in particular for <italic>SAP</italic>&#x00394; in total cell extracts, implying that the lack of activity towards PCNA <italic>in vivo</italic> might be due to insufficient protein rather than ineffective nuclear localisation or defective DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>). In fact, overexpression of the mutants from a galactose-inducible promoter completely rescued the sumoylation defect of <italic>SAP</italic><sup>&#x0002a;</sup> and <italic>SAP</italic>&#x00394; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D</xref>) and fully restored the damage sensitivity of <italic>rad18</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5E</xref>). To exclude the possibility that overproduction of the mutant Siz1 proteins compensated for a loss in activity, we placed the <italic>SAP</italic>&#x00394; allele under control of the copper-inducible <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter, which resulted in protein levels comparable to <italic>WT</italic> Siz1 under control of its native promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5F</xref>). In the presence of copper sulphate, this construct almost completely rescued the phenotype of the <italic>siz1</italic> deletion with respect to DNA damage sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5G</xref>) and PCNA sumoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5H</xref>). This indicates that DNA binding of Siz1 might not be a prerequisite for efficient modification of PCNA <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Loading onto DNA changes the properties of PCNA as a sumoylation target</title><p>To directly compare the activities of the mutant proteins towards PCNA, we analysed their effects on PCNA sumoylation <italic>in vitro</italic> at a range of concentrations. In the absence of DNA, the activities of <italic>SAP&#x0002a;</italic> and <italic>SAP</italic>&#x00394; were slightly lower than those of <italic>WT</italic> Siz1, and selectivity for K164 was somewhat reduced, possibly indicating some destabilisation of the mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>). Towards loaded PCNA, both mutants were less active than the <italic>WT</italic> protein; in particular, formation of poly-SUMO chains was reduced compared with the <italic>WT</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>). Nevertheless, conjugation at K164 by the Siz1 mutants was strongly stimulated by RFC-dependent PCNA loading, indicating that DNA binding of the E3 is not primarily responsible for the effect of PCNA loading on conjugation efficiency. Similar results were obtained with a truncated construct, Siz1(1&#x02013;508), and its corresponding SAP domain mutants, although the differences in DNA-independent activities between the <italic>WT</italic> and the SAP domain mutants were even more pronounced (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>The notion that even Siz1 mutants defective in DNA binding preferentially modify PCNA when the clamp encircles DNA raised the question of whether stimulation of the reaction could be ascribed primarily to DNA-induced changes in the substrate rather than a proximity effect mediated by the binding of substrate and E3 to a common stretch of DNA. We therefore examined whether PCNA modification in the absence of Siz1 was also influenced by DNA. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref> shows <italic>in vitro</italic> sumoylation of PCNA in the presence of primed DNA as before, but at higher Ubc9 concentrations. Surprisingly, RFC stimulated Ubc9-dependent sumoylation at K127 even in the absence of Siz1 (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). As we were unable to detect any physical interactions between Ubc9 and either DNA or RFC under our experimental conditions (data not shown), we consider an indirect recruitment of Ubc9 to PCNA unlikely and favour a model in which PCNA itself, when loaded onto DNA, becomes a better substrate for sumoylation.</p><p>The inner surface of the PCNA ring is lined by several conserved basic residues, which are likely to directly contact DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Fukuda <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Lau <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Ivanov <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) and might therefore influence the conformation of loaded PCNA. Indeed, the respective mutants poorly stimulate polymerase &#x003b4;, although loading and sliding are not affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Fukuda <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Lau <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). When we examined PCNA sumoylation in two of these alleles, <italic>pol30(K20A)</italic> and <italic>pol30(K77A)</italic>, we found significant defects, in particular in <italic>pol30(K20A)</italic>, which affects a lysine predicted to interact with bound DNA close to the centre of the minor groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Ivanov <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6D</xref>). Growth and cell cycle distribution of the corresponding cultures were normal, indicating that the defects in PCNA sumoylation were not due to replication problems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6E</xref>). These observations are consistent with a change in conformation and/or flexibility of PCNA upon DNA binding that is transmitted from the inner surface to the outer rim of the clamp, where it is sensed by the sumoylation system.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Control of PCNA sumoylation by Siz1 and Ulp1</title><p>Our findings suggest an effective mechanism by which SUMO conjugation can be targeted to S phase. We have shown that the overall levels of SUMO-modified PCNA are influenced both by Siz1-dependent conjugation and by Ulp1-mediated de-conjugation. Yet, a cell cycle-dependent fluctuation of sumoylation is observed even when the relevant enzymes are defective, suggesting that changes in enzyme properties or localisation are not primarily responsible for the temporal control of PCNA modification. Instead, we found that sumoylation of PCNA <italic>in vivo</italic> prevailed whenever the clamp was associated with DNA. Considering that even in replicating cells a significant part of the cellular pool of PCNA is not bound to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Essers <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), the total extent of PCNA sumoylation in synchronised cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>) actually suggests that a major proportion of DNA-loaded PCNA is modified in S phase. Consistent with these observations, we found that the efficiency of PCNA sumoylation <italic>in vitro</italic> is influenced only to some degree by DNA binding of the E3, but more importantly by the stable loading of the clamp onto DNA. Taken together, S phase-associated sumoylation therefore appears to be triggered mainly by a change in the properties of PCNA induced by RFC-dependent loading.</p><p>We cannot exclude a minor contribution of cell cycle-dependent changes in E3 or Ulp1 activity to the regulation of PCNA sumoylation. For example, the re-localisation of Siz1 from the nucleus to the bud neck at mitosis is likely due to its cell cycle-regulated phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Johnson and Gupta, 2001</xref>) and may well affect the efficiency of PCNA sumoylation at that time. However, given that loading stimulates the reaction with recombinant proteins <italic>in vitro</italic>, and loaded PCNA can be modified outside of S phase <italic>in vivo</italic>, a change in substrate properties is sufficient to explain our observations. According to this model, Ulp1-dependent desumoylation of PCNA at the end of S phase could be induced either by a shift in the balance between conjugation and de-conjugation upon unloading or alternatively by an enhanced exposure of &#x02018;soluble' PCNA to the nuclear pore-associated Ulp1. The regulation of PCNA modification thus exemplifies how dynamic control in the SUMO system can be achieved at the substrate level despite the limited number and selectivity of conjugation factors.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Independent signals for PCNA sumoylation and ubiquitylation</title><p>In analogy to the system described here, ubiquitylation of PCNA by the E3 Rad18 was shown to be limited to the DNA-bound form both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Garg and Burgers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Davies <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). In this case, recruitment of Rad18 by the ssDNA-binding replication protein A (RPA) was found to be required for ubiquitylation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Davies <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). In contrast, depletion of RPA does not affect PCNA sumoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Davies <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>), and <italic>in vitro</italic> sumoylation of loaded PCNA proceeds efficiently in the absence of RPA. Hence, although the two modifications affect the same site on PCNA, they are initiated in response to independent signals: whereas ubiquitylation is rendered damage inducible by a dependence on the accumulation of RPA-coated ssDNA at stalled replication intermediates, the sumoylation enzymes react primarily to the loading state of the clamp itself and thereby exert an effect constitutively during S phase.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>SUMO conjugation as a probe for the conformation of PCNA</title><p>Our observations provide evidence for a conformational change of the clamp upon loading. This concept has been postulated based on molecular dynamics simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Ivanov <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), but has not been demonstrated experimentally due to the difficulties associated with analysing interactions of a topological rather than an affinity-based nature. Interactions between PCNA and several other replication proteins are well known to be affected by DNA. For example, polymerase &#x003b4; is stimulated only by DNA-bound PCNA, and the productive mode of interaction between PCNA and the flap endonuclease FEN-1 that occurs on DNA differs from that observed in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Jonsson <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Gomes and Burgers, 2000</xref>). However, as both polymerase &#x003b4; and FEN-1 are DNA-binding proteins themselves, their stimulation by loaded PCNA might be due to their own rearrangement on DNA rather than a conformational change of the clamp. This is unlikely to apply to Ubc9; yet the E2 is able to differentiate between loaded and unloaded PCNA. Hence, the sensitivity of the SUMO conjugation system to the loading state of PCNA demonstrates for the first time that contacts between the DNA and the basic inner surface of the clamp can have an impact on residues situated on the outer edge. Changes in the properties of PCNA may well affect its interactions with other replication- or repair-associated proteins. For example, a contribution of conformational changes within PCNA itself to Rad18-dependent ubiquitylation cannot be excluded until a ligase mutant deficient in DNA binding is examined. A detailed understanding of the nature of these conformational changes will have to await the structural characterisation of PCNA in complex with DNA.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Yeast strains</title><p>Standard procedures were followed for the growth and manipulation of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>.
