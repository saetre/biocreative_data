CD36 is involved in the transformation of latent TGF-&#x003b2;1 (L-TGF-&#x003b2;1) to active TGF-&#x003b2;1. To clarify the role of CD36 in the development of silica-induced lung fibrosis, a rat silicosis model was used to observe both the inhibition of L-TGF-&#x003b2;1 activation and the antifibrotic effect obtained by lentiviral vector silencing of CD36 expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The rat silicosis model was induced by intratracheal injection of 10 mg silica per rat and CD36 expression was silenced by administration of a lentiviral vector (Lv-shCD36).

The pathogenesis of silicosis involves alveolar cell injury and activation followed by cytokine signaling and cell recruitment in the areas of silica dust deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The cytokine transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;1 (TGF-&#x003b2;1) plays a critical role in the progression of lung fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and it has been widely studied with respect to its vital role in the development of fibrosis after injury to the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2;1 is synthesized by virtually all cell types in an inactive form referred to as latent TGF-&#x003b2;1 (L-TGF-&#x003b2;1) consisting of the mature TGF-&#x003b2;1 and latent-associated peptide (LAP). Due to the noncovalently association of mature TGF-&#x003b2;1 with LAP, the L-TGF-&#x003b2;1 is unable to be recognized by cell-surface receptors and to trigger biological responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In fact, one of the primary mechanisms of TGF-&#x003b2;1 regulation is the control of its conversion from a latent precursor to the biologically active form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. CD36, as a receptor of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), plays an important role in the processes of L-TGF-&#x003b2;1 activation. A number of studies have demonstrated that L-TGF-&#x003b2;1 associates with TSP-1 to form the TSP-1/L-TGF-&#x003b2;1 complex via the specific interaction between LAP and TSP-1. The TSP-1/L-TGF-&#x003b2;1 complex associates with CD36 on cell surface via the specific interaction between the YRVRFLAKENVTQDAEDNC (93&#x02013;110) sequence of CD36 and the sequence CSVTCG (447&#x02013;452) of TSP-1. Then, L-TGF-&#x003b2;1 is held at the cell surface by a TSP-1/CD36 interaction and is processed by plasmin generated by activated alveolar macrophages to produce active TGF-&#x003b2;1. The CD36-TSP-1/L-TGF-&#x003b2;1 interaction appears critical to the activation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We presume that silencing expression of CD36 could inhibit activation of L-TGF-&#x003b2;1 and result in prevention of the development of lung fibrosis.</p><p>A lentiviral vector expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) specific for rat CD36 (Lv-shCD36) was constructed and shown to suppress expression of CD36 and inhibit the activation of L-TGF-&#x003b2;1 in a rat alveolar macrophage cell line called NR8383 (data not shown and will be presented in another manuscript). In the current study, a rat silicosis model was generated by intratracheal instillation, and the inhibitory effects of Lv-shCD36 on the activation of L-TGF-&#x003b2;1 and the resulting antifibrotic effects were examined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Experimental animals and design</title><p>Equal proportions of male and female Wistar rats at 9 weeks of age, weighing 220&#x02013;240 g, were obtained from the Center of Experimental Animals, China Medical University (Shenyang, China) with a National Animal Use License number of SCXK-LN 2003-0009. The animals were housed at an environmental temperature of 24 &#x000b1; 1&#x000b0;C and a 12/12 h light/dark cycles, with free access to food and water.

Lv-shCD36, a lentiviral vector expressing shRNA specific against rat CD36, was developed for a prior study, and it suppressed the expression of CD36 (data not shown and will be presented in another manuscript).

Rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/rat pentobarbital sodium. The skin of the neck was opened and blunt dissection exposed the trachea. Either physiological saline, silica in physiological saline, or silica with Lv-shCD36 or Lv-shCD36-NC in physiological saline, was instilled into the lungs using a 14-gauge needle inserted into the trachea through the epiglottis of the larynx. The site of surgery was sutured and the rats were allowed to recover until they were sacrificed. At 7, 21 and 28 days post-instillation, eight rats of each group were anesthetized with anesthetic ether, sacrificed by decapitation, and the lungs were removed.

An experimental animal model of silicosis was induced by an intratracheal administration of silica dust, resulting in varying degrees of fibrotic silicosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Following silica-induced lung injury, AMs were stimulated and they secreted large quantities of biologically active TGF-&#x003b2;1, which plays a critical role in the development of lung fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Recent research suggests that a polyclonal anti-TGF antibody or the proteoglycan decorin, a TGF-&#x003b2;1 binding protein, could block TGF-&#x003b2;1 and markedly reduce extracellular matrix accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We hypothesized that it would be also effective to inhibit the activation of TGF-&#x003b2;1 in an attempt to prevent development of silica-induced lung fibrosis.</p><p>CD36 may be involved in silica-induced lung fibrosis, because of its specific combination with TSP-1, which is a critical factor in the activation of L-TGF-&#x003b2;1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Accordingly, in our previous work RNAi technology was used to construct a recombinant lentiviral vector, Lv-shCD36, which expresses shRNA specific against rat CD36. Lv-shCD36 was demonstrated to inhibit the activation of L-TGF-&#x003b2;1 <italic>in vivo </italic>using the rat alveolar macrophage cell line NR8383 (data not shown and will be presented in another manuscript). In the current study, Lv-shCD36 was used to test for inhibition of L-TGF-&#x003b2;1 activation and an antifibrotic effect in a rat silicosis experimental model. To determine effect of Lv-shCD36 on CD36 in the lungs of rats, AMs were isolated from BALF seven days after instillation to detect the expression of CD36 mRNA by real time-PCR. The result suggests that Lv-shCD36 can suppress CD36 mRNA expression in the AMs. Examination of total and active TGF-&#x003b2;1 in the BALF in the early phase of the experimental silicosis demonstrated that Lv-shCD36 could depress the quantity and percentage of active TGF-&#x003b2;1. Therefore, we believe that Lv-shCD36 could inhibit activation of L-TGF-&#x003b2;1 by decreasing expression of CD36 on the membrane of AMs to further reduce the combination of CD36 with TSP-1/L-TGF-&#x003b2;1.</p><p>Activated TGF-&#x003b2;1 can bind its receptor on membrane of lung fibroblast to regulate collagen synthesis and degradation that ultimately results in lung fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Inhibiting activation of L-TGF-&#x003b2;1 could suppress development of silica-induced lung fibrosis. This study shows that the hydroxyproline content of the silica+Lv-shCD36 group was significantly lower than the silica and silica+Lv-shCD36-NC groups at 21 and 28 days after instillation. The results of immunohistochemical examination of collagen I and III showed that the IOD average of both collagens of the silica+Lv-shCD36 group were significantly lower than in the silica and silica+Lv-shCD36-NC groups. Furthermore, the pathological examination revealed an obviously lighter degree of fibrosis in the silica+Lv-shCD36 group than in the silica and silica+Lv-shCD36-NC groups. We conclude that Lv-shCD36 could reduce pathological tissue fibrosis and collagen accumulation in the rat model of silicosis, and therefore, it could inhibit the development of silicosis.</p><p>In the experimental lung fibrosis model, the AMs generate maximal quantities of L-TGF-&#x003b2;1 at 7 days after instillation of the early phase of lung fibrosis. After L-TGF-&#x003b2;1 was processed to become active form, the active TGF-&#x003b2;1 starts the occurrence and development of lung fibrosis. In the mid and late phases of the experimental lung fibrosis model, the amount of TGF-&#x003b2;1 released by the AMs declines gradually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In the experimental silicosis model, there are primarily inflammatory changes and cellular nodules in the early phase. With the development of fibrosis, there are fibrotic cellular nodules, cellular fibrotic nodules, even fibrotic nodules in the mid and late phases of the experimental silicosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This study also shows that in the early phase, the quantities of L-TGF-&#x003b2;1 were obvious high compared with those at 21 days after instillation, and the quantity and percentage of active TGF-&#x003b2;1 were depressed by Lv-shCD36 at 7 days after instillation. At 21 and 28 days after instillation, the degree of silicosis was inhibited obviously by Lv-shCD36. Accordingly, CD36 may participate in the activation process of L-TGF-&#x003b2;1 in the early phase of the experimental silicosis. Furthermore, silencing expression of CD36 prevented the development of silicosis via inhibiting the activation of L-TGF-&#x003b2;1. Silicosis patients usually have exposed to low dose of silica dust for a long time. Silicosis is a chronic and progressive pathologic reaction. The pathological process of silicosis occurs and develops repeatedly. So, we presume that CD36 also repeatedly participates in the activation of L-TGF-&#x003b2;1 and the pathological process of silicosis. These results provide a new molecular basis for understanding latency and activation of L-TGF-&#x003b2;1, which should aid in the design of novel strategies to suppress silica-induced lung fibrosis through modulating inappropriate levels of TGF-&#x003b2;1 activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown that silencing expression of CD36 inhibits activation of L-TGF-&#x003b2;1, which results in reduced hydroxyproline, collagen synthesis, and further prevention of the development of lung fibrosis. These effects may be through the suppression of the association of the TSP-1/L-TGF-&#x003b2;1 complex with CD36. Our data support the view that CD36 may contribute to the control of the activation of L-TGF-&#x003b2;1 and, therefore, silencing expression of CD36 could inhibit development of silica-induced lung fibrosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>L-TGF-&#x003b2;1: latent transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;1; TSP-1: thrombospondin-1; shRNA: short hairpin RNA; BALF: bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; AMs: alveolar macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>XW carried out the experiments, participated in the experimental design and in the interpretation of data, and drafted the manuscript.
