Despite current advances in therapy, including surgical resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy, the prognosis for patients with GBM remains poor. Unfortunately, most patients die within 2 years of diagnosis of their disease. Molecular abnormalities vary among individual patients and also within each tumor. Indeed, one of the distinguishing features of GBM is its marked genetic heterogeneity. Due to the brain location of the tumor, the potential target inhibition for anticancer therapy must exhibit a manageable neurotoxicity profile in the concentration range in which the compounds show anti-proliferative activity.</p><p>Kinesin KIF11 inhibition by small molecules such as Monastrol or Ispinesib is currently under investigation in the field of malignant tumors. In the current study we have assessed the relevance of the anti-mitotic Kinesin-like protein KIF11 in human GBM cell-lines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this study the target was validated using a set of well characterised and potentially specific small molecule inhibitors of KIF11: an ispinesib analog, Monastrol, a Merck compound and 3 simplified derivatives of the Merck compound. Following an <italic>in silico </italic>selection, those compounds predicted to bear a favorable BBB permeation profile were assessed for their phenotypic effect on cell lines derived both from primary (U87MG) as well as treated (DBTRG-05-MG) glioblastomas. For some compounds, these data could be compared to their effect on normal human astrocytes, as well as their neurotoxicity on primary rat cortical neurons. The ispinesib analogue 1 showed an anti-proliferative effect on GBM cell lines by blocking them in the G2/M phase in a concentration range which was shown to be harmless to primary rat cortical neurons. Furthermore, ispinesib analog increased caspase 3/7-induced apoptosis in U87MG cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the area of cell cycle inhibition, KIF11 is critical for proper spindle assembly and represents an attractive anticancer target. Our results suggest that KIF11 inhibitors, when able to permeate the blood-brain-barrier, could represent an interesting class of anticancer drugs with low neurotoxic effects in the treatment of brain tumors.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Malignant gliomas, the most common subtype of primary brain tumors, are aggressive, highly invasive, and neurologically destructive tumors considered being amongst the deadliest forms of human cancers. The most widely used scheme for classification and grading of gliomas is that of the World Health Organization (WHO). Gliomas are graded on a scale from I to IV according to their degree of malignancy; the most aggressive being grade IV or Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM).</p><p>The current study focused on GBM as it is considered the most common and most dramatic primary brain tumor in adults, with highest incidence in the elderly. Median survival for patients affected with GBM is only 9 to 15 months, and the majority of patients die within 2 years. The only -albeit moderately &#x02013; successful currently used standard of care consists of a combination of surgery, chemo- and radiotherapy. Following surgery, patients are typically subjected to radiotherapy in combination with Temozolomide, an orally available DNA alkylating agent. Subsequently patients are further kept under Temozolomide treatment. Although there is no real difference in clinical benefit between patients with primary (de novo) or secondary (originally derived from low grade gliomas) GBMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], an impressive improvement of Temozolomide efficacy has been shown in patients expressing a methylated promotor of the methyl-guanidine-methyl transferase (MGMT) gene. The latter encodes for a DNA repair enzyme and is deemed responsible for a decreased Temozolomide DNA alkylating efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This limitation, together with the inherent, mechanism of action-linked toxicity of Temozolide also implies that the identification of better, molecular targeted therapies for the treatment of GBM remains.</p><p>In order to successfully eradicate GBM, a number of obstacles due to the location (the brain) and the nature (heterogeneous, infiltrating) of the tumor have to be overcome. GBMs do not only grow locally but infiltrate neighboring brain tissue through white matter tracts, perivascular, and periventricular spaces, and invading cells are often found centimeters away from the primary tumor mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The tumor's invasive nature is one of the cardinal features of malignant gliomas. This results in the inability of surgery to cure patients even when lesions arise in areas in which wide surgical resection would be possible. Chemotherapy should therefore be aimed at also affecting those tumor cells which are located in unresectable tumor areas. Since the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) could be expected to be intact in these areas, disease-modifying pharmacological intervention requires BBB-penetrating compounds.</p><p>Predicting central nervous system (CNS) partitioning remains a major challenge in drug design and needs to take a series of molecular properties into account already at the compound library design stage. <italic>In vivo </italic>experimental determination of blood-brain partitioning is difficult. It is time-consuming, expensive, and not suitable to screen large collections of chemicals or to assess the permeation of compounds at the beginning of the discovery process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. <italic>In vitro </italic>methods (passive artificial membrane permeability models, cellular monolayer models) are useful, although predictivity remains limited as the models cannot completely mimic the complexity of a dynamic <italic>in vivo </italic>system. Therefore computational (<italic>in silico) </italic>models have been developed in order to allow screening of large collections of compounds and to understand structure-activity relationships. From a target point of view, successful GBM treatment is hampered by the tumors cellular heterogeneity which features include proliferative, hypoxic and invasive cells.</p><p>Within the current study we decided to focus on the analysis of targets which affect GBM proliferation since in general anticancer drugs that perturb mitosis have been shown to play an important role in the therapy of malignant diseases. Targeted therapies under current investigation that are known to affect the cell cycle could be subdivided in three categories:</p><p>- Kinase inhibitors (mostly Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)</p><p>- DNA modifying agents (Alkylating agents, Topoisomerase inhibitors)</p><p>- Tubulin/microtubules modulators</p><p>Kinase inhibitors of the ATP-competitive sort are at risk of potential toxicity in relation to their potential lack of selectivity within the kinome. DNA modifying agents are known for their toxicity and/or drug resistance issues. Some tubulin/microtubule modulators show a significant effect on mitosis-independent cytoskeletal functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] such as maintenance of organelles, cell shape and intracellular transport phenomena. Since, especially neuronal processes highly depend on an intact cytoskeleton; the tubulin/microtubule modulator of choice should be such that only tumor mitosis is affected, leaving the mitosis-independent (and thus neuronal) functions untouched. Therefore, the potential value of kinesin inhibitors has been assessed. Kinesins are eukaryotic microtubule-associated motor proteins, which convert chemical energy released from nucleoside triphosphates (preferentially from ATP) into mechanical energy. There are over forty kinesins found in humans which all have a similar motor domain that uses ATP to perform its power stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The difference between them is mostly determined by the nature of the adapters that attach the motor to the object that needs to be moved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Kinesins can be classified according to function as either transport or mitotic kinesins. Transport kinesins play amongst others an essential role in the cytosolic movement and localization of synaptic vesicles in neurons and in physiological axonal transport processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Mitotic kinesins are involved in mitotic spindle assembly, maintenance and elongation, chromosome alignment and segregation, and microtubule depolymerisation, among other functions during cell division.</p><p>In this panorama, only the identification of highly specific and preferentially allosteric mitotic kinesin inhibitors which have the capacity to penetrate the BBB represent according to us a promising class of novel therapeutics for GBM.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Descriptors calculation and BBB permeation prediction. Compound 1 is active and predicted to be BBB permeable</title><p>Kinesin inhibitors (compounds <bold>1&#x02013;6</bold>,) were analyzed in VolSurf for their CNS-partitioning properties, producing 94 molecular descriptors (grid spacing 0.5 &#x000c5;) using three probes: a water probe (OH2) for hydrophilicity, a hydrophobic (DRY) probe computing the hydrophobic energy to be balanced with the hydrophilic energy computed by the OH2 probe, and a carbonyl oxygen probe (O) representing the hydrogen bond potential of the compounds. The DRY probe is a specific probe to compute hydrophobicity that can be estimated by means of the computation of three terms: the Lennard-Jones potential (that includes stacking, induction, and dispersion interactions with a maximum around -2.0 kcal/mol), the entropic (about -0.8 kcal/mol) and hydrogen-bonding contributions. The prediction of these seven compounds onto the global BBB model implemented in VolSurf resulted as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Projection of the seven kinesin inhibitors onto the Volsurf global BBB model</bold>.

Furthermore, the compound affects only the KIF11 function and not the transport kinesins.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In the current study, mitotic kinesin KIF11, which is required for the separation of duplicated centrosomes and for the spindle formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], was deemed to be a promising target for glioblastoma treatment. The expression profile of KIF11 mRNA in glioblastoma cells versus normal astrocytes was first assessed. KIF11 mRNA expression is reported to be elevated in tumor samples compared with adjacent normal tissue in tumors derived from breast, colon, lung, ovary, rectum and uterus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We confirmed this trend in GBM cell-lines (U87MG and DBTRG-05-MG) versus normal human astrocytes (data not shown).</p><p>Forward chemical genetics were applied to investigate the phenotypic effect of KIF11 inhibitors on GBM proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle. This implied the selection BBB-permeating compounds known to specifically inhibit the target without affecting normal brain function.</p><p>To perform this study, we had access to a panel of existing preclinical efficacious KIF11 inhibitors. Monastrol (<bold>3</bold>), the first reported small molecule inhibitor, the quinazolinone derivative inhibitor from Cytokinetics SB-715992 and MKI-833, the Merck reported inhibitor (<bold>2</bold>) were demonstrated to be potent inhibitors of cell proliferation in several human tumor cell-lines (lung NCI-H460, A549; breast MDA-MB-231, MCF-7; colon HT29; ovarian SKOV-3, OVCAR-3; leukaemia HL-60, K-562, CNS SF-268; renal A498; osteosarcoma U2-OS; cervical HeLa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Ispinesib is being advanced to <italic>Phase II clinical trials </italic>as a general cancer therapeutic agent for cancers such as breast, ovarian and others. Moreover Monastrol (<bold>3</bold>) and other monastrol analogues are reported to be specific inhibitors of human GBM cells inducing growth inhibition and affecting spindle formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] without affecting the other kinesin-driven motor functions. Moreover, we selected a small set of Merck compound analogues whose smaller size meant they had greater probability of being brain penetrant. Since reaching the tumor in the brain was considered a critical criterion, only those compounds predicted to be BBB permeant were further investigated. The ability to pass the BBB is dependent on multiple factors, including lipophilicity, ionization profile, molecular size, polar surface area and molecular flexibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Relatively lipophilic drugs can cross the BBB by passive diffusion while polar molecules normally do not cross it unless they are substrates of specific active transport systems. There are several computational <italic>in silico </italic>tools that help chemists and biologists understand the complex physico-chemical features of compounds, and hence to predict the BBB properties of a molecule. In this study, two computational-statistical suites have been used for that purpose: VolSurf (VOLSURF, version 4.0; available from Molecular Discovery Ltd.: London, U.K. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.moldiscovery.com"/>) and Cerius2 (Cerius2 version 4.11, available from Accelrys Inc. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.accelrys.com"/>). These data provided a robust base for assigning the probability of compounds for crossing the BBB based on their physico-chemical profile. Only compounds <bold>2</bold>, <bold>3</bold>, <bold>4</bold>, <bold>5 </bold>and <bold>6</bold>, having passed the BBB selection filter, were further analyzed for their capacity to affect cell proliferation, to block the cell cycle and to induce apoptosis. We showed that the Ispinesib analogue compound <bold>1 </bold>(Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) has a higher anti-proliferative activity against human GBM cell lines when compared to Monastrol (<bold>3</bold>) and to the Merk fragments (<bold>4</bold>, <bold>5 </bold>and <bold>6</bold>). The effect of compound <bold>1 </bold>on GBM cell-lines was also reflected by an increase of caspase 3 activity and by cell cycle block in G2/M phase.</p><p>In the neurotoxicity experiments carried against normal human astrocytes and rat cortical neurons, compound <bold>1 </bold>revealed to be characterized by a relatively broad therapeutic window. This could at least partially be attributed to compound <bold>1 </bold>selectivity for KIF11 over transport kinesins.</p><p>Monastrol (<bold>3</bold>), Ispinesib MKI-833 (<bold>2</bold>) and the majority of KIF11 inhibitors have been shown to have the same mechanism of action; they allosterically alter the ability of KIF11 to bind to microtubules and inhibit their movement by preventing the release of ADP without preventing the release of the KIF11-ADP complex from the microtubule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This non-ATP binding, allosteric site, which is formed by helices &#x003b1;2 and &#x003b1;3 and Loop 5 appears to be specific for KIF11. However, several studies have shown that loop 5 mutations may induce resistance problems such as those demonstrated in colorectal cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Should such mutability be identified in GBM patients as well, a need for KIF11 inhibitors that bind away from loop 5 may arise. The design of such novel KIF11 inhibitors, should take into account the recent evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] that ATP-competitive compounds can/should not interfere with microtubule dynamics.</p><p>Overall, although specific KIF11 inhibitors are of great value to GBM, mechanism-based toxicity of kinesin inhibitors in general may limit the development of specific mitosis inhibitors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study we combined chemical, <italic>in silico </italic>ADME and PK properties and biological approaches to analyze the effect of a pannel of mitotic kinesin KIF11 inhibitors on Glioblastoma cell lines. Following an <italic>in silico </italic>selection for BBB penetration, KIF11 inhibitors were analysed for their effect on cell proliferation, cell-cycle and apoptosis induction. The Ispinesib analog <bold>1</bold>, which resulted able to not only affect cell proliferation, but also block cell cycle and induce apoptosis, was tested in normal human astrocytes and in rat pure cortical neurons to evaluate its therapeutic window and neurotoxicity. Although specific KIF11 inhibitors demonstrating a broad therapeutic window could be of great value for the treatment of GBM, the design of these compounds is hampered by high homology between motor and mitotic kinesins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Physico-chemical descriptors</title><p>VolSurf is molecular modeling software that generates 2D molecular descriptors from 3D molecular interaction field (MIF) on GRID maps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].
