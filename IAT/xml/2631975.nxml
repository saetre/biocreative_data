Furthermore, three separate mutations cause early onset forms of PD and DLB. It is particularly telling that duplications or triplications of the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>), which increase levels of &#x003b1;-synuclein with no alteration in sequence, also cause PD or DLB.</p><p>&#x003b1;-Synuclein has been reported to be phosphorylated on serine residues, at Ser-87 and Ser-129 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>), although to date only the Ser-129 phosphorylation has been identified in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Phosphorylation at tyrosine residues has been observed by some investigators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>) but not by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Phosphorylation at Ser-129 (p-Ser-129) is of particular interest because the majority of synuclein in Lewy bodies contains this modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). In addition, p-Ser-129 was found to be the most extensive and consistent modification in a survey of synuclein in Lewy bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Results have been mixed from studies investigating the function of phosphorylation using S129A and S129D mutations to respectively block and mimic the modification. Although the phosphorylation mimic was associated with pathology in studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>) and in transgenic mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>), studies using adeno-associated virus vectors to overexpress &#x003b1;-synuclein in rat substantia nigra found an exacerbation of pathology with the S129A mutation, whereas the S129D mutation was benign, if not protective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). Interpretation of these studies is complicated by a recent study showing that the S129D and S129A mutations themselves have effects on the aggregation properties of &#x003b1;-synuclein independent of their effects on phosphorylation, with the S129A mutation stimulating fibril formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). Clearly, determination of the role of p-Ser-129 phosphorylation would be helped by identification of the responsible kinase. In addition, identification will provide a pathologically relevant way to increase phosphorylation in a cell or animal model.</p><p>Several kinases have been proposed to phosphorylate &#x003b1;-synuclein, including casein kinases 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>) and members of the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). In this report, we offer evidence that a member of the polo-like kinase (PLK) family, PLK2 (or serum-inducible kinase, SNK), functions as an &#x003b1;-synuclein kinase. The ability of PLK2 to directly phosphorylate &#x003b1;-synuclein at Ser-129 is established by overexpression in cell culture and by <italic>in vitro</italic> reaction with the purified kinase. We show that PLK2 phosphorylates &#x003b1;-synuclein in cells, including primary neuronal cultures, using a series of kinase inhibitors as well as inhibition of expression with RNA interference. In addition, inhibitor and knock-out studies in mouse brain support a role for PLK2 as an &#x003b1;-synuclein kinase <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Kinase Assays</italic>&#x02014;To prepare biotinylated &#x003b1;-synuclein substrate, a cysteine residue was introduced into the C terminus (141C-&#x003b1;Syn) of the recombinant &#x003b1;-synuclein expression construct previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>), using site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange XL, Stratagene), and the resulting &#x003b1;-synuclein mutant was prepared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). The C-terminal cysteine was biotinylated with maleimide-polyethylene glycol 2-biotin (Pierce).

Europium cryptate-labeled p-Ser-129-specific11A5 antibody (2 n<sc>m</sc>) and streptavidin-allophycocyanin (7.5 n<sc>m</sc>) were added in the same reaction volume of buffer C (25 m<sc>m</sc> Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.8 <sc>m</sc> KF, 66 n<sc>m</sc> EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), and fluorescence intensity was measured. Uniform phosphorylation of the p-Ser-129 &#x003b1;-synuclein standard was confirmed by reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy. The p-Ser-129 &#x003b1;-synuclein standard curve was obtained under the same conditions as for measurement of assay samples, without kinase. Unphosphorylated &#x003b1;-synuclein was added to keep the total synuclein constant at 33 n<sc>m</sc>. For inhibitor studies, compounds were serially diluted in buffer B, with a PLK2 concentration of 0.3 n<sc>m</sc>.</p><p><italic>Targeted Gene Disruption and Generation of Plk2</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup><italic><sup>/</sup></italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup><italic>Mice</italic>&#x02014;<italic>plk2</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice were prepared by Caliper Life Sciences.

Such knockdown approaches have the advantage of avoiding artificial activity resulting from overexpression. Several kinases whose reduction decreased synuclein phosphorylation were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). Of the candidate kinases, PLK2 was of particular interest because the siRNAs against this enzyme provided the largest and most consistent decrease in &#x003b1;-synuclein phosphorylation. Importantly, PLK2, as well as the closely related PLK3, are expressed in brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>).</p><p><italic>PLK Family Members Directly Phosphorylate</italic> &#x003b1;<italic>-Synuclein</italic>&#x02014;To confirm that PLK2 can directly phosphorylate &#x003b1;-synuclein, we examined the proteins <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Phosphorylation at Ser-129 was measured with a fluorescence assay using an antibody specific for phosphorylation at this residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>); no other phosphorylation was observed by mass spectroscopy.

PLK1 had lower activity, comparable with that of CK2. To ensure that all enzymes were active, their abilities to phosphorylate another substrate, casein, were verified (supplemental Fig. S1).

As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>, transduction with the PLK2 shRNA vectors caused substantial reduction of PLK2 message levels (by as much as 64%) and a parallel reduction of p-Ser-129 &#x003b1;-synuclein (as much as 78%). No effect was observed on PLK3 mRNA or total &#x003b1;-synuclein levels, and there was no cellular toxicity detected by Alamar Blue assay, suggesting that the effect on phospho-&#x003b1;-synuclein was mediated by specific mRNA silencing (data not shown).</p><p>We have compared the potency of selected kinase inhibitors against PLK2 in mouse primary cortical cultures with their potency in the biochemical PLK2 assay. Many of the studies investigating CK2 as an &#x003b1;-synuclein kinase have used the inhibitor DMAT. We also find that DMAT inhibits &#x003b1;-synuclein phosphorylation in mouse cortical cultures, with an EC<sub>50</sub> around 30 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>. However, it also inhibits PLK2 in the biochemical assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>). APMU (compound <bold>3</bold> in Johnson <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>)), which has good activity against PLK2 and -3 but is inactive against PLK1, inhibited &#x003b1;-synuclein phosphorylation in mouse cortical cultures. These results, together with the lower activity for PLK1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>), suggest a limited role, if any, for PLK1 as an &#x003b1;-synuclein kinase. BI2536 has high potency and specificity for PLK family kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>) (see profiling results in supplemental Table S1). This compound inhibited up to 85&#x02013;90% of &#x003b1;-synuclein phosphorylation in the cortical cultures, with an EC<sub>50</sub> in multiple assays of 50&#x02013;100 n<sc>m</sc>.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Reduction of p-Ser-129 &#x003b1;-synuclein by inhibition of PLK2.</bold><italic>A&#x02013;D</italic>, inhibition of &#x003b1;-synuclein phosphorylation by BI2536 (&#x025aa;), AMPU (&#x025b5;), or DMAT (&#x02022;) by recombinant PLK2 in the <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay (<italic>A</italic>), in mouse cortical cultures (<italic>B</italic>), and in HEK293 cells by endogenous kinase (transfected with empty vector) (<italic>C</italic>) or by transfected PLK2 (<italic>D</italic>).

Transfection with PLK2 increases the levels of synuclein phosphorylation over 10-fold so that almost all of the activity could be attributed to the transfected kinase. Good agreement was observed between inhibitor potencies in the presence and absence of overexpressed PLK2. In the absence of kinase transfection, the maximum inhibition of p-Ser-129 &#x003b1;-synuclein was around 60%. The remainder may be due to an additional kinase in these cells.</p><p>BI2536 was used to validate the role of PLK family members in &#x003b1;-synuclein phosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Mice were dosed intravenously with BI2536, the brains were collected, and the levels of total and p-Ser-129 &#x003b1;-synuclein in cortical extracts were measured by ELISA. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>, consistent and significant inhibition of &#x003b1;-synuclein phosphorylation was observed.</p><p>The effect of removal of the <italic>plk2</italic> gene on &#x003b1;-synuclein levels was also investigated using PLK2 knock-out mice. Primary cortical cultures from a homozygous knock-out mouse were compared with those from wild-type (<italic>plk2</italic><sup>+/+</sup>) littermates. Measurement of mRNA levels by qRT-PCR showed that PLK2 expression was completely ablated. Comparison of &#x003b1;-synuclein and p-Ser-129 &#x003b1;-synuclein levels in primary cortical cultures from knock-out and wild-type littermates showed that &#x003b1;-synuclein phosphorylation was decreased by about 70%.

Studies with inhibitors additionally suggest that PLK2 and PLK3 are responsible for the majority of &#x003b1;-synuclein phosphorylation in cultured neurons and in mouse brain. PLK2-specific shRNA knockdown and genetic deletion of the <italic>plk2</italic> gene in mice identify a role for this kinase in particular.</p><p>Previous studies of PLK2 have identified several properties that are particularly intriguing for an &#x003b1;-synuclein kinase. It is induced by excitotoxic glutamate agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). Furthermore, Sheng and colleagues have proposed that PLK2 has a critical role in maintaining dendritic spine stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>) and modulating excitatory glutaminergic synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). Thus, the involvement of PLK2 in &#x003b1;-synuclein phosphorylation provides a potential link between excitotoxic responses and Lewy pathology. Investigation of how the biology of PLK2 relates to the pathogenesis of PD and DLB should help clarify the role of synuclein phosphorylation in these diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="C800206200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="C800206200_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="C800206200_2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Pearl Tang, Anna Liao, and Chris Nishioka for expert technical work; Seymond Pon and Melissa Monahan for managing and tracking the mice used in this study; Wes Zmolek, Eric Goldbach, and Heather Zhang for determining in vivo compound levels; Donald E.
