Interleukin (IL)-12 is considered to be important in the generation of the allergen-specific T cell response. Loss of IL-12 function in IL-12R&#x003b2;2&#x02013;deficient mice, however, did not ameliorate the allergic immune response, suggesting alternate IL-12&#x02013;independent pathways in the induction of CHS. Because exposure to contact allergens always takes place in the presence of microbial skin flora, we investigated the potential role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the induction of CHS. Using mice deficient in TLR4, the receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), IL-12 receptor (R) &#x003b2;2, or both, we show that the concomitant absence of TLR4 and IL-12R&#x003b2;2, but not the absence of TLR4 or IL-12R&#x003b2;2 alone, prevented DC-mediated sensitization, generation of effector T cells, and the subsequent CHS response to 2,4,6-trinitro-1-chlorobenzene (TNCB), oxazolone, and fluorescein isothiocyanate. Introduction of the TLR4 transgene into the TLR4/IL-12R&#x003b2;2 mutant restored the CHS inducibility, showing a requirement for TLR4 in IL-12&#x02013;independent CHS induction. Furthermore, the concomitant absence of TLR2 and TLR4 prevented the induction of CHS to TNCB in IL-12&#x02013;competent mice. Finally, CHS was inducible in germ-free wild-type and IL-12R&#x003b2;2&#x02013;deficient mice, but not in germ-free TLR4/IL-12R&#x003b2;2 double deficient mice, suggesting that the necessary TLR activation may proceed via endogenous ligands.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: ACD, allergic contact dermatitis; CHS, contact hypersensitivity; HA, hyaluronic acid; i.c., intracutaneous; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotide; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TNCB, 2,4,6-trinitro-1-chlorobenzene; TNBS, 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene-1-sulfonic acid; TRIF, Toll/IL-1 receptor domain&#x02013;containing adaptor-inducing interferon-&#x003b2;.</p></fn><fn><p>S.F.

Contact hypersensitivity (CHS), the recognized mouse model for studying human ACD, involves painting a small area of abdominal skin with the allergen (sensitization), e.g., 2,4,6-trinitro-1-chlorobenzene (TNCB), followed by an epicutaneous challenge 5 d later on a previously unexposed site, usually the ear (elicitation). The CHS response is then measured as the increase in ear thickness 24 h later. During the sensitizing contact, the hapten binds to proteins in the skin, altering their antigenic specificity, and the newly created antigens are then processed by epidermal (Langerhans cells) and dermal DCs. A crucial event in this sensitization phase is the induction of a transient skin inflammation via activation of the innate immune system, culminating in the migration of activated DC, bearing hapten&#x02013;peptide complexes, to the draining lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). During this time, DCs up-regulate costimulatory molecules on their surface, produce IL-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), and polarize to a Th1/Tc1 (CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cytotoxic type 1 T cells)-inducing DC phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). After completing their maturation, the immigrated DC prime hapten-specific naive T cells in an IL-12&#x02013;dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), giving rise to allergen-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells which express skin-specific homing receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). More recently, however, it was suggested that both Th1 and Th2 cells play a role in CHS and that their equilibrium is dependent on the identity of the antigen. The crucial role of Th1/Tc1 cells in the induction of CHS has been questioned by a study using Tyk2-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). In this study, sensitization with TNCB resulted in an enhanced CHS response despite an impaired IL-12 signaling and Th2 polarization. Furthermore, the FITC-induced CHS was shown to be Th2 type driven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Reexposure of the sensitized mice to the allergen elicits the infiltration of hapten-specific effector and memory T cells that orchestrate the characteristic local inflammatory response with edema 24&#x02013;72 h later.</p><p>Although considerable information exists on several aspects of CHS development, the events leading to the skin inflammation that is necessary for both sensitization and elicitation with allergen are not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). A striking observation is that contact allergens, similar to the highly conserved microbial constituents (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) which are sensed by Toll-like receptors (TLR; for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), activate NF-&#x003ba;B and MAP kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Notably, the inflammatory reaction resembles the local inflammatory response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). This response is accompanied by the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, up-regulation of costimulatory molecules, and an influx of blood cells into the inflamed tissue. The skin, as the site of exposure to contact allergens, is also continuously exposed to environmental microbial flora and, thus, to TLR ligands. Consequently, participation of TLRs in the CHS induction may be envisaged.</p><p>In mammals, the TLR family consists of at least 11 members (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). TLR4 acts as the receptor for a most potent activator of the innate immune system, Gram-negative bacterial LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Another member of the family, TLR2, recognizes a variety of microbial components, including bacterial lipopeptides (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). In addition to microbial ligands, there is evidence that endogenous substances may also act as ligands for TLR4 and TLR2. We demonstrated earlier that oligomeric degradation products of hyaluronic acid (HA) activate human and mouse DCs via TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). More recently, HA fragments generated in vitro (135 kD) and those purified from human serum (peak 200 kD) were shown to activate mouse macrophages via TLR4 and TLR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Furthermore, HA degradation products and the two TLR receptors were reported to participate in the regulation of noninfectious mouse lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). In addition, several other endogenous factors, including proteins or peptides such as heat shock proteins, have been reported to stimulate TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we investigated the possible involvement of TLRs in the development of CHS to contact allergens. The results reveal a novel role of TLR4 in susceptibility to CHS of mice with impaired IL-12 function. We show further that the role of IL-12 and TLR4 signaling in CHS is interchangeable and that IL-12 deficiency enhances the allergic response. Finally, we show that the development of CHS is abolished in mice with an intact IL-12 function but lacking both TLR4 and TLR2. CHS was also not induced in germ-free IL-12R&#x003b2;2&#x02013;deficient mice lacking TLR4. The results suggest that the TLR activation necessary for sensitization to contact allergens may proceed via endogenous TLR ligands.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Requirement for TLR4 in IL-12&#x02013;independent CHS</title><p>To assess the possible role of TLR4 in the induction of CHS, we investigated the response of three genetically distinct strains of TLR4-deficient mice (C57BL/10: H-2<sup>b</sup>, BALB/c: H2<sup>d</sup>, and 129Sv: H-2<sup>b</sup>) to an epicutaneous application of the contact allergen TNCB. Because the Th1/Tc1 polarizing cytokine IL-12 is still regarded as a dominant factor in CHS induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), we included in the investigation TLR4 and IL-12R&#x003b2;2 single- and double-deficient mice on the same C57BL/10 background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). The TLR4 single-deficient mice and the corresponding WT controls were painted with TNCB and rechallenged with the allergen 5 d later. 24 h after rechallenge, all mice developed comparable ear swellings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>and Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070509/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070509/DC1</ext-link>), indicating that the sole absence of TLR4 had no influence on the allergic response. In a similar experiment performed in TLR4/IL-12R&#x003b2;2&#x02013;deficient mice, a CHS response to TNCB was completely absent (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Furthermore, we found that T cells from the skin-draining lymph nodes of TNCB-painted TLR4/IL-12R&#x003b2;2 double-deficient mice, in contrast to T cells from WT and TLR4 single-deficient animals, exhibited no IFN-&#x003b3; responses to an in vitro restimulation with syngeneic spleen cells modified with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene-1-sulfonic acid (TNBS; a water-soluble analogue of TNCB; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The absence of CHS correlated with the absence of significant cellular infiltration of the ear skin (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). An absence of CHS in these mice was also observed when the contact sensitizers oxazolone and FITC were used (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). Similarly, lymph node cells of oxazolone-sensitized TLR4/IL-12R&#x003b2;2 double-deficient mice, in contrast to those of WT mice, exhibited no enhanced IFN-&#x003b3; responses upon stimulation with anti-CD3 (Fig. S2). Interestingly, the same stimulation of cells from FITC-sensitized WT and double-deficient mice resulted neither in an increased IFN-&#x003b3; response (Fig. S2) nor in detectable IL-4 production (not depicted). Furthermore, although edema and cellular infiltration was present in the skin of FITC-challenged WT mice after multiple rounds of sensitization, eosinophilia, which is typical for a Th2-mediated CHS, was completely absent (Fig. S3). These data suggest that the CHS response to FITC in C57BL/10 mice, unlike in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), is not Th2 dependent.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Differential CHS response to TNCB in TLR4&#x02212;/&#x02212; and IL-12R&#x003b2;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice.</bold> (A) Different CHS responses in mutant mouse strains. Mice of the indicated strains were sensitized on the shaved abdominal skin with TNCB or acetone as vehicle control. Ear challenge with TNCB was performed 5 d later and the 24-h ear swelling response was measured. The results represent the increase in ear thickness for groups of three mice &#x000b1;SD. Differences were statistically significant at P &#x0003e; 0.05 for groups compared (marked by &#x0002a;, &#x0002a;&#x0002a;, or &#x0002a;&#x0002a;&#x0002a;, respectively). One of six independent experiments is shown. (B) IFN-&#x003b3; production by lymph node cells from mice after CHS. Lymph node cells were isolated 3 d after ear challenge and stimulated in vitro for 36 h with irradiated spleen cells with or w/o TNBS modification. IFN-&#x003b3; production was measured by ELISA. The values represent the mean of triplicate measurements &#x000b1;SD for lymph node cells from pooled mice (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 3). One of three independent experiments is shown. (C and D) Lack of CHS to oxazolone and FITC in TLR4/IL-12R&#x003b2;2 double-deficient mice. The indicated mouse strains were sensitized by abdominal painting with oxazolone (C) or FITC (D) solutions. Ear challenge was done on day 6. The results represent the increase in ear thickness for groups of three mice &#x000b1;SD. Data are representative for three independent experiments. (E) Inability of lymph node cells from sensitized mutant mice to passively transfer CHS sensitization. The indicated mouse strains were sensitized with TNCB by painting of the abdominal skin and ears. Skin-draining lymph nodes were pooled on day 5 and lymph node cells were adoptively transferred into WT recipients. Ear challenge was performed on day 6, and the 24-h swelling reaction was measured. The results represent the mean of three mice per group &#x000b1;SD. Data are representative of three independent experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2052151f01"></graphic></fig><p>Finally, lymph node cells from TNCB-painted TLR4/IL-12R&#x003b2;2 double-deficient mice were unable to adoptively transfer CHS to naive WT recipients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). These data indicate that mice with a combined TLR4 and IL-12R&#x003b2;2 deficiency fail to develop the characteristic allergen-specific type 1 CD8&#x0002b; effector T cells (Tc1) in response to sensitization. The evidence that the TNCB-induced CHS in mice on C57BL/10 background is mediated by Tc1 cells (like that in C57BL/6 mice [references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>]) is presented in Fig. S4 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070509/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070509/DC1</ext-link>). It shows that skin-draining lymph node cells of TNCB-painted C57BL/10 mice exhibited enhanced IFN-&#x003b3; responses to an in vitro restimulation with allergen when depleted of CD4&#x0002b; T cells and no responses when depleted of CD8&#x0002b; T cells.</p><p>Interestingly, TLR4-competent mice, which are deficient for IL-12R&#x003b2;2 (C57BL/10; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), exhibited enhanced CHS to TNCB. The same was true for all mice tested with an impaired IL-12 function, including knockouts for IL-12p35/p40 (129Sv; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>) or the signal transducer and activator of transcription, STAT4 (BALB/c; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Furthermore, cells isolated from the draining lymph nodes of TNCB-sensitized IL-12R&#x003b2;2 single-deficient mice exhibited strongly increased IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>) and no detectable IL-4 responses (not depicted) to an in vitro restimulation with syngeneic spleen cells modified with TNBS. Thus, our results show that the loss of IL-12 signaling did not prevent a Tc1 response or lead to Th2/Tc2 polarization of the CHS response to TNCB.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Increased CHS responses to TNCB in IL-12p70&#x02212;/&#x02212; and STAT4&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice.</bold> CHS was induced in IL-12p70 (A) or STAT4-deficient (B) mice as described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>.

To test this, we used TLR4/IL-12R&#x003b2;2 double-deficient mice carrying a functional mouse TLR4 as a transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). The presence of the transgene in these mice rescued the inducibility of CHS by TNCB (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Histology of skin slices shows that the ear of the TLR4 transgenic mouse is noticeably thicker because of an edema and a lymphocyte-rich exudate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, slices 1&#x02013;4), compared with minimal changes in the TLR4/IL-12R&#x003b2;2 double-deficient mouse (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, slices 5&#x02013;8).

To test the impact of this deficiency on the function of the allergen-presenting DC, we replaced the initial TNCB painting with an intracutaneous (i.c.) injection of in vitro TNBS-modified myeloid DC (DC-TNP) from TLR4/IL-12R&#x003b2;2&#x02013;deficient mice. Injection of such cells, in contrast to DC-TNP from WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>) and TLR4 single-deficient mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>), failed to sensitize WT mice to TNCB challenge.

Moreover, the injection of DC-TNP from WT mice successfully sensitized the double-deficient mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>).

For this purpose, we used germ-free mice and investigated their CHS response to endotoxin-free TNCB under germ-free conditions. Normal ear swelling responses were observed in germ-free TLR- and IL-12&#x02013;competent NMRI (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 A</xref>), as well as IL-12R&#x003b2;2 single-deficient mice (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 B</xref>), showing that both IL-12&#x02013;dependent and IL-12&#x02013;independent CHS proceed also in a microbe-free environment.

In view of this finding, we hypothesize that the TLR4 activation, which is essential for the induction of both IL-12&#x02013;dependent and &#x02013;independent CHS, may proceed via endogenous ligands.

The finding that mice lacking both TLR4 and IL-12 receptors are completely resistant to CHS, whereas mice lacking only one of the two receptors remain susceptible, shows that TLR4 and IL-12 receptor can mutually replace each other in the induction of CHS. Interestingly, we found that loss of IL-12 function predisposed the TLR4-competent mice to CHS, leading to an enhanced allergic response. An enhanced response to TNCB has been reported in mice with an impaired IL-12 function caused by the disruption of <italic>Tyk2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). In that study however, T cells from sensitized Tyk2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice exhibited a high IL-4 and decreased IFN-&#x003b3; production (Th2 polarization), whereas in our study, T cells of similarly sensitized IL-12 receptor-deficient mice exhibited no IL-4 but a high IFN-&#x003b3; production (Th1/Tc1 polarization) after rechallenge with the allergen. This may be because of the existence of more than one IL-12&#x02013;independent pathway, all leading to an enhanced CHS response, regardless of the type of T cell polarization. The augmentation of CHS in mice with an impaired IL-12 function could be explained by a loss of the inhibitory effect of IL-12 on IL-17&#x02013;producing CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>), which, according to recent reports, participate in the elicitation of CHS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). The impaired generation of allergen-specific T cells in TNCB-treated TLR4/IL-12R&#x003b2;2&#x02013;deficient mice suggested a defective cross talk between DC and T cells. The inability of allergen-loaded TLR4/IL-12R&#x003b2;2&#x02013;deficient DC to sensitize WT or TLR4/IL-12R&#x003b2;2&#x02013;deficient recipients and its full restoration by the presence of the TLR4 transgene in double-deficient DC is evidence that the induction of IL-12&#x02013;independent CHS requires TLR4 and that it is sufficient when this receptor is present only on DC.</p><p>Although the exact role of TLR4 in the induction of IL-12&#x02013;independent CHS remains to be elucidated, our study offers a possible explanation. We showed in this paper that DC stimulated in vitro with TNCB efficiently up-regulated costimulatory molecules MHC class II and CCR7 but failed to elicit cytokine production, which is a prerequisite for a successful priming of T cells to contact allergens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). This function, however, can be provided by stimulation with TLR ligands (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>; this study). Therefore, TLR4 might be required for the induction of cytokines in DC of mice with impaired IL-12 function. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that activation through TLR9 can replace TLR4 triggering for the generation of functional TNP-presenting TLR4/IL-12R&#x003b2;2&#x02013;deficient DC. TLR9, the receptor for microbial DNA, is important for recognition of certain viruses and bacteria (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). It is therefore possible that, particularly in the skin, infections may provide TLR ligands that support or replace the function of TLR4 during sensitization to contact allergens.</p><p>A possible candidate cytokine induced via TLR4 activation is IL-23, a member of the IL-12 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). IL-23 is inducible via TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>) (this study) and, like IL-12, participates in DC activation and in the enhancement of delayed-type hypersensitivity responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). IL-23 stimulates, whereas IL-12 inhibits, IL-17&#x02013;producing CD8&#x0002b; T cells in CHS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). In our study, IL-23 would come in question for the induction of CHS observed in IL-12R&#x003b2;2&#x02013; and STAT4-deficient mice but not for the CHS observed in mice deficient in IL-12p40 and IL-12p35/p40 or IL-12R&#x003b2;1 because the p40 subunit and the receptor IL-12R&#x003b2;1 chain is shared by both the cytokine IL-23 and IL-12 and their receptors, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). A further candidate for IL-12 replacement is IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2;. It shares several relevant activities with IL-12, such as the generation of activated DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>), stimulation of T cell proliferation, and generation of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). In this study, LPS-activated TLR4 competent DC, as well as both CpG-activated TLR4 competent and deficient DC, produced high levels of IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2; in vitro. Furthermore, preliminary experiments indicate a substantial induction of IFN-&#x003b2; mRNA expression in regional lymph nodes of mice between 4 and 18 h after the primary exposure to TNCB (unpublished data). Another candidate of interest is CD40L. Gorbachev and Fairchild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>) reported that engagement of CD40 promotes CHS responses and development of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing T cells, independently of IL-12. We show in this study that exposure to TNCB alone enhances CD40 expression on DC. In this connection, the induction of CD40/CD40L ligand by LPS (i.e., via TLR4) has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>).</p><p>The inability of TNCB to induce cytokines in DC observed in this study also raised the question of how IL-12 is induced in CHS. The finding that TLR2/TLR4 double-deficient mice are completely resistant to CHS, whereas mice lacking only one of the two receptors remain susceptible, shows that these receptors can substitute for each other in the induction of CHS in IL-12&#x02013;competent mice. It is well documented that activation of TLR2 and TLR4 on DCs results in overlapping, but also distinct, cellular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). This is in part because of the fact that both receptors use the adaptor MyD88 for signaling, whereas TLR4 also uses the adaptor Toll/IL-1 receptor domain&#x02013;containing adaptor-inducing interferon-&#x003b2; (TRIF). The TRIF-dependent activation up-regulates the MyD88-dependent production of proinflammatory cytokines and exhibits additional effects, including induction of IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2; (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). The inability of TLR2 ligands to activate the TRIF-dependent signaling pathway may explain why this receptor is incapable of substituting for TLR4 in the IL-12 independent CHS.</p><p>Most interestingly, the development of CHS to TNCB in germ-free WT and IL-12R&#x003b2;2&#x02013;deficient mice, but its absence in germ-free TLR4/IL-12R&#x003b2;2&#x02013;deficient mice, i.e., in the absence of microbial flora, provides strong support for the hypothesis of an involvement of endogenous TLR ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>) in the sensitization to allergens. Although the identity of these ligands was not addressed in this study, degradation products of HA seem to be suitable candidates because they can activate TLR4 and TLR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). HA is abundant in the skin as a high molecular mass polymer. It facilitates migration of skin DC and its fragments can deliver maturational signals to DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). Interestingly, DC themselves synthesize and possibly also degrade HA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). It is worth mentioning that shortly after TNCB painting we identified biochemical and histochemical changes in HA skin content (i.e., a subcutaneous accumulation of HA and its concomitant disappearance in the epidermis [reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>] [unpublished data]). HA fragments were shown to elicit various proinflammatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) and to be responsible for TLR2 and TLR4 stimulation in bleomycin-induced lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). A recent publication reported that the inflammatory response to sterile skin injury is weaker in TLR4-deficient mice, probably because of a partial loss of HA signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). These authors further demonstrated that a receptor complex consisting of TLR4, CD44, and MD-2 is required for full inflammatory response of cultured cells to HA fragments. Importantly, CD44&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice exhibited an impaired CHS response, which is in agreement with the involvement of HA in the induction of CHS. In line with this study is the inhibition of sensitization for CHS by the HA inhibitor Pep-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Interestingly, in our study this inhibitor also reduced the CHS response in germ-free NMRI mice. This points to a contribution of HA as a potential TLR2/4 ligand involved in the sensitization for CHS.</p><p>Apart from HA degradation products, several endogenous ligands of TLRs, especially of TLR4, have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>).
