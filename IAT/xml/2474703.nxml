Alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) undergo constitutive cycling between the intracellular compartment and the cell surface in the central nervous system. However, the function of UBL domain-containing proteins in the recycling of the AMPARs to the synaptic surface has not yet been reported.</p><p>Here, we report that the Transmembrane and ubiquitin-like domain-containing 1 (Tmub1) protein, formerly known as the Hepatocyte Odd Protein Shuttling (HOPS) protein, which is abundantly expressed in the brain and which exists in a synaptosomal membrane fraction, facilitates the recycling of the AMPAR subunit GluR2 to the cell surface. Neurons transfected with Tmub1/HOPS-RNAi plasmids showed a significant reduction in the AMPAR current as compared to their control neurons. Consistently, the synaptic surface expression of GluR2, but not of GluR1, was significantly decreased in the neurons transfected with the Tmub1/HOPS-RNAi and increased in the neurons overexpressing EGFP-Tmub1/HOPS. The altered surface expression of GluR2 was speculated to be due to the altered surface-recycling of the internalized GluR2 in our recycling assay. Eventually, we found that GluR2 and glutamate receptor interacting protein (GRIP) were coimmunoprecipitated by the anti-Tmub1/HOPS antibody from the mouse brain.</p><p>Taken together, these observations show that the Tmub1/HOPS plays a role in regulating basal synaptic transmission; it contributes to maintain the synaptic surface number of the GluR2-containing AMPARs by facilitating the recycling of GluR2 to the plasma membrane.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proteins can be modified by either a single ubiquitin moiety or polymeric ubiquitin chains to alter their stability, localization, binding partners, or physical conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Hicke1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Hatanaka1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

We refer to this protein as Tmub1/HOPS because it represents well the domain characteristics which used in our identification.

Next, in order to examine whether the Tmub1/HOPS protein is expressed in the brain, we developed a rabbit polyclonal antibody against 29&#x02013;191 amino acids of the Tmub1/HOPS protein fused with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag at its N terminus. By using this antibody, we performed western blotting analysis on various mouse tissues.

Although a strong high-molecular band was observed in the liver, there were no such signals in the brain tissue. It is possible that there is a liver-specific high-molecular factor with a similar amino sequence or conformation that is recognized easily by anti-Tmub1/HOPS antibodies. While almost all the tissues examined exhibited Tmub1/HOPS signals, the brain tissue showed the strongest signal among all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

We immunostained primary hippocampal cultured neurons on day <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV) 14 with the anti-Tmub1/HOPS antibody. Clear Tmub1/HOPS signals were detected in the MAP2-positive dendrites and in the cell bodies of the hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g002">Figure 2A</xref> left). The magnified images of the dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g002">Figure 2A</xref> right) show that the signals are observed close to or attached to the dendrites and at the dendritic shaft (arrowheads). The signals of Tmub1/HOPS were found in PSD95-positive postsynaptic spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g002">Figure 2B</xref> arrows) as well as in the dendritic shaft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g002">Figure 2B</xref> arrow heads). Further, the Tmub1/HOPS signals were hardly found in the Tau1-positive axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g002">Figure 2C</xref> arrow). In order to confirm that these signals show endogenous Tmub1/HOPS, we constructed Tmub1/HOPS-RNAi plasmids having sequences corresponding to 519&#x02013;537 base pair (bp), 134&#x02013;152 bp, and 732&#x02013;750 bp of Tmub1/HOPS. In human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, overexpressed FLAG-Tmub1/HOPS was detected as two bands by anti-FLAG antibody as well as by the anti-Tmub1/HOPS antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that Tmub1/HOPS is cleaved at the C-terminus, as has been previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-DellaFazia1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. The FLAG-Tmub1/HOPS signals were reduced in cells transfected with the plasmid for Tmun1/HOPS RNAi, while the signals were normally presented in cells transfected with the scrambled plasmid. The plasmids containing 134&#x02013;152 bp of Tmub1/HOPS showed the most significant RNAi effect.

When we introduced the RNAi of Tmub1/HOPS (134&#x02013;152 bp) to the hippocampal neurons at DIV 14 and incubated them for additional 2 d, the signals detected by the anti-Tmub1/HOPS antibody were significantly reduced throughout the entire neurons, although a few signals of Tmub1/HOPS were still observed in the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g002">Figure 2E</xref>).

Overexpressed FLAG-Tmub1/HOPS appeared as double bands. The bands almost completely disappeared in cells transfected with Tmub1/HOPS-RNAi (134&#x02013;152) for 30 h, while the control cells showed a strong expression of FLAG-Tmub1/HOPS. The cells transfected with Tmub1/HOPS-RNAi (519&#x02013;537) also showed significant reduction of FLAG-Tmub1/HOPS after 96 h.

In the RNAi-induced neurons, Tmub1/HOPS signals (white) were strongly reduced, although faint signals still remained in the cell body; in contrast, scrambled plasmid-transfected neurons exhibited clear Tmub1/HOPS signals in the cell body and neurites.

To check this, we performed subcellular fractionation of mouse brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). A crude synaptosomal pellet (P2), containing Tmub1/HOPS, was divided into a crude synaptosomal membrane (LP1) and a synaptosomal vesicle (LP2). The LP1, where much of Tmub1/HOPS was contained, was further purified into a synaptosomal membrane (SPM). Tmub1/HOPS was found in the SPM, showing that Tmub1/HOPS exists in synaptosomal membrane compartments. Then, the SPM fraction, wherein Tmub1/HOPS as well as GluR2, Rab4, and postsynaptic density protein (PSD)-95 were contained, was attempted to be dissolved by Triton X (TX)-100. Much of Tmub1/HOPS, GluR2, and Rab4 were dissolved by TX-100, while PSD-95 was not. Taken together, these results indicated that some of Tmub1/HOPS exist in the post synaptic membranes containing not the stable components of the PSD but the TX-100-soluble components, such as endosomal membranes.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Tmub1/HOPS-RNAi decreases the amplitude of AMPAR-mediated synaptic current and increase the inward rectification of EPSC current/voltage</title><p>Next, we examined whether Tmub1/HOPS plays a role in synaptic function.

To determine this, we subjected whole mouse brain to immunoprecipitation with the anti-Tmub1/HOPS antibody. We found that GluR2 and GRIP, a PDZ protein that interacts with GluR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Dong1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, were coimmunoprecipitated by the anti-Tmub1/HOPS antibody.

Although we did not obtain consistent results between the above two assays, our results showed that the endogenous Tmub1/HOPS is associated with the complexes that contain GluR2 and GRIP in the mouse brain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we introduced the neuronal function of Tmub1/HOPS that we screened by <italic>in silico</italic> analysis. This protein was initially identified as an overexpressed protein during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-DellaFazia1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Its overexpression interferes with protein synthesis and suppresses proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-DellaFazia1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, while its depletion generates supernumerary centrosomes, multinucleated cells, and multipolar spindle formation in NIH3T3 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Pieroni1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. This protein is found in cytosolic complexes containing gamma-tubulin and CRM-1 in hepatoma cells and has been implicated as an essential constituent of centrosome assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Pieroni1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The following findings of our present report are consistent with the findings of previous reports, i.e., the protein expression level of Tmub1/HOPS is low during normal conditions in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and that its signals show two bands on western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast, its localization and function appear to be slightly different. Previous reports show that Tmub1/HOPS is localized at the centrosome and is important for the normal proliferation of hepatoma cells, while our present study presents that Tmub1/HOPS exists widely including in cell body/neurites and plays a role in receptor trafficking within the neuron. Gamma-tubulin, which is localized to the centrosome in cycling cells, is present at the centrosome of neurons just beginning to extend their processes, while it is not associated with centrosomes in neurons in which functional synaptic connections have formed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Leask1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that centrosomes exist in different fashions depending upon whether the cell is of the mitotic or postmitotic type. We investigated the localization and function of Tmub1/HOPS in neurons having functional synaptic connections. The differences in our findings and those of previous reports appear to be due to the different cell types.</p><p>From the FANTOM3 database, which provides data regarding expressed sequence tags obtained from murine tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Engstrom1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>tmub1/hops</italic> RNA was expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002809.s001">Table S1</xref>); this was confirmed by our northern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We confirmed that Tmub1/HOPS protein is abundantly expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), consistent with the database expectation. The expression patterns of <italic>tmub1/hops</italic> mRNA and the Tmub1/HOPS protein were not completely consistent with each other, suggesting that the effects of transcription, translation, and posttranslational degradation might differ among the tissues. In the brain tissue, the Tmub1/HOPS protein was widely expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that Tmub1/HOPS may play its roles in various parts of the brain. Consistently with the <italic>in silico</italic> expectation that Tmub1/HOPS possesses transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), endogenous Tmub1/HOPS was found in the membranous fraction of the mouse brain extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). A previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Inoue2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, which showed growth suppression of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> by the expression of Tmub1/HOPS because of its putative transmembrane regions, also supports the fact that Tmub1/HOPS possesses transmembrane domains.</p><p>In neurons, Tmub1/HOPS, whose signals were confirmed to be endogenous ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g002">Figure 2D, E</xref>), was distributed in the dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) rather than axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Further, a portion of Tmub1/HOPS was found in the post synaptic spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Our data suggested that in the post synapse, Tmub1/HOPS exists to the synaptic membranous fraction including not stable post synaptic density components but endosomal membranous components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). Because GluR2 is recycled between plasma membrane and intracellular compartments, some portion of GluR2 is likely to localize at endosomes, where Tmub1/HOPS is suggested to play its role in GluR2 recycling. Further, Tmub1/HOPS was revealed to exist in recycling endosomes rather than early endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Although the Tmub1/HOPS signals in a neuron are widely distributed, our data sufficiently explain the functional existence of Tmub1/HOPS for its GluR2 regulation.</p><p>In the Tmub1/HOPS-RNAi-transfected neurons, only the amplitude, but not the frequency, rise time, and decay time, of AMPAR mEPSC was significantly decreased, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g003">Figures 3A, B</xref>), suggesting that only the number of postsynaptic AMPARs was decreased, while the biophysical features of AMPARs remained unchanged. Furthermore, Tmub1/HOPS-RNAi-transfected neurons showed the larger inward rectification of AMPAR current than the control neuron. Our results indicated that the GluR2-containing AMPARs were mainly contributed to the modulation of AMPAR mediated basal synaptic transmission by Tmub1/HOPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g003">Figures 3C, D</xref>). It has been reported that peptides inhibiting the interaction between NSF and GluR2 evoked a run-down of the basal synaptic transmission, while the inhibition between AP2 and GluR2 did not affect the basal synaptic transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Lee2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Considering the previous report, Tmub1/HOPS is presumed to play a crucial role in GluR2 recycling, which is regulated by NSF but not by AP2 for the regulation of the postsynaptic GluR2-containing AMPARs. Although the amplitude change in the Tmub1/HOPS-RNAi neurons was significant as compared to that in the control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), the extent of changes in electrophysiology was rather less than the extent of changes in the immunostaining of the postsynaptic surface GluR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), because not all AMPARs contain GluR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Sahara1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, i.e., GluR1 homomers exist.</p><p>An approximately 35&#x00025; decrease in the surface endogenous GluR2 was observed in the Tmub1/HOPS-RNAi neurons, where the interaction between Tmub1/HOPS and the AMPAR complexes was inferred to be inhibited, as compared to the control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g004">Figures 4A, B</xref>). A similar or larger reduction in surface endogenous GluR2 expression was observed in neurons that inhibit the NEEP21-GRIP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Steiner1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, PICK1-GRIP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Lu1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, or NSF-GluR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Noel1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> interactions. No significant changes were observed in the surface endogenous GluR1 in the Tmub1/HOPS-RNAi neurons, as compared to the control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g004">Figures 4C, D</xref>), suggesting that Tmub1/HOPS selectively regulates GluR2 and not GluR1. Similarly, interference with the NEEP21-GRIP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Steiner1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> or PICK1-GRIP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Lu1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> interactions did not impair the surface expression of endogenous GluR1. Our results from the Tmub1/HOPS overexpression experiments were consistent with those of the Tmub1/HOPS-RNAi experiments. The surface expression of GluR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g004">Figures 4E, F</xref>), but not of GluR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g004">Figures 4G, H</xref>), was increased in the Tmub1/HOPS-overexpressing neurons. Similarly, the expression of full-length GRIP enhanced the surface expression of coexpressed GluR2, suggesting that GRIP actively promotes GluR2 surface trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Kulangara1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, our immunostaining results and previous reports of the AMPAR surface staining suggest that the maintenance of the synaptic surface expression of GluR2 requires various interactions among non-PDZ proteins, PDZ proteins, and GluR2. Further, those interactions appear to affect the GluR2 subunit selectively.</p><p>The amount of internalized GluR2 during 10 min did not differ significantly between the Tmub1/HOPS-RNAi and control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g005">Figures 5A, B</xref>), suggesting that Tmub1/HOPS is not related to the endocytosis of GluR2 in the steady state. Recycling of the internalized GluR2 to the cell surface was significantly delayed in the Tmub1/HOPS-RNAi neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g005">Figures 5A, C</xref>), indicating that Tmub1/HOPS is related to the pathway by which GluR2 is recycled to the cell surface. Likewise, the inhibition of the NEEP21-GRIP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Steiner1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and GRIP-PICK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Lu1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> interactions delays the recycling of GluR2, suggesting that they are required for the recycling of GluR2 back to the plasma membrane. Consistent with our results of immunostaining of the surface endogenous GluR1, the internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g005">Figures 5D, E</xref>) and recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g005">Figures 5D, F</xref>) of GluR1 did not differ significantly between the Tmub1/HOPS-RNAi and control neurons. The inhibition of the NEEP21-GRIP interaction also did not affect the internalization and the recycling of GluR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Steiner1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, Tmub1/HOPS appears to regulate the recycling of GluR2, which also requires multiple interactions such as those of NEEP21-GRIP and GRIP-PICK1.</p><p>The results from the neurons overexpressing Tmub1/HOPS were consistent with those from the Tmub1/HOPS-RNAi-transfected neurons. The internalization of GluR2 did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g006">Figures 6A, B</xref>) but the recycling of GluR2 varied significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g006">Figures 6A, C</xref>), supporting that Tmub1/HOPS is related to the recycling of GluR2 but not to the internalization of GluR2. The level of GluR2 or GluR1 recycled to the surface in the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g005">Figures 5C, 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g006">6C</xref>) appeared to be relatively low as compared to that in other reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Steiner1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Lu1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, although the time scales used by us were slightly different. In the absence of neuronal activity, internalized AMPARs are sorted for either degradation or reinsertion at synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Passafaro1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Ehlers1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>; however, upon incubation with AMPA or NMDA/TTX, AMPARs are more actively directed into the recycling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Ehlers1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Lee1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Because we did not use any artificial stimulation in our recycling assay, some AMPARs may spontaneously be sorted for lysosomal degradation, which was represented as a rather lower recycling ratio in the control cells, as compared to other reports.</p><p>In surface-receptor regulation, Tmub1/HOPS appears to act contrary to ubiquitin and the UBL protein SUMO. While ubiquitin and SUMO decrease the surface number of their target receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Ehlers2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Martin1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, Tmub1/HOPS increases the surface number of AMPARs. Like Tmub1/HOPS, some other UBL domain-containing proteins, such as Plic-1/ubiquilin-1 and GABARAP/ubiquilin-2, also increase the surface number of their receptors although the underlying mechanisms may be somewhat different. Tmub1/HOPS and GABARAP/ubiquilin-2 increase the surface expression of receptors by facilitating the trafficking of the receptors to the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Leil1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, while Plic-1/ubiquilin-1 increases the surface expression of receptors by increasing the stability of the receptors in the intracellular compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Bedford1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the function of the UBL domain of Tmub1/HOPS remains to be revealed in future studies, it is interesting to speculate that the UBL domain can act as &#x0201c;pseudo&#x0201d; ubiquitin, which blocks ubiquitin function, similar to the dominant negative form of ubiquitin.</p><p>It was indicated that a large portion of Tmub1/HOPS exists at recycling endosomes rather than at early endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g007">Figure 7A, B</xref>). Internalized AMPARs for recycling enter to early endosomes and sorted to recycling endosomes for returning to the plasma membrane. NEEP21 interacts with the complex of GluR2 and GRIP at early endosomes and sorts the complex to the recycling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Steiner1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. The recycling of GluR2-containing AMPARs appears to be carried out by the association with endosomal proteins and peripheral factors throughout the pathway. Tmub1/HOPS may act for the returning of GluR2-containing AMPARs to the plasma membrane, at recycling endosomes. Further, as the fluorescent intensity of intracellular GluR2 was not significantly changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), the spatiotemporal information of AMPARs after the stimulation is suggested to be consistent with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Ehlers1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Lee1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Tmub1/HOPS only affected the GluR2 subunit and not the GluR1 subunit. Subunit-specific trafficking of AMPARs has been known to occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Shi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Passafaro1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and appears to be critically related to their intracellular C-terminal-binding partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Bredt1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, postsynaptic subunit-specific regulation of AMPARs is also affected by neurotransmitter release, i.e., a presynaptic effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Harms1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Because Tmub1/HOPS is found at postsynaptic sites, Tmub1/HOPS is likely to be related to the postsynaptic complex containing GluR2 C-terminal-binding partners or GluR2, for the regulation of GluR2. GRIP, known to interact with the C-terminal site of GluR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002809-Dong1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, was coimmunoprecipitated together with GluR2 by Tmub1/HOPS from the mouse brain lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002809-g008">Figure 8</xref>).

The GluR2-GRIP complexes may associate with Tmub1/HOPS at some points of the constitutive recycling pathway. Tmub1/HOPS and GRIP were coimmunoprecipitated in HEK293 cells while they did not interact in our yeast 2-hybrid system (data not shown). For the association of Tmub1/HOPS with the complexes containing GluR2 and GRIP, it may be required another factor which exists in the HEK293 cells but not in the yeast.
