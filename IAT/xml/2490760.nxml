SnoRNAs, including U3 snoRNA, and many <italic>trans</italic>-acting proteins are required for the ordered assembly and function of the 90S preribosomal complex. Here, we show that the conserved protein Mrd1p binds to the pre-rRNA early during transcription and is required for compaction of the pre-18S rRNA into SSU processome particles. We have exploited the fact that an Mrd1p-GFP fusion protein is incorporated into the 90S preribosomal complex, where it acts as a partial loss-of-function mutation. When associated with the pre-rRNA, Mrd1p-GFP functionally interacts with the essential Pwp2, Mpp10 and U3 snoRNP subcomplexes that are functionally interconnected in the 90S preribosomal complex. The fusion protein can partially support 90S preribosome-mediated cleavages at the A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub> sites. At the same time, on a substantial fraction of transcripts, the composition and/or structure of the 90S preribosomal complex is perturbed by the fusion protein in such a way that cleavage of the 35S pre-rRNA is either blocked or shifted to aberrant sites. These results show that Mrd1p is required for establishing productive structures within the 90S preribosomal complex.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The biogenesis of ribosomes is largely conserved in eukaryotes and it is most extensively studied in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In the nucleolus, RNA polymerase I produces large precursor rRNAs, the 35S pre-rRNAs that contain three of the four rRNAs, 18S, 5.8S and 25S rRNA. The fourth rRNA, 5S rRNA, is produced by RNA polymerase III. Approximately 180 <italic>trans</italic>-acting proteins and many small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are needed to chemically modify specific positions in the 35S pre-rRNA, cleave and fold the pre-rRNA and assemble the rRNAs with ribosomal proteins into the two ribosomal subunits, 18S rRNA in the small 40S subunit and 5.8S and 25S rRNA together with the 5S rRNA in the large, 60S subunit.</p><p>The polycistronic 35S pre-rRNA cotranscriptionally assembles into a large, approximately 90S preribosomal RNA&#x02013;protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Preribosomal complexes have been visualized in the electron microscopy (EM) as large terminal knobs on the growing 35S pre-rRNA during transcription. These knobs are formed as small structures that condense into larger knobs containing the entire 18S part of the 35S pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Preribosomal complexes, called small subunit (SSU) processomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) or 90S preribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) have also been biochemically purified. The 90S preribosomal complexes include U3 snoRNA, at least 40 <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors involved in the biogenesis of the small ribosomal subunit and a number of the small ribosomal subunit proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7">5&#x02013;7</xref>). In addition, a number of components that are required for small subunit biogenesis, including U14, snR10 and snR30 snoRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), do not biochemically copurify with the 90S preribosomal complex, presumably due to transient or less stable associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>). Most factors involved in 60S subunit biogenesis appear to associate with the pre-rRNA at a later stage, soon after the pre-rRNA is cleaved to separate the pre-40S from the pre-60S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>In the preribosomal complexes, the 35S pre-rRNA is extensively chemically modified, including 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methylation of sugar moieties and pseudouridinylation of uridines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The modifying enzymes are guided to correct positions by different snoRNAs. A series of endo- and exo-nucleolytic cleavages take place. Three early cleavages, A<sub>0</sub> and A<sub>1</sub> in the 5&#x02032; external-transcribed spacer (ETS) and A<sub>2</sub> in the first internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) liberate a 20S pre-rRNA contained in a 43S RNP complex. This complex contains Nob1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) which, after export to the cytoplasm, is required for cleavage of the 20S pre-rRNA at site D to result in the mature 18S rRNA.</p><p>Biochemical analyses have suggested that in many species processing of the 35S pre-rRNA in the 90S preribosomal complex, including chemical modifications and A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub> cleavage, is posttranscriptional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). However, cleavage at A<sub>0</sub> has been reported to occur cotranscriptionally in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). EM studies in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and in exponentially growing yeast have shown that the 35S pre-rRNA can also be cotranscriptionally cleaved at A<sub>2</sub>, probably after chemical modifications have been introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Regardless, if cleavages at A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub> occur cotranscriptionally or posttranscriptionally, the folding of the 35S pre-rRNA must be highly coordinated to allow the different processing steps to occur in a timely order and presumably before the compact structure of the ribosomal subunits form. In the 90S preribosomal complex, several subcomplexes have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The U3 snoRNP has a central role. The Pwp2 complex, probably identical to the UTP-B complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), and the Mpp10/Imp3/Imp4 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) are important for U3 snoRNP binding to the 35S pre-rRNA. The subcomplex consisting of the transcription-Utps (t-Utps), which is similar to the UTP-A subcomplex, associates with the ribosomal chromatin and with the 35S pre-rRNA independently of U3 snoRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) and is needed for efficient transcription by RNA polymerase I. Utp22p, a component of the stable UTP-C complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), has been found in the 90S preribosomal complex. As is the case for Rrp7p, which is also part of the UTP-C complex, Utp22p is required for synthesis of 18S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). These components are also present in a complex similar to UTP-C that appears to be involved in coupling transcription of ribosomal protein genes and pre-rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>It is intriguing that so many different <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors are needed to ensure that the A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub> cleavages take place. Cleavage at A<sub>0</sub> is not essential for cell viability. The A<sub>0</sub> cleavage requires that the U3 snoRNA base pairs to a sequence located 140-nt upstream of the A<sub>0</sub> site in the 5&#x02032; ETS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27">25&#x02013;27</xref>). Other factors influence cleavage at A<sub>0</sub> and as a rule cleavage at A<sub>0</sub> is coupled to cleavage at A<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub>. Cleavage at A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> are even more closely coupled, and recognition of these cleavage sites in both cases involves a conserved nucleotide sequence and a fixed distance from a stem&#x02013;loop structure in the 35S pre-rRNA. U3 snoRNA has a central role in the A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub> cleavages and interacts with the 35S pre-rRNA in a complex manner. Apart from the base pairing upstream of the A<sub>0</sub> site, U3 snoRNA base pairs at the 5&#x02032;-end of the 18S rRNA and to a sequence within the 18S rRNA, two regions that are involved in formation of the pseudoknot present in the mature 18S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28 B29 B30">28&#x02013;30</xref>). This base pairing blocks the formation of the pseudoknot and may be a way of both preventing premature folding and guiding correct folding.</p><p>To understand ribosome biogenesis, it is important to know how the dynamic structure of the 35S pre-rRNA is formed in a coordinated manner within the 90S preribosomal complex. It is likely that the 90S preribosomal complex coordinates pre-rRNA folding and regulates accessibility of factors interacting with the 35S pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). The 90S preribosomal complex may perform this function as a unit. A more dynamic model is that individual subcomplexes, including snoRNPs, influence the structure of the pre-rRNA, possibly resulting in a succession of structures needed to achieve quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The cleavage mechanisms and the function of most of the individual <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors in the 90S preribosomal complex are so far unknown. In addition, it is not known how a correct and controlled folding of the pre-rRNA is achieved.</p><p>We have previously identified a protein, Mrd1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), that is essential for cleavages at sites A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub>. Mrd1p can be coimmunoprecipitated with 35S pre-rRNA, but has not been identified as a stable component of the biochemically purified U3 snoRNA-containing preribosomal complexes. A prominent feature of Mrd1p is the presence of five RNA-binding domains (RBDs) that are conserved as to position and sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). This structure of Mrd1p distinguishes it from the majority of 90S complex proteins, which contain no recognizable RNA-binding motifs, and makes it an attractive candidate to play a role as a pre-rRNA chaperone. Additionally, Mrd1p is one of only three RBD-containing proteins that are conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report the analyses of the defects in preribosomal processing induced by depletion of Mrd1p or by the presence of a mutant Mrd1p. This extends our knowledge about the structural and functional connection between Mrd1p and the preribosomal complex. We show that Mrd1p interacts early with pre-rRNA, independent of U3 snoRNP and key Utps, and that Mrd1p is required for compaction of the pre-rRNA into SSU processomes. We further show that a mutant Mrd1 allele, in addition to causing a general defect in ribosomal (18S) biogenesis, both disturbs U3 snoRNP association with pre-rRNA and drastically increases synthesis of an aberrant rRNA product, the 22.5S rRNA. The 22.5S rRNA is made in the nucleus by a premature cotranscriptional cleavage event and in the context of a 90S preribosomal complex. We finally establish that the growth and aberrant processing of the mutant is sensitive to changes in processome composition. This indicates that Mrd1p functionally interacts with specific 90S preribosomal complex components and is essential for formation of structures within the 90S preribosomal complex productive for cleavages at A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains, plasmids and genetic manipulations</title><p>Conditional mutant, epitope-tagged and deletion strains were generated by a one-step PCR strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) via homologous recombination.

We therefore wished to test the hypothesis that Mrd1p functionally and physically interacts with the SSU processome components in a 90S preribosomal RNP complex in the cell. While depletion of Mrd1p completely inhibits growth, fusion of a GFP coding domain to the 3&#x02032;-end of the coding region of the genomic MRD1 gene resulted in an approximately 2.7 times longer generation time. No such effect was recorded when Mrd1p was C-terminally tagged with 13Myc or protein A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and C). The amount of 18S rRNA was considerably reduced in the presence of Mrd1&#x02013;GFP, whereas the amount of 25S rRNA was not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). The extent of 18S rRNA reduction was measured by hybridization with probes specific for 18S and 25S rRNA (data not shown).

The extra C-terminal GFP domain might alter important functional interactions of Mrd1p and analyses of the Mrd1p-GFP fusion is conceptually similar to studying defects caused by other types of mutations in essential genes. As a means to learn more about the function of Mrd1p in the biogenesis of 40S ribosomal subunits, we therefore investigated the molecular basis for the influence of the Mrd1p-GFP fusion protein on 18S rRNA synthesis and cell growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Mrd1p-GFP accumulates in the nucleolus and assembles with 35S pre-rRNA into 90S preribosomal complexes</title><p>The partial loss-of-function could theoretically be due to a de-localization of Mrd1p-GFP from the normal site of action caused by the GFP domain. This makes it important to establish the location of Mrd1p-GFP in the cell. Mrd1p-GFP colocalized with the nucleolar specific Nop1p in the nucleolus, where it was highly concentrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). A fraction of Mrd1p-GFP was also detected in the nucleoplasm. This pattern was the same as that of Mrd1p tagged with a 3HA tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) or a 13Myc tag (data not shown). We then asked if the accumulation of Mrd1p-GFP in the nucleolus was dependent on RNA polymerase I transcription. We constructed a rpa12::LEU2 deletion strain with Mrd1p-GFP. Rpa12 is a subunit of RNA polymerase I that is dispensable at room temperature but becomes essential at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). After shift to nonpermissive temperature, western blot analysis showed that the Mrd1p-GFP amount was initially reduced, within 1 h, but then remained relatively stable for several hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). An initial reduction in Mrd1p-GFP signal was also seen in the microscope. Importantly, there was a redistribution of Mrd1p-GFP within the nucleus. Three hours after the shift to 37&#x000b0;C and even more so after 5 h, Mrd1p-GFP no longer accumulated in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). In the PLY129 strain, containing the wild-type RPA12 gene, Mrd1p-GFP remained in the nucleolus under these conditions (data not shown). Also RBD1, the Mrd1p orthologue in insect cells, is dependent on RNA polymerase I transcription for its nucleolar accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), suggesting that this is an intrinsic property of the protein and was not due to the GFP tag of Mrd1p-GFP. We also analyzed the behavior of a SSU processome component, Utp13p&#x02013;GFP, upon cessation of transcription by RNA polymerase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Compared to Utp13p&#x02013;GFP, Mrd1p-GFP accumulation in the nucleolus was more sensitive to transcription shut off. We conclude that the GFP domain did not displace Mrd1p-GFP from its normal, predominantly nucleolar location, and that the accumulation in the nucleolus of Mrd1p was dependent on RNA polymerase I transcription, more so than the <italic>bona fide</italic> SSU processome component Utp13p. Utp13p is part of the stable UTP-B subcomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), while Mrd1p has not been found in any stable subcomplex. This difference could influence their different localization behavior, and suggests that the nucleolar enrichment of Mrd1p is mainly dependent on the presence of newly synthesized pre-rRNA. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Mrd1p-GFP is located primarily in the nucleolus and this localization is dependent on transcription by RNA polymerase I.

The majority of genes showed long uncleaved transcripts with few or no 5&#x02032;-terminal RNP particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). Occasionally, some transcripts near the 3&#x02032;-end of the genes formed 5&#x02032;ETS particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C, small arrows), but the majority were not incorporated into typical structures. The EM results show that formation of 5&#x02032;ETS particles on the 35S pre-rRNA was either partially abrogated or disturbed by Mrd1p-GFP, even more so than when Mrd1p was depleted. Combined, the results for Mrd1p-GFP and depletion of Mrd1p strongly suggest that Mrd1p-GFP binds early to the pre-rRNA, within the 5&#x02032;ETS, and that the GFP moiety interferes with timely formation of the 5&#x02032;ETS particle.</p><p>No genes with the normal cotranscriptional cleavage pattern were seen in the Mrd1p-GFP strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C and D) or the depleted strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Since small amounts of 20S pre-rRNA and 18S rRNA were still made in the presence of Mrd1p-GFP, this suggests that SSU processome formation and required cleavages are delayed until after transcription in those cases. In a number of genes in cells expressing Mrd1p-GFP, aberrant cotranscriptional cleavages were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). Although this unusual cleavage mapped to the general region of ITS1, as does normal cleavage, it had two features never seen in normal cotranscriptional cleavage at the A<sub>2</sub> site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). First, it occurred without prior formation of either visible 5&#x02032;ETS particles or visible SSU processomes, and second, it occurred on transcripts attached to polymerases that had transcribed only into ITS1, which is more upstream than is seen for normal A<sub>2</sub> cleavage. That is, normal A<sub>2</sub> cleavage requires transcription of RNA downstream of the A<sub>2</sub> cleavage site, including transcription through 5.8S rRNA and into ITS2 (Y.N. Osheim and A.L. Beyer, unpublished data). This unusual cotranscriptional cleavage seen in cells expressing Mrd1p-GFP is likely to represent the event resulting in the 22.5S rRNA. It is unlikely to represent cleavage at A<sub>3</sub> to generate 23S rRNA because A<sub>3</sub> cleavage requires the presence of the 3&#x02032;ETS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) and is not thought to occur cotranscriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Although the two examples shown for the Mrd1&#x02013;GFP strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C and D) display transcripts that are either mainly cleaved or not cleaved, other genes showed a mixed population of transcripts on the same gene, with some cleaved, others not, and rarely with large SSU processome-like particles. We conclude from the EM analyses that in the presence of Mrd1p-GFP, the aberrant processing that results in the 22.5S rRNA described above appears to be at least partly cotranscriptional.</p></sec><sec><title>90S preribosomal complex components are required for the Mrd1p-GFP induced aberrant processing of pre-rRNA</title><p>The EM data showed that both depletion of Mrd1p and the presence of Mrd1p-GFP interfered with normal SSU processome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). In contrast, while depletion of Mrd1p did not affect visible 5&#x02032;ETS particle formation on pre-rRNA, EM showed that the 5&#x02032;ETS particles formed less efficiently when Mrd1p-GFP was present. This might mean that U3 snoRNP was less efficiently recruited to or less stably associated with the nascent pre-rRNA, since U3 snoRNA is required for 5&#x02032;ETS particle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Thus, we examined the association of U3 snoRNA with Mrd1p-GFP and the distribution of U3 snoRNP in sucrose gradients. Immunoprecipitation showed that U3 snoRNA is associated with Mrd1p-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, IP). In wild-type cells, U3 snoRNP was mostly associated with 80&#x02013;90S complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A), with little free U3 snoRNP at the top of the gradient (about 17% of the hybridization signal in fractions 1&#x02013;7). In the presence of Mrd1p-GFP, there was an increase in free U3 snoRNP with a corresponding decrease of U3 snoRNP in the 80&#x02013;90S fractions (about 29% of the U3 snoRNA signal in fractions 1&#x02013;7). The distribution of U14 snoRNA followed the same pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, a shift from about 39% to about 51% signal in fraction 1&#x02013;7). Even if a shift of snoRNPs away from large pre-rRNA complexes is in line with a disturbed formation of 5&#x02032; ETS particles and SSU processomes, the considerable amount of snoRNPs in 80&#x02013;90S complexes was higher than expected considering the dramatic effect of Mrd1p-GFP on formation of particles as displayed by EM. The discrepancy between the EM and gradient results could indicate that a suboptimally assembled preribosomal complex could be sensitive to methodological differences, in one case (Miller spreads) falling apart and in another (sucrose gradients) staying together. Alternatively, or in addition, this could reflect that stable U3 snoRNP association with pre-rRNA was delayed and not visible on nascent pre-rRNA. Since we observed that 35S pre-rRNA accumulated extensively in the presence of Mrd1p-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A), it is possible that once U3 snoRNP was incorporated in a preribosomal complex, it remained there for an extended time period. It should also be noted that it is possible that the observed redistribution of the snoRNPs in sucrose gradients reflects slower growth of the Mrd1p-GFP containing cells, since growth rate influences snoRNP incorporation into 90S preribosomal complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Mrd1p-GFP is compatible with the presence of U3 and U14 snoRNAs in 90S preribosomal complexes and U3 snoRNP is required for induction of the aberrant 22.5S rRNA, but not for Mrd1p-GFP association with 35S pre-rRNA and 23S rRNA.

Depletion of Nop58p destabilizes all C/D box snoRNPs, including U3 snoRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). When U3 snoRNA was substantially depleted in glucose medium (by about 90%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, compare Input, gal and glu), 20S and 22.5S rRNA were substantially reduced, while 35S pre-rRNA and 23S rRNA were still efficiently produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, Input, glu). Coimmunoprecipitation showed that in the presence of U3 snoRNA, Mrd1p-GFP was associated with 35S and 20S pre-rRNA and with 23S and 22.5S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, IP, gal). When U3 snoRNA was depleted, Mrd1p-GFP was still associated with 35S pre-rRNA and 23S rRNA.

These results indicate that box C/D snoRNPs are not required for the association of Mrd1p-GFP with 35S pre-rRNA, but that Nop58p or one of its snoRNPs, possibly U3 snoRNP, is required for Mrd1p-GFP induction of the aberrant processing.</p><p>We asked if the aberrant processing, producing the 22.5S rRNA, was dependent on further components specific to the 90S preribosomal complex.

Furthermore, the combined results of EM and genetic depletion experiments suggest that the U3 snoRNP can associate with the 5&#x02032; part of the nascent pre-rRNA in the presence of Mrd1p-GFP, as seen by the requirement for U3 snoRNP/processome factors to generate the aberrant 22.5S processing which, at least in a fraction of transcripts, is visible in EM and hence cotranscriptional. This association of U3 snoRNP with pre-rRNA was however disturbed as seen by the large reduction in the number of 5&#x02032;ETS particles in EM.</p></sec><sec><title>Pwp2p and Mpp10p functionally interact with Mrd1p-GFP</title><p>When the <italic>PWP2</italic> and <italic>MPP10</italic> genes were expressed from the GAL1 promoter in the Mrd1p-GFP background, we detected specific genetic interactions between Mrd1p-GFP and both Pwp2p and Mpp10p. No or very minor interaction was observed between Mrd1p-GFP and Utp4p, expressed from the GAL1 promoter.</p><p>First, processing of 35S pre-rRNA was influenced. The effect of Pwp2p was the most significant. Quantification showed a drastic decrease in the production of 22.5S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, gal lane). In addition, compared to <italic>MRD1-GFP</italic>, the 20S/23S rRNA ratio increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, gal lane). GAL1-directed expression of Mpp10p increased the 22.5S/23S rRNA ratio slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, gal lane), while the 20S/23S rRNA ratio decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, gal lane). For Utp4p, GAL1-directed expression did not influence the relative amount of 22.5S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, gal lane), but the 20S/23S ratio increased as for Pwp2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, gal lane). These effects were not due to decreased amounts of Mrd1p-GFP expression in the strains (data not shown).</p><p>To exclude the possibility of second site suppressors, strain PLY340 (<italic>GAL</italic>::<italic>3HA-PWP2/MRD1-GFP</italic>), was crossed to wt (<italic>PWP2/MRD1</italic>).

The generation time was &#x0223c;4 h compared to 5 h for the Mrd1p-GFP strain. This was specific for the <italic>MRD1-GFP</italic> genotype, since GAL1-directed expression of Pwp2p in the wild-type background did not influence cell growth (data not shown). GAL1-directed expression of Mpp10p resulted in a reduction in cell growth, &#x0223c;7 h generation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C), while GAL1-directed expression of Utp4p did not influence growth of cells containing Mrd1p-GFP (data not shown). Together, these results show that Pwp2p specifically suppressed the cleavage defects induced by Mrd1p-GFP, while Mpp10p in the presence of Mrd1p-GFP negatively influenced the A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub> cleavages. It is possible that the combined effect described above of decreased 22.5S rRNA synthesis and a relative increase in 20S pre-rRNA synthesis was involved in the higher growth rate in the case of GAL1-directed expression of Pwp2p. Similarly, a relative decrease in 20S pre-rRNA and a slight increase in synthesis of 22.5S rRNA could be involved in slower growth in the case of GAL1-directed expression of Mpp10p. In the case of GAL1-directed expression of Utp4p, a relative increase in 20S pre-rRNA synthesis, but unchanged amounts of 22.5S rRNA did not influence growth.</p><p>Third, EM analyses of rRNA genes from cells in which Pwp2p was expressed from the GAL1 promoter in the Mrd1p-GFP background showed a definite increase in formation of the SSU processomes on nascent transcripts as compared to the Mrd1p-GFP strain, though many genes still showed slowed or abnormal cotranscriptional processing (data not shown).</p><p>Fourthy, GAL1-directed expression of Pwp2p also influenced the physical properties of 90S preribosomal complexes containing Mrd1p-GFP. Sucrose gradient analysis showed that Mrd1p-GFP was present in 80&#x02013;90S preribosomal complexes both when Pwp2p was depleted and when expressed from the GAL1 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D). However, in both instances Mrd1p-GFP accumulated in 80&#x02013;90S preribosomal complexes, compared to cells that expressed Pwp2p at endogenous levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D, compare Mrd1p-GFP distribution in <italic>MRD1-GFP</italic> with <italic>GAL::3HA-PWP2/MRD1-GFP</italic> gal and glu). This suggests a change in the structure and/or composition of the Mrd1p-GFP containing 90S preribosomal complexes. In addition, we observed that GAL1-directed expression of Pwp2p in the presence of Mrd1p-GFP further decreased the association of U3 snoRNP with 90S preribosomal complexes. 15&#x02013;20% of the U3 snoRNA present in the 80&#x02013;90S region in Mrd1p-GFP cells shifted towards the top of the gradient in cells expressing Pwp2p from the GAL1 promoter (data not shown).</p><p>The accumulation of Mrd1p-GFP in 80&#x02013;90S complexes was specific for Pwp2p. GAL1-directed expression of Utp4p did not change the distribution of Mrd1p-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D). However, depletion of Utp4p resulted in a shift of part of the Mrd1p-GFP to lower fractions (compare <italic>GAL::3HA-UTP4/MRD1-GFP</italic> gal and glu in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D). A substantial part of Mrd1p-GFP remained in the 80&#x02013;90S region. This would indicate that in contrast to many other ribosomal biogenesis factors, Mrd1p-GFP is not dependent on t-Utps for assembly onto the pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>The genetic interactions of Mrd1p-GFP with Pwp2p and with Mpp10p could be due to a changed balance between Mrd1p-GFP and these two proteins when expression was directed from the GAL1 promoter. This possibility was supported by the demonstration that the relative mRNA levels changed as a result of GAL1-directed expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>E). Quantification showed that the ratio of Mrd1p-GFP:Mpp10p mRNA changed from 2.8 to 0.2 and the ratio of Mrd1p-GFP:Pwp2p mRNA changed from 1.6 to 0.2. Western blot analysis indicated that there was also a relative increase at the protein level for Mpp10p, though not as dramatic as the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>F). Quantification showed that in relation to the Mrd1p-GFP amounts (PLY339: PLY129 ratio of 1), Mpp10p was slightly increased in PLY339 (PLY339:PLY129 ratio of 1.4). It is also possible that the presence of the GFP tag on Mrd1p and a 3HA-tag on Mpp10p and Pwp2p contributed to the functional interactions.</p><p>In summary, Pwp2p and Mpp10p exhibited specific genetic interactions with Mrd1p-GFP. These data indicate that both Pwp2p and Mpp10p functionally and possibly physically interact with Mrd1p in the context of the 90S preribosomal complex.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The 90S preribosomal complexes were first identified by sucrose gradient analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Extensive biochemical purifications, using affinity tagged proteins, have identified U3 snoRNA and a large number of proteins as components of the 90S preribosomal complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7">5&#x02013;7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). In these purifications, several smaller complexes with partially overlapping components have been found, indicating the existence of subcomplexes within the 90S preribosomal complex and possibly that some components interact transiently with the complex. In addition, analyses of individual proteins and snoRNAs have shown that more components are likely to be part of the 90S preribosomal complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). The 90S preribosomal complex is dynamic during assembly and subsequent processing steps. This is reflected in EM of active rDNA genes, where different structures are visible along the partially unfolded 5&#x02032; part of the 35S pre-rRNA, eventually making up a compact structure encompassing the entire 18S rRNA part of the nascent transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Biochemical analyses have also shown that several subcomplexes associate with the 35S pre-rRNA in defined steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In spite of these data, neither the <italic>in vivo</italic> composition and structure of the 90S preribosomal complex are known nor is the function of the individual components of the 90S preribosomal complex.</p><sec><title>Mrd1p is part of the 90S preribosomal complex</title><p>Our results show that Mrd1p is part of the 90S preribosomal complex. This is in agreement with the recent identification of Mrd1p in some of the biochemically purified 90S preribosomal subcomplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Mrd1p is recruited to the 5&#x02032; part of the 35S pre-rRNA and is incorporated into 90S preribosomal complexes, even when U3 snoRNA, Pwp2p and Utp4p are depleted, suggesting that the association of Mrd1p with 35S pre-RNA is independent of these components. Our EM data show that the 5&#x02032; ETS particles form in the absence of Mrd1p. Since formation of the 5&#x02032;ETS particles requires U3 snoRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), this implies that U3 snoRNA directly or indirectly performs this function in the absence of Mrd1p. Even though 5&#x02032;ETS particles can form without Mrd1p, the finding that the GFP domain in Mrd1p-GFP hinders normal formation of the 5&#x02032;ETS particles suggests that Mrd1p is associated with the transcript early during transcription, before U3 snoRNP is involved in 5&#x02032;ETS particle formation.</p><p>The association of Mrd1p with the pre-rRNA is probably also largely independent of t-Utps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D), but is lost when RNA polymerase I transcription is arrested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), indicating that pre-rRNA is necessary and sufficient for Mrd1p incorporation into preribosomal complexes. Together, our data thus suggest that Mrd1p is assembled early into the 90S preribosomal complex. Other components such as Rrp5 and the UTP-C components Utp22p and Rrp7p would then be incorporated later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). We have however not investigated the relationship between Mrd1p and these components.</p><p>The combined data for Mrd1p-GFP and for Mrd1p depletion demonstrate that Mrd1p is required for compaction of the pre-18S rRNA into large, SSU processome particles as observed in the EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Lack of Mrd1p prevents or drastically destabilizes such large particles and the extra GFP domain perturbs the structure and function of the particle. Our data therefore show that Mrd1p is essential for compaction of the pre-rRNA. We can furthermore coimmunoprecipitate Mrd1p-GFP with 35S pre-rRNA, 23S and 22.5S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B), which all contain the intact A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub> cleavage sites. We cannot rule out that Mrd1p must dissociate before cleavages can occur. However, considering that Mrd1p-GFP is also associated with 20S pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B), it appears more likely that Mrd1p must be present to organize conformations required for cleavages. The fact that Mrd1p-GFP at least to some extent remains with the 20S pre-rRNA could explain why we detected low levels of Mrd1p-GFP in the nucleoplasm, outside the nucleolus. As yet, we do not know where Mrd1p binds to the 35S pre-rRNA. However, Mrd1p is highly conserved in eukaryotes and we have previously shown that the corresponding protein in <italic>Chironomus tentans</italic>, RBD1, binds both to the 5&#x02032;ETS and the ITS1 and ITS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). If this is also the case for Mrd1p, this is consistent with the possibility that Mrd1p, with its multiple RBDs, might help guide the compaction by binding to sequences present at both ends of the pre-rRNA that is present in the SSU processome, bringing the A<sub>1</sub> site in the 5&#x02032;ETS into proximity with the A<sub>2</sub> cleavage site in ITS1.</p><p>Esf2p, a protein believed to interact transiently with the SSU processome, is associated with the 5&#x02032;ETS and is required for A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub> cleavages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Esf2p is important for release of U3 snoRNP from the 90S preribosomes, and the findings that Esf2p copurifies with Pwp2p and Mpp10p colocalizes with 90S preribosomal complexes on gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>), and acts as a binding partner and cofactor for the Dbp8p helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>), suggest that Esf2p may be directly involved in 90S preribosome dynamics. It is interesting to compare effects of Mrd1p depletion to effects of Esf2p depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>), since both of these situations allow U3 snoRNP incorporation into 80&#x02013;90S complexes and both allow formation of 5&#x02032;ETS particles as visualized by EM. The difference in the EM results is that in Esf2p-deficient cells, the assembly can progress beyond the 5&#x02032;ETS particle stage to the stage of transcript compaction into a loose or pre-SSU processome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). RNP assembly appears to halt at this stage in the absence of Esf2p, prior to formation of tight SSU processomes, which are the substrate for A<sub>2</sub> cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The 5&#x02032;ETS particles in Mrd1p-deficient cells show no evidence of compaction into loose or normal SSU processomes, though they sometimes appear slightly larger than normal. These results indicate that Mrd1p but not Esf2p is required for transcript compaction and formation of the larger particles.</p><p>In the Mrd1p-GFP strain, fewer 5&#x02032;ETS particles are formed and formation is delayed in the few that form. Many genes exhibit long transcripts with no particles while other genes exhibit aberrant cleavage. This is consistent with the GFP moiety hindering timely 5&#x02032;ETS particle formation, though other results indicate that preribosomal particles eventually form on some transcripts. That is, although the transcripts in the Mrd1p-GFP strain initially appear more abnormal than those in either the Esf2p-depleted or Mrd1p-depleted cells, some of these transcripts are eventually processed to 20S pre-rRNA while those in the depletion strains are not.</p><p>Although depletion of many individual 90S preribosomal complex components impairs cleavage at the A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub> sites, it appears that the U3 snoRNP, Pwp2 and Mpp10 subcomplexes are located close to the A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub> cleavage sites in the 90S preribosomal complex. Our data do not allow us to draw precise conclusions about the location of Mrd1p, but the functional interactions between Mrd1p-GFP and the U3 snoRNP, Pwp2 and Mpp10 subcomplexes suggest that Mrd1p is important for establishing productive structures within the 90S preribosomal complex. It is possible from our data that Mrd1p is physically located close to the U3 snoRNP, Pwp2 and Mpp10 subcomplexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Mrd1p influences the structure of a dynamic 90S preribosomal complex</title><p>Mrd1p-GFP supports correct processing at the A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub> sites. About one-fourth of the wild-type steady-state amount of 18S rRNA is made in the presence of Mrd1p-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). To some extent, Mrd1p-GFP must therefore be compatible with correct binding of the U3 snoRNP, Pwp2 and Mpp10 subcomplexes. At the same time, it is striking that Mrd1p-GFP severely disturbs the function of the 90S preribosomal complex.</p><p>The correct processing that did take place was considerably delayed as seen from the accumulation of 35S pre-rRNA and from the chromatin spreads of the active rDNA genes. A delayed dissociation of U3 snoRNP was also indicated by the considerable presence of U3 snoRNP in 80&#x02013;90S complexes in Mrd1p-GFP cells, and the increase in free U3 snoRNP when processing was partially rescued in the <italic>GAL::3HA-PWP2/MRD1-GFP</italic> suppressor strain. We did not detect degradation of the pre-rRNA, showing that Mrd1p-GFP did not induce breakdown of the pre-rRNA.</p><p>Mrd1p-GFP led to a significant decrease in cleavage at the A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub> sites, resulting in cleavage at the A<sub>3</sub> site and accumulation of 23S rRNA. This relative block in cleavage at the A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub> sites could be due to disturbance in U3 snoRNP associations in the 90S preribosomal complex, possibly due to a steric effect from the GFP moiety of Mrd1p-GFP. The EM data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) showed in general a delayed and/or disturbed formation of 5&#x02032; ETS particles and failure of these particles to progress to compacted SSU processomes. The biochemical data combined with the EM data thus indicate that disturbed and/or less stable 90S preribosomal complexes are formed. EM analysis also showed that transcripts along the same gene could be independently affected by Mrd1p-GFP, suggesting that Mrd1p-GFP acts at the level of the individual 90S preribosomal complexes.</p><p>On some transcripts, Mrd1p-GFP induced changes in the 90S preribosomal complex that resulted in aberrant 3&#x02032;-ends just downstream of the D-site in 35S pre-rRNA. The 22.5S rRNA was almost as common as 23S rRNA, indicating that the frequency by which these two latter events occurred was about the same. Aberrant processing intermediates called 22.5S have been described previously in strains depleted for proteins or with mutated versions of proteins implicated in preribosomal processing at the A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub> sites. These proteins include a putative RNA helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>), small and large ribosome subunit proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>), Lsm proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>) and one ribosome biogenesis factor needed both for 40S and 60S maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). In all these instances, it was assumed that the 22.5S intermediate had been generated by cleavage at the D site, but the cleavage site was not mapped nor the location in the cell where the cleavage occurred. It is therefore possible that some or all of these 22.5S intermediates are identical to the 22.5S characterized in the Mrd1p-GFP strain. Since we detected a low amount of aberrant processing in wt cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C), it is conceivable that any mutation that affects preribosomal assembly/structure at this step can shift the equilibrium towards 22.5S rRNA production. Our data indicate that the aberrant events producing 22.5S rRNA take place within the 90S preribosomal complex, containing the U3 snoRNP, Pwp2 and Mpp10 subcomplexes. The 22.5S rRNA may represent multiple initial cleavage products, or alternatively, 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; exonucleolytic trimming of a downstream cleavage product. For example, the delayed or altered assembly of U3 snoRNP and other components onto transcripts in the presence of Mrd1p-GFP may expose several new cleavage sites somewhat downstream of the D site, or one new site whose 3&#x02032;-end is subject to trimming. Combined, these data are consistent with the view that the 90S preribosomal complex is a highly dynamic structure in which Mrd1p influences the folding of the 35S pre-rRNA and the contacts that are present between the different components and the pre-rRNA necessary for correct cleavages in the 90S preribosomal complex. The fact that the presence of Mrd1p-GFP can lead to three different functional results for the 90S preribosomal complex suggests that the structure is flexible, where some structural states are consistent with correct binding of U3 snoRNP and cleavage at the A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub> sites and other states are not. Even though it is possible that Mrd1p is also involved in protein&#x02013;protein interactions, our data in combination with the fact that Mrd1p contains five evolutionarily conserved RBDs, suggest that Mrd1p plays a role in folding of the pre-rRNA in the 90S preribosomal complex.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Kerstin Bernholm for excellent technical assistance, S.J.
