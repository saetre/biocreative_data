One such variant, H2A.Z, replaces histone H2A and is required for development and viability in all animals tested to date. However, the function of H2A.Z in development remains unclear. Here, we use ChIP-chip, genetic mutation, RNAi, and immunofluorescence microscopy to interrogate the function of H2A.Z (HTZ-1) during embryogenesis in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, a key model of metazoan development. We find that HTZ-1 is expressed in every cell of the developing embryo and is essential for normal development. The sites of HTZ-1 incorporation during embryogenesis reveal a genome wrought by developmental processes. HTZ-1 is incorporated upstream of 23&#x00025; of <italic>C. elegans</italic> genes. While these genes tend to be required for development and occupied by RNA polymerase II, HTZ-1 incorporation does not specify a stereotypic transcription program. The data also provide evidence for unexpectedly widespread independent regulation of genes within operons during development; in 37&#x00025; of operons, HTZ-1 is incorporated upstream of internally encoded genes. Fewer sites of HTZ-1 incorporation occur on the X chromosome relative to autosomes, which our data suggest is due to a paucity of developmentally important genes on X, rather than a direct function for HTZ-1 in dosage compensation. Our experiments indicate that HTZ-1 functions in establishing or maintaining an essential chromatin state at promoters regulated dynamically during <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryogenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>To fit within a cell's nucleus, DNA is wrapped around protein spools composed of the histones H3, H4, H2A, and H2B. One spool and the DNA wrapped around it are called a nucleosome, and all of the packaged DNA in a cell's nucleus is collectively called &#x0201c;chromatin.&#x0201d; Chromatin is important because it modulates access to information encoded in the underlying DNA. Spools with specialized functions can be created by replacing a typical histone component with a variant version of the histone protein. Here, we examine the distribution and function of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> histone H2A variant H2A.Z (called HTZ-1) during development. We demonstrate that HTZ-1 is required for proper development, and that embryos are dependent on a contribution of HTZ-1 from their mothers for survival. We mapped the location of HTZ-1 incorporation genome-wide and found that HTZ-1 binds upstream of 23&#x00025; of genes, which tend to be genes that are essential for development and occupied by RNA polymerase. Fewer sites of HTZ-1 incorporation were found on the X chromosome, probably due to an under-representation of essential genes on X rather than a direct role for HTZ-1 in X-chromosome dosage compensation. Our study reveals how the genome is remodeled by HTZ-1 to allow the proper regulation of genes critical for development.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In genomes ranging from protozoa to humans, specialized regions of chromatin are created by the local incorporation of variant histones into nucleosomes. The histone H2A variant H2A.Z is one such highly conserved variant, though the biophysical and biological function of H2A.Z incorporation into chromatin remains unresolved.</p><p>Evidence from <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> suggests a function for H2A.Z in transcriptional activation due to its localization to the transcriptionally active macronucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Stargell1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Wenkert1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. This function is consistent with genome-wide studies of Htz1 occupancy in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (hereafter &#x0201c;yeast&#x0201d;), which revealed Htz1 incorporation flanking a nucleosome-free region upstream of most genes. It has been hypothesized that H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes may contribute to transcriptional activation by being less stable than H2A-containing nucleosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Jin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Placek1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. However, others have reported that H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes are in fact slightly more stable than canonical nucleosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Thambirajah1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Li1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. This seeming contradiction may have been resolved by studies examining H2A.Z in combination with the histone H3 variant H3.3. In combination with histone H3, H2A.Z nucleosomes were at least as stable as H2A nucleosomes, but the combination of H2A.Z and H3.3 results in highly unstable nucleosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Jin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. This instability in conjunction with H3.3 could facilitate timely and efficient gene activation. Indeed, in yeast cells lacking H2A.Z, the activation of genes in response to heat shock or galactose is delayed, and recruitment of RNA polymerase II and TATA-binding protein to responsive promoters is diminished <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Adam1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Zhang1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Recent high-resolution mapping of H2A.Z in human cells also revealed a positive correlation between H2A.Z occupancy and transcription, providing additional support for an H2A.Z function in transcriptional activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Barski1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Despite the wealth of evidence for a positive association between H2A.Z and transcription, other genetic and cytological evidence suggests that H2A.Z also functions in gene silencing. The functional homolog of H2A.Z in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, H2Avd, is localized to both euchromatin and heterochromatin on polytene chromosomes, including the heterochromatic chromocenter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Leach1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Mavrich1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. By genetic criteria, H2Avd is considered to have a repressive function. H2Avd mutations are enhancers of Polycomb mutant phenotypes, suppressors of Trithorax group mutant phenotypes, and suppressors of position-effect variegation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Swaminathan1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Further evidence for a repressive function is found in mice, where H2A.Z promotes heterochromatin protein HP1&#x003b1; binding and co-localizes with HP1 at pericentric heterochromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Rangasamy1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Fan1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

This potentiation of transcription would be especially critical during periods of dynamic transcriptional regulation, such as occurs in development and environmental responses.

Another case in which HTZ-1 protein levels do not depend on zygotic transcription can be inferred from the presence of HTZ-1 protein in the germline precursors (P lineage).

We plotted HTZ-1 incorporation relative to the first gene in operons, where transcription is expected to initiate, and also plotted incorporation relative to internal genes, where transcription is not expected to initiate.

However, these criteria are imperfect, and do not provide information about genes that may be regulated both as part of an operon and by their own independent promoter. Independent transcription events within operons have been difficult to detect because the 5&#x02032; ends of mRNAs produced by either trans-splicing of a poly-cistronic mRNA or an independent transcription event are not readily distinguishable.</p><p>To identify genes that are likely to be regulated both as part of an operon and individually, we examined incorporation of HTZ-1 at internally encoded genes of annotated operons. Overall, 75&#x00025; of operons contained at least one HTZ-1 peak. A gene within an operon was more than twice as likely as a non-operon gene to have an HTZ-1 peak at its promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000187-g004">Figure 4A&#x02013;B</xref>). Of operons containing at least one site of HTZ-1 incorporation, 85&#x00025; contained a peak upstream of the first gene, as one might expect. However, 49&#x00025; of operons with HTZ-1 incorporation at the first gene also exhibited an internal peak of HTZ-1 incorporation.

Because some operons contain multiple internal HTZ-1 peaks, this represents a total of 455 putative independently regulated genes within annotated operons.

We explored three explanations for this under-representation: differential detection of the HTZ-1 protein specifically on the X; a function for HTZ-1 in dosage compensation; or an under-representation of developmentally important genes, which tend to be HTZ-1 targets, on X <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Maeda1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Reinke2">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The first possibility is reasonable because mammalian H2A.Z can be ubiquitylated on its C-terminus, and this mark distinguishes H2A.Z incorporated on the heterochromatin and silent X chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Sarcinella1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The C-terminal residues are conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic> HTZ-1, and include the antigen to which the antibody was raised. However, analysis of HTZ-1::YFP localization, in which detection would not be affected by modification state, indicates that under-representation on X is not due to epitope occlusion by ubiquitylation or any other cause (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000187.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p><p>The second possibility concerns <italic>C. elegans</italic> dosage compensation, during which the two hermaphrodite X chromosomes undergo chromosome-wide reduction in expression to match the output of the single male X chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Meyer1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. While we observed a high degree of overlap between sites of HTZ-1 incorporation and sites of DPY-27 binding, the converse did not hold true. Many sites of DCC binding occur in areas of no HTZ-1 incorporation, including known recruitment sites such as the <italic>rex-1</italic> locus. This suggests that Dosage Compensation Complex binding does not require HTZ-1. We interpret the extensive co-localization on X to indicate independent functions of HTZ-1 and the DCC, both of which act upstream of genes active during embryogenesis. This interpretation is further supported by very few instances of overlap between HTZ-1 and DPY-27 at sites away from promoters. For example, only nine HTZ-1 peaks on X overlap with the 219 DPY-27 peaks found in the region downstream of genes. Of the nine overlaps, all may be explained as having promoter function: six occurred in regions near another gene promoter, and the remaining three were bound by RNA Polymerase II despite the absence of a gene annotation. Finally, HTZ-1 is under-incorporated on X both prior to and subsequent to the activation of somatic dosage compensation during embryogenesis.</p><p>The simplest explanation for the under-representation of HTZ-1 on X is that during embryogenesis HTZ-1 and the DCC both tend to bind at the transcription initiation sites of active genes important for development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000187-g007">Figure 7K</xref>). Genes essential for development are approximately 2-fold under-represented on the X <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Maeda1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Kamath1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Reinke2">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, which is consistent with the approximately 2-fold under-incorporation of HTZ-1 on X. Although there are fewer sites of HTZ-1 incorporation on X, the individual sites of HTZ-1 incorporation on X do not differ in any quantifiable way from sites of incorporation on autosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000187.s008">Figure S8</xref>).</p><p>A ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq experiment revealing similar under-representation of HTZ-1 on the male X would provide further evidence against the direct involvement of HTZ-1 in dosage compensation. As stated in the results, HTZ-1 is likely to have an indirect function in dosage compensation and many other developmental processes by virtue of its incorporation at a wide spectrum of developmentally important genes. Nonetheless, our results do not completely rule out a direct positive or negative role for HTZ-1 in dosage compensation complex targeting or function. For example, the HTZ-1 on X could be post-translationally modified differently from HTZ-1 on autosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Sarcinella1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Millar1">&#x0005b;72&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Keogh1">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>, thereby conferring a distinct function for HTZ-1 depending on where in the genome it is incorporated.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Integrating Biochemical, Genetic, and Genomic Data Regarding H2A.Z</title><p>One challenge in understanding H2A.Z function is integrating very diverse types of data, each of which lends clues to H2A.Z function but has its own limitations. For example, our experiments were performed in an unsynchronized population of embryos composed of multiple cell types. Therefore, the results presented here are a static projection of the dynamic activation and repression events that are occurring at gene promoters. How this might be manifested in our dataset can be illustrated by considering a previous time-course study of HTZ-1 at the <italic>myo-2</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Updike1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. HTZ-1 was not incorporated into the <italic>myo-2</italic> promoter when it was repressed, but was transiently incorporated at the onset of transcription. HTZ-1 was then lost as <italic>myo-2</italic> became highly expressed later in development. In a temporal projection of these results, as occurs in our dataset, it appears as if HTZ-1 was very weakly incorporated (if at all) into the <italic>myo-2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000187.s012">Text S1</xref>). Our genome-wide data indicates a preferential incorporation of HTZ-1 at developmentally dynamic promoters, and a loss of HTZ-1 at very highly transcribed genes. We infer that the general conclusions implied by the previous time-course study conducted at the <italic>myo-2</italic> locus are now extended to the entire genome by our data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000187-Updike1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The biophysical properties of nucleosomes containing H2A.Z provide clues about how H2A.Z could facilitate precise, coordinated developmental transcriptional programs.
