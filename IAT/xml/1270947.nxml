Ebp1 inhibits transcription of E2F1 and androgen receptor regulated genes such as prostate specific antigen (PSA) through its interactions with histone deacetylases (HDACs). To further understand Ebp1's interactions with other components of the transcriptional repression machinery, we examined the association of Ebp1 with the corepressor Sin3A. Ebp1 interacted with Sin3A both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> as demonstrated by glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation analysis. The C-terminal domain of Ebp1, responsible for its ability to repress transcription and arrest cell growth, was necessary and sufficient for binding Sin3A. The C-terminal domain of Sin3A, containing the paired amphipathic domain 4 and the HDAC interacting domain, bound Ebp1. Recombinant Sin3A bound Ebp1 directly, but recombinant HDAC2 failed to bind Ebp1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and DNA affinity precipitation analysis demonstrated that Ebp1 and Sin3A associate at the PSA and E2F1 promoters. Functionally, Sin3A enhanced the ability of Ebp1 to repress transcription of androgen receptor (AR) and E2F1 regulated genes. These results demonstrate that Ebp1 participates in transcriptional regulation via its interaction with the Sin3&#x02013;HDAC.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ebp1, a member of the <italic>PA2G4</italic> family of proliferation regulated proteins, was isolated as an ErbB3 binding protein in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). The ectopic expression of Ebp1 inhibits the growth of human breast and prostate cancer cells and induces cellular differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Ebp1 represses transcription of both E2F1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>) and androgen receptor (AR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) regulated genes. Ebp1 binds to the E2F1 promoter in a complex with the E2F1 transcription factor and Rb and Ebp1 activity on the E2F1 promoter is regulated by the ErbB3 ligand heregulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Ebp1 contains an autonomous C-terminal transcriptional repression domain that binds histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and HDAC2. The ability of Ebp1 to repress transcription is partially reversed by HDAC inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>).</p><p>Histone acetylation has emerged as a major mechanism of the control of gene expression. Hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 is generally associated with transcriptionally active chromatin, while the chromatin of inactive regions is enriched in deacetylated histones. The acetylation status of histones at specific DNA regulatory sequences depends on the recruitment of histone acetyltransferases or histone deacetylase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). HDACs are frequently recruited to specific DNA sites by association with corepressor molecules as part of multimolecular repressor complexes. HDAC1 and 2 exist in at least three multiprotein complexes: the Sin3, the NuRD/NRD/M12 and the CoRest complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). The Sin3 complex contains the Sin3A and Sin3B corepressors, class I HDAC1/2 and additional associated proteins such as RbAp46 and 48, SAP18 and SAP30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). The abundance and relative stability of both Sin3 and HDAC proteins have led to the proposal that the core Sin3 represssor complexes are pre-assembled and available for recruitment by transient association with gene specific transcription factors. To date, several transcriptional repressors have been shown to associate with the Sin3 complex to mediate repression of target genes. This is exemplified by MAD proteins whose transcriptional repressing activity has been correlated to the recruitment of HDACs together with the Sin3A and Sin3B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Other examples of transcriptional repressors that bind Sin3A include MECp2, Alien, Ikaros, p53 and PLZF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Certain unliganded nuclear receptors exert transcriptional regulatory effects via their ability to recruit the corepressor SMRT which in turn associates with both Sin3A and HDACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>).</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to further understand the basis of the ability of Ebp1 to repress transcription of E2F1 and AR regulated promoters by examining its interactions with other proteins involved in transcriptional regulation. Sin3A was identified as a candidate interacting partner initially because of its interactions with HDAC2. Second, Sin3A has been demonstrated to be associated with both AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) and Rb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) regulated promoters and to contribute to repression of the activities of such promoters. Therefore, we reasoned that Sin3A might contribute to the activity of Ebp1 for both AR and E2F1 regulated genes. We therefore investigated the involvement of Sin3A in Ebp1-mediated gene repression. We determined that Ebp1 could bind Sin3A and mapped their interaction domains. We also assessed if Ebp1 and Sin3A could interact on endogenous promoters and if Sin3A could enhance the ability of Ebp1 to repress transcriptional activity. We found that Sin3A is a functional corepressor for Ebp1, supporting the model that Ebp1 mediates the repression of AR and E2F1 regulated promoters by the recruitment of a corepressor complex containing HDAC2 and Sin3A.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Va) and maintained at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in air.

To determine which regions of Sin3A are required for interaction with Ebp1, we performed pulldown assays using GST&#x02013;Sin3A fusion proteins and HeLa cell nuclear lysates. A fragment containing PAH4 and most of the C-terminal domain of Sin3A (545&#x02013;1157) pulled down endogenous Ebp1.

We first examined the ability of <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized Sin3A and HDAC2 added individually to bind to Ebp1 using <italic>in vitro</italic> protein pull-down experiments. Full-length <italic>in vitro</italic> translated Sin3A protein alone was added to GST&#x02013;Ebp1 beads.

In contrast to results with Sin3A, no binding was detected between GST&#x02013;Ebp1 and <italic>in vitro</italic>-translated HDAC2, suggesting the binding of HDAC2, derived from cell lysates to Ebp1 was indirect. Although HDAC1 has been reported to bind to Sin3A in <italic>in vitro</italic> translation assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), the binding of HDAC2 to Sin3A has not been reported in such systems. To verify that HDAC2 was intact and that it could bind to Sin3A, we incubated [<sup>35</sup>S] HDAC2 to GST&#x02013;Sin3A. HDAC2 was able to bind to Sin3A directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

The corepressors NCoR and SMRT are associated with ARE I only. LNCaP cells were serum starved and then treated with the androgen antagonist bicalutamide for 1 h. Ebp1 was not associated with the ARE I response element of the PSA promoter in the absence of bicalutamide, but was recruited to the PSA promoter after bicalutamide exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) as demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). In contrast, Ebp1 was not found on the ARE II response element of the PSA promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) indicating that the association of Ebp1 with ARE I was specific. Sin3A was found on the ARE I response element of the PSA promoter under growth arrested conditions in the absence of bicalutamide, and its presence was only slightly increased after treatment with bicalutamide. HDAC2 was associated with the PSA promoter before bicalutamide treatment, but its association was increased after exposure to bicalutamide as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Thus all three proteins assembled at the PSA promoter after treatment with an androgen antagonist.</p><p>We next used DNA affinity precipitation assays to determine if Sin3A associates with Ebp1 at an E2F1 consensus element. MCF-7 cells were transfected with an EGFP vector control or an EGFP&#x02013;Ebp1 expression plasmid TA. Cell lysates were incubated with the biotinylated E2F1 promoter consensus oligonucleotide and bound proteins determined by western blotting. GFP&#x02013;Ebp1 was found associated with the E2F1 oligonucleotide. No GFP reactive proteins from lysates of cells that had not been transfected or cells that were transfected with the GFP vector alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, upper panel) were found associated with the E2F1 oligo. Endogenous Ebp1 was also associated with the oligonucleotide, although binding was decreased in the GFP only transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, middle panel). Sin3A was found associated with the E2F1 consensus oligonucleotide in all three cell lysates. However, overexpression of Ebp1 increased the binding of Sin3A to the consensus oligonucleotide suggesting binding of Sin3A to the E2F1 promoter may be via its association with Ebp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, bottom panel). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>) Ebp1 from MCF-7 cell lysates was unable to bind to an E2F1 oligo in which the two E2F1 consensus sites were mutated (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Cooperation of Ebp1, Sin3A and HDAC to repress the transcription</title><p>To determine if Sin3A and Ebp1 could cooperate to repress transcriptional activity, we first analyzed the effect of Ebp1 on the E2F1 promoter in the presence and absence of ectopically expressed Sin3A and HDAC2 in MCF-7 cells. To observe potential cooperation, pcDNA3-<italic>ebp1</italic> was transfected under conditions that resulted in a partial repression of the promoter. Ectopically expressed Sin3A alone did not affect E2F1 transcription and did not increase the ability of Ebp1 to repress transcription. In contrast, transfection of HDAC2 repressed the E2F1 promoter. However, a stronger repression was observed after cotransfection of Ebp1 with HDAC and Sin3A than that observed with either plasmid alone or with any two plasmids in combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). These findings suggests that these proteins can cooperate in mediating repression of an E2F1 regulated promoter. To further support the hypothesis that direct interactions of Ebp1 with Sin3A and HDAC2 were important for these effects, we also transfected <italic>ebp1</italic> in which the LXXLL domain had been mutated to LXXAA to prevent Ebp1&#x02013;Sin3A interactions. The LXXAA mutant did not inhibit E2F1 signaling. The lack of activity of the mutant was not changed by transfection of Sin3A, HDAC2 or the combination.</p><p>We also examined the ability of the three proteins to repress the androgen regulated transcription of an AR regulated promoter. Cells were transfected with Ebp1, HDAC, Sin3A expression plasmids or the combination and an AR regulated MMTV-luciferase reporter plasmid. Cells were then stimulated with R1881. None of the constructs alone or in combination affected the low level of transcription observed in the absence of R1881 (data not shown). However, in the presence of R1881, Ebp1 at limiting concentrations repressed AR transcription &#x0223c;40%. Sin3A and HDAC alone at the concentrations tested had no effect on activation of AR by R1881. Unlike in the case of the E2F1 promoter, Sin3A alone was able to enhance the ability of Ebp1 to repress AR regulated transcription. Similarly, HDAC alone potentiated the ability of Ebp1 to repress R1881 induced transcription. All three constructs did not further increase the transcriptional repression observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). As described above, we also transfected the LXXAA mutant which was reported previously to be unable to affect transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). The LXAAA mutant did not affect transcription by itself and had no effects on the ability of HDAC2 and Sin3A in combination to repress transcription.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Ebp1 has been previously demonstrated to repress transcription of endogenous and exogenous AR and E2F1 regulated genes via its association with HDACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). In this study, we investigated whether the known corepressor Sin3A, a crucial component of many inducible repression systems involving HDACs, was involved in Ebp1-mediated transcriptional repression. We found that Sin3A interacted with the C-terminal domain of Ebp1 that is required to repress transcription. The fact that Ebp1 associated with Sin3A further supports the role of Ebp1 in transcriptional repression and provides a mechanistic basis for its ability to inhibit cell growth. These findings also demonstrate that a protein such as Ebp1, that can be activated via ErbB signaling, is involved in Sin3A-mediated transcriptional repression.</p><p>GST pull-down assays mapped the sites of interaction on the two proteins. Amino acids 293&#x02013;372 of Ebp1 were necessary and sufficient for interaction with Sin3A. This region has been previously shown to be responsible both for the transcriptional repression and growth inhibitory activity of Ebp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). These C-terminal 79 amino acids also bind HDAC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Thus, HDAC2 and Sin3A are likely to be found as a complex <italic>in vivo</italic>. To further clarify interactions between Ebp1, Sin3A and HDAC2, we performed pull-down assays using <italic>in vitro</italic>-translated proteins. Results using <italic>in vitro</italic>-translated Sin3A indicated that Ebp1 bound Sin3A directly. In contrast, <italic>in vitro</italic>-translated HDAC2, which binds Ebp1 as a component of cell lysates, failed to interact with Ebp1. Thus, we postulate that Sin3A acts as a bridge between Ebp1 and HDAC2 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results also indicated that mutation of the LXXLL motif to LXXAA abrogated the ability of Ebp1 to bind to Sin3A. Although LXXLL motifs were originally identified as components of nuclear hormone receptor binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), recent studies have demonstrated that there are numerous examples of other types of protein&#x02013;protein interactions involving LXXLL motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Indeed, transcription factors such as Bcd use hydrophobic surfaces to interact with Sin3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Therefore, disruption of this motif may result in a change of conformation that leads to failure to bind Sin3A.</p><p>The Ebp1 interacting domain of Sin3A mapped to amino acid 545&#x02013;1147 encoding the PAH4 and the C-terminal domain. This is of interest as HDAC2, derived from whole cell lysates, was demonstrated to bind to amino acid 480&#x02013;680 of Sin3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Thus, Ebp1 may be bound in tandem with HDAC2 or in a complex at the same site of Sin3A. Similarly, the corepressor SMRT binds to Sin3A through amino acid 57&#x02013;215 and 533&#x02013;724 domains. The C-terminal domain outside of PAH4 (HCR domain) interacts with other transcriptional repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) including the nuclear receptor corepressor Alien (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). The binding of Ebp1 to the C-terminal region of Sin3A stands in contrast to its binding to the repressors MAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) which binds PAH2 and REST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) which binds the N-terminal region of Sin3A. The N-terminal domain of Sin3A also interacts with TGIF, another repressor of AR-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). It is possible that both TGIF and Ebp1 may be recruited to Sin3A under conditions such as androgen antagonist treatment which results in transcriptional inactivation of the androgen receptor.</p><p>ChIP assays showed that Ebp1 was absent from the PSA promoter under steroid-reduced conditions, but was recruited to the PSA promoter in the presence of the androgen antagonist bicalumtamide. Ebp1 was not recruited to ARE II indicating a specific association with genomic DNA. Similarly, other AR repressors have been mapped to ARE I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), but their presence on ARE II has not been reported. HDAC was associated at the ARE I of the PSA promoter under serum-starved conditions. Similarly, Gaughan <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>) reported previously that HDACs were associated with the ARE I region of the PSA promoter under serum-starved conditions. However, HDAC2 was also recruited to the PSA promoter by bicalutamide. In contrast, the amount of Sin3A detected by ChIP analysis appeared to be little changed. Sin3A may be on the PSA promoter in the absence of bicalutamide because cells are in a resting state. Sin3A may serve as a platform onto which other cofactors are recruited in response to different stimuli. Although Ebp1 and Sin3A appear not be recruited in tandem, the addition of Ebp1 to the HDAC&#x02013;Sin3A complex may enhance the ability of these molecules to repress transcription. Our ChIP studies support the functional role of Ebp1, Sin3A and HDAC binding in transcriptional repression mediated by bicalutamide.</p><p>DNA affinity precipitation assays also indicated that Ebp1 and Sin3A bound an E2F1 promoter consensus oligonucleotide. DNA affinity precipitation assays previously indicated that Rb and HDAC were also recruited to an E2F1 consensus oligonucleotide with Ebp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Similarly, the retinoblastoma binding protein RBP1 was demonstrated to recruit Sin3A complexes containing HDAC and Rb to E2F promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Although Ebp1 can bind Rb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>), we do not know if Ebp1 is part of a multiprotein complex containing RBP1. However, the ability of Ebp1 to bind transcription factors such as E2F1 and AR suggest that Ebp1 may recruit Sin3A to DNA in the presence of sequence-specific DNA-binding factors to repress transcription.</p><p>To test the functional importance of Ebp1&#x02013;Sin3A&#x02013;HDAC complexes, we examined the ability of these proteins to inhibit transcriptional activity. Luciferase reporter assays indicated that Sin3A alone did not enhance the ability of Ebp1 to repress E2F1-mediated transcription. However, HDAC2 and Sin3A together enhanced the transcriptional repression observed using low concentrations of Ebp1 plasmid suggesting the importance of a multiprotein complex. An Ebp1 LXXAA mutant, which does not bind Sin3A, was unable to repress transcription by itself or to lead to transcriptional repression in the presence of Sin3A. This finding suggests that interactions of Ebp1 and Sin3A are important for the observed synergistic effects. Sin3A or HDAC2 alone were able to enhance the ability of wild-type, but not mutant, Ebp1 to repress AR-mediated transcription. Other studies also indicate that Sin3A&#x02013;HDAC is important for silencing of AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). Sharma and Sun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) demonstated that the transcriptional repressor TGIF could inhibit AR transcriptional activity in the presence of androgens via its association with Sin3A and HDAC1. It is of interest that TGIF is a member of the TGF-&#x003b2; signal transduction pathway whose activity is modulated by TGF-&#x003b2;. Similarly, Ebp1 is a member of a HRG activated ErbB3 pathway and its ability to modulate AR activity is dependent on HRG concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). These studies indicate that AR may be regulated by multiple physiological signals originating from different signal transduction pathways.</p><p>In conclusion, the results presented here indicate that Ebp1 can bind the transcriptional repressor Sin3A both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. The C-terminal domain of Ebp1 that is required for its ability to repress transcription and to inhibit cell growth interacts with Sin3A. Ebp1, Sin3A and HDAC can associate on promoters and interact to repress transcription. These studies provide a model of Ebp1-mediated silencing through recruitment of Sin3A and subsequently HDACs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported in part by NIH grants R01 CA76047 and R21 088882-01 and a grant from the Department of Pathology (to A.W.H.).

None of the expression vectors affected basal luciferase activity in the absence of R1881. Each point represents mean &#x000b1;S.E. of triplicate wells. Representative of three experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gki903f7"/></fig></sec></back></article>
