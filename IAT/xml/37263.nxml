We compared the requirement for p53 protein activation of p53 target sequences in two major p53-regulated genes, <italic>p21&#x0002f;WAF1</italic> (encoding a cell cycle inhibitory protein) and <italic>Mdm2</italic> (encoding a ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for proteolytic degradation). The p53 binding site in the proximal p21&#x0002f;WAF1 promoter contains a single p53 binding consensus sequence, while the p53 binding site in the Mdm2 promoter contains two consensus sequences linked by a 17 bp spacer. Binding of recombinant p53 protein to the p21&#x0002f;WAF1 binding site required monoclonal antibody PAb421, which can mimic activating phosphorylation and&#x0002f;or acetylation events at the C-terminus. In contrast, recombinant p53 bound strongly to the Mdm2 binding site in the absence of PAb421 antibody. Separate binding to each consensus sequence of the Mdm2 binding site still required PAb421, indicating that p53 binding was not simply due to greater affinity to the Mdm2 consensus sequences. Linking two p21&#x0002f;WAF1 binding sites with the 17 bp spacer region from the <italic>Mdm2</italic> gene eliminated the PAb421 requirement for p53 binding to the p21&#x0002f;WAF1 site. These results suggest a mechanism for regulation of <italic>Mdm2</italic> gene transcription that differs from that other p53-induced genes by its lack of a requirement for C-terminal activation of p53 protein. A steady induction of Mdm2 protein would maintain p53 protein at low levels until post-translational modifications following DNA damage increased p53 activity towards other genes, mediating p53 growth inhibitory and apoptotic activities.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The p53 tumor suppressor protein transactivates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis genes. p53 gene inactivation by mutation is one of the most common alterations in human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke311c1">1</xref>). p53 activation is mediated by post-translational modifications that increase both the p53 protein half-life and affinity for its DNA binding sequence. The increase in p53 half-life is mainly due to reduced affinity for Mdm2, a p53 binding protein that mediates p53 ubiquitination and degradation through the proteasome pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke311c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke311c3">3</xref>). The <italic>Mdm2</italic> gene itself is transcriptionally activated by p53, closing an autoregulatory feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke311c4">4</xref>). Besides protein stabilization, p53 is thought to require activation of its sequence-specific DNA binding function to transactivate its target genes. The p53 protein binds to a consensus binding motif made up of two decameric palindromes separated by 0&#x02013;13 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke311c5">5</xref>), represented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f1">1</xref>. The binding of recombinant or mammalian expressed p53 protein to this sequence is weak but can be activated <italic>in vitro</italic> by agents that interact with or modify the last 30 amino acids in the p53 C-terminus. Phosphorylation within this 30 amino acid region by casein kinase II, binding of PAb421, alternative splicing, deletion, or incubation with peptides corresponding to this region can activate the p53 DNA binding function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke311c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke311c8">8</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic> translated p53 requires incubation with either PAb421 or nuclear extracts for significant binding to the consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke311c9">9</xref>). Models have been proposed in which the p53 C-terminus folds and interacts with the central core of the p53 protein, maintaining the molecule in a latent form (inhibited for DNA binding) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke311c8">8</xref>). Post-translational modifications of the C-terminus after stress or genotoxic stimuli could diminish this interaction, resulting in activation of the p53 protein&#x02013;DNA binding function. These post-translational modifications include serine and threonine phosphorylations and lysine acetylations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke311c10">10</xref>).</p><p><italic> Mdm2</italic>- and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor <italic>WAF1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke311c11">11</xref>) genes are transcriptional targets of the p53 protein, encoding proteins that participate in p53 stability regulation and p53-mediated G<sub>1</sub> arrest, respectively. Mdm2 differs from other p53&#x000a0;regulated genes in that its promoter contains a double p53 binding site composed of two p53 consensus sequences separated by a 17 bp spacer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke311c4">4</xref>). In contrast, the p53 binding sites proximal to the promoters of other known p53 regulated genes, such as <italic>WAF1</italic>, contain a single p53 consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke311c11">11</xref>). A critical question is whether differences in the particular p53 binding elements in target genes may alter the requirement for p53 post-translational modification and activation. Such differences could modulate the transcriptional activation kinetics of different p53 target genes and regulate the p53 response. To begin to answer this question, we analyzed the relative DNA binding activities of recombinant human p53 proteins to the p53 binding sites present in the <italic>WAF1</italic> and <italic>Mdm2</italic> genes. Either monoclonal antibody PAb421 or deletion of the last 30 amino acids in the p53 sequence was used to mimic the activation events at the p53 C-terminus. The results indicate that the requirement for p53 C-terminal activation depends on the particular binding element; binding to the single p53 site present in the WAF1 promoter requires activation, while binding to the double p53 binding site present in the <italic>Mdm2</italic> gene promoter is constitutive. This suggests a mechanism of differential regulation of p53 target genes responsive to stress or genotoxic stimuli.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Recombinant p53 protein production in insect cells</title><p>The recombinant human wild-type p53 and C-terminally deleted p53&#x00394;30 proteins were expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke311c12">12</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)</title><p>Double-stranded oligonucleotides for the Mdm2-P2 promoter and WAF1 promoters (detailed in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f1">1</xref>) were synthesized by the Biopolymer Core Facility of Roswell Park Cancer Institute (Buffalo, NY) and by Takara Biomedicals (Kyoto, Japan).

As expected, binding to the WAF1 binding site required C-terminal activation by antibody PAb421; a retardation complex was formed only in the presence of PAb421 antibody in the reaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f2">2</xref>, lane 7) and not in its absence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f2">2</xref>, lane 6). However, under the same conditions, binding to the native Mdm2 site occurred in the absence of PAb421 and could be detected even with 20&#x000a0;ng of p53 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f2">2</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;4), while in the absence of PAb421, no binding to WAF1-BS could be detected even with 100 ng of p53 protein (lane 6). When two WAF1 binding sites were linked by the same 17 bp spacer sequence found in the double Mdm2 binding site (to produce the 2&#x000d7;WAF1 oligonucleotide, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f1">1</xref>), p53 protein could bind to the new oligonucleotide in the absence of PAb421 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f2">2</xref>, lane 9). There was no increase in signal of the more slowly migrating 2&#x000d7;WAF1&#x02013;p53 complex in the presence of PAb421 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f2">2</xref>, lane 11 compared to lane 9), suggesting that the p53 protein was fully capable of binding to the 2&#x000d7;WAF1 template.</p><p> Deletion of the C-terminal 30 amino acids in p53, which contain the PAb421 epitope, has been shown to activate p53 binding to its consensus sequence equally as well as addition of PAb421 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke311c8">8</xref>). Thus, a p53 protein without the last 30 amino acids (p53&#x00394;30) should bind equally well to single WAF1, double Mdm2-FL and double 2&#x000d7;WAF1 oligonucleotides. The p53&#x00394;30 protein was expressed in insect cells, and the binding of the purified p53&#x00394;30 protein to these oligonucleotides was tested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f3">3</xref>). No significant differences were seen between the binding activity of p53&#x00394;30 to WAF1-BS and 2&#x000d7;WAF1 oligonucleotides (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f3">3</xref>, lanes 7 and 10). Competition between radiolabeled and unlabeled WAF1-BS and 2&#x000d7;WAF1 oligonucleotides showed no difference in affinity of p53&#x00394;30 to any of these oligonucleotides: both the unlabeled single and double WAF1 oligonucleotides could compete with equal efficiency for binding to radiolabeled WAF1-BS and 2&#x000d7;WAF1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f3">3</xref>, lanes 8, 9 and 11, 12). This suggests that the double p53 binding site configuration can fully substitute for the C-terminal activation of p53 protein, at least when using the WAF1 binding site. However, the single sites Mdm2-1 and Mdm2-2, each representing half of the full-length Mdm2 binding site as indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f1">1</xref>, were not able to fully compete for binding to the double Mdm2 binding site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f3">3</xref>, lanes 3&#x02013;6). This could be due to a lower intrinsic affinity of the p53 protein for the single Mdm2, as opposed to the single WAF1 site. The relative affinities of full-length p53 protein for the single or double Mdm2 DNA binding sites were compared, as shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f5">5</xref>. As expected from the results in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f2">2</xref>, the p53 protein bound to the naturally occurring double Mdm2 site in the absence of PAb421 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f4">4</xref>, lane 7) and was supershifted in its presence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f4">4</xref>, lane 9). The p53 protein failed to bind monomers of the Mdm2 binding site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f4">4</xref>, lanes 1 and 4) unless activated by PAb421 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f4">4</xref>, lanes 2 and 5). Competition experiments, in which increasing concentrations of cold Mdm2-1, Mdm2-2 and Mdm2-FL displaced bound radiolabeled Mdm2-FL, confirmed that p53 protein has a higher affinity for Mdm2-FL than for Mdm2-1 or Mdm2-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f5">5</xref>A). The affinity for Mdm2-2 was higher than for Mdm2-1, since at the highest concentration (5000 nM), Mdm2-2 could compete for &#x0223c;60&#x00025; of the labeled Mdm2-FL oligonucleotide, while at the same concentration, Mdm2-1 still was unable to compete for Mdm2-FL binding to any degree. Because the results shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f4">4</xref> suggested that p53 protein may have still higher affinity for Mdm2-FL in the presence of PAb421 than in its absence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f4">4</xref>, compare lanes 7 and 9), the same competition studies were carried out in the presence of PAb421 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f5">5</xref>B). As expected, in the presence of PAb421 the affinity of p53 protein for the radioactively labeled Mdm2-FL and each of the unlabeled competitors were similar, but with Mdm2-1 still the least effective competitor. Because there was an indication in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke311f4">4</xref> (lane 9 compared to lane 7) that while not required, PAb421 could still increase the binding to the Mdm2-FL, affinity constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) were measured. The <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of p53 protein binding to Mdm2-FL was 21.28 &#x000b1; 1.19 nM in the absence of PAb421 and 3.12 &#x000b1; 0.62 nM in the presence of PAb421. Thus, the double binding site in the Mdm2 promoter alleviates the requirement for C-terminal activation, but C-terminal activation may still be required for full DNA binding activity of the p53 protein.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Taken together, our results indicate that the p53 protein has constitutive DNA binding activity for the tandem sites present in the <italic>Mdm2</italic> gene promoter, and the requirement for p53 C-terminal activation depends on the particular DNA binding sequence. These results provide a potential mechanism for differential regulation of p53 target genes after genotoxic stress. This is particularly relevant for p53 steady-state regulation and for response to DNA damage, considering the major role of Mdm2 protein in regulating p53 protein stability. The Mdm2 protein binds to the p53 N-terminal domain and promotes p53 protein ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation. The Mdm2 protein is also responsible for the low levels of p53 protein found in normal cells in the absence of genotoxic stimuli. DNA damage induces p53 phosphorylation at the N-terminus, diminishing the interaction with Mdm2 protein and increasing p53 protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke311c13">13</xref>). The proposed regulatory feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke311c4">4</xref>), through induction of <italic>Mdm2</italic> gene transcription by activated p53, is a critical mechanism to maintain low levels of p53 protein in the absence of a genotoxic stimulus and to control the extent of p53 protein induction after DNA damage. That the double nature of the <italic>Mdm2</italic> gene p53 binding site alleviates the requirement of p53 C-terminal activation for effective DNA binding is likely to contribute to the efficiency of the Mdm2&#x02013;p53 self-regulatory loop. Because no other activation events are required to induce Mdm2, p53 protein would be maintained at low steady state levels by Mdm2 protein. After genotoxic damage, p53 is post-translationally modified in the C- and N-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke311c10">10</xref>). The N-terminal post-translational modifications inhibit Mdm2 binding, resulting in accumulation of p53 proteins activated for inducing WAF1 and other p53 downstream genes. That p53 binding activity to the Mdm2 promoter still increases after C-terminal activation may contribute to the efficiency of the Mdm2&#x02013;p53 regulatory loop after genotoxic damage.</p><p> Protein interactions between p53 molecules binding to individual consensus sequences within the double site are probably responsible for the increased affinity towards double sites. The p53 protein contains an oligomerization domain in the C-terminal third of the molecule that mediates the formation of p53 tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke311c14">14</xref>). Further stabilization can occur through stacking of these tetramers into higher order aggregates through the hydrophobic central domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke311c15">15</xref>). Cooperative binding to double consensus sites would increase the affinity of p53 for its DNA binding sequence without the need for C-terminal activation. To our knowledge, the <italic>Mdm2</italic> gene is the only p53 responsive gene described with a double p53 binding sequence capable of binding by latent p53. The current results suggest a mechanism whereby transcription of <italic>Mdm2</italic> in cells could be differentially regulated compared to other p53 regulated genes. However, they do not rule out the possibility that additional modifications of the p53 protein can further modulate DNA binding specificity for other p53 responsive gene promoters.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke311f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> p53 binding sequences used in these experiments.
