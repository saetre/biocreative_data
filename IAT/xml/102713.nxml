Non-LTR retrotransposons contain dA-rich sequences at the 3&#x02032; end of their coding strand which, in many cases, is poly(dA). They usually have two open reading frames (ORFs), the second of which encodes nuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c2">2</xref>) and reverse transcriptase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c4">4</xref>) activities. Most non-LTR retrotransposons are dispersed in the genome but some insert at specific sites. The latter include <italic>R1</italic> and <italic>R2</italic> which insert at specific sites in rRNA genes of insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c5">5</xref>), and <italic>HeT-A</italic> and <italic>TART</italic> in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c7">7</xref>) which insert at chromosome ends and compensate for the absence of standard telomeric repeats.</p><p>Reverse transcription of the RNA transposition intermediate of non-LTR retrotransposons is thought to occur at the site of integration (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c8">8</xref>). According to current models, the endonuclease encoded by the element makes staggered single strand breaks at the target site and the reverse transcriptase uses the 3&#x02032; hydroxyl at one of the nicks to prime synthesis of the first DNA strand using the RNA transposition intermediate as template. Some steps of this process have been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> using the site-specific <italic>R2Bm</italic> element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c12">12</xref>). <italic>R2Bm</italic> is a non-LTR retrotransposon of <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> with a single ORF which encodes both reverse transcriptase and endonuclease activities. Reverse transcription of <italic>R2Bm</italic> initiates precisely at the 3&#x02032; end of the element provided that the RNA template contains additional nucleotides corresponding to DNA downstream of the site of insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c13">13</xref>). The additional nucleotides at the 3&#x02032; end of the RNA presumably facilitate alignment of the RNA with the site of insertion during reverse transcription.</p><p>Very little is known about the sequences required at the 3&#x02032;&#x000a0;ends of non-LTR retrotransposons that are not sequence specific to allow initiation of reverse transcription. <italic>L1Hs</italic> elements that occur in the human genome contain a putative polyadenylation signal near their 3&#x02032; ends and their transcripts contain poly(A) tails that appear to be at least partially reverse transcribed during transposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c16">16</xref>). This is not true for all non-LTR retrotransposons, however, since some have other A-rich sequences at their 3&#x02032; ends like the TAA repeats of the <italic>I</italic>&#x000a0;factor of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c17">17</xref>), <italic>Dong</italic> of <italic>B.mori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c18">18</xref>), <italic>LOA</italic> of <italic>Drosophila silvestris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c19">19</xref>) and <italic>Q</italic> of <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c20">20</xref>).</p><p><italic>I</italic> factors are non-LTR retrotransposons that are not site specific and are present in some strains of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> known as inducer (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c22">22</xref>). Strains devoid of functional <italic>I</italic> factors are called reactive. <italic>I</italic> factors are stable in inducer strains, but transpose at high frequencies in the germ line of the females, known as SF females, resulting from crosses between reactive females and inducer males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c23">23</xref>). They have 4&#x02013;8 repeats of the trinucleotide TAA at the 3&#x02032; end of the coding strand which contains two ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c24">24</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f1">1</xref>A). ORF2 putatively encodes nuclease, reverse transcriptase and RNase H activities. A 5.4 kb long RNA containing the complete sequence of the element, including UAA repeats, which is thought to be the transposition intermediate, is synthesized in the ovaries of SF females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c25">25</xref>).</p><p>In this paper we show that the transposition intermediates of a wild-type <italic>I</italic> factor extend a few nucleotides beyond the TAA repeats and that these extra nucleotides are not normally integrated into chromosomal DNA during retrotransposition. We have constructed <italic>I</italic> elements containing mutations affecting the TAA repeats and shown that they are not required for transposition. Transposed copies of these mutated elements have tandem repeats of various types at their 3&#x02032; ends. These might be produced by an activity of the reverse transcriptase of the <italic>I</italic> factor related to that of the reverse transcriptases of telomerases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Construction of the mutated <italic>I</italic> factors</title><p><italic>pI97</italic> was constructed by PCR amplification of <italic>pI954</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c26">26</xref>) using primers 6851 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f1">1</xref>A: 5&#x02032;-CTGCAGTCCATGGTACCAATCTATTAAC-3&#x02032;) and 97 in the flanking DNA (5&#x02032;-GGAATTCTTTTTTTTTTTTTGATAGATAGAATAGTTTAC-3&#x02032;) and ligating the <italic>Kpn</italic>I&#x02013;<italic>Eco</italic>RI digested PCR products into the corresponding restriction sites of <italic>pI954</italic>.

Ten micrograms of total RNA extracted with the RNAble (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France) from 50 flies were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with 10 U of DNase I (Gibco BRL, Cergy, France). Eighty picomoles of the anchor oligonucleotide (5&#x02032;-CAACGGTGGTATATCCAGTGATTTT-3&#x02032;) were ligated overnight to the RNA with 120 U of RNA ligase (Gibco BRL).

We used RLM-3&#x02032;-RACE to determine precisely the structure of the 3&#x02032; end of transcripts from full-length <italic>I</italic> factors. This was done using RNA extracted from SF females produced by crossing females of the reactive strain <italic>JA</italic> with males of strain <italic>21.1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c28">28</xref>) which contains a single functional <italic>I</italic> factor, <italic>I954Y</italic>, with 5 TAA repeats at its 3&#x02032; end (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f1">1</xref>B). We observed two types of transcript (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f1">1</xref>B). Both were obtained in two independent experiments. Up to four nucleotides downstream of <italic>I954Y</italic> were present at the 3&#x02032; end of the RNAs, suggesting that transcription terminates a few nucleotides downstream of the TAA repeats.</p><p>In order to determine whether or not these additional nucleotides are copied by reverse transcriptase during <italic>I</italic> factor retrotransposition we sequenced the ends of transposed copies from the single element <italic>I954Y</italic> contained in the <italic>21.1</italic> transgenic line. These were cloned from DNA extracted from 50 males coming directly from SF females produced by crossing <italic>21.1</italic> males and <italic>JA</italic> reactive females in such a way that it is very likely that each transposed copy resulted from a single transposition event that occurred in the germ line of the SF females. They were cloned by inverse PCR using <italic>Bst</italic>Y1 digested DNA and primers 3 and 5, and sequenced using oligonucleotides 1 and 5 as primers (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f1">1</xref>A and Materials and Methods).</p><p>The sequences of both ends of 14 transposed copies were determined. Two of them were not flanked by target site duplications suggesting that they have been involved in chromosomal rearrangements that frequently occur in the SF female germ line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c31">31</xref>). Target site duplications delimit the ends of the other 12 transposed <italic>I</italic> factors. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f1">1</xref>C summarizes the data. The 3&#x02032; ends of these transposed copies can be assigned to the last nucleotide preceding the target site duplication.

Transgenic lines containing these elements were established using the reactive stock <italic>JA</italic> for transgenesis, and were called <italic>97-52</italic> for <italic>I97</italic>, and <italic>99-18</italic> and <italic>99-59</italic> for <italic>I99</italic>. They were maintained by crosses <italic>en masse</italic>, allowing transposition to occur provided the mutated <italic>I</italic> elements retained the ability to transpose. After several generations, all lines behaved as typical inducer stocks (data not shown), indicating that elements <italic>I97</italic> and <italic>I99</italic> can transpose and that the transgenic stocks contain multiple copies resulting from retrotransposition of these mutated <italic>I</italic> elements.</p></sec><sec><title>The reverse transcriptase of the <italic>I</italic> factor might generate repeats at the 3&#x02032; end of the element</title><p>We have determined the structure of the 3&#x02032; ends of transposed copies of <italic>I97</italic>. DNA was extracted from 50 flies of stock <italic>97-52</italic> and digested with <italic>Nde</italic>II. The ends of transposed copies of <italic>I97</italic>, named <italic>IpA</italic> elements, were cloned by inverse PCR experiments using oligonucleotides 3 and 7, and sequenced using primer 1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f1">1</xref>A). The sequences of the 3&#x02032; end of 12 of these transposed copies were determined and found to have poly(dA) sequences which are much longer than that of <italic>I97</italic>, varying in size from 25 to more than 100 deoxyadenosines. The data are summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f2">2</xref>B. None of the <italic>IpA</italic> elements that were sequenced are flanked by sequences identical to the DNA adjacent to <italic>I97</italic> confirming that they were generated by transposition. These data demonstrate that an <italic>I</italic> element terminated by a poly(dA) sequence can transpose and hence that the TAA repeats are not essential for transposition.</p><p>In order to determine the structure of the sequence into which <italic>IpA</italic> elements had inserted we sequenced both ends of two further insertions (called <italic>IpA1</italic> and <italic>IpA2</italic>) using the same method as that described above, except that <italic>Nde</italic>II was replaced by <italic>Bst</italic>YI. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f2">2</xref>B shows that they are flanked by target site duplications, indicating that they are the results of normal retrotransposition. The duplication flanking <italic>IpA1</italic> is 14 nt long while that flanking <italic>IpA2</italic> is either 11 or 13 nt long depending on whether the first two deoxyadenosines at the 3&#x02032; junction belong to the target site or to the poly(dA) sequence. The poly(dA) sequences of <italic>IpA</italic> elements were presumably created during the retrotransposition process since they are not part of the target site duplications.</p><p>The ends of transposed copies of <italic>I99</italic> in strains <italic>99-18</italic> and <italic>99-59</italic> were similarly analyzed. We sequenced the 3&#x02032; ends of 13 transposed copies. The data are summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f3">3</xref>B and C. Surprisingly, retrotransposition of <italic>I99</italic> generated two types of elements with different 3&#x02032; ends.</p><p>Elements of the first type (called <italic>IpdA</italic>) terminate with poly(dA) sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f3">3</xref>B). They begin after the deoxyguanosine which is the first nucleotide flanking <italic>I99</italic>. We sequenced both ends of three transposed copies of this category. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f3">3</xref>B shows that they are flanked by target site duplications that are not themselves composed solely of deoxyadenosines, suggesting again that the poly(dA) sequences were added during transposition. These elements have a few deoxyadenosines that could belong to either the poly(dA) sequence or the target site.</p><p>Three extra nucleotides are present between the 5&#x02032; end of <italic>IpdA3</italic> and the target site duplication (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f3">3</xref>B). These are not present at the 5&#x02032; junction of the donor element <italic>I99</italic>, suggesting that they are untemplated nucleotides that were added during the retrotransposition process, possibly during priming of the second strand as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c32">32</xref>). We have made similar observations for a few other transposed <italic>I</italic> elements that we have analyzed in this study.</p><p>Transposed copies of the second type (called <italic>Ifs</italic> elements) are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f3">3</xref>C. They have no poly(dA) sequences but have at their 3&#x02032; ends 11 nt that were adjacent to the progenitor element <italic>I99</italic>. Sequences downstream of these nucleotides are different from each other and from those flanking <italic>I99</italic> indicating that each element had inserted at a different site. We sequenced both ends of four of these elements, <italic>Ifs1</italic> and <italic>Ifs2</italic> from transgenic line <italic>99-18</italic>, and <italic>Ifs3</italic> and <italic>Ifs4</italic> from <italic>99-59</italic>. Each insertion is flanked by a target site duplication that is 12 to 14 or 15 nt long depending on whether the deoxyguanosine present at the 3&#x02032; junction of <italic>Ifs1</italic> is the last nucleotide of the transposed copy or the first of the target site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f3">3</xref>C). This indicates that <italic>Ifs</italic> elements were generated by transposition and that these transposed copies of <italic>I99</italic> have taken with them some 3&#x02032; flanking sequences. All <italic>Ifs</italic> elements are flanked at the 3&#x02032; end by a tandem duplication of the sequence AATTCGT that was present only once in the DNA flanking the progenitor element <italic>I99</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Initiation of reverse transcription of the site-specific element <italic>R2Bm in vitro</italic> requires 250 nt of the 3&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c11">11</xref>) suggesting that the transposition complex interacts with this sequence. Since we have found that <italic>I</italic> elements with different 3&#x02032; ends can efficiently transpose, the 3&#x02032; terminal TAA repeats of wild-type <italic>I</italic> factors cannot be essential for recognition by the <italic>I</italic> factor reverse transcriptase. Any sequence or structure that it does recognize may lie in the 3&#x02032; UTR since functional <italic>I</italic> factors from <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Drosophila teissieri</italic> show very strong similarities in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c24">24</xref>).</p><p>Synthesis of the first DNA strand of non-LTR retrotransposons is thought to be initiated at the 3&#x02032; end of the RNA transposition intermediate. We have shown here that the transposition intermediate of the <italic>I</italic> factor contains a few nucleotides flanking the element at its 3&#x02032; end and that these extra nucleotides are not integrated during retrotransposition <italic>in vivo</italic>. This suggests that reverse transcription does not initiate at the last nucleotide of the RNA template but a few nucleotides upstream, precisely at the 3&#x02032; end of the <italic>I</italic> element. Generation of precise junctions between the cDNA of the site-specific <italic>R2Bm</italic> retrotransposon and the insertion site requires RNA templates containing nucleotides from the DNA flanking the donor element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c13">13</xref>). The presence of flanking sequences in the RNA might increase the precision of reverse transcription primed by a 3&#x02032; OH at the site of integration.</p><p>Termination of transcription and initiation of reverse transcription seem to be different for <italic>I</italic> factors and human L1 elements (L1Hs). Although the <italic>I</italic> factor does not contain any polyadenylation signal, its transcripts end just a few nucleotides downstream of the element indicating that it has strong signals for the end of transcription. The polyadenylation signal near the 3&#x02032; end of L1Hs appears to be very weak and, in a system to study transposition in cultured cells, transposed copies of this element contain long sequences that flanked the progenitor elements at their 3&#x02032; ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c34">34</xref>). These data indicate that reverse transcription of wild-type <italic>I</italic> factors initiates in the UAA repeats at the very end of the RNA transposition intermediate whereas that of L1Hs may initiate in flanking sequences at the end of the transcripts far from the end of L1Hs sequences.</p><p>Although <italic>I</italic> factors do not insert in a sequence-specific manner, association of DNA at the target site and nucleotides at the 3&#x02032; end of their transposition intermediates may nevertheless facilitate initiation of reverse transcription. Wild-type <italic>I</italic> factors insert into AT-rich regions and their targets often begin with the trinucleotide TAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c21">21</xref>) while most <italic>I</italic> elements terminating with a poly(dA) sequence have inserted into target sites beginning with two or more deoxyadenosines (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f2">2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f3">3</xref>B). Similar observations have been reported for the human <italic>L1</italic> elements and the <italic>Alu</italic>, <italic>B1</italic>, <italic>B2</italic> and <italic>ID</italic> elements all which end with poly(dA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c35">35</xref>). Association of the transposition intermediate and target DNA may stabilize the reverse transcription complex promoting the initiation of the synthesis of the first cDNA strand. With this in mind it may be possible to modify the sequence at the 3&#x02032; end of an <italic>I</italic> factor to target it to particular chromosomal sites.</p><p>The transposed copies of <italic>I99</italic>, the modified <italic>I</italic> factor with no TAA repeats, are particularly informative. These are of two types (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f3">3</xref>B and C): those followed by a poly(dA) sequence (<italic>IpdA</italic> insertions) and those followed by the sequence GAATTCGTAATTCG (<italic>Ifs</italic> insertions). The target site duplications flanking insertions of each type start with a few nucleotides related to those which lie immediately downstream of <italic>I99</italic>, a short run of deoxyadenosines in the case of <italic>IpdA</italic> insertions and TA or TAA in the case of <italic>Ifs</italic> insertions. This may reflect base pairing of the target site with RNA transposition intermediates which extend beyond the end of the <italic>I</italic> factor. Furthermore, the 3&#x02032; end of each <italic>Ifs</italic> insertion contains a tandem duplication of the sequence AATTCGT.</p><p>A mechanism by which these tandem repeats could be generated is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f4">4</xref>. The RNA transposition intermediate, which extends beyond the end of the <italic>I</italic> factor, pairs with a few nucleotides of chromosomal DNA after cleavage of the target site by the endonuclease encoded by ORF2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f4">4</xref>A and B). This allows reverse transcriptase to initiate DNA synthesis using as primer the 3&#x02032; OH at the end of the strand of the chromosomal DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f4">4</xref>C). After polymerization of a few nucleotides the RNA template dissociates and reanneals to a short complementary sequence in the newly synthesized DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f4">4</xref>D). Continued reverse transcription generates a tandem duplication in the flanking DNA before entering the body of the <italic>I</italic> factor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f4">4</xref>E). Once synthesis of the first strand of <italic>I</italic> factor DNA is complete, the RNase H encoded by the element degrades the RNA template in the DNA&#x0002f;RNA hybrid molecule. Then reverse transcriptase can synthesize the second DNA strand using the 3&#x02032; OH at the other end of the target site as primer and the newly synthesized DNA as template. This process produces a transposed copy of the <italic>I</italic> factor with a short repeated sequence at its right hand end and flanked by a target site duplication (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f4">4</xref>F).</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd406f4">4</xref> illustrates this process for <italic>Ifs1</italic> but <italic>IpdA</italic> insertions could be generated in a similar manner with adjacent poly(dA) sequences formed by a series of disassociation and reannealing events which may be favored by a homopolymeric sequence. The poly(dA) sequences following <italic>IpdA</italic> insertions are unlikely to have resulted from polyadenylation of RNA transposition intermediates since the potential polyadenylation signal nearest to the 3&#x02032; end of the <italic>I</italic> factor is 73 bp upstream. This process can account for variation in the number of TAA repeats at the 3&#x02032; end of wild-type elements since elements of this type generally insert at sites containing a TAA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c21">21</xref>). A similar mechanism can also explain the presence of more complex repeats at the 3&#x02032; end of some other non-LTR retrotransposons as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c36">36</xref>). Although non-LTR retrotransposons that end with a poly(dA) sequence, like mammalian <italic>L1</italic> elements, have potential polyadenylation signals near their 3&#x02032; ends, the possibility that a poly(A) sequence in an RNA transposition intermediate is amplified during transposition by the process described above cannot be ruled out.</p><p>Our results suggest that the first steps of DNA synthesis by reverse transcriptases of non-LTR retrotransposons might be similar to the generation of telomeric repeats. The reverse transcriptase component of telomerase repeatedly copies a short sequence of the RNA component of this enzyme using as primer the 3&#x02032; OH of the extending chromosome end to which the telomerase RNA can associate by a few base pairs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c39">39</xref>). The telomeres of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> chromosomes do not comprise short tandem repeats but copies of the two non-LTR retrotransposons <italic>HeT-A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c6">6</xref>) and <italic>TART</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c7">7</xref>) which insert preferentially at chromosome ends. Telomerase may have evolved from a primitive nucleic acid replication system with the reverse transcriptase component subsequently taking on a life of its own as a non-LTR retrotransposon. The ancestors of Diptera may then have lost telomerase by mutation and recruited the related activities of <italic>TART</italic> and <italic>HeT-A</italic> to preserve the ends of their chromosomes. It is also interesting that reverse transcription of non-LTR retrotransposons shows similarities to telomere addition to fragmented chromosomes in <italic>Euplotes crassus</italic>. Ciliates undergo chromosome fragmentation and telomere addition when the genome of the micronucleus is converted to the transcriptionally-active macronucleus. Fragmentation occurs at specific sites that are devoid of telomeric repeats and is followed by telomere addition by telomerase in a way that might be related to reverse transcription and integration of non-LTR retrotransposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd406c40">40</xref>), providing an additional similarity between these retroelements and telomeres.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd406f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Structures of the <italic>I</italic> factor, of the 3&#x02032; ends of transcripts of a wild-type <italic>I</italic> factor, and of its transposed copies.
