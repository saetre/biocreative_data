Here, we employ a commonly used rat cell line for VSMCs (A7r5 cells) to investigate the effects of glucose on the expression and activity of the SPCA1 (secretory pathway Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase 1; also known as ATP2C1), which is a P-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump located in the Golgi apparatus that plays a key role in the secretory pathway. Our results show that mRNA expression levels of SPCA1 are significantly increased in A7r5 cells cultured in high glucose (25.0&#x000a0;mM)-supplemented medium compared with normal glucose (5.55&#x000a0;mM)-supplemented medium. SPCA1 protein expression levels and thapsigargin-insensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent ATPase activity were also consistent with a higher than normal expression level of SPCA1 in high-glucose-cultured A7r5 cells. Analysis of AVP (arginine-vasopressin)-induced cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in A7r5 cells (after pre-treatment with thapsigargin) showed faster rise and decay phases in cells grown in high glucose medium compared with cells grown in normal glucose medium, supporting the observation of increased SPCA expression/activity. The significant levels of both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase activity and AVP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, in the presence of thapsigargin, indicate that SPCA must play a significant role in Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake within VSMCs. We therefore propose that, if such increases in SPCA expression and activity also occur in primary VSMCs, this may play a substantial role in the aetiology of diabetes mellitus-associated vascular disease, due to alterations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homoeostasis within the Golgi apparatus.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>calcium homoeostasis</kwd><kwd>diabetes</kwd><kwd>Golgi apparatus</kwd><kwd>sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA)</kwd><kwd>secretory pathway Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase 1 (SPCA1)</kwd><kwd>vascular smooth muscle cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>AVP, arginine-vasopressin</kwd><kwd>GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase</kwd><kwd>HBSS, Hanks balanced salt solution</kwd><kwd>HG, high glucose (25&#x000a0;mM) culture medium</kwd><kwd>HRP, horseradish peroxidase</kwd><kwd>NG, normal glucose (5.55&#x000a0;mM) culture medium</kwd><kwd>RPL19, ribosomal protein L19</kwd><kwd>SERCA, sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase</kwd><kwd>SPCA, secretory pathway Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase</kwd><kwd>TMR, tetramethylrhodamine</kwd><kwd>VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell</kwd><kwd>WGA, wheatgerm agglutinin</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="33"/><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cardiovascular diseases, including those associated with diabetes mellitus, have long been associated with the dysregulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homoeostasis in vascular cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Comparisons between healthy and diabetic subjects in the past have shown that the distribution and use of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions differ between the two conditions. For example, diabetes has been associated with higher than normal basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in rat-derived cardiac myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and VSMCs (vascular smooth-muscle cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], as demonstrated from their culture in high-glucose medium. Altered hormone-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling has also been noted in human VSMCs from diabetic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Abnormal expression and/or activity of specific proteins that participate in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling and homoeostasis have been linked to diabetes. These include Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent enzymes, such as increased activity of both calpain in rat endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and CaMKII (Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) in rat whole carotid arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition, it has been shown that Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporters can be influenced by the diabetic state in vascular cells. Examples of these include the inhibition of store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in rat microvascular smooth-muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and increased activity of T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in rat cardiomyocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The SERCA (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase) has also been shown to differ between healthy and diabetic subjects, both in the form of decreased expression levels in heart from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and increased activity in rat primary VSMCs cultured in high-glucose medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The SPCA1 (secretory pathway Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase 1; also known as ATP2C1), a Golgi-apparatus-localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion pump that is relatively highly expressed in VSMCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], has not been investigated in relation to diabetes-related cardiovascular pathology. It is unlikely, however, that the other isoform, SPCA2, plays a substantial role in cardiovascular pathology, since it is not significantly expressed in vascular tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, previous studies have linked SPCA1 expression to diabetes in pancreatic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, alterations in the Golgi apparatus have also been observed in VSMCs treated with kinase inhibitors to inhibit proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. SPCA1 is important for establishing a store of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions in the Golgi apparatus, which is required by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent enzymes essential for post-translational modification of proteins in transit through the secretory pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we utilize one of the most commonly employed cell lines for VSMCs (A7r5 cells) to determine whether culturing them in either NG [glucose (5.55&#x000a0;mM) culture medium] or HG [high glucose (25&#x000a0;mM) culture medium], to mimic the &#x02018;normal&#x02019; and &#x02018;hyperglycaemic&#x02019; glucose homoeostatic states, specifically alters the expression and activity of SPCA1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>A7r5 cell culture and treatment</title><p>A7r5 (rat embryonic thoracic aortic smooth muscle) cells [a gift from Professor C.W.

Growth was maintained under conditions of 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Culture medium contained 25&#x000a0;mM <sc>D</sc>-glucose when cells were maintained for growth or for obtaining cells in the &#x02018;hyperglycaemic&#x02019; HG-cultured state. Subculturing of cells was done every 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;days by trypsinization using 0.05% trypsin/EDTA solution (Invitrogen). Cells in the NG-cultured state were initially obtained by seeding a new flask of subcultured cells from HG medium into NG (5.55&#x000a0;mM <sc>D</sc>-glucose) medium. Both NG and HG cells were subcultured for at least a further two passages in their respective medium before being used for experimentation.</p></sec><sec><title>PCR</title><p>mRNA was extracted from cells and converted into cDNA copies via RT&#x02013;PCR (reverse transcription&#x02013;PCR), using a Superscript III CellsDirect&#x02122; cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed with cell culture PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) and resuspended in 0.1% (v/v) DEPC (diethyl pyrocarbonate)-treated PBS. To prepare each cDNA sample, 2&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> cells were used.</p><p>BIOTAQ&#x02122; Taq DNA polymerase and dNTP mixture were purchased from Bioline. All the primers were made by Alta Bioscience (University of Birmingham, Birmingham, U.K.). Primer sequences and their specific PCR conditions were obtained from the following associated references: SPCA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], SERCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], &#x003b2;-actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and RPL19 (ribosomal protein L19) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The SPCA1 primers only recognized mRNA corresponding to the SPCA1 isoform (all splice variants). The SERCA primers recognized mRNA corresponding to all SERCA isoforms. Each 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l PCR reaction mixture contained 2.5&#x000a0;units of BIOTAQ&#x02122;, 2&#x000a0;mM dNTP mix and 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of cDNA sample. SPCA1 and SERCA PCRs required 35&#x000a0;cycles. GAPDH, &#x003b2;-actin and RPL19 required 28 cycles. All PCR products were separated by agarose-gel electrophoresis, stained with SYBR&#x000ae; Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen) and visualized using a UV transluminator. PCR product band sizes were checked using a 100&#x000a0;bp DNA ladder (New England Biolabs).</p><p>Images of stained gels were taken using an UVP ImageStore 5000 system. Analysis was undertaken using ImageJ (version 1.41e; National Institutes of Health). Mean pixel intensity values were measured for the product bands, each of which was corrected for background and made relative to those for RPL19 (a commonly used internal control for PCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]) from the same sample to correct for differences in total cDNA quantity. The expression of RPL19, a housekeeping protein, was unlikely to be affected by different glucose culture conditions in A7r5 cells when compared with other control markers, such as GAPDH (a glycolytic enzyme) and &#x003b2;-actin (a contractility marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]).

Due to the inherent variability in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase activities from different membrane preparations, experiments were done using samples of microsomal membranes isolated from three replicate pairs of HG and NG cell cultures. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> shows that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase activities from the three membrane preparations, isolated from NG- and HG-cultured cells, were similar in the absence of thapsigargin.

This is not dissimilar from our previous findings in aortic VSMC membranes, where we showed that approx. 50% of total ATP-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake into these membranes was due to SPCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

The mean peak heights between cells not treated and those pre-treated with thapsigargin, for both NG and HG culture conditions, were each reduced by approx. 60%. This shows that the contribution made by SERCA-containing Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores to the AVP-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in these cells is not overwhelmingly dominant and SPCA-containing Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores are also likely to contribute significantly.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients induced by AVP after pre-treatment with thapsigargin in hyperglycaemic and normal glucose-cultured A7r5 cells</title><p>For both (A) NG and (B) HG culture conditions, the main Figures show results from four coverslips, whereby each trace represents averaged fluorescence values from ten cells, analysed for Fluo-3 fluorescence changes (<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>) in response to 10&#x000a0;nM AVP, after pre-treatment of cells with thapsigargin.

Comparison of the staining patterns for SPCA1 showed no notable differences between NG- and HG-cultured cells. Thus localization of SPCA1 in A7r5 cells was largely unaffected by the glucose culturing conditions.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] showed rat aortic tissue and primary human aortic VSMCs express relatively high levels of SPCA1 protein compared with many other tissues and cell types. From Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent ATPase measurements we show that between 20 and 60% of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase activity associated with intracellular membranes of A7r5 cells is derived from SPCA. Again this is similar to our previous findings, which showed that in aortic VSMC membranes approx. 50% of the ATP-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is via SPCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This is also corroborated by the fact that substantial increases in AVP-induced intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] were observed in thapsigargin-pre-treated cells, which suggests that these VSMCs must contain a sizeable SERCA-independent mobilizable Ca<sup>2+</sup> store. Therefore, taken together, these findings highlight the substantial role SPCA plays in Ca<sup>2+</sup> store refilling within VSMCs.</p><p>It has also been well established that vascular tissues prone to developing atherosclerotic plaques (as observed in diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]) have a tendency to change their VSMCs from a contractile to a secretory phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This is characterized by their increased ability to produce secreted proteins, such as collagen and proteoglycans found in the extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Since SPCA1 plays an important role in both post-translational modification of proteins in the Golgi apparatus and transit of proteins through the secretory pathway, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether SPCA1 expression and/or activity is different between NG and HG-cultured A7r5 cells, a commonly used cell line for VSMCs.</p><p>Measurements of mRNA and protein levels in this study showed A7r5 cells grown in HG culture medium expressed measurably more SPCA1 than cells grown in NG culture medium, which suggests that glucose availability can influence the expression of this protein. There was a notable difference, however, in the extent of change between SPCA1 mRNA and protein expression levels, whereby a 60% increase in mRNA resulted in only approx. 15% increase in protein. A similar discrepancy was observed by Reinhardt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] when they compared SPCA expression levels between rat mammary and brain tissue, and attributed their finding to a difference in protein turnover. A similar explanation may, at least in part, explain our observation in A7r5 cells. Transcriptional control of SPCA1 may also play a role, since Sp1 and YY1, which are the transcription factors of the SPCA1 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], possess increased activity in cells grown in high, compared with normal, glucose media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. One possibility could be that a combination of enhanced transcription and near-maximal translation of the SPCA1 gene in hyperglycaemic A7r5 cells may result in an increase in its mRNA, but not necessarily increase in its protein levels to the same extent.</p><p>Consistent with results from PCR-based mRNA measurement and immunochemical detection of SPCA1 protein, thapsigargin-insensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent ATPase activity in microsomal membranes (representative of SPCA activity) was also found to be higher from HG, compared with NG, cultured cells. However, the mean activity for the HG-cultured cells was approx. 2-fold higher than that for the NG-cultured cells, which would also appear to be disproportionate to the increase in SPCA1 protein levels observed. Such differences may be explained by the differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport activities between different SPCA1 splice variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In our present study, we measured all SPCA activity and the expression of all SPCA1 slice variants. However, one could envisage that an increased expression of SPCA1 splice variants that have higher levels of activity could contribute to the higher than normal SPCA activity observed in HG-cultured cells. However, this possibility needs to be further explored.</p><p>In order to assess whether higher than normal expression of SPCA1 within HG-cultured A7r5 cells can alter agonist-induced cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients, the effects of AVP on cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] profiles were investigated. AVP (working through the phosphoinositide pathway) initiates Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization from internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and stimulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry from the extracellular medium. Cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal (by uptake into intracellular stores and extrusion out of the cell) then follows, resulting in a typical Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In our present study, using thapsigargin-pre-treated A7r5 cells, we showed that, although the peak heights of SERCA-independent AVP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were not significantly different between NG- and HG-cultured cells, these transients were different with regard to both their rise and decay phase kinetics. The differences in the rise and decay phase kinetics could be attributed to differences in the abundance of thapsigargin-insensitive IP<sub>3</sub>-releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores (i.e. Golgi Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores). Thus, if HG-cultured cells had more of these Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores than NG-cultured cells, this could result in higher rates of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, as well as higher rates of Ca<sup>2+</sup> re-uptake (due to their higher levels of SPCA). This becomes even more apparent once SERCA-containing Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores have been emptied by thapsigargin treatment.</p><p>Our immunostaining studies confirm that SPCA1 remains located at the distinct regions within the cell consistent with being the Golgi apparatus, rather than more widely distributed throughout the endoplasmic reticulum like SERCA. Furthermore, increased SPCA expression, as observed in HG-cultured cells, does not appear to affect its subcellular location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the present study has shown that culturing A7r5 cells (a commonly used VSMC model) in HG medium (which mimics the hyperglycaemic state associated with severe diabetes mellitus) can lead to: (i) higher SPCA1 expression levels (both at the mRNA and protein levels); (ii) increased thapsigargin-insensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase activity, which is comparable with the activity observed for SERCA; and (iii) higher rates of both the rise and decay phases of AVP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in thapsigargin-pre-treated cells. These findings suggest that glucose availability can substantially affect the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling properties within the Golgi apparatus and therefore affect the secretory pathway and post-translational protein modification processes, as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated hormonal responses, in A7r5 VSMCs. If these changes in SPCA1 expression and activity also occur in primary VSMCs, this might potentially contribute towards cardiovascular diseases often associated with diabetes. Therefore further studies are required, using primary VSMCs cultured in different glucose media, as well as studying cells isolated from normal and severely diabetic animals, in order to corroborate this hypothesis.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Professor Colin Taylor (Department of Pharmacology, University of Cambridge) for supplying A7r5 cells, Dr J.
