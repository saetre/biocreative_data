KAP3 is a kinesin-2 subunit responsible for binding to cargos including choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Motor axons in <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G93A</italic></sup>-Tg mice also showed a reduction in ChAT transport from the pre-onset stage. By employing a novel FALS modeling system using NG108-15 cells, we showed that microtubule-dependent release of acetylcholine was significantly impaired by misfolded SOD1 species. Furthermore, such impairment was able to be normalized by KAP3 overexpression. KAP3 was incorporated into SOD1 aggregates in human FALS cases as well. These results suggest that KAP3 sequestration by misfolded SOD1 species and the resultant inhibition of ChAT transport play a role in the dysfunction of ALS.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor neuron cell death in the brain and spinal cord accompanied by rapid loss of muscle control and eventually complete paralysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C2">2</xref>). The vast majority of ALS cases are of a sporadic nature, while &#x0223c;10% are familial (FALS). Although the cause of sporadic ALS remains unclear, 15&#x02013;20% of FALS patients have point mutations in cytosolic Cu<sup>2+</sup>/Zn<sup>2+</sup> superoxide dismutase (SOD1). SOD1 is an antioxidant enzyme ubiquitously expressed in the cytosol, which converts the superoxide anion radical to hydrogen peroxide. More than 115 disease-causing mutations, affecting all regions of the SOD1 gene product, have been identified.</p><p>Previous studies using transgenic animal models expressing mutated human SOD1 have shown that the disease is not caused by a loss of its dismutase activity, but by the gain of toxic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C1">1</xref>). Many mutant SOD1 proteins tend to become easily misfolded and form aggregates, especially under oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C4">4</xref>). Intracellular aggregates containing SOD1 were specifically detected in affected regions of both patients and animal models possessing <italic>sod1</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C7">7</xref>). In spinal cords of mutant SOD1-Tg mice, misfolded intermediates of mutant SOD1 proteins, which showed a decrease in solubility and increase in size, were found prior to disease onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C9">9</xref>). These results suggest that misfolded molecules containing mutant SOD1 may contribute to motor neuron-specific damage in ALS.</p><p>Axonal transport is required for a variety of neural functions including neurotransmitter synthesis, release and recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C10">10</xref>). Motor neurons often have long axons that can be more than a meter in length in humans. For this reason, orderly function of the axonal transport mechanism should be particularly important in maintaining the structure and signal transmission at the terminals of motor axons. The transport process is carried out by two major families of motor proteins, i.e. kinesin super family for anterograde transport and the cytoplasimic dynein for retrograde transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C11">11</xref>). Defects in axonal transport have been reported as an early sign of motor neuron diseases including ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C12">12</xref>). In mutant SOD1-Tg mice, anterograde transport of neurofilaments and tubulin is partially impaired long before disease onset, presumably due to an inhibition of certain transport systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C14">14</xref>). With respect to retrograde transport, mutations in the dynein heavy chain result in motor-selective dysfunction in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C15">15</xref>). Moreover, mutation in p150<sup>Glued</sup>, a subunit of dynactin (dynein activator), was identified in a family that developed a lower motor neuron-specific disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C16">16</xref>). These results strongly suggest a link between the integrity of the axonal transport mechanism with the function and survival of motor neurons.</p><p>We previously studied the intracellular localization of misfolded SOD1 species by subcellular fractionation of spinal cords from <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G93A</italic></sup>-Tg mice and found a significant accumulation of misfolded SOD1 species within the axon-enriched fraction at disease onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C17">17</xref>). From this result, together with previous reports, we hypothesized that misfolded SOD1 species may bind to proteins required for axonal transport and thereby inhibit normal function of the motor proteins. To prove this hypothesis, we screened axonal transport-related molecules in search for proteins that associate specifically to the misfolded SOD1 species and identified KAP3 as a misfolded SOD1-interacting protein. KAP3 is a component of the kinesin-2 motor complex mediating an axonal transport of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C19">19</xref>). By using an <italic>in vitro</italic> FALS modeling system that we developed, we showed that misfolded SOD1 inhibits axonal transport-dependent release of acetylcholine (ACh). Moreover, such impairment of ACh release could be rescued by the KAP3 overexpression. This evidence strongly suggests that the sequestering of KAP3 and the resultant inhibition of ChAT transport is a novel toxic property of mutant SOD1 proteins that inevitably leads to motor neuron-specific dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Misfolded SOD1 species is accumulated in ventral white matter of spinal cords in <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G93A</italic></sup>-Tg mice prior to disease onset</title><p>We previously showed by using subcellular fractionation analysis that a considerable amount of misfolded SOD1 species is located in a fraction enriched in nucleus and certain kinds of cytoskeletal proteins (i.e. glial fibrilary acidic protein and neurofilament) in <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G93A</italic></sup>-Tg mice spinal cord prior to appearance of characteristic motor symptoms of ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C17">17</xref>). To analyze more detailed subcellular localization of misfolded SOD1 in spinal motor neurons of <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G93A</italic></sup>-Tg mice, we divided the spinal cord into four subsegments by laser-assisted microdissection (LMD) (summarized in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN422F1">1</xref>A) and used the lysate from each segment to detect SOD1 by immunoblot analysis. Since we observed that the <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G93A</italic></sup>-Tg mice we used in this study experienced disease onset around the age of 8 months (246.5 &#x000b1; 5.8 days) and died around 9.5 months (288.5 &#x000b1; 7.1 days, mean &#x000b1; SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 14), we chose to collect samples from mice of 4, 7, 8 and 9 months of age. As expected, the majority of misfolded SOD1 species (high molecular-weight bands/smears immunoreactive for SOD1) was located in the ventral gray matter at 7 months of age, which is 1 month prior to disease onset (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN422F1">1</xref>B and C). At this age, we also found that a significant amount of misfolded SOD1 species was located in ventral white matter, suggesting that misfolded SOD1 species are localized in motor neuron cell bodies and their axons. We further divided the ventral white matter segment into three subsegments and confirmed a localization of misfolded SOD1 species to a motor axon-enriched segment indicated by ChAT expression (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddn422/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>). Together, these results suggest that a significant amount of misfolded SOD1 species is located not only in motor neuron cell bodies, but also in motor axons of <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G93A</italic></sup>-Tg mice prior to disease onset.</p><fig id="DDN422F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>Misfolded SOD1 species were enriched in ventral white matter and ventral gray matter in spinal cord of <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G93A</italic></sup>-Tg mice prior to disease onset.

Unfixed frozen sections from L5 spinal cords were stained with 0.01% Toluidine blue and cut into four segments: dorsal white matter (WM-D), dorsal gray matter (GM-D), ventral white matter (WM-V) and ventral gray matter (GM-V) as indicated.

Localization of misfolded SOD1 species in motor axons of <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G93A</italic></sup>-Tg mice suggests that misfolded SOD1 species may affect the function of proteins required for axonal transport. Anterograde and retrograde axonal transports are mediated by different protein complexes, which are composed of a large variety of proteins. The kinesin super family for anterograde transport, for instance, is divided into six families (kinesin-1, 2, 3, 4, 13 and 14) consisting of 45 members in human and mouse, and they associate with appropriate cargos via adaptor molecules in most cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C11">11</xref>). To gain more insight into the relationship between misfolded SOD1 and individual components of the molecular motor protein complex, we compared sedimentation of misfolded SOD1 in linear density gradient centrifugation with that of representative molecules that compose motor complexes in motor axon lysate. We asked whether any of these motor complex components co-migrate with misfolded SOD1. Homogenates were prepared from the ventral white matter of <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G93A</italic></sup>-Tg mice at 8 months of age (disease onset) and <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>WT</italic></sup>-Tg mice expressing human wild-type <italic>sod1</italic> gene (non-symptomatic control) and subjected to linear Nycodenz density gradient centrifugation. SOD1 immunoreactive bands showing expected molecular weight (representing normally folded SOD1) were observed in fractions nos 1&#x02013;7 in mice of both genotypes. Misfolded SOD1 species, on the other hand, were found in fractions around no. 16 only in <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G93A</italic></sup>-Tg mice. We then examined migration profiles of 17 major components of the molecular motors from five kinesin families excluding kinesin-4 which is mostly expressed in juvenile brain, cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin. Among those molecules, KAP3, a subunit of the kinesin-2 motor complex, clearly co-migrated with misfolded SOD1 species around fraction no. 16 from <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G93A</italic></sup>-Tg mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN422F2">2</xref>A, asterisks). In addition to KAP3, KIF3A and KIF3B, which are KAP3-binding partners, were weakly detected around fraction no. 16. We also observed p150<sup>Glued</sup>, a dynactin subunit, co-migrated with misfolded SOD1 species. However, we did not proceed to a detailed analysis of this observation for now, because p50, another dynactin subunit (data not shown), or other dynein components such as Dynein intermediate chain (Dynein IC in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN422F2">2</xref>A) did not co-migrate with misfolded SOD1 species. To confirm this association of KAP3 with misfolded SOD1, we performed immunoprecipitation analysis using the fraction nos 16 and 7. KAP3 was identified in anti-SOD1 immunoprecipitates obtained from fraction no. 16 containing misfolded SOD1 species but not in the fraction from no. 7 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN422F2">2</xref>B). In reciprocal immunoprecipitation, we found misfolded SOD1 in anti-KAP3 immunoprecipitates only in fraction no. 16. CRMP-2 (collapsin response mediator protein-2), a KAP3 counterpart for kinesin-1 motor complex, did not associate with misfolded SOD1. KAP3 seems to be associated with misfolded SOD1 species at least 2 months before disease onset, since the misfolded SOD1 species was detected in the immunoprecipitate with anti-KAP3 antibody from the extracts of 6-month-old <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G93A</italic></sup>-Tg spinal cords (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN422F2">2</xref>C). Furthermore, we examined immunohistochemical localization of SOD1 and KAP3 on spinal cord sections of <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G93A</italic></sup>-Tg mice at 9 months of age (end stage). We found that protein aggregates in the remaining spinal motor neurons, immunoreactive for KAP3 were also positive for SOD1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN422F2">2</xref>D, upper panel). The KAP3-positive aggregates also contained ubiquitin immunoreactivity, suggesting that the aggregates are cellular inclusion bodies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN422F2">2</xref>D, lower panel). These results suggest that misfolded SOD1 species specifically binds to KAP3 in motor axons of <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G93A</italic></sup>-Tg mice and that this association starts prior to the onset of motor symptoms.</p><fig id="DDN422F2" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2.</label><caption><p>Misfolded SOD1 species in ventral white matter of spinal cords specifically associates with KAP3.

Therefore, to examine the impact of misfolded SOD1&#x02013;KAP3 association on the function of motor neurons in <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G93A</italic></sup>-Tg mice during the disease progression, we decided to analyze the transport of ChAT in motor neurons.

We also found that ChAT co-immunoprecipitates with KAP3 in fractions where KAP3 and kinesin-2 components co-migrated. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddn422/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2B</ext-link>). These results suggest that misfolded SOD1 species not only trap the kinesin-2 motor complex via association with KAP3 in and around the cell bodies but some of the misfolded SOD1 is also transported to axons in stead of normal cargos such as ChAT.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>NG108-15 cells serve as an <italic>in vitro</italic> model for FALS</title><p>We showed a clear correlation between the association of misfolded SOD1 with KAP3 and the inhibition of ChAT transport within <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G93A</italic></sup>-Tg mouse motor axons.

This raises the possibility that misfolded SOD1-induced reduction in ChAT transport may be normalized by supplementing motor neurons with KAP3. To prove this hypothesis using the FALS culture model system, we examined microtubule-dependent ACh release from differentiated PNG3 cells overexpressing wild-type or mutant SOD1 together with KAP3. Overexpression of KAP3 did not change ACh release from MG132-treated PNG cells transfected with empty vector or wild-type SOD1. However, overexpression of KAP3 was able to normalize the ACh release reduction under the condition that causes mutant SOD1 misfolding (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN422F6">6</xref>E). These results strongly suggest that misfolded SOD1-induced reduction in ChAT transport and ACh release is mediated by a reduction in functional KAP3 molecule because of its association with misfolded SOD1.

A significant proportion of misfolded SOD1 is located within motor axons prior to disease onset in <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G93A</italic></sup>-Tg FALS model mice. We showed that misfolded SOD1 species selectively binds to KAP3 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN422F2">2</xref>B and C) and that this binding may be a cause for the reduction in functional KAP3 molecule required for kinesin-2-dependent transport within motor axons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN422F3">3</xref>A and B). The kinesin-2 motor complex is particularly important, because it is required for ChAT transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C19">19</xref>). Decreased ChAT expression and resultant decrease in ACh release from motor nerve ends can lead to dysfunction of motor synapses at axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C31">31</xref>). By employing a newly developed cell culture model of FALS, we showed that ACh release from nerve terminals was decreased presumably due to a reduction in ChAT transport resulting from KAP3 sequestration by misfolded SOD1 species (Figs&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN422F5">5</xref>A and C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN422F6">6</xref>D).

In healthy motor neurons (<bold>A</bold>), ChAT is continuously transported by kinesin-2 motor, comprising KIF3A, KIF3B/C and KAP3, toward the neuromuscular junction where ACh functions as a neurotransmitter. ACh is released into the synaptic cleft upon stimulation and rapidly degraded into choline and acetic acid by AChE. Choline is taken up into the nerve terminal by choline transporters and then ChAT synthesizes ACh from choline and acetyl-CoA. The reaction catalized by ChAT is the rate-limiting step for ACh supply to the nerve terminals. In motor neurons expressing mutant SOD1 (<bold>B</bold>), mutant SOD1 proteins were converted into misfolded forms as a result of increased ROS generation and/or reduced proteasomal activity. Certain misfolded species preferentially binds to KAP3 and inhibit the binding of ChAT to KAP3, thereby causing a decrease in ChAT transport. This decrease in ChAT in the nerve terminals can constitute a mechanism that causes motor dysfunction.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ddn42208"/></fig><p>ALS-like motor neuron pathology is observed in transgenic mice expressing C-terminal truncated SOD1 (L126Z), in which the mutant SOD1 expression was not clearly observed in sciatic nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C32">32</xref>). This suggests that KAP3-misfolded SOD1 association is formed mostly in motor neuron cell bodies. Indeed, we detected KAP3-misfolded SOD1 association in spinal cords (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN422F2">2</xref>C) and ventral white matter (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN422F2">2</xref>A and B) of <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G93A</italic></sup>-Tg mice prior to disease onset, but could not detect it in distal sciatic nerve even at the end-stage (data not shown). These findings suggest that, even if misfolded SOD1 associates with molecular motors, it cannot travel for a long distance, presumably because it is not a physiological cargo.</p><p>We suspect that misfolded SOD1&#x02013;KAP3 association is one of the early events in FALS pathogenesis. Evidence to support this possibility is that the SOD1&#x02013;KAP3 association becomes detectable around 6 months of age in <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G93A</italic></sup>-Tg mice, 2 months earlier than disease onset (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN422F2">2</xref>C), suggesting that the SOD1&#x02013;KAP3 association constitutes an early event in FALS motor neurons. Also, our immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis shows that SOD1&#x02013;KAP3 association always detected relatively low molecular-weight misfolded SOD1 (&#x02212;50 kDa) among all of the misfolded products ranging up to hundreds of kilodaltons in size (Figs&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN422F2">2</xref>B and C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN422F5">5</xref>A). The preferential association of KAP3 for low molecular-weight species but not with large precipitates suggests that SOD1&#x02013;KAP3 association accounts for a fraction of the initial events in FALS pathogenesis. Previous reports on selective increase in KAP3 transcription in lumbar spinal cords from <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G86R</italic></sup>-Tg mice as an early event prior to disease onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C33">33</xref>) also supports our hypothesis, as the increase may be regarded as compensatory to the KAP3 sequestration by SOD1&#x02013;KAP3 association.</p><p>Previous reports show that crossing mutant SOD1-Tg mice with dynein heavy chain mutant mice (<italic>loa</italic> or <italic>cra</italic>) delays the disease onset and extends survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C35">35</xref>). This result is surprising because mutations in dynein heavy chain, a subunit of dynein motor complex, or p150<sup>Glued</sup>, a subunit of dynactin (dynein activator) cause dysfunction and degeneration of spinal motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C16">16</xref>). This suggests a possible mechanistic link between impaired axonal transport in mutant <italic>SOD1</italic>-Tg mice and that in dynein heavy chain mutant mice. Here we demonstrated that KAP3 sequestration by misfolded SOD1 is a mechanism for selective inhibition of axonal transport observed in mutant SOD1-Tg mice. Previous reports on melanophore transport in <italic>Xenopus</italic> melanosomes showed that dynactin serves as an activator of kinesin-2 via direct binding of p150<sup>Glued</sup> to KAP3 and regulates the intracellular direction of melanosome transport by binding to either dynein (retrograde) or KAP3 (anterograde) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C36">36</xref>). Dynein and KAP3 share the same binding site on p150<sup>Glued</sup>, and so p150<sup>Glued</sup> binds to only one of them at a time and thereby activates transport in only one direction. If a similar regulation by dynactin plays a role in mammalian neurons, <italic>loa</italic> and <italic>cra</italic> mutations may increase the chance of p150<sup>Glued</sup> to bind to KAP3, because those mutations promote subunit disassembly and increase dynein-unbound dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C15">15</xref>). By this mechanism, dynein heavy chain mutations may result in normalizing kinesin-2-mediated transport of ChAT inhibited by the misfolded SOD1 species. Indeed, in our analysis of ventral white matter in <italic>SOD1</italic><sup><italic>G93A</italic></sup>-Tg mice using Nycodenz density gradient centrifugation, a small fraction of p150<sup>Glued</sup> co-migrated with misfolded SOD1 species and KAP3 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN422F2">2</xref>A). This population of p150<sup>Glued</sup> also co-precipitated with KAP3 (data not shown). This result may reflect an involvement of p150<sup>Glued</sup> in KAP3/SOD1 misfolding and aggregation through its interaction with KAP3.</p><p>A recent study provides an interesting evidence that transcription of all members of the KIF3 family selectively decreases in motor cortex of sporadic ALS patients among 13 kinds of kinesin and kinesin-related proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN422C37">37</xref>).

Our finding that misfolded SOD1 species sequesters KAP3 raises a possibility that the transport of these molecules may also be impaired in mutant SOD1-related FALS, together with the reduced ChAT transport.
