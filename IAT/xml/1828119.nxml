VEGF stimulates NO production, proposed to be a result of phosphorylation and activation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) at Ser1177. Phosphorylation of eNOS at this site also occurs after activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in cultured endothelial cells. We therefore determined whether AMPK mediates VEGF-stimulated NO synthesis in endothelial cells. VEGF caused a rapid, dose-dependent stimulation of AMPK activity, with a concomitant increase in phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177. Infection of endothelial cells with an adenovirus expressing a dominant negative mutant AMPK partially inhibited both VEGF-stimulated eNOS Ser1177 phosphorylation and NO production. VEGF-stimulated AMPK activity was completely inhibited by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase inhibitor, STO-609. Stimulation of AMPK via Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase represents a novel signalling mechanism utilised by VEGF in endothelial cells that contributes to eNOS phosphorylation and NO production.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P2">VEGF is a key regulator of angiogenesis, stimulating differentiation, survival, migration, proliferation and vascular permeability of endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>].

VEGF (10ng/ml) elicited a transient, concomitant activation of AMPK and eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177, which reached a maximum 2.8-fold and 3.6-fold stimulation respectively after 5 minutes. Both AMPK activity and eNOS phosphorylation rapidly returned to basal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). In addition, activation of AMPK and phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177 by VEGF shared a similar dose-dependence, such that AMPK activity and eNOS Ser1177 phosphorylation were stimulated maximally (2.5-fold and 3.6-fold respectively) by 10 ng/ml VEGF, a concentration at which all further experiments were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Previous studies have reported that stimulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with VEGF for 6 h or bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) with VEGF for 10 min was without effect on phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. These studies are in agreement with the present study in which VEGF-stimulated AMPK activity peaked after 5 min incubation and returned to basal values within 15 min.</p><p id="P13">PI3K, PLC and c-Src are known effectors of VEGF signalling in endothelial cells and previous studies have suggested that AMPK stimulation is downstream of PI3K and c-Src activation in peroxynitrite- and metformin-treated BAECs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. In the current study inhibition of either PI3K or c-Src had no effect on VEGF-stimulated AMPK activity in HAECs, suggesting that neither PI3K nor c-Src mediate VEGF-stimulated AMPK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Preincubation with U73122 completely inhibited VEGF-stimulated AMPK activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), suggesting that VEGF stimulates AMPK in a PLC-dependent manner. Similarly, histamine has previously been reported to activate AMPK in HUVECs in a PI3K- independent, PLC-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>].</p><p id="P14">It is now apparent that CaMKK&#x003b2; can act as an alternate upstream kinase to LKB1 that activates AMPK in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and AMP-independent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. A recent report indicates that CaMKK mediates thrombin-stimulated AMPK activation in HUVECs, but that AMPK does not underlie thrombin-stimulated eNOS Ser1177 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. As VEGF is known to stimulate PLC&#x003b3;-mediated increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] and VEGF-stimulated AMPK activity is inhibited by the PLC inhibitor U73122 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>), we examined whether VEGF-stimulated AMPK activity was mediated by CaMKK activation by using the CaMKK inhibitor, STO-609. Preincubation of HAECs with STO-609 reduced VEGF-stimulated AMPK activity to basal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>), without altering AICAR-stimulated AMPK activity, which is mediated by LKB1 (data not shown). VEGF-stimulated AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation was similarly reduced to basal levels after preincubation with STO-609 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). STO-609 inhibits both CaMKK&#x003b1; and CaMKK&#x003b2;, yet the expression of these isoforms in endothelial cells has not previously been determined. Using isoform-specific anti-CaMKK antibodies, we demonstrated expression of both CaMKK&#x003b1; and CaMKK&#x003b2; in HAECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). These data indicate that VEGF stimulates CaMKK via PLC-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>mobilisation, and that CaMKK, rather than LKB1 is the upstream kinase responsible for AMPK activation in response to VEGF in endothelial cells.</p><p id="P15">To determine the functional effects of VEGF-stimulated AMPK activity, we investigated the role of AMPK in VEGF-stimulated eNOS phosphorylation and NO production. Previous studies have proposed that VEGF-stimulated eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177 is mediated by PKB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], yet complete inhibition of PKB with the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin only partially inhibited VEGF-stimulated NO production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. In agreement with this, preincubation of HAECs with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin incompletely but significantly reduced VEGF-stimulated NO production by &#x0223c;65% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) at a concentration that completely inhibited phosphorylation of PKB at Ser473 (data not shown). These data suggest that both PI3K/PKB and a PI3K-independent kinase mediate VEGF-stimulated NO production. Infection of HAECs with Ad.&#x003b1;1DN caused a significant (&#x0223c;40%) reduction in VEGF-stimulated NO production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). In the presence of wortmannin, infection with Ad.&#x003b1;1DN significantly reduced VEGF-stimulated NO production to basal levels. Quantification of eNOS phosphorylation status in Ad.&#x003b1;1DN-infected cells revealed VEGF stimulated phosphorylation at Ser1177 was significantly reduced by approximately 70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p id="P16">ACC is phosphorylated by AMPK at Ser80 in ACC1 and Ser 220 in ACC2 (human sequence). Using an antibody that recognises both phosphorylated species, we demonstrated that VEGF stimulates phosphorylation of ACC, an effect completely inhibited in HAECs infected with Ad.&#x003b1;1DN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). These data indicate that infection with Ad.&#x003b1;1DN completely inhibits VEGF-stimulated AMPK activity. We were unable to distinguish whether the band represented ACC1, ACC2 or both. Inhibition of ACC1/ACC2 by phosphorylation at Ser80/Ser221 has been demonstrated to inhibit fatty acid synthesis in adipose tissue and liver whilst stimulating fatty acid oxidation in heart and skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Activation of AMPK with AICAR has been shown to stimulate fatty acid oxidation in HUVECs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], so it remains possible that VEGF transiently stimulates fatty acid oxidation due to AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of ACC.</p><p id="P17">Inhibition of VEGF-stimulated eNOS Ser1177 phosphorylation has previously been reported in HUVECs infected with adenoviruses expressing either dominant negative PKB or dominant negative AMPK under conditions of hypoxia, while under normoxic conditions, dominant negative AMPK was without effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. In contrast, we have demonstrated that AMPK contributes to VEGF-stimulated eNOS phosphorylation and NO production under normoxic conditions (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Given the effects of wortmannin and Ad.&#x003b1;1DN, we propose that VEGF stimulates both PKB and AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177 under normoxic conditions. Similarly, both PKB and AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177 has previously been suggested to occur in response to adiponectin in HUVECs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. As incubation of HAECs with wortmannin does not alter AMPK activity, AMPK does not act downstream of PI3K in the response to VEGF in HAECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). It remains possible that AMPK could act upstream of PKB in VEGF-stimulated eNOS phosphorylation, but this seems unlikely because we have previously demonstrated that infection with Ad.&#x003b1;1DN does not alter PKB phosphorylation in HAECs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p><p id="P18">In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that VEGF stimulates the transient activation of AMPK in cultured endothelial cells in a PLC- and CaMKK-dependent manner. AMPK therefore represents a novel component of VEGF signalling. In addition we propose that AMPK represents the PI3K-independent kinase that contributes, along with activated PKB to VEGF-stimulated eNOS Ser1177 phosphorylation and subsequent NO production.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S11"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by Diabetes UK (fellowship to I.P.S), grants from the British Heart Foundation and
