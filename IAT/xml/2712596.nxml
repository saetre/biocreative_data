Here, we report that Numb interacts with E-cadherin (E-cad) through its phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB) and thereby regulates the localization of E-cad to the lateral domain of epithelial cell&#x02013;cell junction. Moreover, Numb engages the polarity complex Par3&#x02013;aPKC&#x02013;Par6 by binding to Par3 in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Intriguingly, after Src activation or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) treatment, Numb decouples from E-cad and Par3 and associates preferably with aPKC&#x02013;Par6. Binding of Numb to aPKC is necessary for sequestering the latter in the cytosol during HGF-induced EMT. Knockdown of Numb by small hairpin RNA caused a basolateral-to-apicolateral translocation of E-cad and &#x003b2;-catenin accompanied by elevated actin polymerization, accumulation of Par3 and aPKC in the nucleus, an enhanced sensitivity to HGF-induced cell scattering, a decrease in cell&#x02013;cell adhesion, and an increase in cell migration. Our work identifies Numb as an important regulator of epithelial polarity and cell&#x02013;cell adhesion and a sensor of HGF signalling or Src activity during EMT.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cell polarity</kwd><kwd>E-cadherin</kwd><kwd>EMT</kwd><kwd>Numb</kwd><kwd>tyrosine kinase</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The transition of epithelial cells to a mesenchymal phenotype is a fundamental process governing morphogenesis in multicellular organisms and underlies progression and metastasis of epithelial cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Guarino, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Guarino <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Hugo <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Mandal <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) consists of several steps: the dissolution of tight junctions (TJs), loss of cell&#x02013;cell adhesion, loss of apico&#x02013;basal polarity, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and an increase in cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Guarino, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Guarino <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Hugo <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Levayer and Lecuit, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Mandal <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Polarized epithelial cells contain both TJs and adherens junctions (AJs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Gumbiner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Shin <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Wang and Margolis, 2007</xref>). TJs are formed by the transmembrane proteins occludin and claudin, and the cytoplasmic proteins ZO-1, -2 and -3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Hartsock and Nelson, 2008</xref>). The evolutionarily conserved Par3&#x02013;Par6&#x02013;aPKC polarity complex has an essential function in the establishment of the TJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Macara, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Margolis and Borg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Suzuki and Ohno, 2006</xref>). Par6 contains an N-terminal Phox-Bem1 (PB1) domain that binds to the PB1 domain of aPKC through heterodimerization, a C-terminal PDZ domain that binds the Par3 PDZ domain, and a Cdc42&#x02013;Rac interaction binding motif that recruits the small GTPase Cdc42 or Rac to the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Margolis and Borg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Wang and Margolis, 2007</xref>). The AJs are maintained by E-cadherin (E-cad), p120-catenin (p120), &#x003b2;-catenin and &#x003b1;-catenin that form a dynamically regulated complex coupled to the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Drees <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Yamada <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Hartsock and Nelson, 2008</xref>). On the initiation of EMT, polarized epithelial cells gradually lose their apical&#x02013;basal polarity and cell&#x02013;cell junctions and acquire the characteristics of mesenchymal cells capable of migrating away from the primary site into surrounding tissues.</p><p>EMT is often induced by excessive signalling of a growth factor such as the transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;1 (TGF-&#x003b2;1), the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) or the fibroblast growth factor (FGF), or by aberrant activation of a non-receptor protein kinases (PK) such as Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Birchmeier <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Avizienyte <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Avizienyte and Frame, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). A long-standing question in cancer metastasis is how external stimuli-induced signals may regulate cell polarity and cell&#x02013;cell adhesion to induce EMT. Recent work has begun to shed light on this important issue. For example, Par6 was shown to interact with TGF-&#x003b2; receptor and function as a direct substrate of TGF-&#x003b2;RII. Moreover, phosphorylated Par6 recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 and thereby promotes localized RhoA degradation and ultimately leads to loss of TJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Ozdamar <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Bose and Wrana, 2006</xref>). The activated ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase was shown to signal through the polarity complex Par6&#x02013;aPKC to disrupt apical&#x02013;basal polarity in breast epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Aranda <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Wang <italic>et al</italic> identified Par3 as a substrate of c-Src or c-Yes and showed that abrogation of Par3 tyrosine phosphorylation promoted its dissociation from the LIM kinase 2 and delayed TJ assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). These studies suggest extensive interplays between kinase signalling and cell polarity and call for further investigation into the underlying mechanism. In a proteomic screen for Numb-interacting proteins, we identified several polarity and junctional proteins, including Par3 and E-cad, that co-purified with GST-Numb-PTB (phosphotyrosine-binding), implicating Numb in cell polarity and cell&#x02013;cell adhesion (data not shown). In support of this notion, Rasin <italic>et al</italic> have shown that Numb and Numbl (Numblike) are required for the maintenance of cadherin-based adhesion and polarity in neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Rasin <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Specifically, inactivation of Numb in these neuroepithelial cells results in a basolateral-to-apical membrane translocation of cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Rasin <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). An interaction between Numb and E-cad has been observed both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in ependymal cells of the postnatal mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Kuo <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Moreover, Numb was found to bind Par3 and control directional cell migration by modulating the trafficking of integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Nishimura and Kaibuchi, 2007</xref>). The asymmetric localization of Numb during the division of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts is controlled by aPKC, which phosphorylates Numb on specific serine residues and results in its release from the apical cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line to characterize a role for Numb in regulating epithelial polarity and cell&#x02013;cell adhesion and in HGF-induced EMT. HGF engages the Met receptor, which, in turn, activates downstream signalling proteins such as the Src kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Ponzetto <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Boyer <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>). Activation of Src has been shown to promote E-cad phosphorylation and internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Fujita <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Pece and Gutkind, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Palovuori <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), whereas loss of E-cad expression or its mislocalization has been implicated in cancer progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Thiery and Sleeman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Jeanes <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Yang and Weinberg, 2008</xref>). We show here that Numb binds to E-cad through a conserved NVYY motif in the cytoplasmic domain, but that this interaction is abolished by tyrosine phosphorylation. In the absence of a tyrosine kinase signal, Numb is associated with Par3, but on addition of HGF or the activation of Src, Numb decouples from Par3 and now binds selectively to aPKC&#x02013;Par6, sequestering the latter in the cytosolic and membrane compartments during HGF-induced EMT. Using E-cad mutants and small hairpin RNA (sh-RNA)-mediated knockdown of Numb in MDCK cells, we further show that Numb is necessary for the proper subcellular localization of E-cad, &#x003b2;-catenin and the Par3&#x02013;Par6&#x02013;aPKC polarity proteins. Accordingly, depletion of Numb sensitizes cells to HGF-induced EMT by causing a decrease in cell&#x02013;cell adhesion and an increase in cell motility.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Tyrosine phosphorylation negatively regulates binding of the Numb PTB domain to an NVYY motif in E-cad</title><p>To understand the function of the Numb&#x02013;E-cad interaction in epithelial cells, we first established by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) that endogenous Numb and E-cad interacted in MDCKII cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). To determine whether the Numb&#x02013;E-cad interaction was modulated by tyrosine kinase signalling, cells were either incubated with the phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate or transfected with a <italic>v-src</italic>-expressing vector, both of which significantly enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation level of E-cad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). The phosphorylation of E-cad in <italic>v-src</italic>-transfected cells was not as pronounced as in pervanate-treated cells, likely due to the more specific effect of Src in comparison to pervanadate. Conversely, cells were treated with PP2, an Src-specific kinase inhibitor to suppress phosphorylation. Although the Numb&#x02013;E-cad interaction was attenuated by pervanadate and completely abolished by v-Src expression, it was strengthened by PP2 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). These data show that the Numb&#x02013;E-cad interaction is negatively regulated by Src activity.</p><p>Sensitivity of the Numb&#x02013;E-cad interaction to tyrosine phosphorylation of the latter prompted us to investigate a potential role for the PTB domain in regulating Numb binding to E-cad. Indeed, a GST-fused Numb-PTB domain, but not GST alone, precipitated E-cad from the MDCKII cell lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). In searching for a PTB-binding site in E-cad, we performed a multiple sequence alignment and identified a potential PTB-binding motif, NVYY, in the cytoplasmic domain of E-cad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). This motif is conserved in vertebrates and conforms to the canonical N[V/I][Y/F][Y/F] motif determined earlier for the Numb PTB domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">Zwahlen <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). To confirm this prediction, a &#x02018;peptide-walking' array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Jia <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) representing the cytoplasmic region of human E-cad was synthesized and probed for binding to purified Numb-PTB domain. From this experiment, we identified the peptide, DNVYY<bold><sup>754</sup></bold>, as the minimum sequence required for binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>). Besides containing a canonical PTB-binding motif, NVYY, this peptide overlaps with a tyrosine triad, YYY. To evaluate the importance of tyrosine residues in PTB binding, we synthesized peptide analogs in which the triad Tyr residues were replaced, individually or in combination, by Ala, Phe or pTyr residues. Probing of the resulting peptide array by Numb-PTB revealed that the first two tyrosines in the triad were essential for binding because their respective substitution by an Ala led to a marked reduction or complete loss of affinity. Intriguingly, substitution of any Tyr residue in the triad by a pTyr abrogated binding, echoing earlier results showing an inhibitory effect of phosphorylation on the Numb&#x02013;E-cad interaction. This observation is also reminiscent of the interaction between the tensin-1 PTB domain and &#x003b2;-integrin in which tyrosine phosphorylation of the latter had a negative effect on the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">McCleverty <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). In agreement with the peptide array results, an E-cad mutant, E-cad(3A) in which the Tyr triad was replaced by an Ala triad (i.e. YYY to AAA), failed to bind Numb, whereas the triple F mutant, E-Cad(3F) (i.e. YYY to FFF) was as effective as the wild-type (wt) E-cad in precipitating Numb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>HGF signalling or Src activation regulates dynamic interactions of Numb with E-cad and components of the Par polarity complex</title><p>As E-cad can be phosphorylated at the triad tyrosines during an EMT induced by the activation of Src or a receptor tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Fujita <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>), it is likely that a dynamic Numb&#x02013;E-cad interaction has a function in this process. To explore this notion, we examined, by reciprocal co-IP and western blotting, the complex of Numb and E-cad in MDCKI cells transformed by a temperature-sensitive allele of <italic>src</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Behrens <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>). The <italic>ts-src</italic>-MDCKI cells formed normal cell&#x02013;cell junctions when cultured as a monolayer at the non-permissive temperature of 40&#x000b0;C but acquired characteristics of mesenchymal cells at the permissive temperature of 35&#x000b0;C when Src was expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). Parallel experiments were carried out in MDCKII cells treated with HGF to mimic EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Balkovetz <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>). Although both MDCKI and MDCKII are epithelial cells derived from renal tubules, the MDCKII strain exhibits less clonal variation than MDCKI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Richardson <italic>et al</italic>, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Matter and Balda, 2003</xref>). As the MDCKII strain is used more widely in the literature, we felt it necessary to repeat the experiments done in ts-src-MDCKI cells in this strain. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>, Numb bound strongly to E-cad in <italic>ts-src</italic>-MDCKI cells cultured at 40&#x000b0;C in the absence of Src, but the interaction was abolished at 35&#x000b0;C when Src was expressed. Similarly, Numb was decoupled from E-cad after HGF treatment of MDCKII cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). As E-cad is tyrosine phosphorylated on Src expression or HGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>), it is likely that phosphorylation of one or more Tyr residue at the YYY triad in E-cad abrogated its binding to Numb.</p><p>As Numb was recently shown to bind Par3 and aPKC through its PTB domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Nishimura and Kaibuchi, 2007</xref>), we examined whether these interactions could be modulated by tyrosine kinase signalling. Indeed, Numb exhibited distinct binding preference for components of the Par3&#x02013;Par6&#x02013;aPKC complex in both <italic>ts-src</italic>-MDCKI and MDCKII cells, depending on the status of Src activation. Under basal conditions when Src was not activated, Numb bound strongly to all three isoforms of Par3 (but most strongly to the 150 kDa variant) and moderately to aPKC. Nevertheless, on Src expression or HGF treatment, the Numb&#x02013;aPKC interaction was significantly augmented, whereas the Numb&#x02013;Par3 interaction markedly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>). Furthermore, compared with a constitutive interaction between aPKC and Par6 that appeared to be independent of Src activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>), Par3 was dissociated from the aPKC&#x02013;Par6 complex in response to Src activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>). In contrast, the Numb&#x02013;Par3 interaction was strengthened by PP2 treatment, but diminished in cells over-expressing v-Src (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1C and E</xref>). As Par3, Par6 and aPKC were all tyrosine phosphorylated by Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>), it is likely that phosphorylation played an important function in shifting their respective binding affinity and preference for one another and for Numb.</p><p>We next examined the effect of Src activation on the integrity of the cadherin complex by western blotting. E-cad bound strongly to &#x003b2;-catenin but only weakly to p120-catenin under basal conditions. In contrast, the E-cad&#x02013;p120 interaction was enhanced in both <italic>ts-src-</italic>transformed (35&#x000b0;C) and HGF-treated cells, whereas the E-cad&#x02013;&#x003b2;-catenin interaction was significantly attenuated in <italic>v-src</italic>-transformed but not in HGF-treated cells, suggesting that the activation of Src in the latter case was not as pronounced as in the former (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>). In agreement with these results, v-Src over-expression markedly augmented E-cad binding to p120-catenin, yet reduced its interaction with &#x003b2;-catenin. In contrast, inhibition of Src activity by PP2 completely eliminated binding of E-cad to p120-catenin, indicating that this interaction is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Lilien and Balsamo, 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1D</xref>). Together, these data suggest that Src activity has an important function in regulating the integrity of the Par polarity and the cadherin complexes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Numb is necessary for the basolateral localization of E-cad and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-catenin in epithelial cells</title><p>To investigate whether the interaction between Numb and E-cad is required for proper junctional localization of the cadherin complex, we transfected MDCKII cells with expression constructs for E-cad-GFP, E-cad-(3F)-GFP and E-cad-(3A)-GFP, respectively. As expected, E-cad-GFP localized to cell&#x02013;cell junctions in polarized cells. Of the two E-cad mutants examined, E-cad-(3F)-GFP localized to the lateral membrane domain as did the wt protein. In contrast, E-cad-(3A)-GFP, which was deficient in Numb binding, was detected at the apical region of the cell&#x02013;cell junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A and E</xref>). This suggests that a physical binding between Numb and E-cad is necessary for the proper lateral membrane localization of the latter. To interrogate whether Numb is necessary for the localization of E-cad, we generated a stable clone of MDCKII in which Numb expression was ablated by a specific shRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2A and B</xref>). Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that endogenous E-cad localized to the lateral membrane of cell&#x02013;cell junction as expected. Depletion of Numb by shRNA caused a basal-to-apicolateral membrane translocation of E-cad immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, this phenotype was completely reversed by restoration of Numb expression using a construct encoding an shRNA-resistant form of Numb (i.e. srNumb, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B and F</xref>). It should be noted that the effect of Numb knockdown on E-cad localization was less dramatic than observed for the E-cad(3A) mutant, likely due to the effect of residual Numb in the <italic>numb</italic>-shRNA cells. Alternatively, additional factors besides Numb may be involved in controlling endogenous E-cad localization. As the AJ is linked to the actin cytoskeleton and the reorganization of actin network underpins the formation and maturation of cell&#x02013;cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Kametani and Takeichi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Hartsock and Nelson, 2008</xref>), we compared F-actin staining patterns between the control and the <italic>numb</italic>-shRNA MDCK cells. Numb knockdown led to a significant increase in F-actin staining compared with wt cells or cells expressing srNumb, suggesting that Numb is involved directly or indirectly in regulating actin dynamics in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B and F</xref>). Furthermore, in both <italic>numb</italic>-shRNA and srNumb-expressing cells, actin stain overlapped significantly with the E-cad immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). To find out whether other AJ proteins are affected by Numb depletion, we immunostained for &#x003b2;-catenin, a key component of the AJ. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C and G</xref>, &#x003b2;-catenin underwent a similar basal-to-apicolateral translocation as E-cad in <italic>numb</italic>-shRNA cells. This defect, however, is rescued, by expression of srNumb in these cells. Together, these data show that Numb is necessary for the proper junctional localization of E-cad and &#x003b2;-catenin in polarized epithelial cells. It should be pointed out that Numb depletion did not affect the formation of TJs for cells polarized on transwell filters as indicated by the apical staining of ZO-1 in <italic>numb</italic>-shRNA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>As HGF treatment dissociated Numb from E-cad, we next investigated whether HGF modulated E-cad localization in <italic>numb</italic>-shRNA cells in comparison to in control MDCKII or cells expressing srNumb. In contrast to a tight junctional membrane staining signal for E-cad in polarized MDCKII cells, HGF treatment resulted in a punctate staining pattern for E-cad at the apicolateral membrane domain between adjacent cells and diffused cytosolic stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting dissolution of the AJ. Similarly, HGF induced a redistribution of Numb from the plasma membrane to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). Depletion of Numb in the <italic>numb</italic>-shRNA stable clones, although not affecting their ability to polarize on filters, led to an accumulation of E-cad at the apicolateral membrane domain in the absence of HGF and a redistribution of E-cad to the cytosol after HGF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, E-cad remained largely on the junctional membrane in cells expressing srNumb in the presence of HGF, although the immunofluorescence signal was significantly reduced in comparison to in cells without HGF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). To find out whether Numb depletion sensitizes cells to HGF-induced EMT, we examined, by fluorescence microscopy, the localization of E-cad in subconfluent MDCKII or <italic>numb</italic>-shRNA cells stimulated with HGF for 0, 6, 12 or 18 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures S3 and S4</xref>). These cells were partially polarized and therefore more sensitive to HGF treatment than a monolayer of fully polarized epithelial cells. Numb depletion coincided with faster dispersion of <italic>numb</italic>-shRNA cells (e.g. at 6 h of HGF treatment) than control cells (e.g. at 12 h of HGF treatment) and promoted redistribution of E-cad from the membrane to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures S3 and S4</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Numb differentially regulates the subcellular localization of Par3 and aPKC&#x02013;Par6 during HGF-induced EMT</title><p>Our biochemical data showed that Numb could be engaged in two distinct complexes with either Par3 or aPKC&#x02013;Par6, depending on the status of Src activation. To characterize these dynamic interactions in cells undergoing EMT, we followed the subcellular localization of Par3 and aPKC, respectively, in polarized monolayer of <italic>numb</italic>-shRNA stable clones before or after HGF treatment. In polarized control MDCKII cells before HGF treatment, Par3 and aPKC were found mainly at the apicolateral membrane domain although cytosolic staining was also detectable for Par3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>). HGF treatment caused translocation of Par3 to the nucleus but had little effect on aPKC localization. These immunofluorescence data were supported by cell fractionation analysis demonstrating that Par3 became nuclear after HGF treatment, whereas aPKC remained in the membranous and cytosolic fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). The apparent decoupling of Par3 from aPKC was also observed in subconfluent MDCKII cells stimulated with HGF for different durations of time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). The partially overlapped immunofluorescence for Par3 and aPKC before HGF stimulation became discrete after exposure to HGF for 6 h when Par3 was translocated to the cytosol and nucleus while aPKC remained largely on the membrane. By 12 h, Par3 was found mainly in the nucleus whereas aPKC on the membrane and in the cytosol as the cells became more elongated and scattered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). These results suggest that decoupling of Par3 from aPKC and translocation of Par3 to the nucleus are early steps in HGF-induced EMT.</p><p>Compared with HGF-induced nuclear translocation of Par3 in control MDCKII cells, both Par3 and aPKC were detected in the nuclei of polarized <italic>numb</italic>-shRNA cells in the absence of HGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4E</xref>). As Par3 was found in the nucleus of control cells only after HGF treatment, the change in subcellular localization for Par3 and aPKC caused by Numb depletion suggests that the <italic>numb</italic>-shRNA cells already acquired certain characteristics of mesenchymal cells before HGF stimulation. Indeed, stimulation of these cells by HGF for 18 h did not significantly alter the subcellular localization pattern for either Par3 or aPKC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4E</xref>). We believe that the mislocalization of Par3 and aPKC in the <italic>numb</italic>-shRNA cells was caused specifically by the lack of Numb as restoration of Numb expression in the sr-Numb cells completely reversed this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4F</xref>). To ensure that these immunostaining signals observed for aPKC and Par3 were specific, we repeated the same experiments using anti-aPKC and anti-Par3, respectively, from different sources and obtained comparable results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures S7 and S8</xref>). Moreover, the Par3 immunostaining signal was lost when the antibody was pre-incubated with a blocking antigen, suggesting that the anti-Par3 antibody used was specific (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures S8B and D</xref>). The immunostaining patterns were corroborated by results from western blotting of cellular fractionations. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, aPKC was detected in the nuclear fraction of <italic>numb</italic>-shRNA cells but not control MDCK or sr-Numb cells in the absence of HGF. Similarly, Numb knockdown led to a redistribution of Par3 from the cytosolic and membranous fractions to the nuclear fraction. In agreement with immunostaining data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>), HGF stimulation did not alter the subcellular distribution of either protein significantly. To further explore the role of Numb in affecting the localization of aPKC and Par3 during EMT, we monitored their respective subcellular localization in a time-course of HGF treatment of subconfluent <italic>numb</italic>-shRNA cells. Compared with the control cells, the Numb-knockdown cells were more readily scattered on HGF stimulation. Moreover, prominent nuclear staining was observed for both aPKC and Par3 in the <italic>numb</italic>-shRNA cells, but not in the control, at 6 h of HGF treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures S5 and S6</xref>). These results suggest that Numb may regulate EMT by controlling the subcellular localization of polarity proteins.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Depletion of Numb leads to weakened cell&#x02013;cell adhesion and enhanced cell migration and proliferation</title><p>As the above biochemical and immunofluorescence data identified a critical role for Numb in the localization of both the cadherin and the Par complexes, we speculated that lack of Numb might contribute to weakened cellular junctions, reduced cell&#x02013;cell adhesion, and increased cell motility. To test this hypothesis, we carried out cell aggregation and migration assays on MDCKII, <italic>numb</italic>-shRNA and sr-Numb cells. Although the control and sr-Numb-expressing cells formed aggregates that were not easily dispersed by pipetting, the <italic>numb</italic>-shRNA cells dissociate readily with the same manipulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). To interrogate whether Numb has a function in cell migration, we performed wounding assays on these cells, respectively. Compared with the control, Numb-knockdown promoted wound healing significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). Boyden chamber assays also showed a marked increase in the rate of migration for the <italic>numb</italic>-shRNA cells. Importantly, restoration of Numb expression in the sr-Numb cells returned the migration rate to the same level as the wt cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6E</xref>). To gauge the effect of cell proliferation on promoting cell migration, we measured the growth rate for each cell type. Numb-knockdown led to increased cell proliferation and re-expression of sr-Numb brought the cells back to their normal rate of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6F</xref>). It should be noted, however, that the elevated rate of cell proliferation was insufficient to account for the dramatic increase in the rate of cell migration (i.e. at 48 h post-seeding; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that the depletion of Numb had a dual effect on MDCKII cells: increased cell proliferation and enhanced cell migration because of weakened cell&#x02013;cell adhesion.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Numb links a tyrosine kinase signal to the cadherin and Par complexes</title><p>Growth factors such as HGF, FGF and PDGF provide the necessary stimuli to trigger EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Birchmeier <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Avizienyte <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Avizienyte and Frame, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>), but how the activation of corresponding signalling pathways regulate the transition of epithelial cells from a polarized monolayer to migratory mesenchymal cells during EMT is not fully understood. As loss of cell polarity and cell&#x02013;cell adhesion are hallmarks of EMT, it is reasonable to assume that growth factor-initiated signalling events have an impact on the assembly or dissolution of the TJs and/or AJs. In keeping with this assumption, tyrosine phosphorylation of Par3 by EGF treatment or the Src family kinases (e.g. Src and Yes) has an important function in regulating epithelial TJ assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). It has also been shown that a receptor tyrosine kinase may directly interact with components of the Par polarity complex. For instance, activated ErbB2 is capable of binding to Par6 and thereby promotes the disassociation of the Par3&#x02013;aPKC&#x02013;Par6&#x02013;CDC42 complex to disrupt epithelial polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Aranda <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The identification of Numb, an endocytic adaptor protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Santolini <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>) as a direct binder for Par3 and aPKC, and the demonstration that polarized Numb phosphorylation by aPKC contributes to directional cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Nishimura and Kaibuchi, 2007</xref>) suggest that Numb is a regulator of epithelial polarity. This notion is reinforced by a recent study showing that Numb and Numbl are required for the maintenance of cadherin-based adhesion and polarity for neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Rasin <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). That Numb is capable of interacting with both the Par polarity complex and E-cad raise the possibility that it may be an important regulator of both the TJ and the AJ in epithelial cells.</p><p>In the present work, we investigated the role of Numb in regulating cell polarity through the Par polarity complex and cell&#x02013;cell adhesion through E-cad in the context of HGF- or Src-induced EMT of MDCK cells. Our biochemical data strongly suggest that Numb is engaged in distinct protein complexes depending on the status of Src activation. In the absence of HGF stimulation or Src activation, Numb interacts with both the Par complex through binding to Par3 and the cadherin complex through E-cad in MDCK cells. In HGF-treated or <italic>v-src</italic>-transformed cells, Numb is decoupled from E-cad and Par3 and binds selectively to aPKC&#x02013;Par6. HGF signals through the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met, which, in turn, activates both Src and the Erk mitogen-activated PK cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Ponzetto <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>). Our observation that HGF treatment and Src activation affect the interactions mediated by Numb in a similar manner suggests that HGF signals to the TJ and AJ through the activation of Src and Src-dependent phosphorylation of junctional proteins and/or their regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Avizienyte <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Fujita <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Christiansen and Rajasekaran, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Numb has an essential function in controlling E-cad localization to the AJ</title><p>How does Numb regulate the cadherens junction in epithelial cells? We addressed this question by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy using an E-cad mutant [E-cad(3A)] defective in Numb binding and a MDCKII clone with stable shRNA-mediated Numb knockdown, respectively. Our results indicate that Numb is necessary for the basolateral membrane localization of E-cad in polarized epithelial cells. Decoupling of Numb from E-cad or depletion of Numb causes E-cad to be accumulated at the apical membrane domain in the absence of a stimulus. As Numb binds to E-cad and the two proteins colocalize in polarized MDCK cells, it is likely that a physical interaction between the two proteins is involved in targeting E-cad to the basolateral membrane in polarized epithelial cells. As Numb is capable of binding to components of the endocytosis machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Santolini <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Dho <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), it may be involved in the enodocytosis of E-cad. On Src activation, E-cad becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and is decoupled from Numb. Phosphorylated E-cad has been shown to bind selectively to Hakai, an E3 ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Fujita <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). It is likely that Numb regulates the endocytosis and recycling of E-cad in resting epithelial cells, whereas Hakai promotes the ubiquitination and endocytosis of phosphorylated E-cad in response to Src activation. Together, Numb and Hakai may modulate dynamic changes in E-cad mediated cell&#x02013;cell adhesion during normal development or EMT. This model is supported by the following considerations. First, E-cad undergoes a constant turnover at the epithelial junctional membrane. E-cad endocytosis has been observed during mitosis, after HGF induced cell scattering or on depletion of extracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Le <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). Second, Numb is an endocytic adaptor protein that can promote the endocytosis of a bound protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Santolini <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Dho <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Nishimura and Kaibuchi, 2007</xref>). In this regard, it is interesting to note that the PTB domain of Numb binds to a YENPTY motif present in the cytoplasmic tail of APP and promotes the endocytosis of the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Roncarati <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). As E-cad binds to Numb through its PTB domain, the C-terminus of Numb is free to interact with an EH domain-containing endocytic protein and/or with AP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Santolini <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Dho <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Third, Hakai contains a PTB domain similar to that found in Cb1, also an E3 ligase. Interestingly, the Cbl PTB domain recognizes an [N/D]xxpY motif in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Lupher <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>); it is therefore possible that the Hakai PTB domain binds E-cad through the NVYY site on Src activation (to generate NVYpY). Indeed, Hakai has been shown to interact with E-cad in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner and thereby induce ubiquitination of E-cad. Ubiquitinated E-cad may be either degraded in the proteosome or recycled back to the membrane through the endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Pece and Gutkind, 2002</xref>). The potential dynamic interplay of E-cad with Numb and Hakai, which awaits further investigation, may be an important mechanism for controlling E-cad localization, trafficking and EMT under physiological and pathological conditions. Notwithstanding these considerations, however, we found that E-cad was associated with AP2 in both unstimulated and Src-activated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1D</xref>), suggesting that AP2 may also directly regulate E-cad endocytosis independently of Numb.</p><p>An important yet unsolved question from this work is how knockdown of Numb causes apical accumulation of E-cad in polarized MDCK cells in the absence of a stimulus. It is likely that actin reorganization associated with Numb depletion contribute to this phenomenon.</p><p>An important function of the AJ, which is mediated by the actin cytoskeleton, is to reinforce contacts between neighbouring cells such that apical and basolateral membrane domains are maintained in polarized cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Vasioukhin <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Hartsock and Nelson, 2008</xref>). We observed a striking F-actin stress fibre-like phenotype associated in polarized <italic>numb</italic>-shRNA cells, which suggests abnormal cytoskeleton reorganization. Intriguingly, E-cad was found to colocalize with F-actin at the apical domain in these cells. As actin polarization is controlled by the Rho family small GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Jaffe and Hall, 2005</xref>), it is possible that localized RhoA or Rac activity leads to changes in the actin cytoskeleton, which, in turn, impact on E-cad localization.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Numb regulates the TJ by sequestering Par3 and aPKC away from the nucleus</title><p>Our observation that the subcellular localization of Par3 and aPKC is altered in polarized <italic>numb</italic>-shRNA cells before HGF treatment strongly suggests that Numb also has an important function in regulating the stability of TJs. It is intriguing that Numb depletion caused a nuclear accumulation for aPKC independently of a kinase signal. It has been reported that aPKC may be imported into the nucleus, a process that is facilitated by tyrosine phosphorylation, in particular at the conserved Tyr263 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">White <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). When Numb is present, however, aPKC is retained on the membrane and in the cytoplasm regardless of Src activation or HGF treatment. This suggests that, rather than a tyrosine kinase signal, it is Numb that is responsible for sequestering aPKC away from the nucleus. In support of this notion, we found Numb bound to aPKC independently of Src activity. The interaction, however, was enhanced significantly in <italic>v</italic>-<italic>src</italic>-transformed or HGF-treated cells. A tighter binding of Numb to phosphorylated aPKC and the resulting sequestration of the latter in the cytosol may play an important part in delaying the process of EMT. In keeping with this consideration, Numb-depletion sensitized MDCK cells to HGF-induced EMT. Compared with aPKC, Par3 underwent nuclear translocation in both wt MDCK cells treated with HGF and in <italic>numb</italic>-shRNA cells. Once again, Numb has an important function in retaining Par3 in the cytosol and/or on the membrane. As the Numb&#x02013;Par3 interaction was inhibited by tyrosine phosphorylation, stimulation of wt MDCK cells with HGF effectively created a scenario similar to that caused by Numb knockdown.</p><p>What is the biological significance of nuclear translocation for polarity proteins? A recent study showed that Par3 localized to the nucleus of Hela cells and bound to Ku70 and Ku80, the regulatory subunits of the DNA-dependent PK (DNA-PK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Fang <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). As Par3 knockdown cells are defective in DNA repair accompanied by reduced DNA-PK activity, it was suggested that Par3 has a function in regulating DNA double strand break repair. The modular nature of Par3, which contains multiple PDZ domains and interaction motifs, suggests that additional nuclear functions may exist. As Par3 underwent nuclear translocation soon (6 h) after HGF treatment of subconfluent MDCKII cells, the nuclear accumulation of Par3 may be an early event during HGF-induced EMT. It will be interesting and important to determine whether nuclear translocation of Par3 and other polarity proteins occurs under other types of stimuli, such as TGF-&#x003b2;, that are conducive to EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>A model for Numb function in HGF-induced EMT</title><p>Numb was recently shown to function as a tumour suppressor in breast cancer by protecting p53 from Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, and by antagonizing Notch activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Frise <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Pece <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Leong and Karsan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Colaluca <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Dotto, 2008</xref>). Our work extends the function of Numb to potentially regulating tumour metastasis by delaying the progression of EMT. This assertion is supported by the observation that depletion of Numb sensitized MDCK cells to HGF-induced cell scattering, reduced cell&#x02013;cell adhesion, increased cell proliferation and migration. In fact, the migration and proliferation data obtained for the <italic>numb-</italic>shRNA cells is in agreement with recent reports showing that Numb is down-regulated during promoted migration of peripheral glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Edenfeld <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) and that implantation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval neuroblasts carrying a mutation in <italic>numb</italic> triggered tumour growth in the recipient fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Caussinus and Gonzalez, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Defects in subcellular localization for E-cad, &#x003b2;-catenin, Par3 and aPKC caused by Numb knockdown suggest an important regulatory role for Numb in cell polarity and cell&#x02013;cell adhesion. Although there is no direct evidence to support a physical interaction between the AJ and elements of the Par complex to date, genetic studies have indicated potential interplay between these two cell junctional units. For instance, during <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis, disruption of the AJ perturbed apical localization of Bazooka (Par3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Muller and Wieschaus, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bilder <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Knockout of &#x003b1;-catenin in mice also led to mislocalization of Par3 and aPKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Lechler and Fuchs, 2005</xref>). On the basis of data presented herein, we propose that Numb is a critical, dynamic link between the TJ and the AJ under physiological and pathological conditions. Under physiological conditions, Numb interacts with both E-cad and Par3 to maintain cell polarity and stabilize cell&#x02013;cell adhesion. During EMT induced by tyrosine kinase signalling, Numb dissociates from phosphorylated E-cad and Par3, and forms a complex with aPKC&#x02013;Par6. The formation of the Numb&#x02013;aPKC&#x02013;Par6 complex sequesters aPKC&#x02013;Par6 in the cytoplasm and promotes the dissociation of Par3 from the latter. In the meantime, phosphorylated E-cad and &#x003b2;-catenin are translocated to the apical domain along with reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton to promote cell migration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). Therefore, Numb likely has a key function in early EMT events when cell&#x02013;cell adhesion is weakened and cell polarity is lost.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Peptide array synthesis and probing</title><p>Synthesis and probing of peptide-walking array targeting the cytoplasmic domain of human E-cad followed the same procedures as reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Jia <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Antibodies to E-cad (goat, polyclonal), Numb (rabbit, polyclonal), p120-catenin (mouse, monoclonal), aPKC (mouse, monoclonal), Par6 (goat, polyclonal), ZO-1 (goat, polyclonal), c-Src (mouse, monoclonal), Myc (mouse, monoclonal), GFP (rabbit, polyclonal), Na/K-ATPase (mouse, monoclonal), LaminA/C (goat, polyclonal), Tubulin (rabbit, polyclonal) and GST (rabbit, polyclonal) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech, Inc (Santa Cruz, CA).

Statistical analysis was performed with two-tailed Student's <italic>t</italic>-test.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell aggregation, wounding, migration and proliferation assays</title><p>Cell aggregation assays were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Thoreson <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>) with minor modifications. Briefly, confluent cells were detached from culture dishes using 0.01&#x00025; trypsin in PBS. After incubating for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C in a 100 &#x003bc;l overhanging drop on lid, cells were dissociated by pipetting 10 times through a 100-&#x003bc;l tip. For cell wounding and healing assays, MDCKII cells were seeded on 10 cm Petri dishes with 0.5 million cells. Cell at 100&#x00025; confluency (at approximately 24 h post-seeding) were scratched using a 1000 &#x003bc;l plastic pipette tip and the cell debris were washed away. The plate of cells was then incubated for an indicated period of time in the presence of serum before imaging. The average migration distance in a wounding assay was determined by measuring the gap of the wound at different time points. Boyden chambers cell migration assay was carried out in Transwell (Corning Inc, NY) 24-well tissue culture plates. The upper chamber was seeded with 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells in serum-free DMEM and incubated overnight. The lower chamber was replaced with 0.5&#x00025; FBS in DMEM the next day. Cells that migrated to the lower chamber were fixed and stained in Giemsa solution (VWR International, Canada). The migrating cells at the bottom of the filters were counted in four fields per filter in three independent experiments. For cell proliferation assays, aliquots of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells were seeded into a 96-well plate in quadruplicates and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 72 h. At the end of each time point, each well was loaded with 5 &#x003bc;l of fresh MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, 5 mg/ml in PBS, Sigma) and the mixture was incubated for an additional 3 h. The optical absorbance at 570 nm was measured using a 96-well plate ELISA reader. Every MTT assay was conducted in triplicate.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="N0x1cc8d20N0x34af920" content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Supplementary data</p></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="emboj2009190s1.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="N0x1cc8d20N0x34af980" content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Review Process File</p></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="emboj2009190s2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr J&#x000fc;rgen Behrens of Nikolaus-Fiebiger-Center for Molecular Medicine, Germany, for providing the ts-src-MDCKI cells, Dr K Kaibuchi of Nagoya University, Japan, and Dr Zhengjun Chen of Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, China, for sharing reagents.

(<bold>A</bold>) Reciprocal Co-IP of Numb and E-cadherin from lysate of MDCKII cells. Interaction of Numb with E-cadherin was disrupted by tyrosine phosphorylation of the latter induced by pervanadate treatment or v-Src expression. Ctrl, untreated MDCKII cells; E-cad, E-cadherin; Per, pervanadate; PP2, an Src kinase inhibitor. (<bold>B</bold>) The Numb PTB domain precipitated E-cadherin from MDCKII cell lysate in a GST pull-down assay. (<bold>C</bold>) Multiple sequence alignment revealed a highly conserved region in E-cadherins from vertebrates. The black box marks a predicted Numb PTB domain-binding motif N[V/I][Y/F][Y/F]. (<bold>D</bold>) Peptide array screening confirmed an NVYY motif in E-cadherin as a specific PTB-binding site. For clarity and space consideration, only a portion of the &#x02018;peptide-walking' array of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic region is shown on the left strip (the remaining array exhibited no appreciable binding to Numb PTB). GST exhibited no binding to the same strip. The left column on the strip to the right was an array of a peptide corresponding to the known Numb PTB-binding site (sequence as shown) in LNX, used as a positive control for binding and a quality control for the peptide array synthesis. The right column represents results from substitution analysis of the YYY triad at the PTB-binding site in E-cadherin. Each Tyr in the triad was replaced by an Ala, a Phe or a pTyr to evaluate its importance in PTB binding. (<bold>E</bold>) Binding of E-cadherin mutants to Numb. The triad YYY in E-cadherin was replaced, through site-directed mutagenesis, by AAA or FFF to generate the mutants E-cad(3A) or E-cad(3F). Wild-type E-cad and the mutants were expressed as GFP fusions in MDCKII cells and evaluated for ability to bind Numb by western blot. The bar graphs below panels of (A), (B) and (E), respectively, are data from quantitative analysis of the corresponding western blots.

(<bold>B</bold>) Tyrosine phosphorylation of E-cadherin, aPKC, Par6 or Par3 was examined with a specific anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody (4G10) under conditions specified in (A). E-cadhrin, aPKC, Par6 and Par3 (100 kDa, 150 kD and 180 kDa isoforms) were phosphorylated when Src was activated. In contrast, under HGF treatment, only Par6 and the 150 kD Par3 isoform were significantly phosphorylated while E-cadherin was weakly phosphorylated. (<bold>C</bold>) Co-IP of aPKC with Par6, Par3 and Numb, respectively, under conditions specified in (A). Both Src activation and HGF treatment promoted aPKC binding to Numb, but attenuated its interaction with Par3.
