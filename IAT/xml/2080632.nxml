Among microorganisms, gram-negative bacteria and more precisely, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) component of the outer cell wall, is a very potent activator of macrophages. LPS binds to LPS-binding protein and is delivered to the cell surface receptor CD14, before being transferred to the transmembrane signaling receptor toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and its accessory protein MD2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. LPS stimulation activates several intracellular signaling pathways including the three mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways: extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1 and 2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. These signalling pathways in turn activate a variety of transcription factors which coordinate the induction of many genes encoding inflammatory mediators as well as anti-inflammatory cytokines.</p><p>The control of inflammatory responses is critical to the host to allow resolution and avoid tissue damage. IL-10 is a key anti-inflammatory factor and pleiotropic cytokine produced by a variety of cell types among which monocytes/macrophages are the main sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. IL-10 mediates the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-8, IL-6, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. IL-10 has also been shown to inhibit antigen-presenting cell function, including the maturation of dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and the expression of MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. IL-10 gene regulation can occur both at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Several studies have shown that the transcription factor Sp1 plays an important role in IL-10 transcription (an Sp1 responsive element in the IL-10 promoter is localized at -89 to -78) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Moreover, detailed studies showed that p38 mitogen-activated protein regulates LPS-induced activation of Sp1 in THP-1, a human monocytic cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The STAT3 transcription factor may also bind to an element in the IL-10 promoter gene and the use of a dominant negative form of STAT3 was able to decrease IL-10 transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. More recently, the protooncogene c-Maf has been shown to be an essential transcription factor for IL-10 gene expression in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] while a role for C/EBP in cooperation with Sp1 has also been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, the intracellular signalling pathways governing IL-10 gene regulation in human alveolar macrophages are poorly understood. Thus, alveolar macrophages are the main source of IL-10 in the alveoli where they play an important role to control lung homeostasis. One study on human alveolar macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] showed that activation of PKC decreases IL-10 production whereas activation of protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A enhance IL-10 secretion. In the present work, we evaluate the ability of human alveolar macrophages to produce IL-10 upon LPS stimulation and the role of MAPkinases (ERK, p38 and JNK) and Sp1 transcription factor as intracellular signals leading to IL-10 expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>LPS from <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, PMSF, Nonidet, DTT, BSA, Tween 20, Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide and Actinomycin D were purchased from Sigma (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO).

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> panel A shows the production of IL-10 overtime. The release of IL-10 begins after 6 h of incubation and reaches a maximum at 24 h. Moreover, IL-10 production is dose-dependent and linear in the range of LPS concentration between 1 ng/ml and 1 &#x003bc;g/ml (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, panel B). The time-course of IL-10 induction by LPS was confirmed at gene level by real time PCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, panel C).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Time and dose dependency of IL-10 production in HAM stimulated by LPS</bold>.

The ability of LPS to induce the phosphorylation of ERK, p38 and JNK in human alveolar macrophages was evaluated by western-blotting. As shown on Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, LPS triggers ERK, p38 and JNK phosphorylation in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. Panel A shows that both ERK and p38 MAPkinases reached a maximum of phosporylation at a concentration of 100 ng/ml and are not activated at concentration below 100 pg/ml. Concerning JNK MAPkinase, phosphorylation is dose-dependent in the range of concentration between 0.1 and 10 ng/ml. Experiments of time-dependence show that both ERK and p38 are rapidly phosphorylated (within 5 min) and reached a maximum of activation after 15&#x02013;30 min followed by a progressive decline and come-back to the basal state after 90 and 120 min for ERK and p38 respectively (panel B). JNK phosphorylation is also rapid (within 5 minutes) and reached its maximum at 15 min but returns to its basal state within 60 min.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Activation of MAP kinases in HAM stimulated by LPS</bold>.

To this aim, PD98059, SB203580 and SP600125, three specific inhibitors of ERK, p38 and JNK respectively were used. First, the specificity of each inhibitor was checked by western-blot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and cell toxicity was assessed by the MTT assay (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). No significant cytotoxicity was observed for the three inhibitors at 25 &#x003bc;M while 50 &#x003bc;M of SB or SP induced a 30&#x02013;35% reduction in MTT reduction (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Pre-treatment of HAM with PD98059 (50 &#x003bc;M) clearly inhibits LPS-induced ERK activation and was without significant effect on p38 and JNK phosphorylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). SB203580 (25 &#x003bc;M) partially inhibits LPS-induced p38 phosphorylation without affecting ERK and JNK activation while SP600125 (50 &#x003bc;M) is able to prevent the phosphorylation of JNK MAPkinase after LPS stimulation without affecting ERK phosphorylation. In the latter conditions, phosphorylation of p38 MAPkinase is slightly increased. Having shown that these three inhibitors were specific of each MAPkinase, we used them to evaluate the involvment of MAPkinases in the production of IL-10. As shown on Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, PD98059, SB203580 and SP600125 dose-dependently inhibit LPS-induced IL-10 in HAM. At the maximum concentration (50 &#x003bc;M), SB203580 totally inhibits IL-10 production (more than 99% of inhibition) whereas PD98059 is slightly less active (80% of inhibition).

Secondly, we set up an EMSA assay to confirm that Sp1 was activated and that the inhibition observed with mithramycin was due to an effect on Sp1. Activation of Sp1 following LPS stimulation was assessed using a specific probe containing the consensus binding site for Sp1. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> represents a representative EMSA gel where HAM have been activated by LPS during 2 h. As control, the free probe (without nuclear extract protein) shows no band whereas in the control and LPS-treated HAM, two bands (one major intense and one light) are found in both conditions whereas the light band is more present in LPS-treated HAM. To determine which of these bands is specific to Sp1, the following controls have been performed. First, an excess of cold probe totally switch off all the bands. Secondly, the use of a mutant probe (mutation in the consensus binding site of Sp1) gives only one band corresponding to the major band meaning that this band is a non-specific one. Thirdly, addition of an anti-Sp1 antibody decreased the light band and induces a super-shift. Therefore, we can conclude that the light band represents the complex Sp1/probe.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of mithramycin on IL-10 production in HAM</bold>.

As a predominant immune effector cell in the airspaces, the alveolar macrophage is critical to these defence processes. Thus they produce a vast array of cytokines and inflammatory mediators in particular after LPS stimulation, including TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-10 as prototypic pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, respectively. While the signaling events that mediate TNF-&#x003b1; in HAM have been extensively studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], those responsible for IL-10 production have not been well characterized.</p><p>The present study is the first one showing that ERK, p38, JNK and Sp1 are involved and essential in LPS-induced IL-10 expression in HAM. These factors act at the transcriptional level, as IL-10 mRNA stability was not affected by MAPK inhibitors. It is well known that LPS drives intracellular signaling pathways such as MAPKs and NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] to activate several pro-inflammatory genes including cyclooxygenase-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], inducible nitric oxygen synthase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In the present study, we found that in HAM the MAPK signaling pathways were also involved in LPS-induced gene activation of IL-10, a major anti-inflammatory factor. A recent study in murine macrophage raw 264.7 cells also reported that MAPKs were necessary in IL-10 expression by LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] whereas other studies showed that only MAPK p38 was essential for IL-10 expression induced by LPS and other ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Our study not only showed that all MAPKs were necessary but that they also played an important role in the downstream activation of Sp1 trancription factor.</p><p>Sp1 is the founding member of a family of zinc finger transcription factors, which includes at least four Sp transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Among the Sp transcription factors, Sp1 has been extensively studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and is known to be widely expressed and to play a role in the regulation of a vast array of genes. Thus, while not excluding a role for other nuclear factors our data confirm previous studies showing that IL-10 gene expression is controlled by the transcription factor Sp1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] since mithramycin, an inhibitor of Sp1, almost completely abrogated LPS-induced IL-10 production at the mRNA and protein level. EMSA assay confirmed this observation as it showed that mithramycin decreased the activation of the nuclear protein Sp1 after LPS stimulation. Transfection of HAM by antisense oligonucleotides to Sp1 could not be used as another approach to confirm the role of Sp1 in IL-10 induction by LPS, as after the time period required to silence Sp1 expression (minimum 16&#x02013;20 hrs) following 4 hrs-transfection, HAMs were not anymore responsive to LPS for IL-10 production (data not shown). Interestingly, inhibition of MAPKs by their specific inhibitors, also abolished LPS-induced Sp1 activation. These results are in accordance with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] showing that Sp1 phosphorylation can be induced by ERK and p38 MAP kinases. In addition the present study also showed that JNK MAP kinase is also required for the activation of Sp1 induced by LPS. The three MAP kinases seem however to have different contributions to LPS-induced IL-10 in HAM, with a prominent role of p38 and ERK.</p><p>IL-10 production by alveolar macrophages has been debated since some authors described the inability of alveolar macrophages to produce IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Other investigators related this to a reduced production of IL-10 to allergic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Our data clearly confirm IL-10 production by normal HAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], provide new information on the mechanisms involved in this production and complete the studies of Boehringer et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] who has studied the role of PP1 and PP2A in the regulation of LPS-induced IL-10 in HAM.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study demonstrates the contribution of MAP kinases to IL-10 expression in HAM upon endotoxin activation, indicating that ERK and p38 and to a lesser extent JNK are involved. In addition we show that ERK, p38 and JNK are able to trigger the phosphorylation of Sp1, the major transcription factor for the IL-10 gene. These findings are highly relevant to lung immunity, alveolar macrophages assuming front-line defense mechanisms and IL-10 representing a key factor for mucosal tolerance and resolution of inflammatory responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HC supervised all the experiments, performed the data analysis and wrote the manuscript.
