We have previously shown that human exonuclease 1 (hEXO1) is phosphorylated in response to agents stalling DNA replication and that hEXO1 consequently undergoes ubiquitination and degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. In the present study, we have addressed the identity of the pathway transducing stalled-replication signals to hEXO1. Using chemical inhibitors, RNA interference, ATM- and ATR-deficient cell lines we have concluded that hEXO1 phosphorylation is ATR-dependent. By means of mass spectrometry, we have identified the sites of phosphorylation in hEXO1 in undamaged cells and in cells treated with hydroxyurea (HU). hEXO1 is phosphorylated at nine basal sites and three additional sites are induced by HU treatment. Analysis of single- and multiple-point mutants revealed that mutation to Ala of the three HU-induced sites of phosphorylation partially rescued HU-dependent degradation of hEXO1 and additionally stabilized the protein in non-treated cells. We have raised an antibody to pS<sub>714</sub>, an HU-induced site of the S/T-Q type, and we provide evidence that S<sub>714</sub> is phosphorylated upon HU but not IR treatment. The antibody may be a useful tool to monitor signal transduction events triggered by stalled DNA replication.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Exonuclease 1 is a DNA repair nuclease of the Rad2 family originally identified in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The activity of <italic>S. pombe Exo1</italic> gene product is induced about 5-fold just prior to meiosis, which led to the suggestion that Exo1 might be involved in meiotic homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Transcriptional induction of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster EXO1</italic> gene during meiosis has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Mouse Exo1 was found predominantly expressed in testis and the spleen, consistent with roles in processes specific to germ cell maturation and hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The human homolog <italic>EXO1</italic> gene encodes a protein bearing only 27% identity to its yeast counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Nonetheless, human exonuclease 1 (hEXO1) was shown to be functionally similar to the yeast protein by its ability to complement <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Exo1 and the mutator phenotype of the yeast <italic>rad27</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In humans, two isoforms (hEXO1a and hEXO1b) have been described to arise from alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), though no functional differences between the two isoforms have been reported. The expression of hEXO1 reflects the pattern reported for the mouse, with high levels in testis, thymus and colon and slightly lower expression in small intestine, placenta, spleen and ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>EXO1 catalyzes the removal of mononucleotides from the 5&#x02032; end of the DNA duplex, showing a strong preference for blunt-ended, 5&#x02032; recessed termini and DNA nicks. It can also degrade exonucleolytically single-stranded DNA, although less efficiently than double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Moreover, hEXO1 displays a 5&#x02032; ssDNA-flap-specific endonuclease activity but does not possess endonuclease activity at bubble-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, EXO1 was shown to participate in meiotic crossing over as well as in the processing of double-strand breaks (DSB) ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). An additional role in mutation avoidance and mismatch correction was described for <italic>S. pombe</italic> Exo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Mismatch repair (MMR) is a mechanism reducing the rate of somatic microsatellite polymorphism and it is disabled in a number of human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The involvement of Exo1 in MMR was confirmed by studies demonstrating physical and genetic interaction between yeast Exo1 and the MMR proteins Msh2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and Mlh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Furthermore, an independent study confirmed the structural role of yeast Exo1 in the stabilization of the multiprotein complex containing MMR proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Studies conducted with human recombinant proteins or HeLa cells extracts confirmed the interaction between hEXO1 and the MMR proteins hMSH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and hMLH1/hPMS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The functional role of hEXO1 in MMR was addressed in complementation assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) as well as in reconstituted systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19 B20">17&#x02013;20</xref>). Taken together, the evidence provided by these studies pointed to hEXO1 as the most likely candidate for the excision step during MMR in mammals. In addition to MMR, yeast Exo1 was shown to participate to mitotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and to end-resection at telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The physical interaction observed in human cells between hEXO1 and the Werner Syndrome helicase WRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and RECQ1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) further pointed to a role for hEXO1 in the resolution of DNA intermediates that are formed during recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). In ectopic expression studies, hEXO1 was shown to interact with PCNA via its C-terminal region and the two proteins co-localized at DNA replication foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Proper nuclear localization of hEXO was shown to depend on the sequence K<sub>418</sub>RPR<sub>421</sub>, which exhibits strong homology to other monopartite nuclear localization sequences (NLS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>The importance of exonuclease 1 is underscored by the phenotype of Exo1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that displayed reduced survival, sterility and increased susceptibility to the development of lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Analysis of Exo1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells revealed specific defects in MMR leading to elevated microsatellite instability, increased mutation rate at the Hprt locus and abnormal spindle structures in metaphase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Moreover, Exo1 mutant mice displayed altered somatic hypermutation and reduced class switch recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with its proposed role at sites of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), we have previously shown that the hEXO1 protein is selectively destabilized in response to fork arrest. We reported the rapid degradation of hEXO1 to depend on ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathways and to be facilitated by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In the present study, we have examined the pathway transducing the fork-arrest signal to hEXO1 and we have identified ATR as the responsible kinase. Moreover, we have localized the sites of phosphorylation in hEXO1 and assessed their role in the stability of the protein. Finally, we have generated and characterized an antibody to one of the fork arrest-induced sites of phosphorylation in hEXO1 that would represent a useful tool in studies addressing DNA replication fork stalling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Antibodies and chemicals</title><p>The polyclonal antibody F-15 to the N-terminus of hEXO1 was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).

Twenty-four hours upon transfection, cells were either left untreated or treated with HU for 24 h and were harvested 48 h post-transfection. Using the Omni-probe antibody, hEXO1 was immunoprecipitated from 12 mg of cell extracts, for 3 h at 4&#x000b0;C. The antibody was captured on protein G-agarose beads that were subsequently washed twice with TNET buffer (50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA and 1% Triton X-100) and twice with TNE buffer (50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl and 5 mM EDTA) before boiling in an equal volume of 2&#x000d7; Laemmli-SDS sample buffer.

This, in turn, results in ubiquitination of hEXO1, which is followed by rapid degradation of the protein in a proteasome-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). To assess whether this is a peculiarity of HEK-293T cells or a common response to agent that stall replication, we analyzed the parental HEK-293 cells along with HeLa, U2OS, MEF and NIH3T3 cells. In all cases, visualization of hEXO1 required immunoprecipitation, as the amount of hEXO1 protein present in total extracts was below the threshold of detection of western blot analysis. This confirmed that hEXO1 is a rare protein in all cell lines examined. Moreover, in all cases treatment with HU led to decrease of hEXO1 protein amount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and Supplementary Figure 1A), as previously reported for HEK-293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In order to identify the DNA structure checkpoint pathway that controls phosphorylation of hEXO1, we employed the non-selective PI3K-like kinase inhibitor caffeine as well as the selective ATM inhibitor KU-55933 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Addition of caffeine to HEK-293T cells prior to the treatment with HU abolished activation of the ATR-downstream target CHK1 and led to rescue of HU-induced hEXO1 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, compare lane 4 with lane 5). This, however, was not the case when cells were pre-treated with the selective ATM inhibitor KU-55933 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, compare lane 4 with lane 6). In order to assess whether KU-55933 was functional under our assay conditions, we treated HEK-293T cells with the compound prior to administering ionizing radiation (10 Gy) or HU (2 mM). The data showed that whereas KU-55933 was very effective in inhibiting ATM phosphorylation at S<sub>1981</sub> as well phosphorylation of the downstream effector p53 at S<sub>15</sub> in response to IR, the inhibitor could not block either of the two events in cells treated with HU (Supplementary Figure 1B). This indicates that the kinase activated in response to HU was ATR. The ATR-dependent phosphorylation of ATM that we observed is in agreement with evidence previously reported in the literature for UV-induced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) and confirms the reported cross-talk between these two PI3K-like kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). To substantiate the finding that ATR controls hEXO1 stability, we examined the effect of down-regulating ATR or ATM by means of RNA interference. The shRNA constructs employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) led to a specific, although not compete, reduction of the level of the two PI3K-like kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). In this setting, the HU-induced hEXO1 degradation was only rescued upon knocking-down ATR expression. The residual hEXO1 protein upon HU treatment was 35%, 57% or 37% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, lanes 2, 4 and 6, respectively) as compared to the untreated controls. The fact that the rescue of hEXO1 degradation observed in these experiments was partial might depend on the potency of the shRNA to ATR, which appeared to be less effective than the one to ATM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Quantification of the data indicated that the reduction of protein expression was 75% for ATM and 55% for ATR. In order to get a more definitive answer to the involvement of ATR in the control of hEXO1 stability, we examined the ATR-Seckel cell line. These cells carry a mutated ATR allele that is transcribed in an mRNA undergoing incorrect splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Nonetheless, ATR-Seckel cells maintain low level of the correctly spliced mRNA for ATR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) and in the course of culturing, display increasing expression of functional ATR (M. O&#x02019;Driscoll and P. Jeggo, personal communication). Such model appeared to be ideal to assess the effect of differential level of ATR on hEXO1 stability. In this system, we observed that the expression of hEXO1 was higher in early- than in late-passage cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, compare lane 1 with lane 3), in a manner that was inversely proportional to the level of expressed ATR. More importantly, treatment of late-passage Seckel cells with HU led to a clear decrease in the amount of hEXO1, an effect that did not occur in early passage cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, compare lane 4 with lane 2). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>ATR-dependent control of hEXO1 stability in response to stalled replication.

Both in ATM-deficient and -proficient fibroblasts, hEXO1 displayed a similar pattern of degradation in response to HU treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E), thus ruling out a role for ATM in this process. Taken together, these data show that the stalled-fork signal was relayed to hEXO1 through an ATR-dependent pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of the sites of phosphorylation in hEXO1</title><p>Having established that hEXO1 was phosphorylated in an ATR-dependent manner in response to stalled forks, we set out to identify the sites of phosphorylation. To this end, we ectopically expressed an Omni-tagged form of hEXO1 in HEK-293 cells. Large-scale immunoprecipitations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A) allowed us to obtain sufficient amount of hEXO1 protein to perform LC-MS/MS analysis. In typical experiments, we were able to cover &#x0003e;85% of hEXO1 sequence (Supplementary Figure 2). The results show that hEXO1 was phosphorylated at nine residues (8 Ser, 1 Thr) under basal conditions and at three additional sites (2 Ser, 1 Thr) upon HU treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and Supplementary Figure 2). The three HU-induced sites of phosphorylation (S<sub>454</sub>, T<sub>621</sub> and S<sub>714</sub>) conformed to the requirement for recognition by CHK1/CHK2, MAPK/SAPK and ATM/ATR, respectively. These findings point to the involvement of classic DNA damage signaling pathways as well as stress-activated kinase cascades in hEXO1 phosphorylation in response to HU. Among the nine basal sites of phosphorylation, residues S<sub>376</sub>, S<sub>598</sub>, S<sub>623</sub> and S<sub>639</sub> conformed to the recognition by proline-directed kinases (S/T-P), whereas residues T<sub>581</sub> and S<sub>660</sub> resembled typical CK2 targets (S/T-X<sub>1&#x02013;2</sub>-D/E). The sites S<sub>422</sub> and S<sub>746</sub> fulfilled the requirement for phosphorylation by CHK1/CHK2 (&#x003a6;-X-K/R-X<sub>2</sub>-S/T, where &#x003a6; is any hydrophobic amino acid), or, as second choice, for CK2. Among the basal sites of phosphorylation that we identified is S<sub>598</sub>, a site that was previously described in a large-scale study on HeLa cell nuclear phosphoproteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). A representative MS-chromatogram for the identification of phosphorylation at the HU-induced S<sub>714</sub> site is shown in Supplementary Figure 3. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Identification of the sites of phosphorylation in hEXO1.

The fact that a higher amount of phosphorylated hEXO1 was precipitated from MG-132 treated cells in comparison to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, upper panel, lane 3 versus lane 2), confirmed our early finding that hEXO1 degradation is phosphorylation-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Antibody pS<sub>714</sub> was also suitable for the detection of phosphorylated hEXO1 by western blot analysis upon immunoprecipitation of the endogenous protein. A weak but clear signal was observed upon treatment with HU and the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 to prevent hEXO1 degradation (Supplementary Figure 4).</p><p>Finally, considering that S<sub>714</sub> belongs to the S/T-Q type of DNA damage sites, we asked whether S<sub>714</sub> is specifically phosphorylated upon replication fork stalling or if it is also targeted in response to other types of DNA damage. To this end, we treated HEK-293T cells ectopically expressing Omni-tagged hEXO1 with either IR or HU. Detection of hEXO1 with the pS<sub>714</sub> antibody indicated that HU potently induced phosphorylation at this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D, lane 3), whereas the IR treatment was only minimally affecting phosphorylation at S<sub>714</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D, lane 2).</p><p>Taken together, these results show that the pS<sub>714</sub> antibody is able to specifically recognize the phosphorylated S<sub>714</sub> epitope in hEXO1 and that S<sub>714</sub> is a site selectively targeted in response to stalled replication. The pS<sub>714</sub> antibody may be potentially employed to monitor the flow of signal transduction events in studies on stalled DNA replication. A second foreseeable application for this tool is the identification of hEXO1 interacting proteins by means of combined immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry under conditions of stalled DNA replication, when hEXO1 is phosphorylated at S<sub>714</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutation of the sites of phosphorylation and effect on hEXO1 protein stability</title><p>In order to assess the impact of phosphorylation on hEXO1 protein stability, we generated single and multiple Alanine point mutants of the sites of phosphorylation and expressed them in HeLa cells. The data showed that single mutation of the three HU-induced sites (A<sub>454</sub>, A<sub>621</sub> and A<sub>714</sub>) did not rescue hEXO1 degradation in response to HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Likewise, the double point mutants A<sub>621,714</sub> and A<sub>454,714</sub> were as sensitive as wild-type hEXO1 to the effect of HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). On the contrary, the triple mutant A<sub>454,621,714</sub> was expressed to an apparently higher level than wild-type hEXO1 and resulted to be less sensitive to HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). The higher basal stability of the A<sub>454,621,714</sub> mutant is unlikely to result from constitutively increased expression (i.e. transcription and translation) of this specific isoform as compared to other point mutants. Such increased stability rather reflects the fact that, although phosphorylation at the three HU-induced sites might be substoichiometric under basal conditions of cell growth, it is sufficient to trigger continuous degradation of hEXO1. Support to this view comes from the evidence that low level of phosphorylation at S<sub>714</sub> was detected with the pS<sub>714</sub> antibody in exponentially growing HEK-293T cells that were ectopically expressing hEXO1 but were not treated with HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, upper panel, lane 2). As mentioned above, we observed that the triple mutant A<sub>454,621,714</sub> displayed increased resistance to HU-induced degradation as compared to wt-hEXO1 (29.3 &#x000b1; 6.35% degradation for the triple mutant versus 53.7 &#x000b1; 10.69% for the wild type, Supplementary Figure 5). On the other hand, mutation of all sites in a S/T-Q cluster (Supplementary Figure 2), did not result in any significant rescue of hEXO1 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Taken together, these data indicate that the HU-induced phosphorylation of hEXO1 at the three residues described in this study facilitated the destabilization of the protein, though additional events may contribute to hEXO1 degradation in response to fork arrest. With regard to this point, it is worth considering the possibility that ATR-dependent phosphorylation of hEXO1 interacting partners, among which might be a specific E3-ligase for hEXO1, could be of key importance in the overall control of hEXO1 degradation in response to stalled replication. Future experiments will aim at clarifying this issue. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Effect of HU on non-phosphorylatable hEXO1 mutants.
