Yet, infection with HPV is not sufficient to cause cervical cancer, because most infected women develop transient epithelial dysplasias that spontaneously regress. Progression to invasive cancer has been attributed to diverse host factors such as immune or hormonal status, as no recurrent genetic alterations have been identified in cervical cancers. Thus, the pressing question as to the biological basis of cervical cancer progression has remained unresolved, hampering the development of novel therapies and prognostic tests. Here we show that at least 20&#x00025; of cervical cancers harbor somatically-acquired mutations in the <italic>LKB1</italic> tumor suppressor. Approximately one-half of tumors with mutations harbored single nucleotide substitutions or microdeletions identifiable by exon sequencing, while the other half harbored larger monoallelic or biallelic deletions detectable by multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA). Biallelic mutations were identified in most cervical cancer cell lines; HeLa, the first human cell line, harbors a homozygous 25 kb deletion that occurred <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>LKB1</italic> inactivation in primary tumors was associated with accelerated disease progression. Median survival was only 13 months for patients with <italic>LKB1</italic>-deficient tumors, but &#x0003e;100 months for patients with <italic>LKB1</italic>-wild type tumors (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.015, log rank test; hazard ratio&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.25, 95&#x00025; CI&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.083 to 0.77). <italic>LKB1</italic> is thus a major cervical tumor suppressor, demonstrating that acquired genetic alterations drive progression of HPV-induced dysplasias to invasive, lethal cancers.

To systematically screen for deletions, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for all 10 <italic>LKB1</italic> exons and three flanking probes was employed. Whereas normal human DNA control samples (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3) consistently showed equivalent signal strengths for all probes, MLPA identified distinct <italic>LKB1</italic> deletions in 10/86 tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005137.s002">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005137-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In five tumors, deletions appeared to be homozygous because signals from contiguous probes were reduced by &#x0003e;50&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005137-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, cases 60 and 22); residual signal in these cases likely reflects stromal contamination. Of tumors with apparent heterozygous deletions, one also contained a significant mutation identified by sequencing (Case 41, which harbors a 26 bp deletion, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005137.s002">Table S1</xref>). These findings are consistent with human and mouse studies showing that although loss of the second allele can accelerate tumor progression, mutation of a single <italic>LKB1</italic> allele is by itself tumorigenic (i.e. <italic>LKB1</italic> can be haploinsufficient) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005137-Ji1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005137-Bardeesy1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it is also possible that some mutations went undetected, or that stromal contamination led to an underestimation of homozygosity. In summary, biologically-significant <italic>LKB1</italic> mutations including deletions characterize at least 20&#x00025; (17/86) of invasive cervical cancers. Only one case in our study (case 20, which harbored a somatically-acquired <italic>LKB1</italic> mutation) was diagnosed as a minimal-deviation adenocarcinoma (MDA), a rare, extremely well-differentiated variant of cervical adenocarcinoma associated with Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005137-Young1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Only the CaSki (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005137-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) and C33a (not shown) cell lines did not exhibit <italic>LKB1</italic> deletions.

In our experience, automated base call software overlooked a high percentage of mutations, necessitating direct inspection of chromatograms.</p><p>The discovery of a homozygous <italic>LKB1</italic> deletion in HeLa is noteworthy because of the historical significance of this cell line to biomedical research. HeLa was derived in 1951 from a cervical adenocarcinoma.

HeLa cells were unusual in growing so rapidly in culture, but the primary tumor was also aggressive. The primary tumor was confined to the cervix at the time of diagnosis, but it metastasized early and widely despite aggressive therapy including radiation treatment, leading to the patient's death just six months after the initial diagnosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005137-Jones1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005137-Jones2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005137-Hsu1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results suggest that the homozygous deletion we have documented within <italic>LKB1</italic> contributed to this aggressive growth phenotype, rationalizing some of the unusual features of the HeLa primary tumor and cell line. Consistent with this idea, enforced expression of <italic>LKB1</italic> cDNA into HeLa and other HeLa-deficient cell lines induces growth arrest (unpublished data, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005137-Ji1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005137-Tiainen1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>This is also the first report that <italic>LKB1</italic> mutations confer a worse prognosis for a particular human cancer. However, this observations is in line with genetically-engineered mouse models of <italic>LKB1</italic> deficiency that have consistently found that Lkb1 loss promotes invasive/metastatic growth. In <italic>K-ras</italic> driven mouse models of lung cancer, <italic>Lkb1</italic> inactivation provided the strongest cooperation in terms of tumor latency and frequency of metastasis (as compared to classic tumor suppressors such as <italic>p53</italic> and <italic>Ink4a/Arf</italic>). It is also notable that <italic>Lkb1</italic> loss in the lung was associated with a broad histologic spectrum (squamous cell carcinomas to adenocarcinomas), recalling that <italic>LKB1</italic> inactivation characterizes cervical carcinomas of varied histologic subtypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005137-Ji1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

Further studies i.e. with genetically-engineered animal models will be required to understand the biological basis of the interaction between HPV and LKB1. The biological and biochemical basis of LKB1-mediated carcinogenesis remains to be fully elucidated.
