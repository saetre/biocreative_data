If left unrepaired, the modified bases may induce mutations or block replication leading to cell death. A repair pathway found ubiquitously in both pro- and eukaryotes to deal with such lesions is base excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c1">1</xref>). The modified base is removed by a glycosylase, the strand is incised at the remaining abasic sugar by an AP-endonuclease activity, and after removal of the abasic sugar, the gap is filled by a DNA polymerase with subsequent ligation of the nick. A prerequisite for this repair to occur is detection of the modified base by the glycosylase. For almost all lesions such as alkylation, oxidative or hydrolytic damage this condition is met, since the reaction product is not a normal constituent of DNA. A special case, however, results from deamination of 5-methyl cytosine. Here the reaction product is thymine, a regular base in DNA. The only way to detect this thymine as a product of deamination is by virtue of its opposition to guanine on the complementary strand. Two examples of glycosylases removing thymine from T&#x0002f;G mismatches as an initiating step for base excision repair have been identified so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c3">3</xref>).</p><p>A different repair pathway counteracting the mutagenic effects of hydrolytic deamination of 5-methyl cytosine, which has been described in <italic>Escherchia coli</italic>, is very short patch (VSP) repair. VSP repair was first detected genetically as the determinant for an apparent excess of triple crossovers involving a particular set of markers in crosses of phage &#x003bb; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c6">6</xref>). The central enzyme in this pathway was found to be Vsr endonuclease. The gene for Vsr endonuclease overlaps with the gene for the Dcm cytosine DNA methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c8">8</xref>). Biochemical characterization demonstrated that Vsr is a sequence- and mismatch-specific endonuclease that incises at T&#x0002f;G oppositions on the 5&#x02032; side of the mismatched thymidine, if the sequence context of the mismatch is derived from certain subsets of the recognition sequence CC<sup>A</sup>&#x0002f;<sub>T</sub>GG of Dcm cytosine methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c9">9</xref>). This substrate specificity could also be deduced from genetic analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c11">11</xref>) and is reflected in the genome structure of <italic>E.coli</italic> K12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c13">13</xref>). It seems very likely that the Vsr-catalyzed incision serves as a starting point for an excision repair, removing thymidine and reinserting cytidine, in particular since it was shown genetically that VSP repair requires the presence of DNA polymerase I with an intact 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c14">14</xref>). VSP repair <italic>in vivo</italic> is also greatly stimulated by the presence of functional <italic>mutS</italic> and <italic>mutL</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c15">15</xref>). It has been shown that DNA binding of Vsr endonuclease is enhanced by MutL protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c16">16</xref>).</p><p>Recently, the crystal structure of the enzyme alone and in complex with cleaved substrate DNA has been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c18">18</xref>). This has provided further insight into substrate recognition and the DNA cleavage reaction catalyzed by the enzyme. The catalytic center consists of two strictly conserved (see below) aspartate residues (D51, D97), a threonine (T63) and a conserved histidine (H69) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c17">17</xref>). In an alanine scanning mutagenesis of conserved residues, D51A and H69A showed no activity and D97A reduced activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c18">18</xref>). Upon binding of Vsr to DNA, the three aromatic residues F67, W68 and W86 intercalate into the DNA duplex directly beneath the mismatched T&#x0002f;G from the major groove side. The strict conservation of residues required for recognition of the T&#x0002f;G mismatch and endonuclease activity in all open reading frames with the capacity to encode proteins with sequence similarity to <italic>E.coli</italic> Vsr endonuclease that have been found in numerous bacterial species (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg276f1">1</xref>) suggests that all these putative proteins function in repair of damage by hydrolytic deamination of 5-methyl cytosine. However, except for Vsr endonuclease from <italic>E.coli</italic>, none of these putative proteins has been characterized biochemically. Furthermore, all such open reading frames identified so far originate from mesophilic bacteria. The problem of hydrolytic deamination, however, is strongly aggravated at elevated temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c19">19</xref>). As part of an extended project of this department to characterize enzymes counteracting hydrolytic DNA deamination damage in thermophilic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c21">21</xref>), we decided to isolate a Vsr homolog from a thermophilic bacterium. No thermophilic bacterium had been shown previously to contain a Vsr homolog. We selected <italic>Bacillus stearothermophilus</italic> as target organism, since 5-methyl cytosine modification of its DNA had been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c23">23</xref>). We also wanted to expand the knowledge of the biochemical properties of the Vsr family of endonucleases, which seems particularly important in order to understand the forces shaping genomic sequences, since in the <italic>E.coli</italic> genome the specificity of Vsr endonuclease clearly has a significant impact on the frequency of certain nucleotide strings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c13">13</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and media</title><p><italic>Bacillus stearothermophilus</italic> H3 (source T.

After cooling to room temperature, ethidium bromide was added (1 mg&#x0002f;ml) and the mixture was extracted twice with phenol&#x0002f;chloroform (1:1). RNase A was added to the aqueous phase to a final concentration of 1 mg&#x0002f;ml and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The mixture was extracted once with phenol&#x0002f;chloroform (1:1) and DNA was precipitated with 1.5 vol 96&#x00025; ethanol, washed with 75&#x00025; ethanol and redissolved in TE buffer (1&#x0002f;10 vol of the starting culture) at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. The chromosomomal DNA was partially digested with <italic>Bsp</italic>143I. Ligation with the DNA cassette and PCR with six different sets of degenerated primers (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg276f1">1</xref>) was essentially carried out as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c25">25</xref>). In the first round, PCR conditions were 10 cycles of a touchdown PCR (starting annealing temperature: 60&#x000b0;C with a decrease of 0.5&#x000b0;C per cycle) followed by 35 cycles with an annealing temperature of 55&#x000b0;C. Products that resulted from amplification with a biotinylated cassette primer were enriched with streptavidin-coated magnetic particles and reamplified (30 cycles, annealing temperature: 50&#x000b0;C). These were cloned via <italic>Bam</italic>HI&#x0002f;<italic>Eco</italic>RI into pBluescript II SK(&#x02013;) (Stratagene). Inserts of 68 randomly chosen clones were sequenced. Four of them contained identical 25 bp inserts, which coded for a stretch of amino acids with homology to other Vsr homologs. Based on the sequence of this 25 bp fragment (5&#x02032;-CGC ATG TGA AAT ACA TGG ACG GAT C-3&#x02032;), two primers (5&#x02032;VsrBst: 5&#x02032;-GCT CTA GAA TAC ATG GAC GGA TC-3&#x02032;; 3&#x02032;VsrBst: 5&#x02032;-GGA CTA GTT GTA TTT CAC ATG CG-3&#x02032;) were synthesized for an inverted PCR. Chromosomal DNA from <italic>B.stearothermophilus</italic> was cleaved with several restriction endonucleases and ligated under conditions favoring circularization of the fragments to generate templates for the inverted PCR. The <italic>Mun</italic>I-derived template yielded a 1.2 kb PCR product in the inverted PCR, which was subsequently cloned into pBluescript II SK(&#x02013;). Sequencing of this fragment identified an open reading frame coding for a Vsr homolog (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg276f1">1</xref>). The nucleotide sequence of the gene was determined by sequencing three PCR products derived from three independent amplification reactions with chromosomal DNA as template and later confirmed by sequencing of a chromosomal cosmid clone. The gene was amplified with its own RBS with the primers 5&#x02032;BstVsr-Xba (5&#x02032;-TGC TCT AGA TAT GGA GTT AAT GTT ATG GC-3&#x02032;) and 3&#x02032;BstVsr-Xho (5&#x02032;-CCG CTC GAG ACT TTG AGA ATC TTT GGC-3&#x02032;) and cloned into pET21d (Novagen) yielding the expression plasmid pET21d-vsr.Bst-h6. In this plasmid, the 3&#x02032; end of the <italic>vsr.Bst</italic> gene is fused in frame to a vector-derived sequence coding for six histidines.

Homo- and heteroduplices were constructed by hybridization of oligonucleotides, one of which was fluorescently labeled (for sequences see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg276f3">3</xref>A). The duplices were incubated with Vsr.<italic>Bst</italic> and as a control with Mig.<italic>Mth</italic>I, a glycosylase removing thymine from T&#x0002f;G mismatches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c20">20</xref>). The reaction products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis in a DNA sequencer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c28">28</xref>). The results for a T&#x0002f;G heteroduplex and the corresponding C&#x0002f;G homoduplex are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg276f3">3</xref>B. Whereas no changes can be observed after incubation of homoduplex with Vsr.<italic>Bst</italic> (compare mock reaction without addition of enzyme labeled &#x02018;H<sub>2</sub>O&#x02019;), a new species with an altered electrophoretic mobility can be observed after incubation of the T&#x0002f;G heteroduplex. The reaction product migrates similarly to that of Mig.<italic>Mth</italic>I. Since the Mig.<italic>Mth</italic>I reaction product needs to be liberated by alkaline strand scission of the depyrimidinated reaction product resulting from Mig.<italic>Mth</italic>I treatment and thus contains a 3&#x02032; phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c3">3</xref>), the slightly slower mobility of the Vsr.<italic>Bst</italic> reaction product would be consistent with cleavage 5&#x02032; to the mismatched T with release of a fluorescently labeled reaction product with a 3&#x02032; hydroxyl end as it has been demonstrated for Vsr.<italic>Eco</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c9">9</xref>).</p><p>Sixteen substrates, each containing one of the possible base&#x0002f;base oppositions in the sequence context 5&#x02032;-Fl-GGCTTA TCTCCGC<bold>X</bold>CGGGTTAATCTGTCGCA-3&#x02032; (from substrate 1, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg276tb1">1</xref>; only the sequence of the upper labeled strand is shown, X marks the variable position) were tested for cleavage by Vsr.<italic>Bst</italic>. No product was detected for any of the substrates except for the one containing the T&#x0002f;G mismatch (data not shown). This indicates that Vsr.<italic>Bst</italic> is quite specific for T&#x0002f;G mismatches, at least in the sequence context under investigation. In another sequence context (5&#x02032;-Fl-GGGTACTTGGCT TATCTCCGAGG<bold>T</bold>CCTTAATCTGTCGCA; the sequence of labeled upper strand is shown; the potentially mismatched T is marked in bold), where T&#x0002f;A, T&#x0002f;G, T&#x0002f;C and T&#x0002f;T base&#x0002f;base oppositions were analyzed, some residual cleavage of T&#x0002f;T was observed (4&#x00025; product formation versus 30&#x00025; with T&#x0002f;G under identical reaction conditions). But again, no cleavage of T&#x0002f;A or T&#x0002f;C was detected (data not shown).</p><p>Several T&#x0002f;G processing enzymes have been shown to have equal or even stronger activity towards U&#x0002f;G mismatches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c31">31</xref>), which would result from the hydrolytic deamination of unmodified cytosine. Thus, two substrates with identical sequence context, one containing a T&#x0002f;G and the other a U&#x0002f;G mismatch were compared with multiple substrate kinetics (see below). It was found that the T&#x0002f;G mismatch is processed 2.5 times faster than the U&#x0002f;G mismatch (data not shown). Cleavage at U&#x0002f;G due to contaminating uracil DNA glycosylase (Ung) activity from <italic>E.coli</italic> can be largely ruled out, since Ung is a monofunctional glycosylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c32">32</xref>) and would require a base catalyzed &#x003b2;-elimination by alkaline treatment for efficient strand cleavage in our assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c20">20</xref>). However, no additional product was observed by NaOH treatment of a U&#x0002f;G containing duplex incubated with Vsr.<italic>Bst</italic> (data not shown). It should be noted that the product resulting from alkaline strand scission has a different electrophoretic mobility than that produced by endonucleolytic incision (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg276f3">3</xref>). The observed selectivity of T&#x0002f;G versus U&#x0002f;G is compatible with the assumption that the major cellular task of Vsr.<italic>Bst</italic> is the correction of DNA damage resulting from deamination of 5-methyl cytosine.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence context selectivity of Vsr.<italic>Bst</italic></title><p>If Vsr.<italic>Bst</italic> is involved in repair of hydrolytic deamination damage of 5-methyl cytosine, its sequence context selectivities can be expected to correlate with that of one or more cytosine DNA methyltransferases. To detect such target sequences, we tested cleavage of chromosomal DNA of <italic>B.stearothermophilus</italic> H3 with several methylation sensitive restriction enzymes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;rebase.neb.com">http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;rebase.neb.com</ext-link>).

This demonstrates that at least some sequences containing the tetranucleotides CCGG and CGCG are modified by 5&#x02032;-methyl cytosine and may thus represent substrate sequences for Vsr.<italic>Bst</italic>. &#x0005b;Since the respective enzymes are inhibited by methylation at all cytosines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;rebase.neb.com">http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;rebase.neb.com</ext-link>), no information on the possible location of the methylation in the <italic>B.stearothermophilus</italic> strain investigated here can be drawn from this experiment.&#x0005d;</p><p>To test the conjecture sketched above of a correlation between methylated sites and sequence selectivity of Vsr.<italic>Bst</italic>, the relative second order rate constants for Vsr.<italic>Bst</italic> cleavage at T&#x0002f;G mismatches in different sequence contexts was determined by multiple substrate kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c29">29</xref>). To this end, oligonucleotide hybrids as shown schematically in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg276f4">4</xref>A were constructed. The sequence contexts of the T&#x0002f;G mismatch as listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg276tb1">1</xref> (corresponding to the region labeled &#x02018;variable&#x02019; in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg276f4">4</xref>A) were either derived from the putative substrate sequences or chosen arbitrarily. The rest of the double stranded region was identical in sequence for all substrates. The 5&#x02032; ends of the T containing strands were fluorescently labeled and formed single stranded overhangs that were variable in length to allow discrimination of cleavage products derived from different substrates by their gel electrophoretic mobility.</p><p>Since it could not be excluded that these overhangs might influence the efficiency of the enzyme, two substrates with identical sequence context, but differently sized single stranded overhangs, were compared. The substrate with the context cTcggg was prepared with no and with a 12 nt overhang and the substrate with the context aTcggt with 4 and 8 nt overhangs. The four substrates were compared by multiple substrate kinetics. The substrates with identical sequence context but different single stranded overhangs were processed with identical rates (data not shown). This demonstrates that the efficiency of the enzyme is not influenced by the length of the single stranded overhang to a measurable extent.</p><p>Relative rates for processing of T&#x0002f;G mismatches in different sequence contexts as shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg276tb1">1</xref> were determined by analyzing four substrates per reaction as described above for the substrates with differently sized single stranded overhangs. An example of the analysis of such a cleavage reaction on a DNA sequencer is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg276f4">4</xref>B. The percent remaining substrate was plotted versus reaction time and relative second order rate constants were calculated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c29">29</xref>). An example of such a plot is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg276f4">4</xref>C. The rate constants were then normalized to the most efficiently processed substrate (cTcggg). The results are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg276tb1">1</xref>. The relative rate constant for this substrate and for the slowest substrate differ by a factor of 50. This demonstrates that Vsr.<italic>Bst</italic> has some selectivity for the sequence context of the T&#x0002f;G mismatch. However, the relative rate constants of the other 11 sequences tested differ only by a factor of less than 5. Since these 11 sequences are not obviously closely related, it can be deduced that Vsr.<italic>Bst</italic> does not exhibit a pronounced preference for a particular sequence context the T&#x0002f;G mismatch is occurring in. It can, of course, not be rigorously excluded that there might exist a much better substrate than those tested in this survey, in which case the activities observed here would have to be considered as minor side reactions. This seems unlikely, however, since the best substrates found here correlate quite well with the most plausible substrate range deduced from the analysis of resistance of chromosomal DNA to restriction enzyme cleavage.</p><p>Identification of all cytosine DNA methyltransferases from <italic>B.stearothermophilus</italic> H3 would certainly be the best guideline to judge potential substrate sequences for Vsr.<italic>Bst</italic>. So far, two cytosine DNA methyltransferases have been described for <italic>B.stearothermophilus</italic> H3: the multispecific phage cytosine DNA methyltransferase M.&#x003c6;<italic>Bss</italic>HII, methylating A<bold>C</bold>G<italic>C</italic>GT (<italic>Mlu</italic>I), C<bold>C</bold>G<italic>C</italic>GG (<italic>Sac</italic>II), RG<bold>C</bold>GCY (<italic>Hae</italic>II), R<bold>C</bold><italic>C</italic>GGY (<italic>Cfr</italic>10I) and G<italic>C</italic>G<bold>C</bold>G<italic>C</italic> (<italic>Bss</italic>HII) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c23">23</xref>) (dominant methylation sites indicated in bold face, possible minor methylation sites in italics) and the authentic M.<italic>Bss</italic>HII protecting GCGCGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c33">33</xref>). Although the substrate with the highest cleavage effiency is not derived from these recognition sequences, it seems conceivable&#x02014;given the comparatively small differences of the relative second order rate constants for the different substrate sequences&#x02014;that these sequences represent natural targets for Vsr.<italic>Bst</italic> after hydrolytic deamination of a 5-methyl cytosine.</p><p>The competition to be expected between Vsr.<italic>Bst</italic> and the postreplicative DNA mismatch repair might provide an additional tool for the search of potential substrate sites, once the genomic sequence of <italic>B.stearothermophilus</italic> is available. Mismatches arising during replication as DNA polymerase errors are processed by postreplicative DNA mismatch repair to increase replicational fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c34">34</xref>). Since we have identified a <italic>mutS</italic> and <italic>mutL</italic> homolog in <italic>B.stearo thermophilus</italic> (B.Fartmann, M.Laging and W.Kramer, unpublished), it is very likely that DNA mismatch repair is operating in this organism. Any T&#x0002f;G mismatch generated during replication could be processed by either DNA mismatch repair or Vsr.<italic>Bst</italic>. Whereas DNA mismatch repair removes the wrong nucleotide on the newly synthesized strand, Vsr.<italic>Bst</italic> would always initiate excision of the T. If the T&#x0002f;G mismatch arises by insertion of G opposite T on the template strand, action of Vsr endonuclease would fix the error. Competition of VSP repair with DNA mismatch repair has been demonstrated in <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c11">11</xref>) and its traces left during evolution can still be found imprinted into the <italic>E.coli</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c12">12</xref>). Thus, tetra-, penta or hexanucleotide sequences that are underrepresented in the <italic>B.stearothermophilus</italic> genome might be cytosine DNA methyltransferase recognition sites (or subsets thereof) that are subject to repair by Vsr.<italic>Bst</italic> after hydrolytic deamination of the 5-methyl cytosine.</p></sec><sec><title>Fraction of active enzyme</title><p>The cleavage assays were all carried out with a large molar excess of enzyme (&#x0223c;1000-fold). Nevertheless, no quantitative cleavage of the substrate could be achieved. This could have two reasons: either only a very minor fraction of the enzyme is active or the association constant for formation of the enzyme&#x02013;substrate complex is too low, which might not allow efficient formation of the complex at the substrate concentrations employed (0.5 nM) unless the enzyme concentration is high (0.57 &#x000b5;M). The upper limit for the amount of labeled substrate is set by the maximum detection capability of the DNA sequencer used. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we used mixtures with a fixed concentration of labeled substrate (1 nM) and varying concentrations of unlabeled substrate and determined product formation after 20 min at 50&#x000b0;C at a constant enzyme concentration (100 nM). The results are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg276tb2">2</xref>. Already a 5-fold molar excess of the enzyme is sufficient to cleave most of the substrate. This rules out that the large molar excess used in the multiple substrate kinetics is necessary because most of the protein is enzymatically inactive. In an equimolar mixture, &#x0223c;50&#x00025; of the substrate is processed and at a 2-fold excess of substrate &#x0223c;25&#x00025;. This indicates that approximately two molecules of Vsr.<italic>Bst</italic> are necessary to cleave one substrate molecule under the reaction conditions used. If one assumes that Vsr.<italic>Bst</italic> has no or only little turnover, as it has been demonstrated for Vsr.<italic>Eco</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg276c36">36</xref>), at least 50&#x00025; of the enzyme would be enzymatically active.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg276f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Multiple sequence alignment of proteins exhibiting strong similarity to <italic>E.coli</italic> Vsr and sequences of degenerated primer sets for isolation of <italic>vsr.Bst</italic>.
