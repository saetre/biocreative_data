Liver-specific signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5A/B&#x02013;null mice (STAT5-LKO) were treated with carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>), and histological analyses revealed liver fibrosis and tumors. Transforming growth factor (TGF)&#x02013;&#x003b2; levels and STAT3 activity were elevated in liver tissue from STAT5-LKO mice upon CCl<sub>4</sub> treatment. To define the molecular link between STAT5 silencing and TGF-&#x003b2; up-regulation, as well as STAT3 activation, we examined STAT5-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts and primary hepatocytes. These cells displayed elevated TGF-&#x003b2; protein levels, whereas messenger RNA levels remained almost unchanged. Protease inhibitor studies revealed that STAT5 deficiency enhanced the stability of mature TGF-&#x003b2;. Immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry analyses demonstrated that STAT5, through its N-terminal sequences, could bind to TGF-&#x003b2; and that retroviral-mediated overexpression of STAT5 decreased TGF-&#x003b2; levels. To confirm the in vivo significance of the N-terminal domain of STAT5, we treated mice that expressed STAT5 lacking the N terminus (STAT5-&#x00394;N) with CCl<sub>4</sub>. STAT5-&#x00394;N mice developed CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver fibrosis but no tumors. In conclusion, loss of STAT5 results in elevated TGF-&#x003b2; levels and enhanced growth hormone&#x02013;induced STAT3 activity. We propose that a deregulated STAT5&#x02013;TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;STAT3 network contributes to the development of chronic liver disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) are a major cause of cancer death and mostly develop as a result of advanced liver fibrosis. Studies have linked the development of HCC with a methylation-induced silencing of SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling) genes, which in turn leads to elevated activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) or mutations of Axin1, a negative regulator of Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which liver fibrosis induces cancer remain elusive.</p><p>It is well known that TGF-&#x003b2; is an important cytokine in these fibrotic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>) and that excess TGF-&#x003b2; production is a key problem for the treatment of liver diseases as it triggers liver fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Three different gene products, TGF-&#x003b2;1, -&#x003b2;2, and -&#x003b2;3, have been cloned from mammalian tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) and mature TGF-&#x003b2; proteins are composed of two 12.5-kD polypeptides. They are derived from 55-kD polypeptides, which dimerize upon synthesis followed by processing and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Most studies describing biological effects of TGF-&#x003b2; have examined how it affects targeted cells. In this paper, we have focused on intracellular processing of the TGF-&#x003b2; complex before secretion. Transformation of hepatocytes, but not of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) or Kupffer cells (KC), leads to cancer as a result of liver fibrosis. Although hepatocytes have not been considered a source of TGF-&#x003b2;, we can hypothesize that intracellular synthesis and modification of TGF-&#x003b2; in these cells is involved in cancer development.</p><p>The transcription factors STAT5 and STAT3 promote cell cycle progression and suppress apoptosis, thus contributing to cellular transformation. Notably, activated STAT3 can mediate cellular transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>) and has been detected in primary tumors including HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Although STAT5 has been linked to tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), it can also act as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting expression of NPM1-ALK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). As for solid tumors, the role for STAT5 is controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). To explore the role of cytokine signaling through STAT5 in liver fibrosis and cancer, we deleted the <italic>Stat5</italic> locus specifically in hepatocytes using Cre-mediated recombination. Using this experimental approach, we discovered a relationship between STAT5, TGF-&#x003b2;, and STAT3 in the pathogenesis of chronic liver disease.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Progression of liver fibrosis in hepatocyte-specific STAT5-null mice</title><p>Treatment of mice with carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>) induces liver fibrosis and is an accepted model to mimic human disease. To examine the significance of cytokine-STAT5 signaling in the development of liver fibrosis, control mice and mice from which the <italic>Stat5</italic> locus had been deleted in hepatocytes using Cre-mediated recombination (STAT5-LKO) were treated for 8 wk with CCl<sub>4</sub>. Loss of STAT5 did not affect the sensitivity of primary hepatocytes to CCl<sub>4</sub> and the slight increase of cell death was not significant (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080003/DC1">Fig. S1, A and B</ext-link>). Before treatment, there were no histological differences between mice from both groups based on silver and Azan staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>, top). The reticular fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>, arrows) extended and developed into the interlobular septum in STAT5-LKO mice, whereas few reticular fibers deposited in the periportal tissue space in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, bottom). To evaluate fibrotic changes, we also performed Azan staining to detect collagen accumulation and identified the formation of nodules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, arrows) in STAT5 mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, bottom). In agreement with these observations, the content of hepatic collagen was higher in STAT5-LKO mice after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). These histological analyses and hepatic collagen assays revealed that STAT5 mutant mice displayed more advanced liver fibrosis than control mice.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Progression of liver fibrosis in hepatocyte-specific Stat5A/B KO mice.</bold> (A and B) Silver staining (A) and Azan staining (B) of liver sections from STAT5A/B<sup>f/f</sup> (control) mice and STAT5A/B<sup>f/f;Alb-Cre</sup> (STAT5-LKO) mice before and after CCl<sub>4</sub> treatment for 8 wk.

TGF-&#x003b2; (mature TGF-&#x003b2;) levels were more profoundly induced in STAT5-LKO mice after CCl<sub>4</sub> treatment compared with controls. Latent TGF-&#x003b2; binding protein (LTBP) levels were reduced in STAT5-LKO mice after CCl<sub>4</sub> treatment and to a lesser extent in controls. This reduction of LTBP might be the result of an increased secretion of mature TGF-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). The expression levels of other fibrogenesis-related factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and TGF-&#x003b2; pseudo receptor Bambi, were examined and no differences were observed between control and STAT5-LKO mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080003/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>).</p><p>Liver fibrosis is reported to associate with acquired growth hormone (GH) resistance because of low GH receptor levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Although strong activation of STAT5 was observed in hepatocytes of control mice upon stimulation with GH, reduced activation was detected after CCl<sub>4</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>), suggesting that these cells loose their hormonal response during early stages of fibrosis. STAT5 levels and activation were greatly reduced in STAT5-LKO mice before and after GH stimulation irrespective of CCl<sub>4</sub> treatment. GH receptor levels were largely independent of GH and CCl<sub>4</sub> treatment.</p><p>We have recently reported that in the absence of STAT5, other STAT members, especially STAT3 and STAT1, could be recruited to receptors normally engaged by STAT5, which in turn would result in their aberrant activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>, GH weakly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (pSTAT3) in control mice, which was exacerbated in the combined presence of GH and CCl<sub>4</sub>. In STAT5-LKO mice, strong STAT3 activation was observed even before GH injection and was even more pronounced upon GH treatment. Combined CCl<sub>4</sub> and GH treatment further enhanced STAT3 activation in STAT5-LKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). STAT3 levels were similar in the different groups. Expression levels of the STAT3 target genes <italic>fibrinogen &#x003b3;</italic> and <italic>haptoglobin</italic> were also increased in liver tissue from STAT5-LKO mice and further elevated upon GH and CCl<sub>4</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080003/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>). STAT1 activation was largely independent of CCl<sub>4</sub> treatment (unpublished data). These results demonstrate that in the absence of STAT5, GH can directly activate STAT3, and that this activation is strongly enhanced by CCl<sub>4</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Development of liver cancer in STAT5-LKO mice</title><p>4 out of 20 STAT5-LKO mice had developed multiple tumors after 8 wk of CCl<sub>4</sub> treatment, whereas none were detected in 26 control mice (P = 0.0199; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Histological analysis revealed that these tumors were mostly formed by moderately differentiated HCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). It has been established that most HCCs develop as a result of severe liver fibrosis. However, because STAT5-LKO mice had not developed severe fibrosis, we speculated these HCCs were induced through a different mechanism. We again confirmed an almost complete absence of nuclear STAT5B in STAT5-LKO mice, whereas it was present in hepatocytes from control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Although little nuclear pSTAT3 was detected in control mice, STAT5-LKO mice exhibited slightly stronger staining of pSTAT3 in nontumor tissue and extensive staining in tumor tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). These results indicate that STAT3 is gradually activated in the fibrosis-cancer process in STAT5-LKO mice.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Development of cancer in hepatocyte-specific STAT5A/B KO mice.</bold> (A) Appearance of a representative hepatic tumor from STAT5A/B<sup>f/f;Alb-Cre</sup> mice after CCl<sub>4</sub> treatment.

We first confirmed the absence of STAT5 expression and activation in cell lysates from STAT5-null MEFs by Western blot analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Proliferation of control and STAT5-null MEFs was similar both in 15 and 3% FCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Fibroblastic cells are known to produce TGF-&#x003b2; and to be stimulated by autocrine and paracrine pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Based on our experiments with hepatocytes, we hypothesized that TGF-&#x003b2; levels would be elevated in STAT5-null MEFs, which would lead to a paracrine activation and excess production of extracellular matrix protein. The intracellular content of collagen was similar in MEFs from STAT5-null and control mice immediately after their preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>, left). In contrast, elevated collagen levels were observed in STAT5-null but not control MEFs after 10 passages. Similarly, collagen levels were higher in culture medium obtained from STAT5-null MEFs after 1 mo in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>, right). Furthermore, collagen levels were reduced in MEFs of the 10th passage in the presence of anti&#x02013;TGF-&#x003b2; antibody, suggesting that increased levels of TGF-&#x003b2; caused excess production of collagen. TGF-&#x003b2; levels were greatly elevated in cell lysates and medium of STAT5-null MEFs compared with control MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>, top; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080003/DC1">Fig. S4</ext-link>).

(B) Model for the development of liver fibrosis and cancer through elevated expression of TGF-&#x003b2; and activation of STAT3 in hepatocytes. Under physiological conditions, TGF-&#x003b2; is present at low or nondetectable levels and some is secreted after binding to LTBP in a constitutive fashion. STAT5 binds to TGF-&#x003b2; and interferes with the formation of TGF-&#x003b2; complex, resulting in suppression of TGF-&#x003b2; protein stability. At this level of TGF-&#x003b2;, STAT5 levels and activation are not influenced. Upon development of liver fibrosis, TGF-&#x003b2; levels increase and LTBP levels decrease. Under these conditions, STAT5 is sequestered by TGF-&#x003b2; and can no longer be activated by GH. Instead, GH activates STAT3.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEM_20080003_RGB_Fig6"/></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>GH resistance and low serum levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 have been identified in a large percentage of cirrhotic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), suggesting a link between STAT5 signaling and liver fibrosis and possibly HCC. In this paper, we have demonstrated that TGF-&#x003b2; directly interacts with STAT5 and that elevated levels of TGF-&#x003b2; abrogate GH-induced STAT5 activation. Instead, elevated levels of TGF-&#x003b2; result in GH activation of STAT3, and constitutive STAT3 activity is commonly observed in HCC. Elevated phosphorylation of STAT3 has been associated with epithelial cancers and linked to the induction of STAT3 target genes. In support of a STAT5&#x02013;TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;STAT3 mechanism, deletion of STAT5 from hepatocytes in mice resulted in elevated levels of TGF-&#x003b2;, an activation of STAT3, and, finally, the development of HCC. We hypothesize that a TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;mediated abrogation of STAT5 signaling results in the activation of STAT3, which is a key step in the development of HCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>).</p><p>Most likely, the development of liver cancer in this model is the result of more than one molecular insult. Notably, excessive STAT3 activation upon GH and CCl<sub>4</sub> treatment in STAT5-LKO mice could result in unscheduled cell proliferation and transformation. TGF-&#x003b2; binds to the N terminus of STAT5, and loss of STAT5 led to elevated TGF-&#x003b2; levels as a result of increased stability. The absence of the STAT5 N terminus in STAT5-&#x00394;N mice did not abrogate the development of liver fibrosis, but no tumors were observed in these mice. This suggests that an N-terminally truncated STAT5 still contains tumor suppressor functions similar to that seen with wild-type STAT5. Several studies that compared STAT5-&#x00394;N mice and mice completely missing STAT5A/B established functional activity of the N-terminally truncated STAT5. For example, although the complete loss of STAT5 results in perinatal lethality, STAT5-&#x00394;N mice are viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Similarly, the complete loss of STAT5 causes more severe hematological defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). A recent study demonstrated that the N-terminal domain plays an important role in maintaining normal balance of lymphoid and myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Although it is clear that loss of STAT5 N terminus, which is required for the tetramerization of STAT5, does not result in increased liver cancer induced by CCl<sub>4</sub>, its contribution to oncogenesis might be cell specific. Moriggl et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>) established that loss of the N-terminal region protected the development of certain leukemia. At this point, the cell specificity of STAT5 in normal development and oncogenesis is poorly understood.</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2; and STAT3 are not only critical in the promotion of tumor progression and survival but they also contribute to tumor-immune escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Notably, increased TGF-&#x003b2; secretion might lead to the expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (T reg) cells that would impact liver fibrosis and tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Another possibility for the promotion of liver fibrosis is that the deletion of STAT5 might have an effect on HSC or KC and increase their sensitivity to TGF-&#x003b2;. However, the CD4/CD8 ratio and TH1- and TH2-cytokine production were similar in control and mutant mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080003/DC1">Fig. S8, A&#x02013;C</ext-link>), and no selective expansion of T reg cells was observed after CCl<sub>4</sub> treatment (Fig. S8, D and E). Moreover, the sensitivity of HSC to TGF-&#x003b2; in isolated HSC was identical in both mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080003/DC1">Fig. S9</ext-link>). These results contributed to a nonbiased analysis of the role of STAT5 in liver fibrosis and cancer development.</p><p>In the absence of inflammation, liver TGF-&#x003b2; is secreted from HSC and KC but not from hepatocytes. However, upon inflammation or injury hepatocytes gradually become the major source of TGF-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). As hepatic fibrosis develops, TGF-&#x003b2; levels increase, followed by the accumulation of extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Collectively, hepatocytes secrete an excess of TGF-&#x003b2; in the late stage of liver fibrosis when most cancer develops. It has been shown that TGF-&#x003b2;1 induces an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in mature hepatocytes, resulting in type I collagen synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). Because embryonic fibroblasts secrete TGF-&#x003b2;, MEFs are reminiscent of myofibroblasts, which are activated in liver fibrosis state. TGF-&#x003b2; levels were highly elevated in STAT5-null MEFs and reintroduction of STA5 resulted in the suppression of TGF-&#x003b2;. Based on our studies, we propose that binding of STAT5 to TGF-&#x003b2; reduces its half-life. STAT5 has been reported to interact with other molecules, such as the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and HNF (hepatocytes nuclear factor) 4&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). Although the GR can act as a transcriptional coactivator of STAT5 and enhances STAT5-dependent transcription, the GR&#x02013;STAT5 complex diminishes the glucocorticoid response of promoters harboring glucocorticoid response elements. As for HNF-4&#x003b1;, it strongly inhibits GH-induced STAT5B transcriptional activity. Although STAT5 decreases TGF-&#x003b2; stability, resulting in a reduction of TGF-&#x003b2;, excess levels of TGF-&#x003b2; inhibit GH-induced activation of STAT5. In this context, GH preferentially activates STAT3, which in turn activates genes linked to cell proliferation and survival. Thus, STAT5 transcriptional functionality can be modulated by activating and suppressing cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>).</p><p>The unscheduled ability of STAT3 to be activated by cytokines that normally only activate STAT5 is no artifact of the STAT5-KO mouse model. Recently, several inactivating STAT5B mutations have been identified in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>) and linked to dwarfism and immunological disorders. Stimulation of primary cells from these patients with GH and prolactin leads to an unscheduled activation of STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>), and it is conceivable that some of the immunological disorders observed in these patients can be linked to the aberrant activation of STAT3 rather than the loss of STAT5B. With respect to liver fibrosis and HCC, we propose that TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;mediated down-regulation of STAT5 levels in hepatocytes leads to an aberrant activation of STAT3.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice and treatment.</title><p>Through breeding, we generated STAT5A/B<sup>fl/fl;Alb-Cre</sup>, STAT5A/B<sup>fl/fl</sup>, and STAT5A/B<sup>fl/&#x00394;N;Alb-Cre</sup> mice, which are in a mixed background (STAT5-&#x00394;N mice were provided by J.N.

All supernatants were collected for 48&#x02013;72 h after transfection and passed through a 0.45-&#x000b5;m filter before freezing at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.</p><p>For the infection of retrovirus to MEFs, 10<sup>6</sup> cells were seeded on a 10-cm culture dish and were infected the next day with retrovirus in the presence of 8 &#x000b5;g/ml polybrene. 48&#x02013;72 h after infection, the cells were lysed and subjected to the subsequent experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>FACS.</title><p>After infection with retrovirus, MEFs were trypsinized, washed twice in PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and, finally, subjected to flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; BD). Nonfluorescent cells and GFP-expressing cells were isolated using the FACS Vantage (BD) and sorted directly into PBS. Protein was extracted from each population and applied to Western blot analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Histology.</title><p>H&#x00026;E, silver staining, and Azan staining were performed using standard procedures. In short, liver pieces were rapidly removed and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, processed routinely, and embedded in paraffin wax. The sections were cut to appropriate thickness followed by each staining.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and real-time PCR analysis.</title><p>Total RNA was isolated (RNeasy mini kit; QIAGEN), and then 1-&#x000b5;g amounts of RNA were reverse transcribed (SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix; Invitrogen), and cDNAs were amplified using Taqman (for fibrinogen &#x003b3; and haptoglobin) or SYBR Green master mix and probe (for TGF-&#x003b2;1, &#x003b2;2, and &#x003b2;3; Applied Biosystems). These assays were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of cell growth.</title><p>To examine the cell growth curve, 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> wild-type and STAT5 KO MEFs were seeded on a 96-well culture plate. After 3, 6, and 9 d, the net number of viable cells was assessed colorimetrically using water-soluble tetrazolium (WST; 2-[2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl]-3-[4-nitrophenyl]-5-[2, 4-disulfophenyl]-2<italic>H</italic>-tetrazolium monosodium salt; Roche). This assay is based on the cleavage of tetrazolium salt by mitochondrial dehydrogenase in viable cells. For the assay, 10 &#x000b5;l WST reagent was added to the 100-&#x000b5;l culture medium, followed by incubation at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 h. Then the optical density at 450 nm was measured. The assay was done in quadruplicate, and the values were expressed as the means &#x000b1; SD.</p></sec><sec><title>Degradation of TGF-&#x003b2; after blockade of protein synthesis and effects of lysosome inhibitors on TGF-&#x003b2; stability.</title><p>STAT5 wild-type (two independent lines) and KO MEFs were grown to 80% confluence in 60-mm dishes and serum starved overnight. Cells were then incubated with 20 mg/ml CHx for 0&#x02013;6 h or 100 mM ammonium chloride for 2 h followed by CHx or PBS treatment. Cells lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti&#x02013;TGF-&#x003b2; antibody.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics.</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using a two-tailed unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic> test.
