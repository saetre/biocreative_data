In order to study the mechanism of regulation of AR at the molecular level, a 1571 bp fragment in the 5'-flanking region of the mouse androgen receptor (mAR) gene was isolated and sequenced. Transfection of 5'-deletion constructs cloned into vectors containing the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene indicated the presence of a promoter in the sequence -146 to +131. These experiments also suggested the presence of a suppressor element. Further characterization indicated that the suppressor is present between -486 to -351. It is functional in the context of the natural AR promoter and the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter. Transfection of a -546/ + 131 construct in which the putative suppressor element (-421 to -448) had been deleted caused increased basal CAT activity suggesting that the suppressor is limited to this 28 bp element in the 5'-flanking region of the mouse AR gene.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00042-0034.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3693"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00042-0035.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3694"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00042-0036.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3695"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00042-0037.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3696"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00042-0038.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3697"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00042-0039.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3698"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
