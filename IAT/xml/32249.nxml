Endogenous oscillators or clocks capable of sustained oscillation through multiple cycles control such rhythms in the absence of external cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Molecular-genetic analysis of circadian rhythms in <italic>Drosophila, Neurospora</italic> and more recently in vertebrate systems has led to the conclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] that rhythms of gene expression are of central importance both in the sustained generation of rhythmicity (clock genes) and in the control of output pathways (clock controlled genes).</p><p>Recently, the search for components of the vertebrate circadian system has led to the identification of homologues of <italic>period</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and <italic>timeless</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], originally characterized as central clock genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as well as <italic>Clock</italic> and <italic>Bmal1</italic> (<italic>Cycle</italic>), identified initially in the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> CLOCK and BMAL1 regulate transcription of <italic>period</italic> (<italic>per</italic>) and <italic>timeless</italic> (<italic>tim</italic>) in a cycle in which the PER and TIM proteins dimerize, enter the nucleus, and negatively regulate their own transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This pattern of rhythmic gene transcription appears to be of central importance to the clock mechanism. In addition, rhythmic regulation of the transcription of "clock controlled" genes such as tryptophan hydroxylase is important in the regulation of overt rhythms downstream of the clock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Among vertebrates, circadian oscillators have been formally identified in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the mammalian brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and the pineal gland of non-mammalian vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Each of these systems controls behavioral, physiological or neuroendocrine rhythms that are of physiological importance to the organism. However, it has recently become apparent that rhythmic gene expression occurs more broadly. For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> the circadian oscillator controlling behavioral rhythmicity can be localized to a small set of lateral neurons in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] while circadian transcription of the clock gene, <italic>period</italic>, occurs in multiple tissues and organs even when isolated to an <italic>in vitro</italic> setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The recent identification of period gene homologues in mammals has led to a similar finding of rhythmic expression in multiple tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In one case, sustained rhythmicity has been demonstrated in tissue culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>nocturnin</italic> gene was discovered in a differential display screen for circadian gene expression using the retina of the African clawed frog, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The gene encodes a protein with a leucine repeat domain and a domain homologous to the carbon catabolite repression 4 protein (CCR4), a transcription co-activator in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Analysis of the EST database also revealed human transcripts with extensive sequence similarity to the same domain in yeast CCR4 and NOCTURNIN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. CCR4 is thought to affect gene transcription through interactions with other proteins in the yeast transcriptional apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In <italic>Xenopus</italic> retina, <italic>nocturnin</italic> was found to exhibit high amplitude rhythmicity in which most, if not all, of the nighttime increase in mRNA could be accounted for as increased gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Although the <italic>nocturnin</italic> gene appears to encode a potentially important component of the circadian regulatory system in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> eye, its position within or downstream of the circadian clock mechanism has not been determined. In addition, its importance in mammalian circadian regulation and in systems outside of the eye has not been evaluated. Here we report that a mouse homologue of nocturnin is expressed in a circadian pattern in multiple tissues including retina, spleen, kidney, heart and liver. Widespread rhythmic expression of mouse <italic>nocturnin</italic> (<italic>mNoc</italic>) parallels the pattern seen for other clock-related genes in the mouse, indicating that nocturnin is broadly associated with other circadian regulatory components.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Homologues of <italic>Xenopus Nocturnin</italic></title><p>Blast analysis of public databases reveals a large number of coding sequences with significant similarity to <italic>Xenopus nocturnin</italic> (<italic>xNoc</italic>). As we originally reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], XNOC protein is similar to a large, C-terminal domain of the transcriptional regulator, CCR4, but appears to be lacking in several regulatory domains critical to CCR4 function. Recently, however, mouse and human cDNAs encoding homologues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) of the same domain of CCR4, but comparable in size to XNOC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] have been reported (Accession number # AAD56547 and AAD56548). Furthermore, availability of the complete genome of<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] has revealed a coding sequence (AAF54601.1) with significant similarity to XNOC. In addition to these, we have recently added a complete coding sequence of mouse nocturnin cDNA from retina (<italic>mNoc</italic>) along with partial coding sequences for human (<italic>hNoc</italic>), bovine (<italic>bNoc</italic>), rat (<italic>rNoc</italic>) and chicken (<italic>cNoc</italic>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of the conceptual amino acid sequences of nocturnin homologues</bold> from chicken (CNOC), cow (BNOC), rat, (RNOC), <italic>Xenopus</italic> (XNOC), mouse (MNOC), human (hNoc) and Drosophila (DNOC). Sequences were analyzed using the Clustal W Alignment procedure. Gaps indicated with dots are inserted to achieve optimum alignment. Dark gray and light gray highlights indicate amino acid identities and similarities respectively. The horizontal bar marks the position of the heptad leucine repeat in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and the asterisks indicate the position of the leucines. The positions of introns 1 and 2 based on the <italic>Xenopus</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] are indicated by arrows. Note that both mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and human (from data in public databases of the National Library of Medicine) appear to have a similar gene structure based on 3 exons. The XNOC sequence is from GenBank accession number U74761, HNOC is from NP036250.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and DNOC is from AAF54601.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Our complete <italic>mNoc</italic> cDNA from retina (accession number AF199491) has the same coding sequence as that reported earlier from liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The <italic>cNoc</italic> (AF199498), <italic>bNoc</italic> (AF199497), and <italic>rNoc</italic> (AF199495) partial sequences are from PCR amplified DNA segments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-1-9-1"/></fig><p>Among the sequences illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, NOCTURNIN shows a high level of conservation throughout its coding sequence. As aligned, xNoc is 66% and 65% identical to HNOC and MNOC respectively. The aa identity drops to 36% when compared to DNOC. Among the vertebrate species this conservation is particularly striking beginning at aa 67. This methionine (not aligned in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> sequence) corresponds to the fourth codon of <italic>Xenopus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and mouse exon II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]; the ATG at this site meets the Kozak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] consensus for translation initiation in all three species and represents a possible alternative site of translation initiation. In the region beginning at the start of exon II XNOC is 78% identical to HNOC. The short coding sequence of XNOC exon I (22 aa) aligns poorly with a longer amino terminal region in the other species. In addition to the high sequence similarity, <italic>Xenopus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] genes have a simple 3 exon structure with very similar boundaries of the second and third exons.</p><p>Previously, an unusual leucine zipper-like domain was identified in <italic>Xenopus</italic> nocturnin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The third leucine in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> sequence is either a tyrosine (mouse and rat) or a phenylalanine (human, cow and chicken) in other vertebrates (see bar in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Furthermore, the alanine in position 4 of the second heptad is replaced by a proline in all five species. The latter proline is adjacent to a conserved proline identified earlier in XNOC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These proline residues are not compatible with the coiled-coil structure charateristic of leucine zipper motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. However, conservation of this region of the protein suggests that it is functionally important, perhaps serving as a protein interaction domain as is the case for a leucine rich-region in CCR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]</p></sec><sec><title><italic>mNoc</italic> is Expressed in Multiple Tissues of the Mouse</title><p>The principal goal of this study was to analyze <italic>mNoc</italic> mRNA expression. We used C3H/He mice because they are useful for studying clock activity based on rhythmic release of melatonin; C3H/He is one of the few mouse strains that synthesizes melatonin rhythmically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In Northern analysis using single stranded probes generated from the <italic>mNoc</italic> 3' UTR or from exon II, we found that in contrast to our prior work in <italic>Xenopus, mNoc</italic> is expressed as a single mRNA of about 3 kb (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The only variations from this pattern was diffuse hybridization of the probe above the 3 kb position when gels contained higher levels of <italic>mNoc</italic> mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, liver and kidney; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> at ZT 12) and diffuse hybridization below the 3 kb band specifically in spleen (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>); the latter may reflect RNA degradation.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold><italic>mNoc</italic> mRNA is expressed in multiple tissues of the C3H/He mouse</bold>.

Peak expression occurs at the time of light offset (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). However, the amplitude of the rhythm is approximately 2 fold compared to the greater than 10 fold amplitude seen in <italic>Xenopus</italic> retina. Rhythmicity with a similar peak at ZT12 is also seen in heart (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), spleen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), kidney (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>), and liver (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The amplitudes of the rhythms in heart, spleen and kidney, as determined by phosphor imaging, reflect 2 to 5 fold changes between minimum and maximum. In contrast, the magnitude of the day-night difference in liver represents a nearly 30 fold change (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Although the overall pattern of rhythmicity is similar in these tissues, baseline expression during the day is evident in retina, heart, and spleen and in part accounts for the lower amplitude in these tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Rhythms of <italic>mNoc</italic> mRNA Abundance are Circadian in Nature</title><p>In order to investigate the endogenous rhythmicity of <italic>mNoc</italic> expression, C3H/He mice were maintained in constant darkness for 36 hours before sampling for rhythmic changes in DD.

Furthermore, liver tissue exhibits a high amplitude rhythm with virtually no mRNA detectable in the day-time as was the case in LD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The other four tissues all exhibit a higher level of daytime expression than in LD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Unlike other tissues, spleen RNA exhibits a diffuse zone of hybridization centered at 1.0-1.2 kb, which may reflect RNA degradation.</p><p><italic>mNoc</italic> mRNA appeared to reach higher levels at ZT12 in DD than LD in all tissues except retina (compare Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), suggesting that light may suppress <italic>mNoc</italic> mRNA level. This was particularly striking in liver where the ratio of mNoc/&#x003b2;-actin as determined by phosphorimaging was greater at ZT12 in DD than in LD (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). This difference appears to be significant in that it was reproducible in an independent replication of the experiment in which LD and DD samples were analyzed on the same blot.</p></sec><sec><title>C3H/He and 129SV Mice Lack a Transposable IAP Element in the <italic>Nocturnin</italic> Gene</title><p>Laboratory strains of mice are heterogeneous in the presence of a transposable intracisternal A-particle (IAP) element in the <italic>nocturnin/CCR4</italic> gene. During the course of our work on the mNoc cDNA it was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] that a transposable IAP of viral origin, present in about 1000 copies throughout the mouse genome, is found in the first intron of the <italic>mNoc/CCR4</italic> gene. In DBA/2, BALB/c, C57Bl/6 and C57Bl/10 mice, transcriptional read through from the IAP insert to the <italic>mNoc/CCR4</italic> open reading frame resulted in hybrid transcripts (3, 6 and 10 kb) whose abundance increased in aging mice. Apparently, insertion of the IAP element in the first intron occurred relatively recently because the insert was found to be lacking in some strains of mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. We confirmed the lack of an IAP element in 129/SV and C3H/He (the strain used in the rhythmic analysis above) mice through a combination of genomic PCR and partial sequencing of a genomic clone.

This was further confirmed for 129/SV mice by the lack of an IAP element in genomic sequence from this region as well (data not shown). Although the IAP element is absent in these two strains of mice, we confirmed the presence of the IAP sequence by PCR in BALB/c (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>) and C57/Bl6 (data not shown) mice as reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>C3H/He and 129/SV mice lack an intracisternal A-particle (IAP) insert in the first intron of the <italic>nocturnin/CCR4</italic> gene</bold>. <bold>A.</bold> Diagram showing the results of partial sequencing of a nocturnin genomic clone derived from a 129/SV bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library.

The lanes labeled 412D6 are control PCR reactions using the 129/SV BAC as template. Note that the absence of &#x02245; 5 Kb band for BALB/c mice with primers F1 and R1 is due to the inefficiency of Taq polymerase for large products; we have separately obtained the full IAP insert in BALB/c mice using a long PCR procedure.

Six week old BALB/c mice were kept in our animal facilities for two weeks and liver and kidney tissues were obtained for Northern analysis at 6 hour intervals through a light-dark cycle. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, mNoc in BALB/c mouse liver and kidney clearly exhibits rhythmicity similar to that seen in C3H/He mice with a prominent mRNA band at approximately 3 kb. Less abundant larger bands are also seen above 4 kb (liver and kidney) and 8 kb (liver only). Although larger mRNA bands have been reported to reflect hybrid transcripts including components of the IAP element in aging BALB/c mice, it is unclear whether this would explain the larger bands in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>. The bands in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> are smaller than the 6 and 10 kb bands reported in old mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and follow a rhythmic pattern similar to that of the 3 kb band.

In addition, partial cDNA sequences and database analysis reveals <italic>xNoc</italic> homologues in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, human, rat, cow, and chicken. <italic>xNoc</italic> was originally identified as the product of a differential display screen for circadian clock-regulated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] in the retina of the African clawed frog, a system known to exhibit circadian clock activity in an <italic>in vitro</italic> setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. High amplitude circadian regulation of the <italic>xNoc</italic> mRNA with peak abundance at night was found to be a defining feature of the gene. Nuclear run-on assays showed that the high amplitude circadian rhythm of <italic>xNoc</italic> was controlled at the level of gene transcription. Furthermore, <italic>xNoc</italic> was found to be expressed in photoreceptors, the site of a retinal circadian oscillator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. To further our understanding of <italic>nocturnin</italic>, we initiated analysis of mammalian homologues of <italic>xNoc</italic>.</p><p>The main features of the putative NOCTURNIN protein in <italic>Xenopus</italic> were a leucine repeat domain and a CCR4 homology domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]; both regions are evident in the other sequences. However, the unusual leucine-repeat domain, originally identified in XNOC, is not well conserved and exhibits significant deviations from the classic leucine zipper model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The principal changes are the substitution of either tyrosine or phenylalanine for leucine at the beginning of the third heptad repeat and the addition of a second proline adjacent to the first in the second heptad repeat. Both changes, although conserved in five different species, are deviations from the classical leucine zipper model. Proline residues, as pointed out previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] are expected to disrupt the coiled-coil structure of the protein. The conservation of this domain, including the prolines, suggests that it is a functionally important motif. Although its function is unknown, one possibility is that it serves as a protein interaction domain. For example, the leucine-rich domain in CCR4, mediates interaction with other proteins of the basal transcription apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>The other conserved structural feature of nocturnin is a domain with homology to the C-terminus of yeast CCR4, a factor required for the transcription of genes including ADH2 (the glucose repressible alcohol dehydrogenase II; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]). CCR4 is a multi-domain protein, substantially larger than nocturnin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]; its estimated molecular weight is 94.5 kDa compared to 43.9 kDa for XNOC. CCR4 is thought to interact with other proteins via a leucine rich domain in the middle of the molecule. It is of some interest that while XNOC, MNOC and HNOC all align with the C-terminal domain, alignment of the leucine zipper-like domain of XNOC with the leucine rich region of CCR4 is relatively poor. Furthermore, regulatory domains, such as the glucose repressed activation domain and glucose independent activation domain, found in the amino-terminal half of CCR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] are not present in NOCTURNIN. The fact that CCR4 has been characterized as a transcriptional co-activator has led to the speculation that nocturnin serves a similar function. However, the lack of key activation domains in nocturnin that are required for the function of CCR4 suggests that yeast CCR4 may not be the best model for delineating NOCTURNIN function. We believe that one of the keys to understanding NOCTURNIN function is to identify its putative binding partners.</p><p>xNoc was identified on the basis of its high amplitude circadian expression in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, in several additional <italic>Xenopus</italic> tissues we were unable to detect <italic>xNoc</italic> mRNA by Northern analysis. A major finding of this study is that <italic>mNoc</italic> mRNA is detected in most, if not all, tissues of the adult mouse. Furthermore, identification of ESTs derived from mouse and human embryonic cDNA libraries along with our Northern data on mouse embryo RNA indicate that mNoc is expressed early in development. Recently, early and ubiquitous expression of <italic>xNoc</italic> has also been detected during <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryogenesis (Green, unpublished). Furthermore, rhythmic increases of mRNA abundance that persists in constant darkness, have been seen in mouse retina, liver, kidney, heart and spleen. This provides evidence that the rhythmic changes in <italic>mNoc</italic> mRNA are controlled by one or more circadian oscillators. Although this study has emphasized retinal and non-neural tissues, Northern analysis has revealed <italic>mNoc</italic> mRNA in brain and pineal tissue. In addition, we have found (see below) that nocturnin is expressed in multiple brain regions including the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the site of the central circadian oscillator controlling behavioral rhythmicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>The widespread circadian expression of <italic>mNoc</italic> mRNA in multiple tissues of the mouse parallels that of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> central "clock gene", <italic>period</italic>, which was recently characterized in mammals. The <italic>period</italic> gene is rhythmically expressed in multiple tissues as well as in the central "clock" controlling behavior in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. At present we do not know if <italic>nocturnin</italic> plays a role as a central component of the circadian clock mechanism or as a "clock controlled" gene, perhaps coupling clock activity to an unidentified physiological rhythm. However, widespread expression and rhythmic regulation of <italic>mNoc</italic> argues against a limited role in rhythmic physiology of the retina or in the regulation of its melatonin output rhythm suggested by the earlier work on the <italic>Xenopus</italic> eye. It seems more likely that <italic>nocturnin</italic> is coupled to circadian function in a general way as either a central clock component or as a downstream effector.</p><p>During the course of our work on <italic>mNoc</italic>, it was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] that a transposable intracisternal A-particle (IAP) element of viral origin is found in the first intron of the mouse <italic>nocturnin/CCR4</italic> gene. Furthermore, it was reported that in DBA/2, BALB/c, C57Bl/6 and C57Bl/10 mice, transcriptional read through from the IAP transcriptional start site to the <italic>nocturnin/CCR4</italic> open reading frame resulted in hybrid mRNA transcripts whose abundance increased in parallel in aging mice. This report raised the immediate concern that disrupted <italic>mNoc</italic> transcription might modify its rhythmic expression pattern and function. However, insertion of the transposable IAP in the <italic>nocturnin/CCR4</italic> gene was apparently a recent event, occurring after the origin of modern mouse strains because some mouse strains lack the insert [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Our genomic sequencing and PCR experiments confirm this finding by demonstrating that the IAP element is present in Balb/c and C57/Bl6 mice but lacking in 129/SV and C3H/He mice. Thus, the rhythmic expression of <italic>mNoc</italic> as a single mRNA species in C3H/He mice appears to reflect the wildtype condition for this gene.</p><p>The IAP insert appears to strongly affect the expression of <italic>mNoc</italic> mRNA in aging mice. The multiple hybrid forms of <italic>mNoc</italic> mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] along with the recent report of an absence of rhythmic expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] of <italic>mNoc</italic> mRNA in mice containing the IAP element have raised the possibility that differences among mouse strains could provide a basis for understanding <italic>nocturnin</italic> function. It is well known that strains of inbred mice have different rhythmic phenotypes. Perhaps the best understood is the lack of the ability to produce melatonin in some strains such as BALB/c and C57Bl/6 and the production of normal rhythms of melatonin in others such as the C3H/He and CBA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Recently, we initiated studies directed at analysis of <italic>mNoc</italic> expression in BALB/c mice with the goal of determining if the IAP insertion has a direct consequence on rhythmic <italic>mNoc</italic> expression. Our analysis shows that the presence of the IAP element has no impact on <italic>mNoc</italic> expression or its rhythmicity in mice up to 8 weeks of age. Although it is possible that altered expression of the <italic>mNoc</italic> gene during the process of aging may affect the rhythmic phenotype, our data indicate that the IAP insert itself cannot be regarded as a specific insertional mutation with direct consequences on rhythmicity.</p><p>Although <italic>nocturnin</italic> was originally identified as a rhythmic gene product in photoreceptors, the most striking rhythmicity identified in the mouse is in the peripheral tissues such as liver and kidney. In parallel with the findings of this study we recently identified <italic>nocturnin</italic> as a rhythmic gene product in rat liver and kidney based gene array analysis of over 9000 rat Unigenes (Kita, et al., unpublished). Interestingly, in the latter study rNoc was identified among a group of clock-regulated genes that included <italic>Per1</italic>, <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Per3</italic>, <italic>Bmal1</italic>, and D-binding protein (<italic>DBP</italic>). Independent clock driven pathways may be critical in the function of many tissues and organs as suggested by the widespread expression of clock genes in peripheral tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Support for this conclusion comes from the recent finding that circadian oscillation of gene expression in the liver is entrained by food intake independently of the central oscillator in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. An understanding of the rhythmic function of nocturnin may come from analysis of its role in rhythmic physiology of the liver and kidney.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and tissue collection</title><p>C3H/He mice, wild type (+/+) at the rd locus, were originally obtained from Dr. Michael Menaker at University of Virginia and then maintained as a breeding colony in ventilated environmental compartments within a temperature-controlled animal facility (24 -25&#x000b0;C) on a 12 hour light:12 hour dark cycle (LD), except as noted.
