In anaemic animals, northern blotting showed that 15-LOX mRNA2 was predominantly expressed in non-erythroid tissues, whereas 15-LOX mRNA1 was exclusively expressed in red blood cells and bone marrow. The 15-LOX 3'-UTR2 mRNA2 contained a novel 8-fold repetitive CU-rich motif, 23 nt in length (DICE2). This motif is related but not identical to the 10-fold repetitive differentiation control element (DICE1) of 19 nt residing in the 15-LOX UTR1 mRNA1. DICE1 was shown to interact with human hnRNP proteins E1 and K, thereby inhibiting translation. From tissues expressing the long 15-LOX mRNA2, two to three unidentified polypeptides with molecular weights of 53-55 and 90-93 kDa which bound to DICE2 were isolated by RNA affinity chromatography. A 93 kDa protein from lung cytosol, which was selected by DICE2 binding, was able to suppress translational inhibition of 15-LOX mRNA2, but not of 15-LOX mRNA1, by hnRNP E1. A possible interaction between DICE1/DICE2 cis / trans factors in translational control of 15-LOX synthesis is discussed. Furthermore, the 3'-terminal part of the highly related rabbit leukocyte-type 12-LOX gene was analysed. Very similar repetitive CU-rich elements of the type DICE1 (20 repeats) and DICE2 (nine repeats) were found in the part corresponding to the 3'-UTR of the mRNA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
