Although FGD patients typically have normal mineralocorticoid secretion, subtle alterations in the renin&#x02013;angiotensin&#x02013;aldosterone axis have been reported in a subset of patients at presentation. Anecdotally, some patients with FGD have been initially diagnosed as having Addison's disease (AD), with implications for treatment and genetic counselling. Currently, mutations in three genes: the ACTH receptor (<italic>MC2R</italic>); the melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein (<italic>MRAP</italic>); and the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (<italic>STAR</italic>) are known to give rise to FGD types 1&#x02013;3. We investigated a cohort of autoantibody-negative AD patients for mutations in these genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Forty patients with known AD without evidence of autoimmune disease were screened for mutations in <italic>MC2R</italic>, <italic>MRAP</italic> and <italic>STAR</italic>. In addition, patients were genotyped for the <italic>MC2R</italic> promoter polymorphism previously associated with reduced responsiveness to ACTH.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>No mutations in <italic>MC2R</italic>, <italic>MRAP</italic> or <italic>STAR</italic> were identified in any patient. The frequencies of the <italic>MC2R</italic> promoter polymorphism were similar to those reported in healthy controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>FGD does not appear to be underdiagnosed in the AD population. However, in &#x0223c;50% of patients with FGD, no genetic cause has yet been identified and it is possible that the other, as yet unidentified, genes giving rise to FGD may be implicated in AD.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Medical Research Council</funding-source></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Primary adrenal failure is relatively rare with a prevalence of approximately five cases per 100&#x0200a;000 in Northern Europe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1 bib2">(1, 2)</xref>. The initial cases described by Addison in 1855 involved tuberculosis, adrenal malignancy and idiopathic adrenal fibrosis, which is now thought to be the first report of autoimmune adrenal disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">(3)</xref>. Currently, autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD) accounts for the majority of cases of primary adrenal failure in western countries (up to 94%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">(1)</xref>. AAD can occur either in conjunction with other autoimmune conditions (autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes), or in isolation. Isolated AAD with no other autoimmune clinical manifestations occurs in about 40% of cases, but positive autoantibodies have been shown to be present in up to 80% of these <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">(4)</xref>.</p><p>Primary adrenal insufficiency (or antibody-negative AD) covers a broad spectrum of pathologies including malignant, infectious and genetic causes. Genetic causes range from autosomal or X-linked recessive conditions such as familial ACTH resistance syndromes (familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD), Triple A), congenital adrenal hyperplasia and adrenoleukodystrophy to mitochondrial disorders such as Kearns-Sayres syndrome.</p><p>FGD (OMIM 202200) is an autosomal recessive condition characterised by ACTH resistance leading to isolated glucocorticoid deficiency with normal mineralocorticoid secretion. The syndrome was first described by Shepard <italic>et al</italic>. in 1959 in two siblings who had initially been diagnosed with AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">(5)</xref>. However, although patients with FGD have normal renin and aldosterone levels, subtle abnormalities of the renin&#x02013;angiotensin axis are sometimes seen in this condition at diagnosis, most notably with nonsense mutations of the ACTH receptor (<italic>MC2R</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6 bib7">(6, 7)</xref>. In contrast, the recently described <italic>MC2R</italic> knockout mouse model demonstrates classical adrenal failure with both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">(8)</xref>.</p><p>The first inactivating mutation of the <italic>MC2R</italic> (also known as the melanocortin type 2 receptor) in a patient with FGD was reported in 1993 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">(9)</xref>, and subsequently more than 30 mutations in the <italic>MC2R</italic> have been found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">(10)</xref>. In 2004, a polymorphism in the <italic>MC2R</italic> promoter at position 2 was described as having decreased response to ACTH both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in normal human subjects following i.v. ACTH infusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">(11)</xref>. More recently, mutations in a novel gene, the melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein (<italic>MRAP</italic>), which is involved in trafficking <italic>MC2R</italic> to the plasma membrane, have been described in FGD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">(12)</xref>. In 2009, Metherell <italic>et al</italic>. reported that a proportion of patients with FGD (5&#x02013;10%) have mutations in <italic>STAR</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">(13)</xref>. <italic>STAR</italic> mutations usually give rise to a severe form of adrenal insufficiency known as lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia (LCAH; OMIM 201701), leading to both mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid deficiency. Mutations in these three genes lead to FGD types 1, 2 and 3 respectively and account for just over 50% of all known clinical cases of FGD. Furthermore, there are reports of patients initially diagnosed with AD subsequently having their diagnosis refined to FGD, allowing them to omit their mineralocorticoid replacement therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">(5)</xref>. Of note, two families found to have <italic>STAR</italic> mutations leading to adrenal failure were initially diagnosed with non-AAD. Having noted that there appear to be certain mutations in <italic>MC2R</italic> and <italic>STAR</italic> causing adrenal failure with both mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid abnormalities, we investigated here the possibility that a subset of patients with isolated AD without evidence of autoimmune disease may have mutations in <italic>MC2R</italic>, <italic>MRAP</italic> or <italic>STAR</italic>. In addition, we screened the AD cohort for possible increased frequency of the <italic>MC2R</italic> promoter polymorphism associated with reduced responsiveness to ACTH.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Forty patients (17 males and 23 females) with isolated AD were identified from a previously described cohort of patients studied in the north-east of England <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">(14)</xref>. The mean age of diagnosis was 36.5 years (range 8&#x02013;79 years). All patients demonstrated a peak cortisol response of &#x0003c;550&#x0200a;nmol/l following a short synacthen test (250&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g synthetic ACTH administered i.m). All patients had a diagnosis of primary adrenal failure (secondary adrenal failure, infiltrative and infective causes were excluded). All patients with evidence of autoimmune disease or polyendocrinopathy (positive adrenal autoantibody screen by immunofluorescence or other organ system affected, e.g. thyroid dysfunction, vitiligo, type 1 diabetes mellitus and pernicious anaemia) were excluded. Patients with any family history of autoimmune disease were excluded. No patient had formal investigation of the renin&#x02013;angiotensin axis, although none were known to have maintained normal mineralocorticoid secretion. There was one familial case of AD in the cohort (mother diagnosed at the age of 28 years and her son diagnosed at the age of 8).</p></sec><sec><title>DNA extraction</title><p>Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood using the Nucleon BACC DNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK).</p></sec><sec><title>Sequencing</title><p><italic>MC2R</italic> has a single-coding exon.

The population studied was in Hardy&#x02013;Weinberg equilibrium.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>AD is a common cause of adrenal failure in adults. In our cohort of FGD patients and other reported patients with non-classical LCAH, there are several reports of family members diagnosed initially with Addison's disease or with late onset of symptoms of glucocorticoid deficiency who have subsequently been found to have mutations in <italic>MC2R</italic> or <italic>STAR</italic> with alterations in their renin&#x02013;angiotensin&#x02013;aldosterone axis. However, our results indicate that FGD is not being underdiagnosed within the wider AD population in the UK. Furthermore, there does not appear to be any significant increase in the <italic>MC2R</italic> promoter polymorphism consistent with reduced responsiveness to ACTH, consistent with other Caucasian populations previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11 bib16 bib17">(11, 16, 17)</xref>, although we accept that a detailed analysis of a local control population would be desirable. However, it may be that in other regions, mutation screening for FGD is not considered perhaps because of an atypical biochemical profile or resource considerations, and consequently such patients are being diagnosed as having antibody negative AD. Nevertheless, mutations in these genes account for only just over 50% of cases of FGD. It is known that there are several further loci involved in FGD and there is phenotypic variability in patients with FGD of unknown cause <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">(18)</xref>. It is possible that as yet unidentified gene(s) for FGD could account for familial cases of non-AAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Declaration of interest</title><p>There is no conflict of interest that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the research reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>R P Dias is a Clinical Research Fellow funded by the Medical Research Council.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kong</surname><given-names>MF</given-names></name><name><surname>Jeffcoate</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Eighty-six cases of Addison's disease</article-title><source>Clinical Endocrinology</source><volume>41</volume><year>1994</year><fpage>757</fpage><lpage>761</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7889611</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nerup</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Addison's disease &#x02013; clinical studies.
