The evolution of hybrid incompatibilities has been described in widely accepted models by Dobzhansky and Muller where lineage-specific functional divergence is the essential characteristic of hybrid incompatibility genes. Experimentally tractable models are required to identify and test candidate hybrid incompatibility genes. Several <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> genes involved in hybrid incompatibility have been identified but none has yet been shown to have functionally diverged in accordance with the Dobzhansky-Muller model. By introducing transgenic copies of the X-linked <italic>Hybrid male rescue (Hmr)</italic> gene into <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> from its sibling species <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. simulans</named-content> and <italic>D. mauritiana,</italic> we demonstrate that <italic>Hmr</italic> has functionally diverged to cause F1 hybrid incompatibility between these species. Consistent with the Dobzhansky-Muller model, we find that <italic>Hmr</italic> has diverged extensively in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> lineage, but we also find extensive divergence in the sibling-species lineage. Together, these findings implicate over 13&#x00025; of the amino acids encoded by <italic>Hmr</italic> as candidates for causing hybrid incompatibility. The exceptional level of divergence at <italic>Hmr</italic> cannot be explained by neutral processes because we use phylogenetic methods and population genetic analyses to show that the elevated amino-acid divergence in both lineages is due to positive selection in the distant past&#x02014;at least one million generations ago.

Hybrid incompatibilities (HIs) such as hybrid sterility and lethality are widely observed examples of reproductive isolation. The Dobzhansky-Muller (D-M) model explains how the genes causing deleterious phenotypes in hybrids can evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Dobzhansky1">Dobzhansky 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Muller1">Muller 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Turelli1">Turelli and Orr 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020142-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The model holds that HIs arise from the interaction between two or more genes that have evolved independently in two isolated populations; the deleterious phenotypes caused by these genes are a by-product of intraspecific divergence and will occur only when the genes interact in the interspecific hybrid. The essential criterion for defining HI genes, therefore, is that the alleles from the two species have distinct phenotypic properties in hybrids: for example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020142-g001">Figure 1</xref>A the derived allele <italic>A</italic> from one species causes the incompatibility while the ancestral allele <italic>a</italic> from the other species does not.</p><p>This model makes clear and testable genetic predictions, namely, that experimental manipulation of allele <italic>A</italic> (or <italic>X</italic>) but not allele <italic>a</italic> (or <italic>x</italic>) will affect the HI phenotype. For example, increasing the dosage or activity of allele <italic>A</italic> should decrease hybrid fitness, while identical manipulations of allele <italic>a</italic> should not. In contrast, downstream effector genes such as <italic>d1</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020142-g001">Figure 1</xref>A contribute to the phenotype of HI but are not expected to have functionally diverged alleles in the two hybridizing species; in other words, experimental manipulation of downstream effector alleles from either species will have equivalent effects on the HI phenotype. These alternative possibilities can only be addressed by genetically manipulating each species allele in a controlled hybrid background, but this has yet to be achieved in model organisms such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster.</italic></p><p>If the genetic changes that cause HI are rare, then genes that have undergone extensive divergence may be more likely to cause HI simply because there is more chance that they have experienced rare HI-causing mutations. But the D-M model itself offers no suggestions about the mode of evolution that leads to this divergence. One possibility is that HI genes accumulate genetic changes over time as they evolve neutrally. Alternatively, many models have suggested that speciation may be driven by molecules that are undergoing natural selection, for example, under the pressure of ecological divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Schluter1">Schluter 2001</xref>) or sexual selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Lande1">Lande 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Parker1">Parker and Partridge 1998</xref>). If genes associated with HI evolve under positive selection, one consequence is that they may be disproportionately X-linked, as positively selected, recessive X-chromosome alleles may go to fixation more quickly and therefore cause X-linked loci to evolve more rapidly relative to autosomal loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Charlesworth1">Charlesworth et al. 1987</xref>). This preferential X-linkage may contribute to Haldane's rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Haldane1">Haldane 1922</xref>), the observation that heterogametic (e.g., XY) hybrids suffer more incompatibilities than homogametic (XX) hybrids. A second consequence of selection is that HI genes may have unique phylogenetic and population genetic signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Wang1">Wang et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Ting2">Ting et al. 2000</xref>). Molecular evolutionary analyses of speciation genes are essential to address the role of selection in reproductive isolation and speciation.</p><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> can hybridize with three closely related species that we refer to collectively as its sibling species: <italic>D. simulans, D. mauritiana,</italic> and <italic>D. sechellia.</italic> Crosses between <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> females and sibling-species males result in invariantly lethal hybrid sons and temperature-dependent lethal hybrid daughters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Sturtevant1">Sturtevant 1920</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Lachaise1">Lachaise et al. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Barbash2">Barbash et al. 2000</xref>). The <italic>Hybrid male rescue (Hmr)</italic> gene has a major effect on the fitness of hybrids from this cross. This point is most strikingly demonstrated by the fact that <italic>D. melanogaster Hmr</italic> loss-of-function mutations such as <italic>Hmr<sup>1</sup></italic> suppress the lethality of both hybrid males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Hutter1">Hutter and Ashburner 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Barbash2">Barbash et al. 2000</xref>), as does the X-linked <italic>In(1)AB</italic> rescue mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Hutter2">Hutter et al. 1990</xref>). Increasing the dosage of the wild-type gene <italic>Hmr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> has the reciprocal property of decreasing hybrid viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Barbash2">Barbash et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Orr1">Orr and Irving 2000</xref>). These studies led to the proposal that HI is caused by an interaction between the X-linked <italic>D. melanogaster Hmr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> gene and an unknown autosomal gene(s) from the sibling species. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Barbash1">Barbash and colleagues (2003)</xref> recently cloned the <italic>Hmr</italic> gene, which encodes a predicted DNA-binding protein similar to the ADF and MYB family of transcriptional regulators, and proposed that <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> HI may be caused by transcriptional misregulation.</p><p>A limitation of previous genetic analyses of <italic>Hmr</italic> is that all genetic manipulations were done only with the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> allele. These studies therefore cannot determine whether <italic>Hmr</italic> is an HI gene as modeled by Dobzhansky and Muller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020142-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) or is instead a downstream effector gene that suppresses hybrid lethality because it interacts with or is regulated by the actual HI genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020142-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Similar uncertainties apply to the <italic>D. melanogaster Zhr</italic> and <italic>Nup96</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Sawamura1">Sawamura et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Presgraves1">Presgraves et al. 2003</xref>), which also affect F1 hybrid viability.</p><p>A preliminary analysis suggested that <italic>Hmr</italic> is highly diverged between <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and the sibling species, with almost 8&#x00025; divergence at nonsynonymous (amino-acid replacement) sites, a remarkable finding considering that <italic>Hmr</italic> encodes a predicted protein over 1,400 amino acids in length. Two other <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes that are involved in HI show elevated divergence that appears to have evolved under positive selection, but the divergence is confined to a small region of each gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Ting1">Ting et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Presgraves1">Presgraves et al. 2003</xref>) and <italic>Hmr</italic> is two times more diverged than either locus. These differences raise the question of whether the extensive divergence of <italic>Hmr</italic> may instead have evolved neutrally, or whether there are regional differences in selection and divergence at <italic>Hmr.</italic></p><p>In this study we use transgenic assays to test whether <italic>Hmr</italic> has functionally diverged between <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and its sibling species and thus fits the D-M model of HI evolution. We examine the functional consequences of this divergence and discuss models to determine which lineages and which codons have undergone functional divergence. We also test whether <italic>Hmr</italic> has evolved by positive selection and determine the number and locations of regions and codons that show particularly strong signals of adaptive evolution, asking whether the patterns of polymorphism at <italic>Hmr</italic> are consistent with ancient selection events.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Testing <italic>Hmr</italic> for Functional Divergence</title><p>In the absence of available <italic>Hmr</italic> mutations in the sibling species, we chose an alternative approach to test whether <italic>Hmr</italic> has functionally diverged by introducing cloned copies of <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. simulans</named-content> and <italic>D. mauritiana Hmr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> into <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020142-g002">Figure 2</xref>). It has been shown previously that increasing <italic>Hmr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> activity using <italic>P</italic>-element transgenes containing <italic>D. melanogaster Hmr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> suppresses the hybrid-rescuing activity of <italic>Hmr<sup>1</sup></italic> and <italic>In(1)AB</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Barbash3">Barbash et al. 2003</xref>). Those experiments can be interpreted as showing that the wild-type <italic>D. melanogaster Hmr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> kills hybrids, with the <italic>Hmr<sup>1</sup></italic> and <italic>In(1)AB</italic> mutations rescuing hybrids by reducing or eliminating <italic>Hmr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> activity. The transgenic copies of <italic>D. melanogaster Hmr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> thus suppress rescue by increasing <italic>Hmr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> activity in hybrids. We therefore asked whether or not sibling-species <italic>Hmr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> has the same activity. We reasoned that if <italic>Hmr</italic> is functionally diverged between the species, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020142-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, then transgenes containing sibling-species <italic>Hmr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> would not have the property of suppressing hybrid rescue. On the other hand, if <italic>Hmr</italic> is not functionally diverged, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020142-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, then these sibling-species constructs would have phenotypic properties similar to the <italic>D. melanogaster Hmr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> transgenes and suppress hybrid rescue.</p><p>To maximize the chances that the sibling-species transgenic lines would function normally, we made constructs that are similar to the largest <italic>D. melanogaster Hmr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> transgenic construct and that exceed the minimal <italic>Hmr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> region previously defined (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020142-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). We assayed two independent transformants each of <italic>D. simulans Hmr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> and <italic>D. mauritiana Hmr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> for suppression of hybrid male rescue by <italic>Hmr<sup>1</sup></italic> in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content>/<named-content content-type="genus-species">D. mauritiana</named-content> hybrids and by <italic>In(1)AB</italic> in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content>/<named-content content-type="genus-species">D. simulans</named-content> hybrids (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020142-t001">Table 1</xref>). In all cases hybrid males heterozygous for a sibling-species transgene were at least as viable as their brothers without the transgene. Some crosses showed an excess of transgene-carrying hybrids, which might suggest that the transgenes actually increase the effectiveness of hybrid rescue, perhaps by interfering with the pathway of <italic>Hmr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic>-dependent lethality. This possibility requires further investigation, but we note that such a hypothetical effect must be minor because the sibling-species <italic>Hmr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> transgenes by themselves do not rescue hybrid males. We also assayed the <italic>D. simulans Hmr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> transformants for suppression of <italic>In(1)AB</italic>-dependent rescue of hybrid female sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Barbash1">Barbash and Ashburner 2003</xref>).

In contrast, we found that the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> lineage and the lineage leading to the sibling species both exhibited elevated levels of nonsynonymous divergence relative to synonymous divergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020142-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

In contrast to the neutral expectation, we found that there is highly significant heterogeneity in the ratio of polymorphism to divergence across the five exons of <italic>Hmr</italic> (Hudson-Kreitman-Aguade test &#x0005b;HKA test; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Hudson1">Hudson et al. 1987</xref>&#x0005d;; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.025; 10,000 simulations performed). This significant variation across the locus can be further refined by examining the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous variation across the locus and is visually displayed for <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. simulans</named-content> using sliding window analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020142-g004">Figure 4</xref>. These plots reveal multiple regions that have very high <italic>D<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>D<sub>S</sub></italic> ratios and low <italic>&#x003c0;<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>&#x003c0;<sub>S</sub></italic> ratios, in other words, much more amino-acid divergence than polymorphism. These contrasting ratios do not suggest that regional variation in substitution rates among the two classes of sites is due solely to mutation (and drift) but rather suggest that selection is contributing to the divergence pattern across the gene. Although this sliding window plot is highly suggestive of selection, we wished to obtain independent and statistically supported evidence for regional selection. We therefore tested rates of divergence relative to polymorphism for each exon in a manner similar to the McDonald-Kreitman test (MK test) described in the previous section. The data were partitioned a priori using each exon as a unit (rather than picking an arbitrary window size). Given the size of the sampled region, there is considerable power to address regional variation. These MK tests for each exon revealed that the fourth and fifth exons of <italic>Hmr</italic> appear to contribute the most to the overall MK test (Fisher's Exact Test &#x0005b;FET&#x0005d; and Bonferroni correction; exon 4, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0004; exon 5, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.013). It is interesting to note that these regions are not homologous to any other proteins known in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> (or in any other species), including other MADF domain&#x02013;containing proteins. We conclude that multiple regions of <italic>Hmr</italic> show strong evidence for positive selection.</p><p>We also observed that the flanking regions of the <italic>Hmr</italic> locus appear to have evolved rapidly since <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and the sibling species diverged, relative to both synonymous coding sites and introns. The ratios of divergence to polymorphism between <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. simulans</named-content> for the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; flanking regions combined (including the UTRs) are significantly different from those of the coding and intron regions (3 &#x000d7; 2 FET; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020142-t003">Table 3</xref>), but this significant difference is not observed between <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. simulans</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. mauritiana</named-content> or <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. sechellia</named-content> (FET; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.543 and <italic>p &#x0003d;</italic> 0.783, respectively). These observations suggest that adaptive fixations have occurred at a number of noncoding sites.</p><p>We next asked whether we could refine the targets of selection to the level of individual codons and correlate such data with different models of HI evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020142-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Phylogenetic approaches similar to those used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020142-g003">Figure 3</xref> have been designed to detect recurrent positive selection at individual codons among species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Yang2">Yang and Nielsen 2002</xref>). We reasoned that the large amount of divergence at <italic>Hmr</italic> might offer a unique opportunity to apply these approaches to identify codons that exhibit positive selection and that could be contributing to HI. We identified 25 amino-acid positions that may have diverged due to selection, 20 of which fit possible models for the evolution of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content>&#x02013;sibling-species incompatibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020142-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Many of these codons map to regions with peak <italic>D<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>D<sub>S</sub></italic> values (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020142-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We conclude that multiple regions show evidence of positive selection and may have contributed to the functional divergence of <italic>Hmr</italic> between <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and its sibling species.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Selection Events Are Ancient</title><p>Loci directly involved in reproductive isolation may reflect the true species history of divergence more accurately than a &#x0201c;random&#x0201d; locus sampled from the genome, because these loci cease exchanging alleles among species earlier than other loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Wang1">Wang et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Ting2">Ting et al. 2000</xref>). Both reduced gene flow and adaptive fixations can remove shared ancient polymorphisms. <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. simulans</named-content> separated approximately 2 to 3 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Powell1">Powell 1997</xref>), and many shared polymorphisms have been lost due to drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Clark1">Clark 1997</xref>). However, shared polymorphisms are still observed in these genomes: among 15 loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Andolfatto2">Andolfatto and Przeworski 2000</xref>), we found that 5.2&#x00025; and 3.5&#x00025; of segregating sites in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. simulans</named-content>, respectively, are segregating at the same positions (among all classes of sites). Based on these values we expected to find approximately three to four shared polymorphic sites for <italic>Hmr</italic> among the 54 segregating sites in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and 94 segregating sites in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. simulans</named-content>, but instead found zero. Although the expectation of three to four shared polymorphisms is not a strong test, these findings are consistent with <italic>Hmr</italic> alleles not having been exchanged between these taxa since at or near the time of species divergence and/or with selection events having occurred throughout the <italic>Hmr</italic> gene and having removed recurrent mutations.</p><p>We have shown by several methods that the elevated rate of amino-acid divergence at <italic>Hmr</italic> is due to positive selection. These findings raise the critical question of whether selection events occurred recently or at the time of speciation. The number of years separating <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and the sibling-species lineage makes this a challenging task. We therefore concentrated on the more tractable problem of looking for evidence to exclude the possibility that <italic>Hmr</italic> divergence reflects the action of contemporary or recent selection. In other words, while it may not be possible to prove that selection occurred at <italic>Hmr</italic> at the time of speciation, it is nevertheless important to demonstrate that available data are, at the least, not inconsistent with more ancient selective events. Examination of the frequency spectrum of polymorphism within both <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. simulans</named-content> showed no evidence of recent sweeps, as the distribution of per-site heterozygosities did not differ from expectations of neutrality (Tajima's D is &#x02212;0.61 and 0.75, respectively, which is not significant). However, the power for detecting a selective sweep with this method is not high (75&#x00025;) even if the event occurred in the very recent past, and diminishes to 25&#x00025; as early as 0.8<italic>N</italic> generations ago (where <italic>N</italic>&#x0003d; population size) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Przeworski1">Przeworski 2002</xref>). Because we have prior knowledge from the analyses above that selection events occurred at <italic>Hmr,</italic> we reasoned that we could apply more powerful Bayesian approaches that use not only frequency spectrum information but other summary statistics of polymorphism and recombination to estimate the time at which these events happened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Przeworski2">Przeworski 2003</xref>). To estimate simultaneously the time and strength of selection events we conditioned on three summary statistics of the data: the polymorphism frequency spectrum (Tajima's D), the number of segregating sites, and the number of haplotypes. Prior distributions were chosen based on estimates of recombination, mutation rates, and effective population size. The most recent common ancestor for an <italic>X</italic>-linked locus is on average 3<italic>N</italic> generations ago. We determined that in <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> a recent selective sweep (within the last 0.25<italic>N</italic> generations) is clearly not consistent with the polymorphism data, whereas adaptive mutations occurring more than <italic>N</italic> generations ago are consistent with the polymorphism data, and selective sweeps more than 1.5<italic>N</italic> generations ago are possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020142-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Similarly, the marginal distribution of selection coefficients suggests that the strength of selection is inconsistent with small selection coefficients and recent selective sweeps (data not shown). Together, these results show that given our knowledge that selection has occurred at a large number of codons at <italic>Hmr,</italic> the last selection event occurred in the distant past. These procedures have been applied to infer selection events associated with human evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Przeworski2">Przeworski 2003</xref>) but have not previously been applied to HI loci. Estimating the time of fixation events is integral to determining whether selection events that are found at HI loci are consistent with the known time frame of speciation or might merely reflect ongoing contemporary selection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown here that transgenes carrying <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. simulans</named-content> or <italic>D. mauritiana Hmr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> have no effect on hybrid fitness, in contrast to the strong deleterious effects previously observed with <italic>D. melanogaster Hmr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>.</italic> These transgenic experiments demonstrate that <italic>Hmr</italic> has functionally diverged between <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and its sibling species and thus meets the experimental criteria defined by the D-M model. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of functional divergence for a <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> HI gene. Although transgenic technologies have limitations&#x02014;for example, genes with large and complex regulatory regions may not function correctly when transformed&#x02014;they have the clear advantage of providing unambiguous analyses of single genes. Transgenics was previously used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Winkler1">Winkler et al. 1994</xref>) to show that the <italic>Xmrk-2</italic> gene from the platyfish <named-content content-type="genus-species">Xiphophorus maculatus</named-content> causes HI (although for technical reasons it was assayed in the related fish <named-content content-type="genus-species">Oryzias latipes</named-content> rather than the actual hybridizing species <named-content content-type="genus-species">X. helleri</named-content> &#x0005b;Weis and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Weis1">Schartl 1998</xref>&#x0005d;). Functional divergence is inferred in this case because <italic>Xmrk-2</italic> (also called ONC-X<italic>mrk</italic>) is a gene duplication that is present in <named-content content-type="genus-species">X. maculatus</named-content> but appears to be absent from <named-content content-type="genus-species">X. helleri</named-content>). Functional divergence can also be inferred in other HI systems where multigene regions are transferred between species by repeated backcrossing. This approach has been used to show that <italic>Odysseus (Ods)</italic> has functionally diverged: X-chromosome introgressions from <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. mauritiana</named-content> into <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. simulans</named-content> that contain the <italic>D. mauritiana Ods</italic> region are sterile, while related introgressions that lack <italic>D. mauritiana Ods</italic> remain fertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Ting1">Ting et al. 1998</xref>).</p><p>Both <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Ods,</italic> as well as <italic>Nup96,</italic> which has recently been implicated in causing lethality in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content>/<named-content content-type="genus-species">D. simulans</named-content> male hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Presgraves1">Presgraves et al. 2003</xref>), show high rates of divergence for part <italic>(Ods</italic> and <italic>Nup96)</italic> or most <italic>(Hmr)</italic> of their coding regions. If generally true, this finding may reflect the fact that a high rate of substitution is required in order to generate a rare HI-causing mutation. Alternatively, it may be an indication that the combined effects of multiple substitutions are required to generate an HI allele. Our analysis of <italic>Hmr</italic> suggests two additional characteristics of HI genes. One is that while the D-M model requires divergence along only one lineage in order to generate HI, we have strong statistical support for accelerated divergence of <italic>Hmr</italic> along both lineages since <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and the sibling species split.</p><p>One consequence of this extensive divergence is that it becomes unexpectedly complicated to identify the divergent codons in <italic>Hmr</italic> that are candidates for causing the incompatibility. The simple model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020142-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, where HI is caused by the interaction of <italic>Hmr<sub>mel</sub></italic> and <italic>A<sub>sib</sub>,</italic> implies that any codons in <italic>Hmr<sub>mel</sub></italic> that have diverged from the ancestral allele could potentially be causing the incompatibility; these codons could also diverge in the sibling-species alleles as long as they remain different from the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> allele. There are 137 amino acids in <italic>Hmr</italic> (plus two sites of <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content>&#x02013;specific insertions) that fit these criteria. However, considering the extensive divergence we have detected at <italic>Hmr</italic> along both lineages, a more realistic model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020142-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, where both <italic>Hmr</italic> and gene <italic>A</italic> go through multiple changes in both <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and the sibling species. This model raises a possibility described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Muller1">Muller (1942)</xref>, namely, that a derived allele may become incompatible with an ancestral allele. For example, <italic>A<sub>sib</sub></italic> may become incompatible with <italic>Hmr<sub>anc</sub>,</italic> which means that <italic>Hmr<sub>mel</sub></italic> will also be incompatible if it retains the interacting residues present in <italic>Hmr<sub>anc</sub>.</italic> Since <italic>Hmr<sub>sib</sub></italic> must be compatible with <italic>A<sub>sib</sub>,</italic> the candidate codons are those where <italic>Hmr<sub>sib</sub></italic> differs from <italic>Hmr<sub>anc</sub></italic> and <italic>Hmr<sub>mel</sub>,</italic> and <italic>Hmr<sub>mel</sub></italic> remains identical to <italic>Hmr<sub>anc</sub>.</italic> There are 49 amino acids that fit this model, all of which are different from those identified in the previous model. Distinguishing between these models may be possible by using our transgene assays on <italic>Hmr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> constructs containing site-directed changes at candidate amino acids.</p><p>Divergence due to positive selection is a second striking characteristic of <italic>Hmr</italic> as well as <italic>Ods</italic> and <italic>Nup96.</italic> Adaptive fixations and reproductive isolation at <italic>Hmr</italic> have clearly shaped the pattern of polymorphism relative to divergence and swept away any shared polymorphisms that may have been present. This characteristic raises the general question of what forms of selection are responsible and whether genes involved in certain traits or phenotypes that are under strong directional selection may preferentially contribute to HI. In allopatric models, where speciation occurs between two populations in geographical isolation, HI between species is strictly a secondary consequence of divergence of HI genes that has occurred within each species. The target of selection must therefore be sought by looking at gene function within species. We do not yet know the function of <italic>Hmr; Hmr<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants are viable and fertile, but this allele is clearly hypomorphic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Barbash3">Barbash et al. 2003</xref>) and the null phenotype remains unknown. Because <italic>Hmr</italic> is expressed and causes HI in both sexes, however, it appears unlikely that it diverged under sexual selection. We do know that the pattern of variation in <italic>Hmr</italic> is not consistent with only weak selection events that have occurred recently. Rather, <italic>Hmr</italic> polymorphism is consistent with selective events occurring more than 0.5<italic>N</italic> generations ago and with a potentially large range of selection coefficients. Also unique to <italic>Hmr</italic> is that we have shown that it is likely to have been subject to multiple selective sweeps in both the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and sibling-species lineages and that the signal of positive selection comes from multiple sites and regions.</p><p>We have argued here that experimental demonstrations of functional divergence are required to prove that a gene is a bona fide HI locus. While man has undoubtedly been aware of the phenomenon of plant and animal HI for thousands of years, and hundreds of examples have been described in the scientific literature, identifying the genes involved has progressed rather slowly, with candidates generally being discovered by either genetic mapping or suppressor screens. As genomic sequences become available for species closely related to model organisms such as <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> we suggest that the characteristics of <italic>Hmr,</italic> including high levels of divergence due to positive selection, may provide an alternative means of identification, with comparative genomics being used to identify candidate HI genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Nomenclature</title><p>The subscripts <italic>mel, sib,</italic> and <italic>anc</italic> are used to designate genes from <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> its three sibling species, and their (hypothetical) ancestor, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4a2"><title>RT-PCR</title><p>RT-PCR was performed from total RNA as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020142-Barbash3">Barbash et al.
