To do this, the organism must invade and survive within both epithelial and endothelial cells. We have identified a facilitator of NTHi survival inside human cells, <underline>v</underline>irulence-<underline>a</underline>ssociated protein D (<italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi</italic></sub>, encoded by gene HI0450). Both <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>and a flanking gene, HI0451, exhibit the genetic and physical characteristics of a toxin/antitoxin (TA) locus, with VapD<sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>serving as the toxin moiety and HI0451 as the antitoxin. We propose the name VapX<sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>for the HI0451 antitoxin protein. Originally identified on plasmids, TA loci have been found on the chromosomes of a number of bacterial pathogens, and have been implicated in the control of translation during stressful conditions. Translation arrest would enhance survival within human cells and facilitate persistent or chronic mucosal infections.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Isogenic mutants in <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>were attenuated for survival inside human respiratory epithelial cells (NCI-H292) and human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC), the <italic>in vitro </italic>models of mucosal infection and the blood-brain barrier, respectively. Transcomplementation with a <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>allele restored wild-type NTHi survival within both cell lines. A PCR survey of 59 <italic>H. influenzae </italic>strains isolated from various anatomical sites determined the presence of a <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi</italic></sub>allele in 100% of strains. Two isoforms of the gene were identified in this population; one that was 91 residues in length, and another that was truncated to 45 amino acids due to an in-frame deletion. The truncated allele failed to transcomplement the NTHi <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>survival defect in HBMEC. Subunits of full-length VapD<sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>homodimerized, but subunits of the truncated protein did not. However, truncated protein subunits did interact with full-length subunits, and this interaction resulted in a dominant-negative phenotype. Although <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>does not contain a homologue of either <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>or <italic>vapX</italic><sub><italic>Hi</italic></sub>, overexpression of the VapD<sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>toxin <italic>in trans </italic>resulted in <italic>E. coli </italic>cell growth arrest. This arrest could be rescued by providing the VapX<sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>antitoxin on a compatible plasmid.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>and <italic>vapX</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>may constitute a <italic>H. influenzae </italic>TA locus that functions to enhance NTHi survival within human epithelial and endothelial cells.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Culturable <italic>Haemophilus influenzae </italic>are acquired in the nasopharynx shortly after birth, and are thought to persist throughout life. <italic>H. influenzae </italic>adheres to and penetrates into and between cultured human respiratory epithelial cells, a mechanism that may contribute to its persistence in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. <italic>H. influenzae </italic>can be found in the respiratory tracts of these patients even after they have undergone antibiotic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. As well, COPD sputum cultures can be sterile, while <italic>H. influenzae </italic>can still be isolated from the subepithelial matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Finally, we have found in a recent <italic>in vivo </italic>study that <italic>H. influenzae </italic>can persist in a human bronchiolar xenograft for at least three weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This suggests that the organism can survive and persist in protected biological compartment(s).</p><p>The ability of <italic>H. influenzae </italic>to survive antibiotic treatment and reappear when growth is favorable may be responsible for the reseeding of the middle ear observed in chronic otitis media. Often, middle ear fluid from children presenting with otitis media with effusion are sterile when cultured, but PCR analysis of the fluid has determined the presence of <italic>H. influenzae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Further, RT-PCR studies of this sterile fluid have shown the presence of bacterial mRNA, confirming that the bacteria are alive and persisting in a viable but nonreplicative state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Persistence was investigated <italic>in vitro </italic>using a NTHi strain that was susceptible to &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotics. This strain was allowed to invade a human respiratory epithelial cell monolayer for 24 hours, which was subsequently treated with a 4 hour incubation in 10 &#x000d7; MIC concentrations of the &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotics ampicillin, imipenem, cefuroxim, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, or cephalothin. The antibiotics killed all the extracellular bacteria, but none of the intra- or paracellular bacteria, suggesting that the organism was not replicating inside or between the epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Non-replicating bacteria are not susceptible to the cidal action of &#x003b2;-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics.</p><p>During a study aimed at identifying genes associated with virulence in pathogenic strains of the Gram-negative, strict anaerobe <italic>Dichelobacter nodosus</italic>, the causative agent of ovine footrot, Katz <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] reported the discovery of a novel area of the chromosome that hybridized to all virulent strains tested, but to only 23% of the avirulent strains studied. They designated the four genes found on this fragment as <italic>vapA</italic>-<italic>D</italic>, for <bold><italic>v</italic></bold>irulence-<bold><italic>a</italic></bold>ssociated <bold><italic>p</italic></bold>roteins. Homologues of these genes appear on the chromosomes and plasmids of a number of pathogenic microorganisms, including <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>, <italic>Helicobacter pylori, Reimerella anatipestifer </italic>and <italic>Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans</italic>. The chromosome of <italic>H. influenzae </italic>strain Rd KW20 (hereinafter referred to as strain Rd) contains <italic>vapA</italic>, <italic>vapBC</italic>, and <italic>vapD </italic>homologues, with one pair, <italic>vapBC</italic>, in duplicate. The genome organization of the <italic>vap </italic>genes in <italic>H. influenzae </italic>differs from that of <italic>D. nodosus</italic>, in that <italic>vapA</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>(HI1250) is preceded by a conserved hypothetical protein, HI1251, and both genes are likely transcribed as an operon. As well, <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>is flanked by a gene encoding another conserved hypothetical protein, HI0451 (which we have named <italic>vapX</italic><sub><italic>Hi</italic></sub>), again in an apparent operon configuration (8 nucleotides separate HI0450 and HI0451). To determine if the <italic>vap </italic>homologues played a role in the persistence of NTHi, we chose <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>(HI0450) for further study, since this protein was found in a proteomic survey to be expressed in the soluble fraction of strain Rd [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. VapD<sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>is 40% identical and 67% similar to the <italic>Dichelobacter </italic>VapD and belongs to the Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) 3309 and Pfam 04605, termed the "N-terminal conserved domain of VapD".</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Mutation of <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>results in attenuated survival in human endothelial cells</title><p>When the Rd <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>mutant strain was used to invade the <italic>in vitro </italic>model of the blood-brain barrier, human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) in 12-well plates, the amount of gentamicin-resistant bacteria recovered from the monolayer after three hours declined to approximately 60% of wild type levels, an average of 2.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3 </sup>CFU/ml for the wild-type strain Rd versus 1.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3 </sup>CFU/ml for the Rd <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>mutant (n = 3 (number of independent assays performed in at least duplicate); P &#x0003c; 0.05, Student's <italic>t </italic>test). No significant difference was observed between the wild type and <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>mutant in adherence to the human cell monolayers: the average number of cell-associated bacteria (both adherent and invaded) recovered for strain Rd was 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>CFU/ml and 1.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>CFU/ml for the Rd <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>mutant (n = 3; P &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>To determine if the phenotype of attenuated survival observed in the Rd <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>mutant was a general phenomenon and not restricted to strain Rd, another isogenic pair was constructed and analyzed using a different strain, R3001. R3001 is a bronchoalveolar lavage isolate from a pediatric cystic fibrosis patient, and is considered invasive since it came from a normally sterile site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The average number of gentamicin-resistant bacteria recovered from HBMEC monolayers was 1.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>CFU/ml for the parent strain R3001 versus 7.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>CFU/ml for the R3001 <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>mutant (n = 3; P &#x0003c; 0.05). Although the absolute numbers of bacteria recovered were higher with strain R3001 than with Rd (as is often observed with invasive isolates), the attenuation of survival inside the HBMEC monolayer of &#x02264; 60% observed in the strain with a <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>mutation was maintained. There was no significant difference between the wild-type R3001 and the R3001 <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>mutant in adherence to the monolayer: the average numbers of cell-associated bacteria recovered for strain R3001 were 1.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7 </sup>CFU/ml versus 1.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7 </sup>CFU/ml for R3001 <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>(n = 4; P &#x0003e; 0.05). Unlike Rd, strain R3001 carries the high molecular weight (HMW) adhesins, which may account for its more efficient adherence to the HBMEC monolayer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. No significant difference in the growth rates of either of the <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>mutants versus their cognate parent strains were observed, whether grown in bacteriological media (sBHI broth) or on HBMEC or NCI-H292 monolayers (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Mutation of <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>results in diminished long-term survival inside human respiratory epithelial cells</title><p>To determine if the <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>mutation would affect the ability of <italic>H. influenzae </italic>to survive inside human respiratory epithelial cells over a longer period of time, 18-hour invasion assays were performed using NCI-H292 cells. The number of gentamicin-resistant bacteria recovered from the NCI-H292 monolayer after 18 hours for the parent strain Rd was an average of 6.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>CFU/ml versus 3.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>CFU/ml for the Rd <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>mutant (n = 3; P &#x0003c; 0.05).

However, attempts to conjugate the mobilizable broad host range plasmid carrying the <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>locus, pDD564, into strain R3001 for transcomplementation studies failed repeatedly. This clinical isolate likely has a plasmid or an origin of replication of the same incompatibility group incorporated into its chromosome and therefore will not maintain the broad host range plasmid for transcomplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Reverse-transcriptase PCR of bacteria from human cell monolayers</title><p>To determine if the <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>locus was transcribed during contact with a human cell monolayer, total RNA was isolated from the wild-type strain Rd recovered after 18 hours on HBMEC or NCI-H292 monolayers and was used as the template for RT-PCR.

It was found that, in all cases, the gene had undergone a deletion event that had left the protein in frame, but missing 46 amino acids from the interior of the protein, resulting in a 45 amino acid protein rather than the full-length 91 amino acid protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This corresponds to the loss of Rd genome coordinates 473123 to 473263. In addition, all of the smaller alleles had an aspartate residue inserted at position #7 as compared to Rd, which has a leucine at that position. The significance of this is unclear, as the full-length R3001 <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>allele, which did transcomplement the Rd <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>mutant, also has an aspartic acid inserted at the same position, resulting in a 91 amino acid protein.

The <italic>in trans </italic>expression of a truncated <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>allele in the wild-type strain Rd resulted in a dominant-negative effect on survival within HBMEC monolayers.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>in <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>DH5&#x003b1; results in cell growth arrest</title><p>To test the hypothesis that VapD<sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>constituted the toxin, and that VapX<sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>encoded the antitoxin portion of a TA locus, both proteins were expressed in an <italic>E. coli </italic>background. <italic>E. coli </italic>does not contain a homologue of either protein. Initially, the <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>gene, HI0450, was cloned into the pTrcHisA vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). This resulted in <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>being under the control of the strong P<sub><italic>trc </italic></sub>promoter, which is repressed for the most part until induced by IPTG. This plasmid was designated pDD560. Both the vector control, DH5&#x003b1; (pTrcHisA), and DH5&#x003b1; (pDD560) were grown to mid-log phase in LB broth with 100 &#x003bc;g/ml ampicillin and aliquots were spread on LB agar plates with 100 &#x003bc;g/ml ampicillin and 0.1 mM IPTG. Strain DH5&#x003b1; (pTrcHisA) grew on the plates, but DH5&#x003b1; (pDD560) did not, indicating that induction and overexpression of <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>was toxic to <italic>E. coli</italic>. The putative antitoxin VapX<sub><italic>Hi</italic></sub>, was then cloned into the pTrcHisA vector. No growth disruption occurred in DH5&#x003b1; with the overexpression of VapX<sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>alone. The <italic>vapX</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>gene plus the <italic>lacI</italic><sup><italic>q </italic></sup>gene were then subcloned into the broad host range mobilizable plasmid, pDD515, resulting in pDD672. This strategy allowed the DH5&#x003b1; test strain to carry two compatible plasmids, one which encoded the <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>gene (pDD560) and the other expressing the <italic>vapX</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>antitoxin gene (pDD672). Both genes were under the control of a P<sub><italic>trc </italic></sub>promoter and were therefore both repressed until induced by IPTG. When both genes were induced with 0.1 mM IPTG on LB agar plates that contained 100 &#x003bc;g/ml ampicillin and 10 &#x003bc;g/ml chloramphenicol in strain DH5&#x003b1; (pDD560, pDD672), growth was restored. This indicated that the concurrent expression of the <italic>vapX</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>antitoxin with the <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>toxin ameliorated the cell growth arrest observed with expression of <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>alone, and that <italic>vapX</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>was necessary for this rescue.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Mutation of the <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>allele in strains Rd and R3001 resulted in attenuation of survival within both HBMEC and NCI-H292 monolayers, suggesting that in <italic>H. influenzae</italic>, the presence of a functional VapD<sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>facilitates persistence within epithelial and endothelial cells. Mutants invaded and survived in human cells at &#x02264; 60% of wild-type levels. Although relatively modest, this level of attenuation has been observed during the mutational analysis of other <italic>Haemophilus </italic>virulence factors, such as opacity-associated protein A as well as the high molecular weight (HMW) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. <italic>H. influenzae </italic>survival within human cells is multifactorial, and our data indicate that VapD<sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>contributes to this process. However, strain Rd contains three other <italic>vap </italic>genes (<italic>vapA</italic><sub><italic>Hi</italic></sub>, <italic>vapB</italic><sub><italic>Hi</italic></sub>, and <italic>vapC</italic><sub><italic>Hi</italic></sub>), and it is possible that these <italic>Haemophilus vap </italic>genes act synergistically, such that multiple mutations may result in a more attenuated survival phenotype. Indeed, a recent study has determined that a chromosomally-located homologue of the VapBC locus acts as a toxin-antitoxin module in the spirochete <italic>Leptospira interrogans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It would be interesting to characterize a <italic>Haemophilus </italic>strain with mutations in all the <italic>vap </italic>genes.</p><p>Neither of the <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>mutants displayed differences in adherence to the monolayers compared to the parent strain, so the defect occurred after binding and affected the organism's ability to persist inside or between cells. Interestingly, the <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>mutants were not attenuated in growth rate when compared to the parent strains, either in bacteriological media or on the surface of human cell monolayers. The observed survival attenuation of the mutants could be transcomplemented with a full-length allele from a clinical isolate, R3001, demonstrating that the phenotype was due to the mutation in <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>and not polar effects. A truncated allele from another clinical isolate, R2866, did not transcomplement the Rd <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>strain, indicating that the truncated protein was not functional <italic>in vivo</italic>. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the full-length <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>locus in Rd was transcribed during contact with both epithelial and endothelial cells. VapD<sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>has also been identified in the soluble fraction of strain Rd grown in bacteriological media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It remains to be seen if the transcription of this locus increases upon contact with human cells.</p><p>Results of a PCR survey on 59 randomly-chosen strains showed that nearly all of the genetically highly heterologous NTHi commensal isolates surveyed (93%) carried a full-length <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>allele on their chromosomes, suggesting that maintenance of a functional <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>gene was beneficial to survival in this niche (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Of the invasive strains isolated from the blood or cerebrospinal fluid, 71% retained a full-length allele. Fifty percent of the isolates from sputum, tracheal aspirates, and the middle ear carried the full-length allele. Finally, all the encapsulated strains tested contained a full-length allele. It must be noted, however, that this analysis was not an exhaustive study, since a limited number of strains were included. Many clinical NTHi strains have previously been shown to express various virulence factors that enhance adherence and invasion into human cells which are not found in the sequenced Rd strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The strains identified in this PCR study that lack a functional <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>allele probably compensate for its loss with genes that are not found in Rd, and these "extra genes" may well include other TA loci.</p><p>The calculated molecular mass of the VapD<sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>protein in Rd is approximately 10 kilodaltons, and small bacterial proteins often form multimers. Full-length VapD<sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>subunits exhibited strong homodimerization in a LexA-based protein-protein interaction system, and this may indicate that the subunits form higher-order multimers such as homotrimers or homotetramers <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, the protein encoded by the truncated allele did not homodimerize in the same system, further evidence of its loss of function. Interestingly, the truncated subunit did interact with full-length subunits in heterodimerization assays. Further evidence of this heterodimerization <italic>in vivo </italic>was that the expression of the truncated subunit in the wild-type strain resulted in a dominant-negative effect on survival within HBMEC monolayers, the levels of which mimicked the attenuation observed with the <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>mutation. This was likely due to truncated subunits forming hybrid complexes with full-length subunits and interfering with their structure and/or function, resulting in the observed dominant-negative phenotype.</p><p>The activities of only a few toxins encoded by TA loci have been elucidated thus far. Two specific targets of plasmid-encoded toxins have been identified: CcdB of the F plasmid and ParE of plasmid RK2 inhibit DNA gyrase, and Kid of plasmid R1 was previously thought to interact with DnaB helicase, but has recently been shown to cleave cellular mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The target and function of a toxin from a chromosomally-encoded TA locus (<italic>relBE</italic>) was determined to be cleavage of mRNA in the ribosomal A site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Strain Rd contains <italic>relBE </italic>homologues (HI0710 and HI0711) as well as a homologue of <italic>higA </italic>(<italic>h</italic>ost <italic>i</italic>nhibition of <italic>g</italic>rowth antidote protein) from plasmid Rts1. The <italic>higBA </italic>TA locus is unusual in that the toxin gene (<italic>higB</italic>) exists upstream of the antidote protein (<italic>higA</italic>). Interestingly, VapA<sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>of strain Rd is 29% identical and 53% similar to HigA.</p><p>While the data acquired in this study suggests that VapD<sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>and VapX<sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>form a toxin-antitoxin pair, it is unusual to find homologues of VapX<sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>only in <italic>H. influenzae </italic>and the gonococcal plasmid. <italic>H. influenzae </italic>strains R2846 and R2866 both have a truncated <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>toxin gene, and possess a <italic>vapX</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>which is 100% identical to that gene in strain Rd. Their respective genomes can be searched at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/genom_tree.cgi"/>. Interestingly, there are complete genome sequences available for two isolates of <italic>H. pylori, N. meningitidis </italic>and <italic>Haemophilus somnus</italic>, but only one strain of each has a homologue of <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi</italic></sub>. Thus, several features of the <italic>vapD</italic><sub><italic>Hi</italic></sub>/<italic>vapX</italic><sub><italic>Hi </italic></sub>gene pair are unusual for a toxin-antitoxin locus.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Persistence of NTHi is important in the progression of disease caused by this organism.
