Although these pathways have been thought to interact indirectly, the present study is the first to observe direct interactions between these pathways that involves the regulation of slug expression. Specifically we report that ligand-activated ER&#x003b1; suppressed slug expression directly by repression of transcription and that knockdown of ER&#x003b1; with RNA interference increased slug expression. More specifically, slug expression was down-regulated in ER&#x003b1;-negative MDA-MB-468 cells transfected with ER&#x003b1; after treatment with E2 (17&#x003b2;-oestradiol). The down-regulation of slug in the ER&#x003b1;-positive MCF-7 cell line was mediated by direct repression of slug transcription by the formation of a co-repressor complex involving ligand-activated ER&#x003b1; protein, HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1) and N-CoR (nuclear receptor co-repressor). This finding was confirmed by sequential ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) studies. In the MCF-7 cell line, slug expression normally was low. In addition, knockdown of ER&#x003b1; with RNA interference in this cell line increased slug expression. This effect could be partially reversed by treatment of the cells with E2. The efficacy of the effect of ER&#x003b1; on slug repression was dependent on the overall level of ER&#x003b1;. These observations confirmed that slug was an E2-responsive gene.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>oestrogen receptor &#x003b1; (ER&#x003b1;)</kwd><kwd>oestrogen receptor &#x003b1; co-regulator complex</kwd><kwd>real-time PCR</kwd><kwd>RNA interference</kwd><kwd>sequential ChIP analysis</kwd><kwd>slug</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>AF-1 (2), activation function domain 1 (2)</kwd><kwd>ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation</kwd><kwd>DCC-FBS, dextran-coated charcoal-treated FBS</kwd><kwd>DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium</kwd><kwd>E2, 17&#x003b2;-oestradiol</kwd><kwd>EMT, epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition</kwd><kwd>ER, oestrogen receptor</kwd><kwd>ERE, oestrogen-response element</kwd><kwd>FBS, foetal bovine serum</kwd><kwd>HDAC, histone deacetylase</kwd><kwd>HDACI, HDAC inhibitor</kwd><kwd>IKK&#x003b1;, inhibitor of NF-&#x003ba;B (nuclear factor &#x003ba;B) kinase &#x003b1;</kwd><kwd>miRNA, microRNA</kwd><kwd>N-CoR, nuclear receptor co-repressor</kwd><kwd>ORF, open reading frame</kwd><kwd>RNAi, RNA interference</kwd><kwd>SeqChIP, sequential ChIP</kwd><kwd>siRNA, small interfering RNA</kwd><kwd>slug (snai2), snail homologue 2</kwd><kwd>snai1, snail homologue 1</kwd><kwd>SRC-3, nuclear receptor co-activator</kwd><kwd>TBST, TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><ref-count count="22"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Two of the most common signalling pathways in breast cancer are the ER (oestrogen receptor) ligand activation pathway and the E-cadherin&#x02013;snai1&#x02013;slug [where snai1 is snail homologue 1 and slug (also known as snai2) is snail homologue 2]&#x000a0;EMT (epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition) pathway. ER&#x003b1; is a ligand-activated nuclear hormone receptor that regulates the transcription of oestrogen-responsive genes in diverse target cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. ER&#x003b1; and its main ligand, E2 (17&#x003b2;-oestradiol), play a critical role in many of the biological processes of normal cells located in the breast, reproductive tract, central nervous system, skeleton and immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Similarly ER&#x003b1; and its ligand regulate key pathways in ER&#x003b1;-positive human breast cancer. Two functional domains have been identified in ER&#x003b1;, the transcription activation function domain 1 (termed AF-1) in the N-terminus and domain 2 (termed AF-2) which binds ligand. The AF-1 domain is ligand-independent and constitutive, whereas the function of AF-2 is completely dependent on ligand binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. According to the classical model of ER action, in the absence of hormone, the receptor is sequestered in a multiprotein inactive complex in either the cytoplasm or nuclei of target cells. The binding of ligand induces an activating conformational change within the ER, promoting dimerization and high-affinity binding to specific EREs (oestrogen-response elements) located within the regulatory regions of target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These &#x02018;co-activator&#x02019; complexes enable the ER: (i) to respond appropriately to hormones or pharmacological ligands, (ii) to interpret extra- and intra-cellular signals, (iii) to catalyse the process of chromatin condensation, and (iv) to communicate with the general transcription apparatus at target gene promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The action of ligand-activated ER&#x003b1; is not limited to genes with EREs. Ligand-activated ER&#x003b1; can interact in an indirect manner with the regulatory regions of target genes lacking EREs. For example, ER&#x003b1;-mediated expression of the collagenase and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) genes is mediated through the interaction of ER&#x003b1; with Fos and Jun at AP-1 (activator protein 1)-binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In any case, ligand activation of ER&#x003b1; sets off a complex series of gene activations in the human breast cancer cell. The ER ligand activation pathway is one of the most important signalling pathways in human breast cancer that has been targeted therapeutically.</p><p>The E-cadherin&#x02013;snai1&#x02013;slug EMT pathway is another important pathway in human breast cancer progression thought to regulate tumour progression, invasion and metastasis of certain types of human breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The snail transcription family consisting of members snai1 and snai2 (slug) is thought to repress E-cadherin expression, leading to EMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Snail-induced EMT converts epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells with migratory properties that contribute to the formation of many tissues during embryonic development and to the acquisition of invasive properties in epithelial tumours. Snail-induced EMT is partly due to the direct repression of E-cadherin transcription both during development and tumour progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This pathway is also activated in malignant mesothelioma and other carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Although snail (snai1 and snai2) has been mostly studied in EMT, even when tumours do not exhibit classic EMT, up-regulated snai1 or snai2 (slug) may mediate invasion and metastasis. In squamous cell carcinomas of the oesophagus, tumours with positive slug expression, for example, invaded deeper, had more lymph node metastasis, and had more lymphatic invasion than tumours with negative slug expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Although the functions of slug during EMT, invasion and metastasis are being elucidated, comparatively little is known about slug regulation.</p><p>As the major signalling pathways in breast cancer continue to be characterized, it is important to identify interactions between these pathways so that they can be understood more fully. Because of the inverse correlation that we had observed recently (Y. Ye, Y. Xiao, W. Wang, K. Yearsley, J.-X. Gao and S. H. Barsky, unpublished work) between ER and slug expression in a number of different ER-positive and ER-negative human breast carcinoma cell lines, we wondered whether the two pathways, previously thought to interact indirectly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], might, in fact, interact directly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>Antibodies against ER&#x003b1; (D-12), HDAC (histone deacetylase) 3 (H-99), N-CoR (nuclear receptor co-repressor; H-303) and HDAC4 (H-92) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Based on these observations, it could be concluded that ER&#x003b1; was a bi-functional regulator for the expression of the slug gene, in that the unliganded ER&#x003b1; was an activator, whereas the E2-bound-ER&#x003b1; acted as a repressor, depending upon the specific clone studied. We wondered whether our observations might be more than just stochastic and related to the levels of ER&#x003b1; expressed by each clone. We measured the levels of ER&#x003b1; protein by Western blot analysis in the different clones and investigated whether the effects of unliganded ER&#x003b1; were activating and whether the effects of E2-bound-ER&#x003b1; were repressing based on the levels of ER&#x003b1;. What we observed was very interesting. In clones 4 and 23 ER&#x003b1; was expressed at very high levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D), and it was in these two clones that E2-bound-ER&#x003b1; repression of slug was far greater and statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) than the activating effects of unliganded ER which were not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). In clones 2 and 17 where ER&#x003b1; expression was much lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D), the activating effects of unliganded ER were greater than the repression effects of E2-bound ER&#x003b1;, but both were statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01 and <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). A similar pattern of activation versus repression was exhibited by the remaining clones depending on their relative levels of ER&#x003b1;. Our results in these stable-transfection experiments with respect to slug repression confirmed the results of our transient-transfection experiments. Collectively the transfection experiments indicated that E2 resulted in down-regulation of slug in transfected MDA-MB-468 cells overexpressing ER&#x003b1;, with the most dramatic effects observed in those clones with the highest levels of ER&#x003b1;. In other words, slug is an E2-responsive gene when ER&#x003b1; is overexpressed, and the amount of E2-induced slug repression directly relates to the levels of ER&#x003b1;.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The expression of slug in response to stimulation by E2 in transfected MDA-MB-468 cells overexpressing ER&#x003b1;</title><p>The recombinant vector pcDNA6.2/V5-ER&#x003b1; (pcDNA-ER&#x003b1;) containing ER&#x003b1; ORF or empty vector pcDNA6.2/V5 (pcDNA) was transfected into MDA-MB-468 cells using Lipofectamine&#x02122; 2000.

In addition to examining the effects of ER&#x003b1; overexpression as noted previously, we decided to knockdown ER&#x003b1; in a naturally ER&#x003b1;-expressing line, e.g. MCF-7, in order to monitor the effects on endogenous slug expression, a situation perhaps more physiologically relevant than the situation of overexpression. To investigate the effect of ER&#x003b1; knockdown on the expression of slug, ER&#x003b1; miRNA was transfected into parental MCF-7 cells and stable clones were selected with blasticidin. A total of 38 clones were selected and analysed for ER&#x003b1; mRNA levels by real-time PCR. We observed that ER&#x003b1; expression was significantly reduced to different levels in various clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). These clones also showed significant increases in slug mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). We then treated selected clones with E2 (clones 19 and 20). The ER&#x003b1; level of clone 19 by real-time PCR was higher than in clone 20, but when treated with E2 slug expression was decreased more in clone 19 than in clone 20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). This suggested the possibility that E2 caused a stronger response in clone 19 because clone 19 had greater residual ER&#x003b1;. Another possibility was the existence of an E2&#x02013;ER&#x003b1;-independent mechanism. To resolve these possibilities we needed to examine the levels of ER&#x003b1; protein expression in the different clones and we needed to carry out more effective ER&#x003b1; knockdown. The levels of ER&#x003b1; in the different clones by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C) generally correlated with the mRNA levels by real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). To determine further whether the effects on repression of slug expression by E2 were mediated by residual levels of ER&#x003b1;, which was our hypothesis, or ER&#x003b1;-independent mechanisms, which was another possibility, we carried out siRNA transient ER&#x003b1; knockdown and were able to achieve a more significant and near total knockdown of ER&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). With the subsequent addition of E2, we did not observe any repression of slug expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). Therefore we concluded that the effects on slug repression were indeed mediated by ER&#x003b1;. Therefore slug was also an E2-responsive gene when ER&#x003b1; was knocked down, and the amount of E2-induced slug repression was again related to the residual levels of ER&#x003b1; remaining.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Knockdown of ER&#x003b1; leading to the up-regulation of slug</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MCF-7 cells were transfected with plasmid pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR-ER&#x003b1; that contained ER&#x003b1; miRNA or negative-control plasmid pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-Neg ER&#x003b1;.

Two of the most common signalling pathways in breast cancer are the ER&#x003b1; ligand activation pathway and the E-cadherin&#x02013;snai1&#x02013;slug&#x000a0;EMT pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Although these pathways have been shown to interact indirectly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], the present study is the first to observe direct interactions between these pathways characterized by the suppression of slug expression by ligand-activated ER&#x003b1;. More specifically, ligand-activated ER&#x003b1; suppressed expression of slug by direct repression of transcription. Although the prevailing belief is that agonist-liganded ER&#x003b1; is usually associated with gene activation, and that the recruitment of gene repression components such as HDAC1 by ER&#x003b1; to target gene promoters occurs only when ER&#x003b1; is liganded with antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], in the present study we show the opposite: that ligand-activated ER&#x003b1; with HDAC1 suppresses slug expression.</p><p>Although there have been numerous studies that have addressed the ER&#x003b1; ligand activation pathway and the E-cadherin snai1 slug EMT pathway, very few studies have addressed their interactions. Although it had been noted that ER&#x003b1; can repress the expression of snai1 through the activation of MTA3 (metastasis-associated 1 family, member 3) that selectively targets snai1, but not slug, direct effects on either snai1 or slug transcription were not found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In the present study we found direct effects of ER&#x003b1; on slug transcription.</p><p>Our laboratory had been studying E-cadherin expression in a series of ER&#x003b1;-positive and ER&#x003b1;-negative human breast cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] when we observed by expression profiling that many ER&#x003b1;-negative lines which were also E-cadherin-negative (e.g. MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231) exhibited high slug expression. Conversely, in many ER&#x003b1;-positive lines which were also E-cadherin positive, we observed that slug expression was low or absent. These initial observations suggested that the ligand-activated ER&#x003b1; might regulate slug expression and thereby interact with the E-cadherin snai1 slug EMT signalling pathway. For this reason we decided to investigate this interaction more fully. In the present study, we addressed one mechanism by which ER&#x003b1; controlled the expression of slug. This mechanism was that ligand-activated ER&#x003b1; suppressed slug transcription through direct association with the slug promoter, where ER&#x003b1; interacted with recruited co-regulators. Therefore slug was an ER&#x003b1;-responsive gene.</p><p>Human breast cancers which lack ligand-activated ER&#x003b1; may then overexpress slug, which may down-regulate E-cadherin and lead to EMT. EMT is thought to be a cause of biological aggressiveness, invasion and metastasis. Breast cancers, on the other hand, which possess ligand-activated ER&#x003b1; may express low or absent levels of slug, increased E-cadherin, decreased EMT and less aggressive behaviour. No model is universal and there are certainly ER&#x003b1;-positive breast cancers such as infiltrating lobular cancer which strongly express ER&#x003b1; but are negative for E-cadherin and manifest EMT. Conversely there are ER&#x003b1;-negative breast cancers, such as inflammatory breast cancer, that are strongly E-cadherin positive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We have observed in these latter cancers overexpression of snai1 and slug, and believe that the basis of E-cadherin overexpression in inflammatory breast cancer is related to altered E-cadherin trafficking, increased rates of accumulation and lack of degradation, rather than transcriptional regulation (Y. Ye, W. Wang, K. Yearsley, J.-X. Gao and S. H. Barsky, unpublished work).</p><p>The present studies show that E2 treatment resulted in down-regulation of slug in transfected MDA-MB-468 clones expressing full-length ER&#x003b1;. In addition to examining the effects of ER&#x003b1; overexpression, our studies examined the effects of ER&#x003b1; gene knockdown in a naturally expressing ER&#x003b1; line, e.g. MCF-7, in order to monitor the effects on endogenous slug expression. The result of ER&#x003b1; knockdown was a significant increase in slug mRNA levels even though the effect could be partially reversed by treatment of the cells with E2, based on our hypothesis that there was still significant residual ER&#x003b1;. To support this hypothesis further, near-complete knockdown was achieved with siRNA and the effect of E2 on slug repression was completely abolished. The overexpression and knockdown studies of ER&#x003b1; in tandem reveal that the efficacy of the effect of ER&#x003b1; on slug repression was dependent on the overall level of ER&#x003b1;. These observations confirmed that slug indeed was an E2-responsive gene.</p><p>Our findings indicated that ligand-activated ER&#x003b1; forms, together with HDAC1 and N-CoR, a transcriptional inhibitory complex which probably binds to the slug promoter in a region containing half-site EREs. Because we did not know which of these half ERE sites might be the location of the binding of the transcription inhibitory complex, we chose a promoter region flanked by these sites that would probably be precipitated in the ChIP analyses if any of these half ERE sites were involved. Our findings still do not indicate the precise location of the binding of the complex or whether more than one half ERE site is involved. Our findings with SeqChIP do confirm that E2&#x000a0;ER&#x003b1;, HDAC1 and N-CoR together form an inhibitory complex and that HDAC1 and N-CoR do not independently associate with the slug promoter.</p><p>It has been demonstrated previously that the recruitment of co-regulatory proteins to ER&#x003b1; is required for ER&#x003b1;-mediated transcriptional and biological activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and that these co-regulatory proteins may include HDACs, N-CoR, SRC-3 and IKK&#x003b1;. In the case of slug, however, these co-regulatory proteins specifically included HDAC1 and N-CoR, but not other HDACs or SRC-3 or IKK&#x003b1;. Predictably, an HDACI increased slug expression. Although HDACIs are thought to have global effects on gene expression and therefore could have increased slug expression by other indirect or secondary mechanisms, the finding that E2 increased the HDAC1, but not other HDACs that were immunoprecipitated from the same region of the slug promoter (&#x02212;456 to &#x02212;68) where ligand-activated ER&#x003b1; was immunoprecipitated, indicated that ER&#x003b1; was probably the target for HDACI-alleviated slug gene expression. This finding further confirmed that ligand-activated ER&#x003b1; suppressed slug expression by transcriptional repression and that the ER ligand activation pathway interacts with the E-cadherin&#x02013;snai1&#x02013;slug EMT pathways directly by repressing slug.</p></sec><sec sec-type="funding"><title>FUNDING</title><p>This work was supported by the Department of Defense (U.S. Army) Breast Cancer Research Programme Grant W81XWH-06-1-0631, the Strategic Initiative Grant Programme at Ohio State University and The Donald A.
