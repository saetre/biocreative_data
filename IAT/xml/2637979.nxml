Activation of PKR during viral infection culminates in phosphorylation of the &#x003b1; subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2&#x003b1;) to inhibit protein translation. A broad range of regulatory functions has also been attributed to PKR. However, as few additional PKR substrates have been identified, the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, PKR is shown to interact with an essential RNA helicase, RHA. Moreover, RHA is identified as a substrate for PKR, with phosphorylation perturbing the association of the helicase with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Through this mechanism, PKR can modulate transcription, as revealed by its ability to prevent the capacity of RHA to catalyze transactivating response (TAR)&#x02013;mediated type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) gene regulation. Consequently, HIV-1 virions packaged in cells also expressing the decoy RHA peptides subsequently had enhanced infectivity. The data demonstrate interplay between key components of dsRNA metabolism, both connecting RHA to an important component of innate immunity and delineating an unanticipated role for PKR in RNA metabolism.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Our manuscript explores the immune response to viral infection by investigating events triggered by the protein kinase PKR. This sentinel kinase is constitutively expressed in all cells as an inactive protein that is subsequently activated by viral RNA produced during an infection. The active kinase perturbs viral replication by phosphorylating protein substrates in the cell. In this manuscript we identify a novel substrate for PKR, an essential helicase, RHA. Viruses usurp this helicase to replicate their own genome. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of RHA by PKR perturbs the ability of the helicase to bind viral RNA. Correspondingly, PKR prevents the capacity of RHA to enhance expression of genetic elements encoded by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Juxtaposed to this, HIV virions packaged within cells that also express protein fragments of RHA, demonstrated to interact with PKR as decoy substrates, have enhanced infectivity. These fragments of RHA occur within a protein domain previously established to bind RNA but increasingly recognized to mediate protein&#x02013;protein interactions. This supports an emerging role for these protein domains to coordinate the cell's response to pathogen-associated RNA. The findings identify a new cell-signaling pathway important in the response to viral infection.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The primary detection of viral infection is by the host innate immune system, with the recognition of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) a crucial early function. Responses to dsRNA are mediated by several protein receptors that recognize this pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). Most important of these receptors are the Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR3), two caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing helicases, retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and the related IFN inducible helicase-I (IFIH-I), and the protein kinase R (PKR). These dsRNA receptors are spatially separated within the cell to respond to either intra- or extra-cellular dsRNA. Moreover, the outcome of the ensuing antiviral response triggered by each receptor differs between cell compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000311-Kato1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, a full contingent of pattern recognition receptors is required for immune competence. TLR3 is located on the cell surface or in the endosome compartment, and upon sensing dsRNA recruits the cytoplasmic adaptor Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN&#x003b2; (TRIF), via shared TIR homologous regions to mediate antiviral responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000311-Hoebe1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000311-Yamamoto1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Adaptor signaling leads to IFN regulatory factor (IRF)3 and IRF7 activation and type-I IFN production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000311-Fitzgerald1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000311-Yamamoto2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. RIG-I and IFIH-I are cytoplasmic receptors which sense dsRNA and subsequently transmit a signal via helicase and CARD domains, respectfully. Activated RIG-I/IFIH-I associate with a mitochondrial anchored CARD adaptor, IPS-1 (also called MAVS, Cardif, or VISA), to activate NF&#x003ba;B and IRF3 and induce IFN&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000311-Kawai1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000311-Xu1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, dsRNA-binding at the amino terminus of PKR activates the kinase, resulting in the phosphorylation of the &#x003b1; subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2&#x003b1;) and inhibition of protein translation within infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000311-Farrell1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, PKR evokes cellular responses by modulating cell-signaling pathways. The mechanisms by which PKR functions as a signaling molecule have not been fully delineated. However, PKR has been shown to mediate the responses to other PAMPs, including bacterial LPS, as well as stress stimuli such as IFN&#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1;, mitomycin C, and serum deprivation by inducing degradation of inhibitor &#x003ba;B (I&#x003ba;B), IRF1 expression, indirectly mediating STAT1 phosphorylation, and triggering apoptotic pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000311-Gil1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000311-Williams1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. These broad responses are not reconciled with a narrow mechanism involving translational control through eIF2&#x003b1;. However, few other PKR substrates are known that account for these cellular responses.</p><p>PKR has two domains, a C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain. The N-terminus encodes tandem RNA-binding motifs (RBMs). The RBMs not only recognize dsRNA to activate PKR, but also serve as an autoinhibitory domain, as well as mediating dimerization to form the fully active kinase molecule. These observations suggest an additional function for RBMs as protein&#x02013;protein interaction domains. Support for this comes from other proteins identified to interact with PKR. The protein activator of PKR (PACT) encodes three RBMs, and the structurally similar transactivating response (TAR)-RNA binding protein (TARBP) interacts with PKR to, conversely, inhibit the kinase. That RBMs might mediate interactions between proteins, particularly other RBMs, highlights an emerging concept that has consequence for coordinating the dsRNA response in cells. In this way the RBM might be considered as a signaling domain, analogous to the TIR domain of TLRs or the CARD domain of RIG-I and IFIH-I to mediate homo- or heterotypic protein interactions.</p><p>Here, we identify an interaction between PKR and another protein encoding RBMs, the RNA helicase A (RHA). RHA is an essential DEAH-box protein that exhibits both RNA and DNA helicase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000311-Zhang1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The association is demonstrated to be via the helicase RBMs. Importantly, biochemical analysis shows RHA is a substrate for PKR, and demonstrates that phosphorylation modulates the helicase association with its nucleic acid substrate. The consequences of these observations are examined in relation to RHA's previously established role in retroviral infection. PKR is shown to mediate transcriptional activity and HIV-1 infectivity via phosphorylation of RHA. These findings identify a novel function for PKR, delineating a new cell signaling pathway to target in anti-HIV-1 therapy, and highlighting a process by which proteins that respond to dsRNA may be coordinated.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>PKR Associates with RHA In Vivo</title><p>To detect proteins interacting with PKR, the kinase was immunoprecipitated from isogenic, <italic>pkr</italic>-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) either silenced or expressing human PKR from the native promoter elements at physiologic levels.

Six different glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion constructs, together spanning the full helicase, were used in a GST-pull down experiment to determine which region of RHA associated with PKR. This experiment showed PKR associated exclusively with the first 263 amino acids of RHA that encodes its two RBMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000311-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Since the first RBM, encoded between amino acids 1 to 79, did not associate with PKR, it appears that the second RBM is the interacting region, or both RBMs are required. Efforts to map the region of PKR that interacts with RHA were inconclusive. Binding assays with the isolated RBM or kinase domains of PKR showed the N-terminal RBMs interacted specifically with RHA. However, the truncated C-terminus of PKR bound non-specifically to the control (beads only) in the assay conditions. Subsequent analysis suggests the RBM of RHA interacts with both C- and N-terminal domains of PKR (see below).</p><fig id="ppat-1000311-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000311.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Activated PKR directly associates with the N-terminus of RHA.</title><p>(A) An autoradiograph of <sup>35</sup>S-labeled PKR, pulled down with GSTRHA fusion proteins and GST alone.

This implies that the PKR-RHA interaction is direct and not through mutual association with dsRNA. Moreover, it has been established that PKR dissociates from dsRNA upon activation, autophosphorylation and dimerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000311-Gabel1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, an indirect association between PKR and RHA, bridged by dsRNA, is unlikely. However, to unequivocally establish that the two proteins interact directly, several experiments were conducted.</p><p>First the ability of a 16 bp dsRNA molecule to block the association between in vitro synthesized PKR and the N-terminal 263 amino acid GST-fusion construct of RHA was measured. This short dsRNA, although able to bind to a single RBM, is not long enough to interact with two RBMs from separate proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000311-Ryter1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000311-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) showed that the 16 bp dsRNA did not perturb the association between PKR and RHA, even when present at considerable molar excess. Next, alternative cell treatments that did not use pIC to activate PKR were evaluated and coimmunoprecipitations performed. Accordingly, treatment of the human monocytic cell line, THP-1, with LPS, demonstrated to activate PKR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000311-Hsu1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, induces the association between the kinase and RHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000311-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Finally, triggering of PKR with its protein activator PACT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000311-Ito1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> effected association between PKR and RHA. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with expression constructs for RHA and wild-type PACT or a mutant (&#x00394;PACT) that does not activate PKR and treated with actinomycin-D to stimulate PACT, then PKR was immunoprecipitated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000311-g002">Figure 2D</xref> shows the wild-type and not the mutant PACT increased the association between PKR and the helicase. Together these data demonstrate that PKR interacts directly with the N-terminal region of RHA, and that this interaction is dependent upon activation of the kinase.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>RHA Is a Substrate for PKR</title><p>To investigate the possible consequences of this interaction, we tested whether RHA is a substrate for PKR-mediated phosphorylation. An in vitro kinase assay was performed with proteins coimmunoprecipitated from MEFs using a monoclonal antibody against PKR. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000311-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) show RHA bound to PKR at physiological ratios was phosphorylated by the associated PKR in a subsequent kinase assay. To measure phosphorylation in vivo RHA was directly immunoprecipitated with antibodies to RHA, or coimmunoprecipitated with an anti-PKR antibody from HeLa cells treated with pIC. The resulting immune complexes were probed by western blot for phosphorylated residues using anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphothreonine antibodies. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000311-g003">Figure 3B</xref> shows only the RHA in complex with PKR had detectable phosphorylated serine and threonine residues. Detection of phosphorylated RHA specifically associated with the kinase, strongly suggesting direct phosphorylation of RHA by PKR. The antibody used to immunoprecipitate RHA in this experiment (ab2627 from Abcam) was raised against a synthetic peptide derived from within residues 100 to 200 of human RHA. This is within the region of RHA demonstrated to associate with PKR (between residues 80 to 263, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000311-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). As this antibody and PKR interacts with the same region of RHA mutual association is excluded. Consequently, PKR is not coimmunoprecipitated with this anti-RHA antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000311-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

The requirement for kinase activity for PKR control of RHA-mediated LTR expression was assessed by comparing the relative affect of wild-type PKR, and two mutant PKR proteins either; catalytically active but modified to preclude eIF2&#x003b1; regulation by substitution of the threonine residue to an alanine at position 487 (T487A) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000311-Dey1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, or a kinase dead construct modified by substitution of a lysine residue to a arginine at position 296 (K296R). Expression of wild-type PKR reduced RHA-dependent transcription of the LTR-EGFP reporter. Conversely, expression of the catalytically inactive PKR-K296R promotes RHA-dependent transcription of the reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000311-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). This construct (K296R) dimerizes with endogenous PKR, so acts as a dominant negative to directly inhibit PKR's regulation of RHA as well as general protein translation, via wild-type PKR phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1;. The relative contribution of these two mechanisms was explored by expressing the mutant PKR-T487A that mediates association with eIF2&#x003b1;. This construct is catalytically active, so will phosphorylate RHA, but is incapable of regulating translation. Accordingly, expression of the PKR-T487A showed an intermediate affect on the LTR-driven reporter, reflecting direct inhibition of RHA-mediated induction of the reporter without the wild-type PKR-mediated regulation of global protein translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000311-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). The relative contribution of PKR's direct regulation of RHA juxtaposed to indirect effect upon translation, demonstrated with either PKR mutation (K296R or T487A), is made more clear when the RHA-dependent transcription of the HIV-1 LTR reporter (EGFP) is normalizing against a constitutive reporter (Renilla luciferase). This normalization shows the catalytically inactive PKR-K296R does not affect RHA-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR, while the catalytically active PKR-T487A construct reduces transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR. This data shows that PKR negatively regulates RHA transactivation of the retroviral reporter gene by direct phosphorylation control of RHA.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>The RHA RBM Increases HIV-1 Infectivity</title><p>The preceding data predicts over expression of the RBD of RHA would perturb PKR function by acting as a decoy substrate. This prediction is supported by reporter assays in HEK293T cells that show RHA-regulated LTR expression increases with increasing amounts of the RHA RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000311-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). This rescue effect of RHA's RBD in the reporter assays should extend to full viral infection. To test this, we measured the capacity of constructs that encoded RHA's RBD, and two truncated constructs, of each separate RBM within this domain, to enhance HIV-1 infection in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell line MT-2. As a previous report had demonstrated that RHA becomes incorporated into the HIV-1 virion during replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000311-Isken1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, infectious virus was produced in cells co-expressing the three RHA peptides (RBD, RBM1, and RBM2, encoding residues 1-263, 1-76, and 169-263, respectively), and the virions produced were titrated onto the mononuclear cells. In keeping with the reporter assays, expression of the RBD significantly increased HIV-1 infectivity. Notably, a truncation construct from the first RBM (RBM1) that did not associate with, and was not phosphorylated by, PKR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000311-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000311-g003">3D</xref>), did not alter HIV-1 infectivity. In contrast, the construct encoding the second RBM (RBM2), predicted to be the substrate for PKR, did enhance viral infectivity. In fact, this peptide was more potent than the domain that encompassed both motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000311-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). As these truncated constructs have no helicase activity and lack other domains demonstrated to enhance retroviral replication, increased virus infectivity is presumed to be due to the demonstrated association and inhibition of PKR. However, an alternative mechanism is conceivable whereby RHA's RBD might recruit other cellular factors to enhance viral replication. This was assessed by measuring the activity of reverse transcriptase in infections with HIV-1 produced with the control plasmid or each of the RHA constructs. Importantly, the RHA peptides did not increase viral replication, as measured by the activity of the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000311-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).

This function of PKR identifies an antiviral pathway that represents a plausible target for treatment of established retroviral infections. Consistent with this antiviral mechanism, RHA is positively associated with viral replication. RHA transactivates the Bovine Viral Diarrhea virus by binding to the terminal nontranslated regions of the viral RNA genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000311-Li1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, RHA mediates release of retroviral transcripts from the splicesome and transports the RNA from the nucleus. Correspondingly, the helicase has been shown to associate with the constitutive transport element (CTE) of type D-retroviruses and Rev Response elements of HIV-1 and to associate with cellular mRNA export receptors TAP, SAM68, and HAP95 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000311-Tang1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000311-Roy1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our data demonstrates that coexpression of HIV-1 provirus with RHA peptides that are substrates for PKR subsequently enhances viral infectivity. Significantly, the truncated RHA peptides do not encode any helicase activity and are therefore incapable of transactivating the HIV-1 LTR sequences. Appropriately, no benefit to virus replication was observed by co-expressing RHA peptides. We contend the observed increased infectivity, without increased replication, is due to inhibition of the ensuing antiviral response mediated by PKR, through the interaction between RHAs second RBM and PKR. Therefore an additional function of RHA possibly exploited by HIV-1 is to dampen the primary host immune response. Such a role adds weight to the previous observed incorporation of RHA into the virion.</p><p>RHA was initially identified as a homolog of the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster maleless</italic> gene that regulates chromosomal dosage compensation, a function essential for survival of male larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000311-Lee1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

Accordingly, RHA may not only be induced by IFN, but could also regulate its downstream effects. Therefore appropriation of RHA by viruses during their replication would not only boost viral transcripts, but may also blunt the innate immune response.</p><p>Our observations of interplay between RHA and PKR strengthen the perspective that helicases are key signaling molecules. Helicases had been thought of as terminal proteins in signal cascades that elicit appropriate responses by remodeling RNA and DNA.

We demonstrate that just as the CARD domains of these helicases and their associated adaptor molecules mediate signal transduction, the RBM of RHA mediates the association with PKR. Importantly, by identifying an inhibitory effect of phosphorylation on the function of RHA, we present compelling evidence of this association, with resulting effect upon the enzyme's function. Correspondingly, peptides within RHA's RBD, that interacts with PKR, enhance the infectivity of HIV-1. The data support a paradigm by which the function of a class of RNA-responsive proteins are coordinated or exacerbated by interaction via their RBMs. The consequence of this could be considerable, as at least 17 human proteins have been described that encode RBMs. Moreover, gene deletion studies highlight the importance of these proteins.

Separated proteins were visualized by staining with BioRads Coomassie, or Silver Stain Plus reagents. Stained protein bands were excised from the gel and analyzed by Maldi-ToF. Alternatively, separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to either Immobilon-P, or Immobilon-FL membrane (Millipore) for immunoblotting using horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody and ECL from Amersham, or fluorescently labeled (680 and 800 nm) secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes), respectively. Fluorescently labeled antibodies were detected and quantitation using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor). Replicate experiments to quantitate RHA phosphorylated by PKR in vivo recorded mean values of phosphorylated residues on RHA coimmunoprecipitated with PKR of 1.6&#x0002b;/&#x02212;0.9 for phosphoserine and 5.7&#x0002b;/&#x02212;1.3 for phosphothreonine. No phosphorylated residues were detected with these phospho-specific antibodies in RHA directly immunoprecipitated.
