We examined the effects of activation of group III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) on stimulus-evoked and spontaneous glutamate release onto entorhinal cortical neurons, and found a differential regulation of action potential-dependent and independent forms of release. Activation of presynaptic mGluRs depressed the amplitude of stimulus-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents, but concurrently enhanced the frequency of spontaneous excitatory currents. Moreover, these differential effects on glutamate release were mediated by pharmacologically separable mechanisms. Application of the specific activator of adenylyl cyclase, forskolin, mimicked the effect of mGluR activation on spontaneous, but not evoked release, and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase with SQ22536 blocked mGluR-mediated enhancement of spontaneous release, but not depression of evoked release. Occlusion studies with calcium channel blockers suggested that the group III mGluRs might depress evoked release through inhibition of both N and P/Q, but not R-type calcium channels. We suggest that the concurrent depression of action potential-evoked, and enhancement of action potential-independent glutamate release operate through discrete second messenger/effector systems at excitatory entorhinal terminals.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>presynaptic metabotropic receptors</kwd><kwd>entorhinal cortex</kwd><kwd>glutamate release</kwd></kwd-group><contract-num rid="WT3">067472</contract-num><contract-sponsor id="WT3">Wellcome Trust</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P3">Transmitter release at central synapses has two components, that driven by action potentials (APs) invading the presynaptic terminal, and an AP-independent component which reflects quantal release. AP-dependent release is often multi-quantal, and depends on calcium entry through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Spafford and Zamponi, 2003</xref>, for review). Toxins that block VGCC depress AP-dependent release (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Yeager et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Llinas et al., 1989</xref>). In contrast, AP-independent (&#x02018;miniature&#x02019;) neurotransmitter release reflects stochastic release of transmitter quanta from individual vesicles, and can occur at basal calcium levels when APs are blocked (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Otis et al., 1991</xref>). In addition to these studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Sara et al., (2005)</xref> have demonstrated that, in hippocampal cultures, the pool of vesicles underlying miniature release may be separate from that underlying evoked release (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Groemer and Klingauf, 2007</xref>), and it has been suggested that the presynaptic protein, synaptobrevin, may regulate vesicle transfer between separate vesicle pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Zucker, 2005</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Previous studies have suggested that AP-dependent and independent neurotransmitter release are regulated in parallel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Prange and Murphy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dietrich et al., 2002</xref>), but there is also evidence to suggest that they may be differentially regulated. For example, application of noradrenaline to cultured hippocampal neurones decreases the amplitude of evoked excitatory responses, without alteration of amplitude or frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Scanziani et al., 1993</xref>). In cerebellar stellate neurones, noradrenaline increases the frequency but not amplitude of miniature inhibitory PSCs (mIPSCs), whilst concurrently reducing the amplitude of evoked IPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Llano and Gerschenfeld, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Kondo and Marty, 1998</xref>). At parallel fibre synapses onto cerebellar Purkinje cells, activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), probably mGluR1, increases the frequency of spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) but concurrently reduces the amplitude of evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Levenes et al., 2001</xref>). Differential regulation of evoked and spontaneous glycine release at spinal cord synapses has also been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Katsurabayashi et al., 2004</xref>). Finally, it has been consistently shown that VGCC blockers, which abolish evoked release, have little effect on the frequency or amplitude of miniature currents in many preparations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">del Castillo and Katz, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Katz and Miledi, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Scanziani et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">1995</xref>; c.f. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hori et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p id="P5">At synapses on layer V neurones in the rat entorhinal cortex (EC), we have previously shown that group III mGluRs enhanced the spontaneous release of glutamate (Evans et al., 2001a). This unusual enhancement occurred via a direct modulation of glutamate release involving protein kinase A (PKA) and PKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Evans et al., 2001</xref>), and was evidenced by an increase in the frequency of sEPSCs. In the population data this was accompanied overall by a small increase in mean amplitude, but in some individual neurones, there was an increase in frequency accompanied by a clear decrease in mean amplitude with group III agonists, reflecting a loss of larger amplitude events. However, when we recorded mEPSCs, the increased frequency still occurred, but with no change in amplitude distribution. The change in mEPSCs would be unlikely ascribed to effects on VGCC as mGluRs are considered to reduce the activation of these channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Glaum and Millar, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Takahashi et al., 1996</xref>). This led us to consider the possibility mGluR activation could have differential effects on AP-independent and multi-quantal AP-dependent release, thus differentially modulating the two forms of release. In the present study we demonstrate that increased spontaneous release occurs concurrently with a decrease in the amplitude of eEPSCs, and we have attempted to clarify the mechanism responsible for these effects. Some of these results have been presented in abstracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Evans et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Jones et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p id="P6">Combined EC-hippocampal slices were prepared from young male Wistar rats (50-110 g) as previously described, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Jones and Heinemann, 1988</xref>). All experiments were performed in accordance with the U.K. Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, European Communities Council Directive 1986 (86/609/EEC) and the Universities of Bath and Bristol ethical review documents. Rats were anaesthetised with an intramuscular injection of ketamine (120 mg/kg) plus xylazine (8 mg/kg) and decapitated. The brain was rapidly removed and immersed in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) chilled to 4&#x000b0;C.

Following a recovery period of at least 1 hour, individual slices were transferred to a recording chamber mounted on the stage of an Olympus (BX50WI) or Zeiss Axioskop FS upright microscope. The chamber was continuously perfused with oxygenated ACSF at 30-32 &#x000b0;C, at a flow rate of approximately 2 ml/min.

The solution was adjusted to 290 mOsmol with sucrose and to pH 7.4 with CsOH. Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were made from neurones in layer V of the medial division of the EC, using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices). The holding potential in all cases was &#x02212;60 mV. Under these experimental conditions, layer V neurones exhibit sEPSCs, mediated by glutamate acting primarily at AMPA receptors (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Berretta and Jones, 1996a</xref>). Pure NMDA-receptor mediated sEPSCs also occur at a much lower frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Berretta and Jones, 1996a</xref>), but in the present study no attempt was made to discriminate the effects of the drugs on events mediated by the two receptors.</p><p id="P8">eEPSCs were elicited by electrical stimulation (bipolar pulses, 10-100 mV, 0.02 ms duration) via a bipolar tungsten electrode placed on the surface of the slice in layer V of the lateral EC. Evoked responses in the mEC can vary greatly in peak amplitude, and from trial to trial, so we adjusted stimulation intensity to always give a sub-maximal (approx. 2/3 maximum amplitude) response, and used of trains of evoked EPSCs to mitigate single trial variability. For paired-pulse and high frequency trains, an inter-pulse interval of 50 ms was used. For all protocols, stimulation was applied once every 30 seconds for the duration of the experiment. sEPSCs (consisting of both AP-dependent and independent events) were recorded continuously between eEPSCs.

A paired Student's t-test was used for comparison of eEPSC amplitudes. sEPSCs were detected automatically using a threshold-crossing algorithm, and their frequency and amplitude analysed. 200 sEPSCs were sampled during a continuous recording period for each neurone under each condition. The non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnoff (KS) test was used to assess the significance of shifts in cumulative probability distributions of inter-event interval (IEI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Van der Kloot, 1991</xref>).

As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> shows, bath application of ACPT-1 increased the frequency of sEPSCs reflected by the change in the distribution of towards shorter IEIs (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, KS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), with a mean IEI of 256 &#x000b1; 3.1 ms under control conditions and 151 &#x000b1; 2.7 ms in the presence of ACPT-1. We also made recordings in the presence of TTX (1.25 &#x003bc;M; n=7).

The mean IEI of mEPSCs was decreased from 666 &#x000b1; 17 ms to 301 &#x000b1; 3 ms in the presence of ACPT-1, reflecting a doubling of the frequency.

The decreased IEI without change in the amplitude of mEPSCs indicated that ACPT-1 increased AP-independent release of glutamate through a presynaptic action, consistent with our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Evans et al., 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">2001</xref>). Kinetic analyses revealed no differences in the distribution of rise and decay times of mEPSCs (P &#x0003e; 0.5 in both cases, KS; data not shown), supporting the conclusion that the effects of the mGluR agonist on IEI were due to presynaptic modulation of glutamate release.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>mGluR activation reduces eEPSC amplitude</title><p id="P12">Having established that the effects of ACPT-1 were mediated by a presynaptic receptor, we next examined the effect of mGluR activation on the evoked component of glutamate release under conditions in which network activity was intact, and both sEPSCs and eEPSCs could be monitored. In recordings from 10 layer V neurones, the mean frequency of sEPSCs was increased during bath application of ACPT-1 (20 &#x003bc;M ACPT-1), as described above and previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Evans et al., 2000a</xref>). Concurrently, however, the mean amplitude of eEPSCs was reduced from 29.4 &#x000b1; 1.2 pA to 18.0 &#x000b1; 1.4 pA (P &#x0003c; 0.05, paired t-test). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref> shows voltage clamp recordings of eEPSCs from one neurone (from the same cell illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Summary data for the 10 neurones are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>. Since the majority of sEPSCs in layer V of the EC are TTX-insensitive, AP-independent events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Berretta and Jones, 1996a</xref>), and that ACPT-1 increases the frequency of mEPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Evans et al., 2000a</xref>), these experiments clearly indicate a differential modulation by mGluR of evoked and spontaneous glutamate release at these synapses.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>mGluR blockade reveals tonic effects on glutamate release</title><p id="P13">Given that mGluR activation enhanced spontaneous glutamate release and depressed evoked release, it could be expected that mGluR antagonists might show opposite effects. We applied the group III mGluR antagonist, CPPG (2 &#x003bc;M), whilst recording both sEPSCs and eEPSCs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> shows that a tonic effect of mGluRs on sEPSC frequency is unlikely, since there was no obvious or dramatic change in sEPSC frequency. The pooled data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) did show a small leftward shift in IEI distribution towards shorter intervals in CPPG but this did not reach significance (P &#x0003e; 0.05, KS). Similar results were obtained with CPPG at 10 &#x003bc;M (not shown). In contrast, we did observe a robust change in eEPSC amplitude in response to CPPG application. The mean peak amplitude of eEPSCs from increased from 48.2 &#x000b1; 4.5 pA to 57.4 &#x000b1; 3.1 pA (P &#x0003c; 0.05, paired t-test; n = 8). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> shows a train of 5 events recorded at 20 Hz in one neurone. With such train we usually observed an initial facilitation followed by depression of eEPSCs, or occasionally, as in this case, a simple depression. Clearly, in the presence of CPPG there was an enhancement of eEPSCs, particularly of the first three events. In pooled data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, n=8), the overall profile was initial facilitation, which then plateaued or slightly depressed. CPPG did not alter the profile, but consistently and significantly increased the size of events early in the train. Interestingly, the amplitude of the first event in a train was always facilitated by CPPG, suggesting a constitutive effect via group III mGluRs on AP-dependent release of glutamate at these synapses. In the following experiments we attempted to determine the second messenger events underlying the differential control of glutamate release underlying sEPSCs and eEPSCs.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Baclofen does not block the effects of ACPT-1</title><p id="P14">Previous experiments have demonstrated that activation of presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>B</sub>R) inhibits both AP-dependent and independent GABA release in layer V of the EC, although the intracellular mechanisms have yet to be elucidated (Bailey et al., 2004). GABA release in layer V is also decreased by group III mGluR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Woodhall et al., 2001a</xref>). It is possible that GABA<sub>B</sub>R and group III mGluRs may couple to common intracellular components, and this may also apply for excitatory synapses and glutamate release. Thus, it was of interest to determine whether the activation of GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs could occlude the effect of ACPT-1 on evoked and spontaneous glutamate release. Again, we utilized trains of stimuli at 20 Hz and measured the peak amplitude of all events within the train to reduce the influence of intrinsic variability of eEPSCs in these and subsequent occlusion experiments.</p><p id="P15"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> shows trains of eEPSCs evoked at 20Hz for 1 s in one neurone and reveals that the GABA<sub>B</sub>R agonist, baclofen (10 &#x003bc;M), substantially depressed the amplitude of all events within the train. The graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref> show averaged events from 7 neurones and illustrate the depression of eEPSC amplitude of all 20 eEPSCs. Baclofen depressed all events in the train significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, t-test). It is clear that the most pronounced effect occurred in the first half of the train reducing the largest events to the extent that an initial facilitation-depression profile of eEPSCs was converted to a gradual facilitation alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). It is also abundantly clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3A, B</xref> that the addition of ACPT-1 in addition to baclofen caused a further depression eEPSCs across the train, despite the large reduction already elicited by baclofen. ACPT-1 depressed the events considerably when expressed as a percentage of the amplitude of the events following baclofen application (approximately 40 %). The change in the overall amplitude of eEPSCs in the train (averaged across all 20 events) was highly significant in both cases. As means of quantifying the overall effect of the drugs we averaged amplitudes of eEPSCs across the whole train. In the example shown, baclofen decreased the mean amplitude from 249.0 &#x000b1; 12.5 pA to 101.7 &#x000b1; 7.1 pA, and ACPT-1 further decreased mean amplitude, to 60.6 &#x000b1; 5.6 pA (P &#x0003c; 0.001, ANOVA), which equates to a percentage reduction similar to that determined previously with ACPT-1 alone. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> summarizes the mean results of analysis in 4 neurones.</p><p id="P16">In addition, ACPT-1 appeared to remain effective at increasing the frequency of sEPSCs in the presence of baclofen. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref> shows a pronounced rightward shift in IEI distribution in the presence of baclofen (same neurones as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). This shift is partially reversed by ACPT-1, although the low frequency of events in baclofen means that this effect is not dramatic. Thus, these data indicate that ACPT-1, and hence group III mGluR activation, is still able to influence evoked and AP-independent glutamate release under conditions in which the GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs are strongly activated. The lack of occlusion suggests that group III mGluRs and GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs show little convergence at the level of G-proteins or second messengers, and also that GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs depress both eEPSC amplitude and sEPSC frequency.

In 7 neurones, the mean IEI of sEPSCs was 476 &#x000b1; 19.7 ms under control conditions and this decreased to 222 &#x000b1; 14.9 ms during bath application of forskolin.

However, SQ22536 did prevent the increase in sEPSC frequency elicited by ACPT-1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref> shows voltage clamp records illustrating the lack of effect of ACPT-1 in the presence of SQ22536. Pooled data from the 7 neurones show the overlapping cumulative probability distributions of IEI reinforce this observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). These data clearly indicate that whilst the facilitatory effect on sEPSCs is mediated via a positive coupling to the AC/PKA pathway, the reduction in eEPSC amplitude involves a different messenger-effector pathway.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>ACPT-1 depresses paired-pulse facilitation</title><p id="P19">The lack of depression of eEPSC amplitude indicated that second messenger system(s) underlying enhancement of sEPSCs was different to that underlying depression of AP-dependent eEPSCs. Since it is well established that AP-dependent release involves calcium entry through voltage-gated channels, we tested the effect of ACPT-1 on paired-pulse facilitation, a form of short-term plasticity that involves an increase in an evoked response as a result of a preceding conditioning stimulus. It is specific to the set of afferent inputs excited by the first stimulus and is widely believed to depend on residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presynaptic terminals (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hess and Kuhnt, 1992</xref>). Paired-pulse stimulation was examined in 7 neurones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>) using an inter-pulse interval of 50 ms. The effect of ACPT-1 was to decrease both eEPSCs although there was clearly a greater effect on the test response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). In 7 neurones tested the mean paired-pulse ratio was 1.7 &#x000b1; 0.1 and in the presence of ACPT-1 this was decreased to 1.1 &#x000b1; 0.2.

Of the functionally categorized subtypes of VGCC, the bulk of evidence suggests that glutamate release underlying fast synaptic transmission is predominantly mediated by P/Q and/or N-type channels (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Wu and Saggau, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Reid et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Wu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Qian and Noebels, 2001</xref>), although there is increasing evidence that R-type channels may also contribute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Wu et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Kreiger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gasparini et al., 2001</xref>). We made use of specific inhibitors to determine whether a reduction in presynaptic voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx may underlie the ACPT-1-mediated suppression of AP-dependent glutamate release. CTx (400 nM) was used to block N-type channels, and AgTx (200 nM) and SNx (1 &#x003bc;M) were used to block P/Q and R-type channels, respectively. We conducted our toxin experiments in the presence of ascorbic acid (450 &#x003bc;M), since this has been reported to greatly reduce the concentrations of channel toxins required for effective blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Casali et al., 1997</xref>). Ascorbate alone had no effect on eEPSCs (not shown). As discussed above, eEPSCs in layer V show considerable fluctuation in amplitude from trial-to-trial so, again, we employed stimulus trains (20Hz, 1s) in this series of experiments. eEPSC amplitude remained variable throughout the trains, but averaging eEPSCs across trains provided a more consistent picture of the synaptic events, facilitating comparisons between experiments. As before, repetitive stimulation induced variable profiles of evoked responses, with the most common being an initial facilitation of followed by a subsequent decline back to control levels, or beyond this to an overt depression. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref> shows he effect of ACPT alone (in the presence of ascorbate) in one neurone and clearly shows the depression of all events in the train.

A clear reduction in amplitude of all eEPSCs was seen following blockade of N-type VGCC with CTx.

The plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7Ab</xref> shows the average responses across 3 trains in each of 17 neurones, in control conditions and in the presence of CTx, with and without the addition of ACPT-1.

The plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7Bb</xref> were constructed from 7 neurones, and clearly show that the toxin did not prevent the ability of ACPT-1 to reduce eEPSC amplitude in this cell.

What is clear is that ACPT plus either toxin results in a total reduction similar to that seen with ACPT alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p id="P24">In a third set of experiments we investigated the possible contribution of R-type VGCC to the effect of group III mGluRs. In the presence of the tarantula toxin SNx (1 &#x003bc;M), which is thought to be specific for R-type channels (Newcomb et al., 1998; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Arroyo et al., 2003</xref>), the ability of ACPT-1 to depress eEPSC amplitude was similar to that seen with ACPT alone. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7Ca</xref> illustrates one study. As with CTx and AgTx, SNX (n=6) reduced the amplitude of the eEPSCs, but this effect was weak, was largely confined to the early, facilitated responses in the train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figs. 7Ca and 7Cb</xref>). Indeed, in pooled data averaging across the trains in all neurones the toxin appeared without overall effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7Cc</xref>). However, addition of ACPT-1 in the presence of SNx markedly reduced eEPSC amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figs. 7Ca and 7Cb</xref>). This effect is clearly demonstrated by the pooled data, particularly in comparison to the other toxins. Mean fractional eEPSC amplitude was unaffected by SNX (0.99 &#x000b1; 0.04), but with subsequent addition of ACPT-1 it decreased to 0.50 &#x000b1; 0.03.

In this case, the mean fractional amplitude in the presence of the divalent cation was 0.84 &#x000b1; 0.03, but in the presence of ACPT-1 the additional reduction to 0.32 &#x000b1; 0.01 appeared to be more pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7Db,c</xref>) <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), reflecting a reduction by the agonist of approximately 62%. This could be construed as a potentiation of the effects of ACPT-1 by R-channel blockade.</p><p id="P26">Overall, it appears that N, and P/Q type channels contribute to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx underlying glutamate release at these terminals, and to approximately the same extent (25-30 %). The contribution of R-type channels to evoked release is difficult to assess definitively using current pharmacological tools, since SNx failed to significantly affect eEPSCs overall, whilst Ni<sup>2+</sup> induce a weak depression. However, in some cells (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6Ca,b</xref>) it seemed to reduce eEPSC amplitudes early in the train, perhaps suggesting that R-type channels may contribute to the initial facilitation. In contrast Ni<sup>2+</sup> depressed events throughout the train. It is possible that this could reflect a non-specificity, and that Ni<sup>2+</sup> blocks not only R-type channels but may partially block either or both P/Q and N-type channels in our experiments. Whatever the contribution to release made by R-type channels, it is clear that inhibition of either P/Q or N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels alone is insufficient to prevent the full effects of mGluR activation on eEPSC amplitude.</p><p id="P27">Currently the data suggest that the effects of the GpIII mGluRs may involve both P/Q and N-type channels but not R-type. We attempted to test this further by simultaneously blocking P/Q and N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel subtypes with CTx and AgTx. However, in all but one recording (n=5), the combination of toxins completely abolished the eEPSCs, showing that simultaneous inhibition of P/Q or N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels reduced the intraterminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transient to such a degree that release could not be initiated in most cases. In the remaining neurone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>), there were small residual eEPSCs in the train resistant to combined toxins. Interestingly, these were abolished by ACPT-1, but it is clear that the CTx/AgTx combination reduced eEPSC amplitudes by &#x0003e;95% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>), so support for a contribution of R-type channels to release at these synapses is weak. Recent reports indicating that R-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels are only weakly coupled to release, and that alone, they are insufficient to support release (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Wu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">1999</xref>) support this interpretation. Thus, we conclude that N, P/Q primarily carry to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx underlying glutamate release at these terminals.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S12"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec id="S13"><title>Evoked and AP-independent glutamate release are differentially modulated by mGluRs</title><p id="P28">We have shown that activation of a group III mGluR depresses eEPSC amplitude concurrently with an increase in sEPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Evans et al., 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">2001</xref>), suggesting that AP-dependent and independent glutamate release may be differentially modulated by this receptor in layer V of the EC. It seems likely that these effects are mediated through mGluR4 and/or mGluR8 since, at the concentration we used, ACPT-1 has similar affinity for these two receptors (approximately 8 nM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">De Colle et al., 2000</xref>) and a comparatively low affinity for mGluR7. Of these group III receptors, mRNAs for mGluRs 4 and 7 have been demonstrated in the EC, but there is little information in the literature concerning mGluR8. However, one study has suggested that mGluR8 may be restricted to the very superficial layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Kinoshita et al., 1996</xref>), so it is possible that our effects in the deep layers may be mediated by mGluR4. Further anatomical and pharmacological studies will be needed to answer this question.</p><p id="P29">Whatever the receptor involved, it is likely that effects on evoked and monoquantal glutamate release are mediated through inhibition of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels and activation of AC, respectively. The demonstration that AP-dependent and independent release can be modulated in divergent directions is unusual but not unique. Activation of the VR1-receptor on primary afferent terminals in the dorsal horn increases mEPSC frequency whilst depressing eEPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Baccei et al., 2003</xref>), and GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptors increase spontaneous release of glycine but decrease evoked release onto commissural nucleus neurones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Jang et al., 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Kondo and Marty (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">1998)</xref> demonstrated that noradrenaline increased the frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs in cerebellar stellate neurones, whereas only the frequency of mIPSCs was increased.</p><p id="P30">We found that mEPSCs and sEPSCs are increased in frequency by ACPT-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Evans et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">2001</xref>), but that stimulus-evoked eEPSCs were depressed by mGluR activation. If we assume that the pool of vesicles available for evoked release is the same as that for mEPSCs, then an increase in mEPSCs by mGluR activation could deplete the releasable pool available for the eEPSC. A number of studies have suggested that the size of the readily releasable pool of vesicles (RRP) correlates with the probability of release, such that an increased probability of release should also increase the size of the RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Dobrunz and Stevens, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Goussakov et al., 2000</xref>). However, we have shown that activation of PKA increases both mEPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Evans et al., 2001</xref>) and eEPSC amplitude indicating that the depression of evoked release by ACPT-1 may not be due to depletion of the RRP subsequent to increased spontaneous release. The relationship between RRP and release may be complex. For example, recent studies of group III mGluR in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Billups et al., 2005</xref>) strongly suggests that the main action of mGluRs is to depress release probability (P), but this is matched by an increase in the size of the RRP of glutamate vesicles (N). In this scenario, mGluRs act not to suppress evoked release; rather, they enable redistribution of metabolic demand at the terminal. Certainly, it is plausible that as P declines and N is reciprocally enhanced, eEPSC depression is a sequel to reduced P, and enhanced spontaneous release reflects a larger RRP. It seems likely that eEPSC depression follows Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inhibition, which directly decreases release probability through reduction in the intra-terminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. It is also clear that the cAMP signalling machinery has the ability to mediate enhancement of the size of the RRP. Recent studies in drosophila terminals (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kidokoro et al., 2004</xref> for review) have indicated that mGluR-mediated alterations in cAMP initiate the shift of vesicles from the reserve pool to the RRP.</p><p id="P31">It is unlikely that PKA activation underlies the mGluR depression of eEPSCs at layer V synapses, since eEPSC amplitude was enhanced by forskolin, and the depression induced by ACPT-1 persisted in the presence of an AC inhibitor. Studies at other synapses support this facilitatory role for PKA activation in both spontaneous and evoked transmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chavez-Noriega and Stevens, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Capogna et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Sciancalepore et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Chen and Regehr, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Kondo and Marty, 1997</xref>). Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cai et al. (2001)</xref> have shown that PKA may reduce mGluR function by phosphorylation of a serine residue in the C-terminal tail of the receptor. The ability of mGluR to activate PKA, and for PKA to inhibit mGluRs raises very interesting possibilities with respect to feedback regulation of glutamate release.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels and depression of glutamate release</title><p id="P32">We found that eEPSCs in layer V neurones were reduced in amplitude following blockade of either P/Q or N-Type channels. SNx or Ni<sup>2+</sup>, which show some selectivity for block of R-type channels (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Tottene et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Wu et al., 1998</xref>, but also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Arroyo et al., 2003</xref>), also reduced release. However, SNx only affected the facilitation of release occurring early during repetitive stimulation. Ni<sup>2+</sup> weakly depressed release throughout the period of stimulation. Thus, it is possible that R-type channels may contribute to frequency facilitation of eEPSCs, and that the effects of Ni<sup>2+</sup> are due to non-specific blockade of R, P/Q and N-type channels. Since, concurrent application of both AgTx and CTx virtually eliminated EPSCs, we interpret this to mean that R-type channels alone are probably insufficient to support transmitter release at excitatory synapses in layer V. This would agree with previous conclusions that R-type channels control release much less effectively than P/Q or N-channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Wu et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">1999</xref>).</p><p id="P33">Inhibition of either P/Q or N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels alone was insufficient to prevent the full effects of mGluR activation. It seems likely that when P/Q-channels were blocked with AgTx, N-type channels would still be partly depressed by ACPT-1, sufficient to mediate the full effect of mGluR activation, and vice versa when N-type channels were blocked with CTx. Specific blockade of R-type channels with SNx did not have any overall effect on the ability of GpIII mGluR activation to depress eEPSCs. However, Ni<sup>2+</sup> actually seemed to enhance the depression of eEPSCs by ACPT-1. A likely explanation of this is that the divalent cation was already weakly blocking P/Q and/or N-type channels, and compounding the additional reduction of channel activity due to GpIII receptor activation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Millan et al., (2002)</xref>, have demonstrated that subtypes of group III mGluRs are associated with specific patterns of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel expression in glutamate terminals. mGluR4 is associated with terminals bearing both N and P/Q-type channels and can inhibit both, whilst mGluR7 is expressed at terminals bearing predominantly N-type channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Millan et al., 2002</xref>).

A number of G-protein coupled receptors have divergent effects on K<sup>+</sup>-channels and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Lledo et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Wilk-Blaszczak et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Vaughan et al., 2001</xref>). mGluR1 inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels via multiple transduction pathways in HEK 293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">McCool et al., 1998</xref>) and in CA3 pyramidal cells the same receptor simultaneously elicits a G-protein-dependent slow AHP, and a G-protein-independent slow depolarization via activation of a tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Heuss et al., 1999</xref>). It has often been presumed that spontaneous and evoked releases arise via the same exocytotic mechanisms, but rely on Ca<sup>2+</sup> from different sources (intracellular stores v influx via VGCC). However, recent studies have suggested that the proteins involved in vesicle docking and fusion may be different for the two forms of release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Deitcher et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hua et al., 1998</xref>), and that the role of phosphorylation in regulation of glutamate release differs for spontaneous and evoked events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Oleskevich and Walmsley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Waters and Smith, 2000</xref>). Similarly, studies in drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kidokoro et al., 2004</xref>) have shown that whilst the RRP and the reserve pool exchange vesicles, they are replenished separately. Therefore, whilst vesicles for the two forms of release may be derived from the same RRP, this does not necessarily mean that the two processes must be regulated in parallel, and it is not unreasonable to suggest that group III mGluRs mediate a differential effect on release via two separate signalling pathways.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Functional consequences of mGluR activation</title><p id="P37">The current experiments agree with previous observations that GpIII mGluRs can depress activity-dependent excitation at cortical synapses. The fact that blockade of the receptors enhanced the early responses (including the first) during repetitive stimulation indicates that they are constitutively activated to dampen glutamate release at low frequency, and to limit frequency facilitation. The functional role of the enhancement of activity-independent release by GpIII receptors is less obvious. We have previously shown that this glutamate-induced glutamate release does seem to be functionally active in the EC. Thus, neurokinin receptor agonists dramatically increase sEPSC frequency in layer V neurones, and this effect is partially ameliorated by a GPIII antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Stacey et al., 2002</xref>), indicating that modest excitation of mEC is sufficient to elicit enhanced glutamate release. Interestingly, when sEPSCs are enhanced in this way, eEPSCs are concurrently depressed (Stacey, A and Jones R.S.G. unpublished), so there may be a complex functional interrelationship between the mechanistically separable effects of GpIII mGluRs on activity dependent and independent release. We have also shown that presynaptic NMDA receptors in mEC tonically facilitate spontaneous glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Berretta and Jones, 1996b</xref>; Woodhall et al., 2001). Interestingly, the positive-feedback effects on glutamate release by both NMDA and mGluRs are developmentally regulated, such that they are greatly diminished at 6 months, compared to 1-3 months when most of our studies, including those in the current investigation, are conducted (NMDAR, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Yang et al., 2006</xref>; mGluR, Woodhall and Jones, unpublished). Thus the inherently unstable positive feedback of glutamate on glutamate release may be largely restricted the developing EC, perhaps reflecting processes involved in activity-dependent synaptogenesis, maintenance and elimination.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Wellcome Trust, the Epilepsy Research Foundation and the Universities of Bath and Bristol for financial support.
