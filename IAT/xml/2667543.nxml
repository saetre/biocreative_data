Recently, the radical-pair model involving light-activated photoreceptors as magnetic field sensors has gained considerable support, and the blue-light photoreceptor cryptochrome (CRY) has been proposed as a suitable molecule to mediate such magnetosensitivity. Since CRY is expressed in the circadian clock neurons and acts as a critical photoreceptor of <italic>Drosophila</italic>'s clock, we aimed to test the role of CRY in magnetosensitivity of the circadian clock. In response to light, CRY causes slowing of the clock, ultimately leading to arrhythmic behavior. We expected that in the presence of applied magnetic fields, the impact of CRY on clock rhythmicity should be altered. Furthermore, according to the radical-pair hypothesis this response should be dependent on wavelength and on the field strength applied. We tested the effect of applied static magnetic fields on the circadian clock and found that flies exposed to these fields indeed showed enhanced slowing of clock rhythms. This effect was maximal at 300 &#x003bc;T, and reduced at both higher and lower field strengths. Clock response to magnetic fields was present in blue light, but absent under red-light illumination, which does not activate CRY. Furthermore, <italic>cry<sup>b</sup></italic> and <italic>cry<sup>OUT</sup></italic> mutants did not show any response, and flies overexpressing CRY in the clock neurons exhibited an enhanced response to the field. We conclude that <italic>Drosophila</italic>'s circadian clock is sensitive to magnetic fields and that this sensitivity depends on light activation of CRY and on the applied field strength, consistent with the radical pair mechanism. CRY is widespread throughout biological systems and has been suggested as receptor for magnetic compass orientation in migratory birds. The present data establish the circadian clock of <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model system for CRY-dependent magnetic sensitivity. Furthermore, given that CRY occurs in multiple tissues of <italic>Drosophila,</italic> including those potentially implicated in fly orientation, future studies may yield insights that could be applicable to the magnetic compass of migratory birds and even to potential magnetic field effects in humans.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Magnetic fields influence endogenous clocks controlling the sleep&#x02013;wake cycle of animals, but the underyling mechanisms are unclear.

One of the main characteristics of endogenous clocks is that they continue to oscillate even in the absence of external time cues. Under such conditions, they &#x0201c;free-run&#x0201d; with their endogenous inherited periods that are slightly different from 24 h. Therefore, they are also called circadian clocks. Under natural conditions circadian clocks are synchronized to the 24-h cycle on Earth by different Zeitgebers. The most important Zeitgeber is the light&#x02013;dark cycle, but temperature, humidity, and the social environment can also serve as Zeitgebers. Additionally, magnetic fields have been discussed as agents that synchronize circadian clocks since 1960, when Brown et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d; found that the circadian rhythms of fiddler crabs and other organisms are influenced by small changes in the intensity of Earth's magnetic field. In particular, the electromagnetic field with a frequency of 10 Hz is known to show a prominent 24-h oscillation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;; thus, the field could serve as geophysical synchronizer of the circadian clock. Although electromagnetic fields are not consciously perceived by humans, Wever &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d; demonstrated that the circadian activity rhythm of humans can be entrained by an artificial 10 Hz electromagnetic field, mimicking the natural oscillations on Earth. The activity of mice, house flies, and fruit flies could also be synchronized or phase-shifted by 10 Hz electric fields applied for 12 h daily &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Cyclically changing intensities of a static magnetic field can also work as weak synchronizers of the circadian clock, as shown by Bliss and Heppner &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d; for house sparrows. The latter study was motivated by the idea that birds perform magnetic compass orientation and that this ability depends on a functional clock. Thus, the authors speculated about a link between the magnetosense and the circadian clock.</p><p>Despite the compelling effects of (electro)-magnetic fields on the circadian clock, the mechanisms by which the magnetic field is perceived and how it manipulates circadian clocks are unknown. Two main models of magnetic field sensing are currently under discussion: (1) the magnetite model proposing a primary process involving tiny crystals of permanently magnetic material &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;, and (2) the radical-pair model suggesting a &#x0201c;chemical compass&#x0201d; based on singlet&#x02013;triplet transitions in photopigments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b008">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The radical-pair mechanism, in which the magnetosensor is a photopigment, was first suggested by Schulten and coworkers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b008">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. The first step of the reaction is the absorption of a photon of light energy by the pigment molecule, leading to the transient formation of radical pairs (unpaired electrons) with opposite electron spin states (singlet electrons). The model predicts that these electrons are close enough together that the unpaired electron spin states can undergo transition, at some frequency, from antiparallel to parallel spin states (singlet&#x02013;triplet intersystem crossing). Such singlet&#x02013;triplet intersystem crossing is a natural feature of many photochemical reactions that, in fact, may have nothing to do with magnetosensitivity and is the result of the system reaching the most energetically favorable state subsequent to absorption of photon energy. The critical feature of a magnetosensitive radical-pair reaction is that the radicals have a sufficiently long lifetime and are oriented in such a way that singlet&#x02013;triplet transitions are modified by their alignment in the presence of an applied magnetic field. In such a case, product yield or rate of formation would be different depending on the relative amount of singlet or triplet formation, and these changes in output would provide a means for the organisms to detect the effects of even very weak applied fields. This presumed radical-pair mechanism has indeed been observed experimentally in reactions involving organic compounds &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d; and in biological systems such as photosynthetic reaction centers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Since the radical-pair mechanism of magnetosensitivity depends on the activation of the relevant photopigment by light, it is wavelength dependent. Magnetosensitivity is maximal at the absorbance maximum of the photopigment, and it depends on the strength of the magnetic field. Ritz et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d; calculated the yield of the triplet products in relation to the strength of the magnetic field and the angle of the field with respect to the alignment of the radical pair in space. They found that there is a small window of the magnetic field strength at which the radical-pair mechanism furnishes magnetosensory capacities. In agreement with these calculations, Wiltschko and Wiltschko found that the magnet compass orientation of birds works only at a certain range of magnetic intensities &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>That magnetoperception is wavelength dependent has been shown not only in birds but also in newts and fruit flies. As photopigments, cryptochromes (CRYs) have been proposed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.

However, CRYs are also expressed in the circadian clock neurons of mice and flies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b024">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. This raises the possibility that magnetic fields can interact directly with the circadian clock.</p><p>The fruit fly <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> is best suited to reveal a putative role of CRYs in the magnetosensitivity of the circadian clock, because there is only one CRY, and because mutants are available that either knock out the binding domain of the FAD (<italic>cry<sup>b</sup></italic> mutants, &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;) or the entire CRY molecule (<italic>cry<sup>0</sup></italic> mutants, &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;; <italic>cry<sup>OUT</sup></italic> mutants, &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;; <italic>cry<sup>&#x00394;</sup></italic> mutants, &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;). The molecular mechanisms of the circadian clock are largely unraveled. The main players of the clock are the clock genes <italic>period</italic>, <italic>timeless</italic>, <italic>Clock</italic>, and <italic>cycle</italic>, which participate in complex molecular feedback loops to generate the circadian oscillation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. CRY is known to play an important role in the photoreception pathway to <italic>Drosophila</italic>'s endogenous clock &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Light promotes the binding of CRY to TIMELESS (TIM), leading to the degradation of TIM &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Under light&#x02013;dark cycles the action of CRY leads to a &#x0201c;reset&#x0201d; of the clock every morning. However, under constant light (LL), TIM-mediated degradation by CRY occurs continuously. Therefore, the amount of TIM is reduced and the clock slows down (i.e., the free-running period of the locomotor rhythm is lengthened). When the constant illumination exceeds a critical intensity (&#x0003e; 10 lx), TIM disappears completely and the clock stops running (the flies become arrhythmic &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;).</p><p>On the basis of the background described above we speculated that a magnetic field might influence the circadian clock via CRY under blue light but not red light conditions. To investigate this possibility, we measured the free-running periods of the flies' locomotor rhythms before and during exposure to a magnetic field under constant weak blue light or red light illumination. The blue and red lights were adjusted to such low intensities that in the absence of the magnetic field the flies showed only a slightly longer period than when they were under constant dark (DD) conditions. We found that 40&#x00025; of the flies further lengthened the free-running periods during the exposure to a magnetic field of 300 &#x003bc;T under blue light illumination. This effect was completely absent under red light conditions. We also demonstrate that the response of fruit flies to the magnetic field is not only wavelength dependent, but also dependent on the strength of the magnetic field, as is implied by the radical-pair model. Furthermore, the magnetic field could not induce any period lengthening in <italic>cry<sup>b</sup></italic> and <italic>cry<sup>OUT</sup></italic> mutant flies; but period lengthening was enhanced after overexpressing CRY in the clock neurons. Our results indicate that the magnetic field influences the circadian clock via CRY.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Finding the Right Settings</title><p>The illumination of the flies was a critical parameter during our experiments, because we intended to activate CRY, but not to such an extent that arrhythmic behavior would occur. We recorded the flies under different intensities of blue light (465&#x02013;470 nm) and found that 0.18 &#x003bc;W/cm<sup>2</sup> was a suitable light intensity for the experiments, at which the flies did not become arrhythmic, but showed a significant period lengthening. The mean period at 0.18 &#x003bc;W/cm<sup>2</sup> blue light was 25.8 &#x000b1; 0.14 h (mean &#x000b1; standard error of the mean &#x0005b;SEM&#x0005d;, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 25). This period was 1.7 h longer than under DD conditions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;, indicating that CRY was activated by the constant weak blue light and that it provoked a constant weak TIM degradation. Our rationale was that we should see further changes in the free-running period of the flies as soon as they were exposed to the magnetic field affecting the singlet&#x02013;triplet intersystem crossing of FAD in light-activated CRY.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Effects of Magnetic Fields on the Free-Running Period</title><p>In a first experiment we tested the influence of magnetic fields of different intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000086-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

The free-running periods of the flies were determined before and during the application of the constant magnetic fields and the changes in period were calculated (independent of their direction). We found that even flies without exposure to a magnetic field exhibited period changes over the recording time, but that these changes were significantly smaller than those occurring under the influence of a magnetic field of 300 &#x003bc;T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000086-g002">Figures 2</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000086-g002">2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000086-g003">3</xref>A).

This result indicates that the higher amount of light-activated CRY degrades TIM to a greater extent. The average period of the 24 tested CRY-overexpressing flies was 26.9 &#x000b1; 0.33 h, and one fly showed arrhythmicity.

The magnetic field effect that we observed in our study led to further lengthening of the period, in the same way as an increased intensity of blue light would lead to enhanced CRY function. The effect of a magnetic field was particularly pronounced in CRY-overexpressing flies, in which small differences in CRY function should be significantly amplified. Additionally, we could show that this reaction depends on the strength of the magnetic field and on the wavelength of the light.

Other classes of photoreceptors, such as phototropins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d; and chlorophylls &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d; found in plants, also undergo radical-pair reactions. However, rhodopsins, which are the major photosensory pigments in flies and other animals, are not able to form radical pairs because photoexcitation leads to <italic>cis</italic>&#x02013;<italic>trans</italic> isomerization of retinal rather than an electron transfer &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, CRYs are the only currently known class of molecules found in animals that are likely to fulfill the physical and chemical characteristics that are required for functioning as the primary magnetic sensor.</p><p>The first evidence that CRYs may work as magnetosensors comes from the plant <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis thaliana</named-content>, where it was shown that CRYs mediate magnetic field-dependent hypocotyl growth inhibition under blue light &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. In these experiments, the effect of the magnetic field was to increase the plant's response to perceived blue light by enhancing cryptochrome activity, similarly to the presently observed magnetic field effect in flies. The second evidence comes from the fly <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> (that paper was published during the preparation of the present manuscript &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;). Gegear et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d; showed clearly that fruit flies need functional CRY to perceive a magnetic field that was paired with a sugar reward during a classical learning experiment. Although this study did not analyze the effect of magnetic field strength on CRY activity, these data are highly consistent with our present observations that the magnetic field intensifies the effects of blue light on the clock. The radical-pair mechanism predicts that the rate or yield of product formation from such a reaction will be altered by an applied magnetic field. Therefore, the pairing of blue light and the magnetic field may lead to the perception of more intense (brighter) light as compared to blue light of the same intensity presented alone. Consequently, hypocotyl growth was inhibited to a higher degree in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;, and flies learned to correlate a more intense light signal under magnetic field presence with the sucrose award &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;. In our experiments the circadian clock lengthened its period or became arrhythmic as if it experienced blue light of a higher intensity. All three phenomena clearly do not depend on directional effects of the magnetic field.</p><p>That flies can also perform magnetic compass orientation was shown first by Wehner and Labhart &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d; and further elaborated by Phillips and Sayeed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d; and Dommer et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;. The latter two studies showed that <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult males and larvae are capable of learning the alignment of important environmental gradients (i.e., light, food, and humidity) with respect to the geomagnetic field &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;. These responses were maximal under UV light, but the involvement of CRY was not tested.</p><p>The ability of animals to detect geomagnetic fields has substantial biological importance, because it is used by invertebrate and vertebrate species for orientation and navigation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;. Almost certainly CRY also plays a crucial role in this process (see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d; for discussion). Fruit flies may be well suited to further unraveling the involvement of CRY in the mechanisms of magnetic compass orientation. Since CRY is also present outside the clock neurons in tissues such as the compound eye and the ellipsoid body &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;, in which it might show a directional alignment, it will be most rewarding to test the roles of these structures in magnetic compass orientation.</p><p>In conclusion, we provide the first evidence of a mechanistic link between CRY and magnetic sensitivity in the circadian clock of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Our data provide powerful support for the radical-pair hypothesis, because they show the predicted relationship between strength of the applied field and the reaction (here period of the clock). Furthermore, the fact that the magnetic field leads to enhanced photosensitivity of CRY in both plants and flies argues for a similar mechanism of magnetoperception in all organisms that contain CRYs, including humans.

Briefly, the flies were confined to photometer cuvettes that were placed with one end in an infrared light beam. The number of light beam crosses by a walking fly was monitored during consecutive 1-min intervals. Monochromatic LEDs (Lumitronix LED-Technik, Jungingen, Germany) emitting blue (465&#x02013;470 nm) and red (625&#x02013;630 nm) light were used as light sources to illuminate the flies. Light intensity of both LEDs was adjusted to 0.18 &#x003bc;W/cm<sup>2</sup>. Under constant blue light of 0.18 &#x003bc;W/cm<sup>2</sup>, flies displayed slightly longer free-running periods than those in DD, but did not become arrhythmic. To expose the flies to magnetic fields, Helmholtz coils of sufficient diameter (20 cm) to cover the locomotor recording device were placed above and below the recording device, generating a perpendicular static magnetic field (DC mode of current) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000086-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The magnetic field intensity was controlled by changing the voltage of the power supply that connects to the coils and was placed outside the recording device. The magnetic intensities were measured by a gaussmeter (475 DSP Gaussmeter, Lake Shore Cryotronics, Ohio, United States). To generate magnetic fields of 150, 300, and 500 &#x003bc;T, 6, 12, and 20 volts were given to the coils, respectively. For comparison, the natural magnetic field of the Earth ranges between 30 &#x003bc;T (equator) and 60 &#x003bc;T (poles). We used static magnetic fields of 150&#x02013;500 &#x003bc;T instead of oscillating magnetic fields of natural strength to compare our results directly with former results on <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. thaliana</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000086-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. The free-running rhythms were first recorded for 10&#x02013;15 d without a magnetic field, and then fields of four different intensities (0, 150, 300, 500 &#x003bc;T) were applied. All experiments were performed in the same recording device that was positioned in a climate chamber. The climate chamber was surrounded by a metal case shielding the flies from the local geomagnetic field. In the absence of the applied artificial magnetic fields the Gaussmeter could not detect any magnetic field strength in the chamber containing the flies. Furthermore, the climate chamber was tightly temperature controlled. Ventilators close to the Helmholtz coils immediately blew away any heated air. A maximum of 0.5 &#x000b0;C temperature fluctuations were measured close to the Helmholtz coils. Such small temperature changes are known not to influence the circadian clock.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Data analysis.</title><p>The raw data were displayed as actograms using the program El Temps (Antoni Diez-Noguera, Barcelona, 1999; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.el-temps.com">http://www.el-temps.com</ext-link>).
