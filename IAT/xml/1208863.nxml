We wanted to determine if GIRK channels were expressed in lung cancers and if a similar link exists in lung cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>GIRK1-4 expression and levels were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR. GIRK protein levels were determined by western blots and cell proliferation was determined by a 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>GIRK1 mRNA was expressed in three of six small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines, and either GIRK2, 3 or 4 mRNA expression was detected in all six SCLC cell lines. Treatment of NCI-H69 with &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic antagonist ICI 118,551 (100 &#x003bc;M) daily for seven days led to slight decreases of GIRK1 mRNA expression levels. Treatment of NCI-H69 with the &#x003b2;-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (10 &#x003bc;M) decreased growth rates in these cells. The GIRK inhibitor U50488H (2 &#x003bc;M) also inhibited proliferation, and this decrease was potentiated by isoproterenol. In the SCLC cell lines that demonstrated GIRK1 mRNA expression, we also saw GIRK1 protein expression. We feel these may be important regulatory pathways since no expression of mRNA of the GIRK channels (1 &#x00026; 2) was found in hamster pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, a suggested cell of origin for SCLC, nor was GIRK1 or 2 expression found in human small airway epithelial cells. GIRK (1,2,3,4) mRNA expression was also seen in A549 adenocarcinoma and NCI-H727 carcinoid cell lines. GIRK1 mRNA expression was not found in tissue samples from adenocarcinoma or squamous cancer patients, nor was it found in NCI-H322 or NCI-H441 adenocarcinoma cell lines. GIRK (1,3,4) mRNA expression was seen in three squamous cell lines, GIRK2 was only expressed in one squamous cell line. However, GIRK1 protein expression was not seen in any non-SCLC cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We feel that this data may indicate that stimulation of GIRK1 or GIRK2 channels may be important in lung cancer. Stimulation of GIRK channels and &#x003b2;-adrenergic signaling may activate similar signaling pathways in both SCLC and breast cancer, but lead to different results.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Recent studies in human cancer cell lines or in animal models have shown that the growth of adenocarcinomas of the lungs, pancreas and colon are under &#x003b2;-adrenergic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The tobacco carcinogenic nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) has recently been identified as a high affinity &#x003b2;-adrenergic agonist that stimulated the growth of pulmonary and pancreatic adenocarcinomas in vitro and in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Expression of mRNA that encodes a G-protein coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channel (GIRK1) has been shown in tissue samples from approximately 40% of primary human breast cancers tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and this expression of GIRK1 was associated with a more aggressive clinical behavior. Increases in GIRK currents by &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation have been reported in adult rat cardiomyocytes and in <italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>oocytes coexpressing &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors and GIRK1/GIRK4 subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In addition, in rat atrial myocytes transiently transfected with &#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>or &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenergic receptors, the &#x003b2;-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (Iso) stimulated GIRK currents, whereas this stimulation was not seen in non-transfected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Previous data from our laboratory has indicated that there is a functional link between the &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptor pathway and the G-protein inwardly rectifying potassium channel (GIRK1) in breast cancer cell lines and these pathways were involved in growth regulation of these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Additional data from our laboratory has also indicated that the normal breast epithelial cell line MCF 10A lacks GIRK1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Established risk factors for breast cancer include age, increased hormone exposure, alcohol consumption and family history as well as many other factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Smoking is a controversial risk factor for the development of this malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, increases in pulmonary metastatic disease have been seen in smokers with breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In addition, a study of 141,000 women showed a significantly increased risk of developing lung cancer for breast cancer patients, possibly due to interactions between radiotherapy and smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. An eight-fold increase in breast cancer risk has been seen in women who were smokeless tobacco users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Smokeless tobacco has higher levels of nicotine and the tobacco carcinogen NNK than cigarette smoke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, many types of lung cancer are smoking related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>In order to investigate possible similarities between breast cancer and lung cancer, we wanted to determine if GIRK channels are expressed in human lung cancers and if &#x003b2;-adrenergic signaling is also involved in lung cancer. Voltage gated K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+ </sup>and Ca<sup>2+ </sup>channels have been shown in the small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines NCI-H128, NCI-H69 and NCI-H146 by measurement of currents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These voltage activated K<sup>+ </sup>channels in the SCLC cell lines have a role in modulating cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. A classical inwardly rectifying potassium channel not linked with G-proteins has been shown in a subclone of NCI-H69, H69AR, a subline with overexpressed multidrug resistance associated protein, but these currents were not seen in the original H69 cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Inwardly rectifying potassium currents have also been measured in RERF-LC-MA SCLC cells, and these cells express the Kir2.1 mRNA and protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. GIRK1 expression has been shown in tissue specimens from patients with non-small lung cancer and this expression was associated with lymph node metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Prior to this study, GIRK channels have not been identified in lung cancer cell lines or SCLC cell lines and clinical samples. In the present research we have screened small cell and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines and several normal lung cell types for GIRK mRNA and protein expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human SCLC cell lines NCI-H69 (H69), NCI-H146 (H146), NCI-H187 (H187), NCI-H209 (H209), and NCI-H526 (H526), the human adenocarcinoma cell lines NCI-H322 (H322), NCI-H441 (H441), and A549, the carcinoid cell line NCI-H727 (H727), and the squamous cell lines NCI-H226 (H226), NCI-H2170 (H2170), and NCI-H520 (H520) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

Expression of mRNA for the GIRK1 channel was seen in three of six SCLC cell lines. GIRK 1 was expressed in the SCLC cell lines H69, H146 and WBA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Since GIRK1 cannot form channels alone, it must assemble with GIRK2, 3 or 4 [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]]. GIRK2 &#x00026; 4 expression was determined in the six SCLC cell lines using real-time PCR. GIRK 4 expression was found in all six SCLC cell lines, and GIRK2 was found in all six SCLC cell lines with the exception of H146 and H187 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In these experiments, real-time PCR was used as a second method of determining gene expression. Since gene expression was determined by only one sample (similar to gene expression studies by RT-PCR) no comparisons can be made between C<sub>T </sub>values for the samples. We wished to compare GIRK1 expression in SCLC to normal primary cells. GIRK1 was not expressed in the normal human SAE cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Normal SAE cells express GIRK4 but do not express GIRK2 (data not shown). SCLC shares phenotypic and functional features with pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNEC), one of the possible origins of this cancer type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Neither GIRK1 nor GIRK2 mRNA expression was found in normal tissue from PNEC cells isolated from prenatal hamster lungs using the primers designed for human GIRK1 and 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In order to determine if this result was due to species differences in GIRK1 and 2 between humans and hamsters, tissue was isolated from hamster brain. In both cases, mRNA from GIRK1 and 2 were found to be expressed in hamster brain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However, our GIRK4 primers were found not to work in hamster tissue (data not shown).</p><p>We wanted to determine if GIRK channels were also expressed in human non-SCLC (NSCLC) cancers. GIRK1 was not expressed in two adenocarcinoma cell lines of Clara cell phenotype, H322 and H441 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). However, three GIRK channels (1,2,4) were expressed in both the human adenocarcinoma cell line with alveolar type II cell phenotype (A549) and human carcinoid cell line expressing neuroendocrine features (H727) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). GIRK1 and 4 are expressed in three squamous cell lines, H2170, H226, and H520 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). GIRK2 is only expressed in the H520 cell line, but not in either H2170 or H226 cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>Although the predominant GIRK heterotetramers seem to be GIRK1/2 and GIRK1/4 [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]], GIRK3 expression may also be important in lung cancer. GIRK3 expression in normal cells, SCLC cell lines and NSCLC cell lines was examined. GIRK3 expression was seen in all six SCLC cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). GIRK3 was expressed in normal cells (SAEC, PNEC) and in the five NSCLC cell lines (A549, H727, H2170, H226, H520) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). A summary of all the above experiments indicating gene expression data for the cell lines and normal cells is shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. We also wanted to determine if GIRK1 was expressed in fresh surgical tissue samples. A limited number of samples of pulmonary adenocarcinomas (three) or pulmonary squamous carcinomas (two) were collected from patients at the UT Graduate School of Medicine's Cancer Center. None of these tissue samples expressed GIRK1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><p>For functional GIRK channels in lung cells, protein expression is needed as well as gene expression. We determined GIRK1 protein expression in cell lines that express GIRK1 mRNA. Isolating enriched membrane protein using a Biorad kit, we found GIRK1 protein expression in the three SCLC cell lines that expressed GIRK1 mRNA, H69, H146 and WBA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). In addition, in the NSCLC cell lines that express GIRK1 mRNA, GIRK1 protein expression was determined. GIRK1 protein expression was not seen in A549, H727, H2170, H226, and H520 (data not shown).</p><p>Since &#x003b2;-adrenergic ligands affected both gene expression of GIRK1 and cell proliferation for breast cancer cell lines in our laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], we wanted to determine if &#x003b2;-adrenergic agonists and antagonists had effects on either gene expression or cell proliferation in SCLC cells. H69 cells were used for these experiments because it is one of the two cell lines that expressed mRNA for all four GIRK channels as well as GIRK1 protein. The second cell line, WBA, is not as well characterized in the literature. Exposure of MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells for six days to the &#x003b2;-adrenergic antagonist propranolol increased the GIRK1 mRNA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In the present experiments, we used two specific &#x003b2;-adrenergic antagonists to possibly induce changes in GIRK1 mRNA levels. The specific &#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>antagonist atenolol (100 &#x003bc;M) had no effect on gene expression when H69 cells were treated for seven days (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). However, when H69 cells were treated with 100 &#x003bc;M of the &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenergic antagonist ICI daily for seven days, differences in gene expression were seen as determined by real-time quantitative PCR (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Calculating differences in gene expression using the 2<sup>-&#x00394;&#x00394;C</sup><sub>T </sub>Formula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], ICI treatment caused a 1.47&#x000d7; decrease in GIRK1 gene expression p &#x0003c; 0.0003 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). H69 cells express mRNA for both &#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>(data not shown). As indicated above, we wanted to determine if &#x003b2;-adrenergic ligands altered proliferation in H69 cells. We determined the effects of the &#x003b2;-adrenergic agonist Iso and the GIRK channel inhibitor U5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] on proliferation in H69 cells. Iso (10 &#x003bc;M) inhibited proliferation (p &#x0003c; 0.001) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). The GIRK inhibitor U5 (2 &#x003bc;M) also inhibited proliferation (p &#x0003c; 0.001), and this decrease was potentiated by Iso (p &#x0003c; 0.001) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first report that describes the expression of mRNA for G-Protein Inwardly Rectifying Potassium Channels (GIRKs) in lung cancer cell lines. Previous reports have indicated that voltage gated K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+ </sup>and Ca<sup>2+ </sup>channels have been shown in SCLC cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and these voltage activated K<sup>+ </sup>channels have a role in modulating cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

Since GIRK1 cannot form functional channels by itself, other GIRK channels are needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. All six SCLC cell lines tested express mRNA for either GIRK2 or GIRK4 indicating that functional GIRK potassium channels are possible in these SCLC cancer cell lines.

GIRK1 has also been shown to contribute to tumor progression in NSCLC human tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Differences in GIRK channel mRNA expression was seen in different types of lung cancer. The three adenocarcinomas from the lung cancer patient samples did not express GIRK1, and a subset of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (H322, H441) also did not express GIRK1. However, GIRK1 expression was seen in an adenocarcinoma cell line with alveolar type II cell phenotype (A549). These variations may be due to differences between the Clara cell and the alveolar type II lineage, or it may be due to the small sample size. The cell linage of the lung cancer patient samples is unknown. Data from our laboratory has also indicated differences in responses to anticancer agents between alveolar type II and Clara cells in the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Further research with additional cell lines and tissue samples is needed to determine if the differences in GIRK expression between alveolar type II cells and Clara cells is significant.</p><p>The two samples from squamous cancer patients also did not express GIRK1 mRNA. However, squamous carcinoma cells lines and a carcinoid cell lines do express GIRK1. In all NSCLC cell lines that express GIRK1, either GIRK2 or GIRK4 mRNA was expressed, indicating that functional GIRK potassium channels are possible in these non-SCLC cancer cell lines. Our data showing lack of GIRK1 expression in tumors from human adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas in is in contrast to Takanami et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. They found that in 72 NSCLC patients, 69% had high GIRK1 levels and 31% had low GIRK1 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The differences may be due to our small sample size, or there may be other factors in cancer patients that affect GIRK1 expression. The expression of GIRK2 or GIRK4 has not been determined in previous studies.</p><p>The mRNA for GIRK1 &#x00026; GIRK2 channels have not been detected in the normal cell lines tested, although the mRNA for GIRK4 channels was found in SAE normal cells. Our data indicates more differential expression of GIRK1 and GIRK2 than of GIRK4 in both SCLC and NSCLC cell lines. It is our hypothesis that GIRK4 is less important in lung cancer due to the fact it was expressed in all normal and cancerous cell lines. Further study is needed to determine the importance of GIRK1 and GIRK2 in lung cancer. In addition GIRK3 was found in all cell lines tested, including SAEC and normal hamster PNEC. Since GIRK3 expression was seen in all cells tested, we also feel it is unlikely to be a factor in tumor growth or progression. This hypothesis is supported by data indicating that one of the functions of GIRK3 is to inhibit plasma membrane expression of other GIRK subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Further studies are needed to determine the role of GIRK3 in lung cancer.</p><p>Since protein expression would also be necessary for functional GIRK channels, we determined GIRK1 protein expression in cell lines that expressed GIRK1 mRNA. Expression of GIRK1 protein was seen in the three SCLC cell lines that express GIRK1 mRNA. This is the first report of GIRK1 protein expression in SCLC cell lines. We also determined GIRK1 protein expression in NSCLC cell lines. None of the NSCLC cell lines that expressed GIRK1 showed protein expression for GIRK1. We feel that this indicates that GIRK1 expression may be a larger factor in SCLC than in NSCLC. Further study is needed to elucidate these differences.</p><p>In the present study, we demonstrated a small decrease in GIRK1 mRNA expression (1.5&#x000d7;) in the H69 SCLC cell line after treatment for one week with the &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenergic antagonist ICI daily for seven days. In contrast to this data, exposure of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB453 for six days to the &#x003b2;-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (1 &#x003bc;M) increased the GIRK1 mRNA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Treatment with the &#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>antagonist, atenolol, for the same time period had no effect, indicating that the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor is more important for changes in GIRK mRNA. GIRK currents have been shown to be increased in cells stimulated with the &#x003b2;-adrenergic agonist Iso in rat atrial myocytes transfected with &#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>or &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Heterologous facilitation of GIRK currents by &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation was also seen in rat cardiomyocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The differences in signaling pathways stimulated by &#x003b2;-adrenergic ligands in breast cancer and SCLC remain to be elucidated.</p><p>The tobacco carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), a high affinity agonist for &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptors, stimulated DNA synthesis in two breast cancer cell lines, an effect inhibited by ICI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In the present report the &#x003b2;-adrenergic agonist, Iso, inhibited proliferation in H69 SCLC cells, also indicating opposite effects between breast cancer and small cell lung cancer with &#x003b2;-adrenergic agonists. The GIRK channel inhibitor U5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] also inhibited proliferation. It is our contention that the same receptors and channels (&#x003b2;-adrenergic, GIRK) are in both breast cancer and lung cancer, and stimulation of these pathways can lead to different results. This could be important in devising therapies in women breast cancer patients that are also smokers. Another study has indicated down-regulation of protein synthesis and mRNA expression of voltage-dependent and calcium-activated potassium channels bronchial and bronchiolar smooth muscle cells in rats by chronic smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. No differences were found in protein extracted from the lung, however.</p><p>Further studies are needed with RNA interference (RNAi) or small interfering RNA (siRNA) and additional &#x003b2;-adrenergic agonists and antagonists to further determine the effects of GIRK1 and GIRK2 on &#x003b2;-adrenergic signaling in human lung cancer, especially studies on differences in GIRK protein expression. However, it appears that &#x003b2;-adrenergic signaling and GIRK channels are important in both SCLC and breast cancer. These findings may be important in devising therapies based on &#x003b2;-adrenergic signaling and GIRK channel expression in lung cancers that express GIRK channels or &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We feel that this data may indicate that stimulation of GIRK1 or GIRK2 channels may be important in lung cancer. Stimulation of GIRK channels and &#x003b2;-adrenergic signaling may activate similar signaling pathways in both SCLC and breast cancer, but lead to different results.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HP carried out the majority of experiments, designed the study, and helped draft the manuscript.
