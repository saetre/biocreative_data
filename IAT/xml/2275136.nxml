The mammalian AP-endonuclease (APE1) overexpression is often observed in tumor cells, and confers resistance to various anticancer drugs; its downregulation sensitizes tumor cells to those agents via induction of apoptosis. Here we show that wild type (WT) but not mutant p53 negatively regulates APE1 expression. Time-dependent decrease was observed in APE1 mRNA and protein levels in the human colorectal cancer line HCT116 p53<sup>(+/+)</sup>, but not in the isogenic p53 null mutant after treatment with camptothecin, a DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor. Furthermore, ectopic expression of WTp53 in the p53 null cells significantly reduced both endogenous APE1 and APE1 promoter-dependent luciferase expression in a dose-dependent fashion. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that endogenous p53 is bound to the APE1 promoter region that includes a Sp1 site. We show here that WTp53 interferes with Sp1 binding to the APE1 promoter, which provides a mechanism for the downregulation of APE1. Taken together, our results demonstrate that WTp53 is a negative regulator of APE1 expression, so that repression of APE1 by p53 could provide an additional pathway for p53-dependent induction of apoptosis in response to DNA damage.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The mammalian AP-endonuclease (APE1) is a ubiquitous and remarkably multifunctional protein. It plays a central role in the base excision repair (BER) pathway for damaged bases induced by reactive oxygen species and alkylating agents, and for abasic (AP) sites generated after excision of oxidized and alkylated bases by DNA glycosylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). As an endonuclease, APE1 cleaves the AP site to generate 3&#x02032;-OH and 5&#x02032;-deoxyribose phosphate termini, and the 3&#x02032;-OH terminus is utilized by a DNA polymerase, usually DNA polymerase &#x003b2;, for repair synthesis in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). APE1 was independently identified as a reductive activator of the c-Jun transcription factor <italic>in vitro</italic>, and named Ref-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Subsequently, several other transcription factors (including p53, hypoxia-inducible factor and NF-kB) were also found to be activated by APE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8">6&#x02013;8</xref>). In addition, APE1 directly acts as a <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor by binding to negative Ca<sup>2+</sup> response elements (nCaRE) during Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent repression of the human parathyroid hormone and renin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>).</p><p>Given its multiple functions, it is not surprising that APE1 expression is regulated <italic>in vivo</italic> in a complex manner. We were one of the first to show the activation of APE1 gene by oxidative stress; several other laboratories subsequently confirmed our observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>). Moreover, based on the identification of the nCaREs in the APE1 promoter itself, we suggested that APE1 regulates its own expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). While cell cycle-dependent expression of APE1 was observed in NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), the basal expression of APE1 is variable. The increased APE1 level is often observed in tumor cells including prostate, osteosarcomas, lung and cervical carcinomas compared to normal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19 B20">17&#x02013;20</xref>). In other types of cancer, subcellular localization of APE1 is altered relative to that in normal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21 B22 B23">21&#x02013;23</xref>). Tumor cells often overexpress APE1 and are resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs and ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). In contrast, siRNA-mediated downregulation of APE1 induced apoptosis of many tumor cell types and enhanced cell sensitization to ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27 B28 B29">26&#x02013;29</xref>). We recently showed that APE1 inactivation-induced apoptosis in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) conditionally nullizygous for endogenous APE1, an effect that could be prevented by ectopic expression of human APE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Using a complementation assay, we also showed that both the repair and transcription regulatory functions of APE1 are required to prevent apoptosis of MEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Thus, elucidating the molecular mechanisms controlling APE1 expression has profound implications for cancer therapy from both basic and clinical perspectives.</p><p>The tumor suppressor gene p53, dubbed &#x02018;the guardian of the genome&#x02019;, encodes a sequence-specific transcription factor that activates a variety of cellular genes in response to DNA damage, hypoxia and other stress signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). p53 is one of the most commonly mutated genes in human cancers; 50% of all human cancers lack the wild type (WT) p53 gene allele, and these tumors respond poorly to chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In response to DNA damage or other cellular stresses, p53 is activated and induces cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, depending on the severity of the damage and the context of the cell cycle, and thus helps to maintain genomic stability and prevents cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Once activated, p53 has the ability to arrest cell cycle by transactivation of Waf-1/p21, 14-3-3&#x003b4; etc., or induce cells to undergo apoptosis by both transcription-dependent and -independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35 B36 B37">35&#x02013;37</xref>). p53 activates many downstream target genes involved in the mitochondrial signaling pathway during apoptosis including BAX, PUMA and the death receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38 B39 B40">38&#x02013;40</xref>). In addition, p53 has been shown to downregulate many genes, including cell survival genes such as <italic>survivin</italic>, <italic>bcl-2, IGF1R</italic> and DNA repair gene O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine-DNA-methyltranferase (<italic>MGMT</italic>) with the net result of facilitating apoptosis induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41 B42 B43 B44 B45 B46">41&#x02013;46</xref>).</p><p>Potential link between APE1 expression and p53 status in various tumors and their resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs have been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Despite several studies showing the involvement of APE1 and p53 in drug resistance induction in tumor cells, the question of whether p53 regulates APE1 expression after genotoxic stress has not been addressed. Elucidating the direct role of p53 on APE1 gene expression in human cells should be of major clinical significance, and a clear understanding of the mechanisms by which p53 controls APE1 expression could help in effective use of chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of tumors expressing WT or mutant p53. In this study, we show that activation of p53 after genotoxic stress downregulates APE1 expression in HCT116 p53<sup>(+/+)</sup> human colon carcinoma cells, but not in the p53 null mutants derived there from. Transgenic expression of WTp53 in p53 null cells downregulate both endogenous APE1 level and expression of a reporter whose activity is dependent on APE1 promoter activity. We also present evidence that p53 is associated with the endogenous APE1 promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that interference of specificity protein (Sp1) binding to the APE1 promoter by WTp53 and subsequent recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC) to the promoter could explain downregulation of APE1 by WTp53.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and treatment</title><p>The human colorectal adenocarcinoma lines, HCT116 p53<sup>(+/+)</sup> with WTp53 and p53 null HCT116 p53<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> (a gift from Dr B.

Increase in p53 expression was confirmed by western analysis of the same cells extract with antip53 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Because p53 is an activator of the p21 gene, we simultaneously examined the effect of ectopic expression of p53 on p21 promoter-dependent luciferase activity. The increase in p21 promoter-dependent luciferase activity with increasing amounts of input p53 plasmid indicated that the inhibitory effect of p53 on APE1 promoter was not due to general inhibition of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). Moreover, we observed that CMV promoter-dependent &#x003b2;-galactosidase and thymidine kinase promoter-dependent renilla-luciferase (pRL-TK, Promega) levels were also increased due to overexpression of WTp53 for unknown reasons (data not shown). We thus could not therefore use these reporter plasmids for normalizing transfection efficiency. In any case, our results indicate that the p53-dependent repression is APE1 promoter specific, and not a general phenomenon. We also examined the effects of two p53 point mutants on APE1 promoter activity namely, V143A, a missense mutation which inactivates p53's sequence-specific DNA binding, and a Leu22Gln Trp23Ser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), double mutant which retains the ability to bind p53-<italic>cis</italic> sequences but lacks transcriptional activation ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). Overexpression of WTp53 significantly decreased luciferase activity under the control of the APE1 promoter (reaching up to &#x0223c;60-fold with 50 ng of WTp53), while the mutants had no significant inhibitory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). Western analysis of p53<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> cells lysates transiently transfected with p53 expression plasmids revealed that the p53 mutant polypeptides were more stable than the WT protein, and were present at higher levels (2- to 3-fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E). These results indicate that despite these higher levels, mutant p53 could not inhibit the APE1 promoter activity. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Inhibition of APE1 promoter activity by WT but not mutant p53.

The chromatin fractions were isolated and fragmented by digestion. After immunoprecipitation with antibody to p53 or Sp1, ChIP assays were then performed as described in Materials and Methods section. The amount of immunoprecipitated APE1 promoter sequence was quantitated for each sample by PCR analysis with primers for amplification of the APE1 promoter region from &#x02212;368 to +24 bp. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B shows significant enrichment of this sequence in the immunocomplex with p53 antibody, indicating that p53 is associated with the APE1 promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> in HCT116 p53<sup>(+/+)</sup> cells.

Similarly, no significant enrichment of the APE1 promoter sequence was observed in chromatin extracts from either cell line when non-specific IgG was used for immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). An earlier study identified overlapping Sp1-binding sites within this APE1 promoter sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). As expected, significant enrichment of the APE1 promoter sequence was observed in the Sp1-specific immunocomplexes from both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B), indicating that Sp1 is constitutively associated with the APE1 promoter in the chromatin fraction of both p53<sup>(+/+)</sup> and p53<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> cells.

Furthermore, a significant decrease in binding was observed with nuclear extract from p53-overexpressing HCT116<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> cells, suggesting that WTp53 interferes with Sp1 binding to the promoter.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>APE1 is often overexpressed in tumor cells compared to its basal level in many untransformed cells lines. Downregulation of APE1 was found to sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy with induction of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Thus, elucidating the molecular basis for variable APE1 expression is important from both basic and clinical perspectives. Although several studies have shown that p53 participates in DNA repair processes, and stimulates BER via its direct interaction with APE1 and DNA polymerase &#x003b2;, whether p53 regulates APE1 level itself was not shown before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). This report provides the first evidence that p53 downregulates APE1 expression. We have shown that the levels of both APE1 mRNA and polypeptide were decreased after CPT treatment in HCT116 p53<sup>(+/+)</sup>, but not in the isogenic HCT116 p53<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> cells. This effect on HCT116 p53<sup>(+/+)</sup> cells was specific, and not a consequence of general effects of genotoxic or other types of stress, because the same treatment did not affect APE1 expression in p53 null cells. This thus indicates direct relationship between the p53 status and APE1 downregulation. Reduced expression of both endogenous APE1 and APE1 promoter-dependent luciferase activity by exogenous p53 in unstressed p53 null cells further confirmed that p53 downregulates APE1 expression. However, ectopic expression of WTp53 downregulated the episomal APE1 promoter to a much greater extent than the endogenous gene which was somewhat unexpected. It is possible that the APE1 promoter in the chromatinized plasmid is more sensitive to the effect of p53 than the folded conformation in cellular chromatin. Furthermore, the endogenous APE1 gene could be regulated by binding of transcription factors to <italic>cis</italic> elements absent in the episomal promoter. The V143A p53 mutant lacking DNA-binding activity did not downregulate the basal APE1 promoter as much as did WTp53, which strongly suggests that p53's DNA-binding ability is a prerequisite for its repressor activity. However, the L22G, T23S double mutant with normal DNA-binding activity, but lacking <italic>trans</italic>-acting activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>), was also unable to repress the APE1 promoter, which suggests that both DNA binding and transactivation abilities of p53 are required for the repression. Western analysis showing that p53 mutants were more stable than the WTp53 protein eliminated the possibility that the former's inability to repress the APE1 promoter was due to reduced stability.</p><p>Using functional analysis of nested deletion mutants, we mapped the basal APE1 promoter to a &#x02212;143 bp segment 5&#x02032; to the transcription start site. We also observed that the candidate p53-responsive <italic>cis</italic> element(s) were located in the &#x02212;184 to &#x02212;143 bp segment. However, sequence analysis revealed no apparent p53-binding sites within this segment. Moreover, the recombinant p53 polypeptide failed to bind to an oligo of this sequence (&#x02212;184 to &#x02212;143). At the same time we have provided direct evidence from ChIP assays that p53 was bound to the &#x02212;253 to &#x02212;118 bp segment sequence <italic>in vivo</italic>. Together, these data suggest that APE1 repression by p53 is not mediated via direct <italic>cis</italic> element binding, but rather involves p53's indirect recruitment to the promoter by other transcription factors. p53 has been shown to repress many other promoters that lack p53-specific <italic>cis</italic> elements, indicating that the mechanisms of p53-mediated repression are varied and complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). Such mechanisms could include (i) interference with transcriptional activators, (ii) interference with the basal transcription machinery and (iii) compaction of the chromatin structure at the promoter sites by recruitment of HDACs and other histone-modifying enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).</p><p>The exact mechanism by which p53 represses the APE1 expression is not clear. We have shown that candidate p53-responsive element(s) were located in the &#x02212;184 to &#x02212;143 bp segment that includes one Sp1 site. An earlier study using <italic>in vitro</italic> DNase I footprinting analysis with purified Sp1 polypeptide showed a distinct footprint spanning &#x02212;169 to &#x02212;148 bp in the APE1 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). Consistent with this, our ChIP assay showed constitutive Sp1 binding within this region in both p53<sup>(+/+)</sup> and p53<sup>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;)</sup> cells, indicating that the Sp1 site is functional <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, we observed that Sp1 remains bound to the APE1 promoter after p53 activation by CPT, suggesting that both p53 and Sp1 can simultaneously occupy the same promoter region. It thus appears that repression may be achieved through the physical interaction of p53 with Sp1. Consistent with this possibility, p53 has been shown to bind Sp1, inhibiting Sp1-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56 B57 B58">56&#x02013;58</xref>). However, in P53-dependent repression of the telomerase reverse transcriptase, insulin receptor, VEGF and POLD1 genes, p53 does not inhibit DNA binding by Sp1, but rather interferes with its ability for transactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60 B61 B62 B63">60&#x02013;63</xref>). We also observed that overexpression of p53 decreased DNA binding by Sp1. On the other hand, treatment with HDAC inhibitor TSA partially abolished p53-mediated repression of the APE1 promoter indicating HDAC recruitment to the promoter site. Thus the mechanism of p53-mediated repression of the APE1 gene appears to be multifaceted.</p><p>Our findings are intriguing because p53 acts as a pro-apoptotic factor in the cellular response to stress, whereas APE1 is a pro-survival protein whose DNA repair function is essential for protecting cells from oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). However, it is possible that the tumor suppressor function of p53 is mediated in part by transcriptional repression of antiapoptotic genes such as APE1. Thus the cell could use p53 to downregulate APE1 expression in response to severe DNA damage, thereby promoting apoptosis. Consistent with this idea, several earlier studies showed reduction of APE1 expression during apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cells and in neurons after transient global cerebral ischemia in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>). Additional studies are needed to unravel the physiological significance of such downregulation.</p><p>Our study also sheds light on the potential link between APE1 expression and p53 status in different tumors with their resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Although only few published studies have directly focused on the potential link between APE1 expression and p53 status in various tumors, an inverse relationship between APE1 nuclear expression and p53 nuclear accumulation has been reported in head and neck cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). It is interesting to speculate that tumors with mutated p53 also have high APE1 levels and develop resistance to therapy, while induction of WTp53 in other tumors will reduce their APE1 levels, leading to enhanced therapeutic index of efficacy of the anticancer drugs. Thus the p53-mediated suppression of APE1 expression could offer a potential approach for sensitizing tumor cells to drugs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We acknowledge the help of Dr D.
