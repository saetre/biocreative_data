Epithalamic Nodal signaling subsequently determines the laterality of neuroanatomical asymmetries. We show that overactivation of Wnt/Axin1/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling during late gastrulation leads to bilateral epithalamic expression of Nodal pathway genes independently of LPM Nodal signaling. This is consistent with a model whereby epithalamic Nodal signaling is normally bilaterally repressed, with Nodal signaling from the LPM unilaterally alleviating repression. We suggest that Wnt signaling regulates the establishment of the bilateral repression. We identify a second role for the Wnt pathway in the left/right regulation of LPM Nodal pathway gene expression, and finally, we show that at later stages Axin1 is required for the elaboration of concordant neuroanatomical asymmetries.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DEVBIO</kwd><kwd>MOLNEURO</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Structural and functional asymmetries are common features of the nervous systems of both invertebrates and vertebrates (<xref rid="bib17 bib21" ref-type="bibr">Halpern et&#x000a0;al., 2003; Hobert et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). The best described neuroanatomical asymmetries in vertebrates are found in the diencephalic epithalamus, where both&#x000a0;the habenulae and the dorsally adjacent pineal complex are lateralized in many species. The epithalamus is part of&#x000a0;a conserved output pathway of the limbic system, connecting telencephalic nuclei to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) in the ventral midbrain (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Sutherland, 1982</xref>).</p><p>During early development in zebrafish, bilaterally located parapineal cells migrate leftward from the pineal complex to form a left-sided nucleus that sends ipsilateral axonal projections to the left habenula (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Concha et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). The paired habenular nuclei themselves show various asymmetries, including differences in gene expression, subnuclear regionalization, timing of neuronal differentiation, and neuropil organization (<xref rid="bib2 bib3 bib7 bib14 bib15" ref-type="bibr">Aizawa et&#x000a0;al., 2005, 2007; Concha and Wilson, 2001; Gamse et&#x000a0;al., 2003, 2005</xref>). Left-right asymmetries in habenular neuronal organization are converted into a dorsal-ventral asymmetry in the targeting of the habenular axons in the midbrain IPN, with left-sided habenular axons predominantly innervating the dorsal IPN and right-sided axons projecting to the ventral IPN (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Aizawa et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The parapineal influences the elaboration of habenular asymmetries. For instance, the parapineal modulates gene expression in the left habenula, and ablation of parapineal cells results in the left habenula adopting some right-sided character (<xref rid="bib9 bib14 bib15 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Concha et&#x000a0;al., 2003; Gamse et&#x000a0;al., 2003, 2005; Kuan et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). On the other hand, ablation of left-sided habenula precursors can influence the orientation of parapineal migration (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Concha et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that there is communication between the various structures in the epithalamus to ensure coordinated and consistent elaboration of lateralized neuroanatomical asymmetries.</p><p>The earliest known indication of brain asymmetry in zebrafish is the expression of Nodal pathway genes within the left epithalamus from about 18 hpf (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Halpern et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Epithalamic Nodal signaling influences the laterality of the habenulae and parapineal, but asymmetry per se appears to be established independently of this pathway (<xref rid="bib8 bib9 bib30" ref-type="bibr">Concha et&#x000a0;al., 2000, 2003; Liang et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). As the&#x000a0;Nodal pathway is activated unilaterally in the epitahalmus, other mechanisms must act upstream to initiate this asymmetry. Within the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM), Nodal signaling has evolutionarily conserved roles in the development of asymmetries (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hamada et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>), and in zebrafish, it appears that activation of Nodal pathway genes in the left epithalamus is dependent upon the activity of the Nodal ligand Southpaw (Spw) emanating from the left LPM (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Long et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Whether this activity of Spw is direct or indirect is unknown. We have previously proposed that the role of left-sided LPM Nodal signaling may be indirect, through removal of repression of Nodal pathway gene expression in the left epithalamus (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Concha et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we address the role of the Wnt/Axin1/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway in the regulation of asymmetric Nodal pathway gene expression and in the elaboration of brain asymmetries. The role of this pathway in the development of brain asymmetries has not previously been assessed, but some studies suggest that Wnt signaling can influence visceral asymmetries. For instance, overexpression of Xwnt8 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> can lead to cardiac left-right reversals (<xref rid="bib10 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Danos and Yost, 1995; Nascone and Mercola, 1997</xref>) as can overactivation of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway in medaka (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bajoghli et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). In chick, Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling is suggested to be a left determinant of Nodal pathway gene expression in the LPM, as early upregulation of the pathway results in bilateral Nodal gene expression (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez-Esteban et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, mice lacking Wnt3a exhibit asymmetry defects that are likely due to a requirement for Wnt3a acting in and around the node during the period when asymmetries first become evident (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Nakaya et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use a variety of approaches to establish roles for Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling and the Wnt pathway scaffolding protein Axin1 in both the regulation of Nodal pathway activation and in the differentiation of lateralized brain nuclei. <italic>masterblind</italic> (<italic>mbl</italic>) embryos carry a mutation in Axin1 that disrupts the binding of GSK3&#x003b2;, reducing the ability of GSK3&#x003b2; to degrade &#x003b2;-catenin and consequently leading to overactivation of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in the anterior neural plate (<xref rid="bib19 bib20 bib22 bib34 bib48" ref-type="bibr">Heisenberg et&#x000a0;al., 1996, 2001; Houart et&#x000a0;al., 2002; Masai et&#x000a0;al., 1997; Van de Water et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>). We find that <italic>mbl</italic> mutant embryos show bilateral activation of Nodal pathway genes in the epithalamus but not the viscera. This activation can occur independently of the activity of Spw, suggesting that overactivation of Wnt signaling bilaterally removes repression of epithalamic Nodal pathway gene expression. We provide evidence that this likely reflects a role for Wnt signaling during late gastrulation. Later overactivation of Wnt signaling during somitogenesis stages can disrupt lateralized Nodal pathway gene expression concordantly in the LPM and brain in both zebrafish and medaka. This is consistent with a role for Spw in the ipsilateral removal of repression of epithalamic Nodal pathway gene expression. Finally, we show that Axin1 is also required downstream of Nodal signaling during the elaboration of epithalamic asymmetries. Our results provide evidence that the Wnt/Axin1/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway plays several critical roles during the establishment and elaboration of asymmetries in the forming CNS.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Alterations to Wnt Signaling Early in Development Disrupt the Asymmetry of Nodal Gene Expression</title><p>Previous studies have shown that Wnt signaling influences early development of the forebrain (reviewed in <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Wilson and Houart, 2004</xref>), but none have examined the influence of this pathway on CNS asymmetries. As a first approach to address this issue, we manipulated Wnt signaling early in development. Activation of the Wnt pathway through early injection of RNA encoding Wnt8b disrupts the left-sided activation of Nodal pathway genes in the body&#x000a0;and brain (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref> in the <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data</xref> available with this article online).

These results suggest that altered Wnt/Axin1/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway activity can affect asymmetric epithalamic gene expression independently of any effects on lateralized Nodal gene expression in the LPM.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>The <italic>mbl</italic> Mutation Can Activate Epithalamic Nodal Signaling Independent of Spw Activity</title><p>The Nodal ligand Spw is expressed in the left LPM but not in the brain of both wild-type and <italic>mbl</italic> mutant embryos (n &#x0003d; 51/54; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>D). However, it is required to&#x000a0;activate Nodal pathway genes in the left epithalamus, either directly (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Long et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>) or indirectly, for instance, through ipsilateral alleviation of repression of epithalamic Nodal pathway gene expression (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Concha et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). If the former is correct, then removal of Spw activity in <italic>mbl</italic> embryos should result in the loss of epithalamic Nodal pathway activation. However, if repression of epithalamic Nodal expression is lost in <italic>mbl</italic> embryos, then Nodal activation should occur independently of Spw activity. To address this issue, we abrogated Spw activity in <italic>mbl</italic>&#x000a0;and sibling embryos.</p><p>Although Spw activity is required to activate epithalamic Nodal signaling in wild-type embryos, this is not the case in the majority of <italic>mbl</italic> embryos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A).

To address the possibility that Wnt signaling may be able to influence LPM asymmetries during the period when they are being established, we temporally manipulated Wnt signaling through bathing embryos in lithium chloride (LiCl) to suppress GSK3&#x003b2; function and thereby activate the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Stambolic et&#x000a0;al., 1996</xref>). While LiCl treatments at blastula/gastrula stages result in posteriorization of the brain (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Macdonald et&#x000a0;al., 1994</xref>), treatments at later stages do not obviously alter CNS morphology (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kim et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>) (data not shown). We treated embryos with LiCl for 15&#x02013;20 min periods between 80% epiboly and 22 somites (<xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref>) and subsequently assessed Nodal pathway gene expression and body and brain asymmetries.</p><p>Asymmetric expression of Nodal pathway genes in the epithalamus, but not the LPM, is disrupted by LiCl treatment at 80% epiboly. About a quarter of embryos treated with LiCl at this stage showed bilateral expression of <italic>lft1</italic> or <italic>pitx2</italic> in the epithalamus at 24 somites (n &#x0003d; 204; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A&#x02013;3E and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref>), but none showed bilateral <italic>pitx2</italic> expression in the LPM (n &#x0003d; 52). This phenocopies <italic>mbl</italic> mutants, lending support to the conclusion that overactivation of Wnt signaling in the anterior neural plate during late gastrulation removes repression of epithalamic Nodal pathway gene expression. At no other stage from late gastrula until 22 somite stage did LiCl treatment affect epithalamic Nodal asymmetries without concomitantly affecting gene expression in the LPM (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the early phase of sensitivity to LiCl treatment, many embryos treated between 12 and 14 somites showed concordant, predominantly bilateral, Nodal pathway gene expression in the brain and LPM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A and 3F&#x02013;3H and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S2 and S3</xref>). As expected from the disruption to Nodal pathway activity, embryos subsequently showed disrupted laterality of CNS and visceral asymmetries (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S3</xref>). This result suggests that decreased GSK3&#x003b2; activity (and enhanced Wnt activity) during a narrow time window at mid-somitogenesis stages disrupts the restriction of Nodal pathway gene expression to the left side of the embryo.</p><p>The laterality of expression of Nodal pathway genes in the brain was concordant with expression in the LPM in these experiments, suggesting that by mid-somite stage, the activation of Nodal signaling in the brain is dependent upon Nodal signaling emanating from the LPM.

Thus, by mid-somite stages, activation of epithalamic Nodal signaling is dependent upon LPM Nodal activity.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>A Role for Wnt/Axin1/&#x003b2;-Catenin Signaling in&#x000a0;Regulating Asymmetry during Early Somitogenesis Is Conserved among Teleosts</title><p>To further validate our conclusions suggesting a temporally restricted role for Wnt signaling and to assess whether such a role is conserved across species, we performed comparable experiments in the distantly related teleost, medaka (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Wittbrodt et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). Asymmetries of gene expression and neuroanatomy in the brain of medaka are similar to those in zebrafish (M.C. and F. Loosli, unpublished data; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Soroldoni et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). As in zebrafish, the parapineal is left-sided, the bilateral habenulae have asymmetries in neuropil organization and show dorsoventral segregation of left and right axon terminals in the target IPN nucleus (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>).

These observations suggest that the regulatory mechanisms underlying the formation of brain asymmetries are likely to be comparable between medaka and zebrafish. However, in medaka, CNS development is advanced with respect to somitogenesis compared to zebrafish, and so, for instance, Nodal pathway genes are activated in the epithalamus at &#x0201c;earlier&#x0201d; somite stages (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Soroldoni et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Ubiquitous activation of <italic>wnt1</italic> in a Tg(HS:GFP, HS:wnt1) line at 2&#x02013;4 somite stage results in bilateral Nodal pathway gene expression in the epithalamus and LPM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>J, 3K, 3M, and 3N).

Of 52 mutant embryos that showed bilateral <italic>lft1</italic>:GFP expression in the dorsal diencephalon at 20 hpf, about 65% showed no migration of parapineal cells at 48 hpf. Twelve embryos with either migrated (n &#x0003d; 3 left and 3 right) or nonmigrated parapineal cells (n &#x0003d; 6) were selected for further analysis. At 4 days of development, all 12 of these embryos exhibited a migrated parapineal.

One possibility is that the parapineal axons that innervate habenular neurons influence gene expression and efferent connectivity of these neurons. We speculated that if this is the case, then delayed innervation of the habenulae in <italic>mbl</italic> embryos may compromise the ability of parapineal axons to influence habenular neuron connectivity.</p><p>To address this issue, we analyzed embryos at the time when parapineal neurons first send projections toward the habenula (between 40 and 50 hpf) and found that migrated and nonmigrated parapineal neurons in <italic>mbl</italic> embryos have projections by 46 hpf comparable to wild-types (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>M and 5N). Thus, parapineal neurons can project axons even if somal migration is disrupted. Furthermore, it is unlikely that mistargeting of <italic>mbl</italic> parapineal axons underlies the failure of the parapineal to influence habenular laterality, as the axons appear to terminate in the same medial region of the habenular neuropil (although neuropil is reduced) as in wild-type embryos (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>O and 5P). These data indicate that Axin1 activity has no obvious effect upon parapineal neuron axogenesis and targeting but is important for the communication from parapineal cells that influences habenular laterality, most likely acting in either the parapineal, the habenulae, or both.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we show that Wnt/Axin1/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling is involved reiteratively during the establishment and concordant elaboration of brain and body asymmetries. Activation of Wnt signaling during late gastrula stages abrogates asymmetry of expression of Nodal pathway genes in the brain but not the LPM, and we suggest that this occurs through the loss of bilateral repression of Nodal pathway activation in the prospective epithalamus. Widespread activation of the pathway during mid-somite stages results in concordant disruption to asymmetric Nodal pathway gene expression in both the LPM and brain, suggesting that by this stage Nodal activation in the brain is dependent upon Nodal signaling in the LPM. Downstream of Nodal pathway activity in the epithalamus, Axin1 is required both for development and concordance of parapineal and habenular asymmetries.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Enhanced Wnt Signaling Can Bilaterally Activate Nodal Signaling in the Brain Epistatic to Spw Loss of Function</title><p><italic>mbl</italic> embryos frequently exhibit bilateral activation of Nodal pathway genes in the brain despite establishment of normal visceral situs. Axin1 is a critical component of the protein complex that degrades &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Nusse, 2005</xref>), and previous studies have demonstrated that <italic>mbl</italic> mutants have enhanced Wnt signaling activity during late gastrulation in the anterior neural plate (<xref rid="bib20 bib22 bib48" ref-type="bibr">Heisenberg et&#x000a0;al., 2001; Houart et&#x000a0;al., 2002; Van de Water et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>). This suggests that enhanced Wnt signaling in the prospective epithalamus can lead to activation of Nodal pathway genes in the epithalamus. Supporting this conclusion is the observation that bilateral epithalamic Nodal activation in the absence of effects on the LPM also occurs when LiCl is used to activate Wnt signaling during late gastrulation.</p><p>During normal development and in most mutants/morphants that have been examined, Nodal pathway expression in the epithalamus is concordant with expression in the LPM (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Halpern et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). The mechanistic basis for this relationship appears to be the requirement for activity of the Nodal ligand Spw in the LPM to activate Nodal pathway genes in the ipsilateral epithalamus (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Long et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Given the dependence of epithalamic Nodal signaling upon LPM Nodal signaling, on first analysis, it appears counterintuitive that Wnt pathway activation at late gastrula stage should only affect the epithalamus and not the LPM, whereas Wnt manipulations at later stages concordantly affect both LPM and epithalamus. However, these results are consistent with a model that we have previously proposed in which LPM Nodal signaling is required to ipsilaterally alleviate a repressor of epithalamic Nodal activation that is present on both sides of the brain (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Concha et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). This model helped to&#x000a0;explain Nodal pathway expression phenotypes in embryos in which Nodal signaling and/or midline tissue was disrupted. For instance, embryos lacking the activity of the Nodal coreceptor Oep bilaterally express epithalamic Nodal pathway genes, suggesting that Nodal signaling is not obligatory for activation of epithalamic Nodal gene expression.</p><p>Our data indicate that the <italic>mbl</italic> mutation is largely epistatic to Spw loss of function; that is, the <italic>mbl</italic> mutation can lead to activation of Nodal pathway gene expression on both sides of the brain in the absence of Spw activity. We interpret this to imply that the bilateral repression of epithalamic Nodal expression is removed by overactivation of Wnt signaling in the prospective epithalamus, rendering redundant the role of Spw as inhibitor of repression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>). In this scenario, Axin1 would function in the prospective epithalamus to modulate Wnt signaling and facilitate the establishment of repression. This is consistent with established roles for Axin1 in the regulation of various regulatory genes in the epithalamic region of the anterior neural plate (<xref rid="bib20 bib34 bib48" ref-type="bibr">Heisenberg et&#x000a0;al., 2001; Masai et&#x000a0;al., 1997; Van de Water et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>). The most parsimonious idea is that the repression established through modulation of Wnt signaling is subsequently alleviated by Spw, but it remains possible that Wnt- and Nodal-dependent mechanisms act in parallel pathways to regulate the repression/activation of Nodal pathway genes in the epithalamus. Indeed, the removal of Spw in <italic>mbl</italic> embryos does reduce the percentage of embryos with epithalamic Nodal activation, suggesting that Spw does retain some activity in the context of enhanced Wnt activity.</p><p>To date, no Wnt/Axin1/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway component has been described as being expressed asymmetrically at any time in any species besides Wnt8 in the early chick node (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez-Esteban et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>) (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>). However, one key feature of our model is that there is no requirement for any asymmetry in the activity of Wnt pathway genes, as repression is required to be bilaterally symmetric. It is the left-sided activity of the Nodal pathway from the LPM at later stages that introduces the asymmetry through removal of repression on the left side of the epithalamus. The right epithalamus remains sensitive to relief from repression, as is evident in situations where Nodal signaling is active in the right LPM, resulting in activation of right-sided epithalamic Nodal signaling. The symmetric activity of Wnt pathway genes in late gastrula neural plate also explains how the <italic>mbl</italic> phenotype can be dissociated from the formation of Kupffer's vesicle (KV) and other events that lead to the establishment of LPM asymmetries (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Tabin, 2006</xref>).</p><p>We speculate that the level, localization, and/or timing of Wnt signaling in the prospective epithalamus establishes a specific level of repression that may be subsequently overcome by unilateral Nodal signaling. This idea is supported by recent data (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Inbal et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref> [this issue of <italic>Neuron</italic>]) showing that Six3b/Six7 activity in the neural plate during late gastrulation is required to repress epithalamic Nodal pathway gene expression. Enhanced Wnt signaling, as seen in <italic>mbl</italic> embryos, suppresses Six gene expression (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Wilson and Houart, 2004</xref>), suggesting that Axin1 activity is required to maintain Six3b/Six7 activity and consequently establish the bilateral repression of epithalamic Nodal pathway gene expression. Furthermore, overexpression of <italic>six</italic> genes can suppress epithalamic Nodal gene expression despite the presence of Spw (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Inbal et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>), supporting the idea that specific levels of Wnt and Six activity are required to establish appropriate levels of repression.</p><p>Finally, the model provides a likely explanation for an unusual aspect of the <italic>mbl</italic> phenotype. Although epithalamic Nodal signaling is frequently bilateral in <italic>mbl</italic> mutants, the laterality of the brain, as assessed by direction of parapineal migration, is still usually to the left. This is unlike other situations where there is bilateral epithalamic Nodal pathway activation and asymmetries are randomized (<xref rid="bib8 bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr">Concha et&#x000a0;al., 2000; Halpern et&#x000a0;al., 2003; Hamada et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). However, in <italic>mbl</italic> mutants, the left and right sides are not equal. Even if the initial repression is affected to an equal extent on both sides of the neural plate, there is still the activity of left-sided Spw encroaching on the left epithalamus. Thus, if any repression remains within the neural plate of <italic>mbl</italic> mutants, it is likely to be more fully alleviated on the left. This could result in stronger activation of Nodal signaling on the left, even in situations where there is expression of Nodal genes on both sides of the epithalamus. Indeed, using manipulations that lead to bilateral <italic>spw</italic> expression, we found that leftward bias in migration of parapineal cells in <italic>mbl</italic> mutants was reduced (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>The Wnt Pathway Influences Nodal Activation in the LPM at Mid-Somite Stages</title><p>Activation of Wnt signaling by LiCl in zebrafish or <italic>wnt1</italic> overexpression in medaka during a narrow time window at mid-somitogenesis stages frequently leads to bilateral activation of Nodal pathway gene expression in both LPM and brain. At these stages, key events such as midline development and formation of KV have already occurred. Indeed, KV is beginning to regress at the time at which we manipulate Wnt signaling (<xref rid="bib4 bib5 bib13" ref-type="bibr">Amack and Yost, 2004; Bajoghli et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Essner et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). The manipulations to Wnt signaling at this stage are therefore more likely to directly effect the induction and/or spread of Nodal signals within the LPM than to affect KV per se.</p><p>Although the most frequent asymmetry defect following somite stage Wnt manipulations is bilateral activation of Nodal pathway genes, we did also observe reversals with right-sided expression in LPM and brain and absence of left-sided expression. In such situations, either the activation of Nodal signaling on the right leads to abrogation of Nodal expression on the left, or the Wnt pathway independently leads to abrogation of Nodal activation on the left and activation on the right. Although we have not investigated this issue, we favor the idea that activation of Nodal signaling on the right may in some cases result in suppression of the pathway on the left. It is generally believed that the spread of Nodal signaling through the LPM is due to positive regulation of Nodal expression by Nodal activity, and so a localized induction or source of Nodal signals can lead to widespread activation of the pathway in the ipsilateral LPM (<xref rid="bib35 bib46" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Tabin, 2006</xref>). Surprisingly, Nodal signaling in the LPM on one side can affect Nodal pathway gene expression in the contralateral LPM, most likely through regulation of Lft genes in midline tissue (<xref rid="bib39 bib53" ref-type="bibr">Ohi and Wright, 2007; Yamamoto et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Thus, it is possible that, in situations where we observed reversed Nodal pathway gene expression, the activation on the right could be responsible for repression on the left.</p><p>How might the Wnt pathway be affecting Nodal pathway activation in the LPM? Perhaps Wnt signaling triggers induction of Nodal pathway gene expression, and, once the pathway is activated, then the normal mechanisms of Nodal pathway autoregulation in the LPM propagate a wave of Nodal activation. Given the intrinsic sensitivity of both left and right LPM to the induction and spread of the wave of Nodal activation (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>), one could envisage that a relatively small change in the regulation of Nodal pathway genes could be amplified by autoregulation and result in activation and spread of Nodal signaling through the LPM. Nodal pathway genes can be regulated by Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in various contexts (<xref rid="bib6 bib26" ref-type="bibr">Branford and Yost, 2002; Kioussi et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). Indeed, in experiments where we mosaically overactivate Wnt signaling, we have observed induction of Nodal pathway genes in both zebrafish and medaka (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>) (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bajoghli et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Following mid-somite stage Wnt pathway manipulations, activation of Nodal pathway gene expression in the epithalamus mirrored the activation in the LPM, consistent with epithalamic activation being dependent upon LPM Spw activity. We have not formally ruled out that these Wnt manipulations might be independently affecting LPM and brain. However, in the rare cases of reversal of LPM Nodal activation, we see concordant epithalamic reversal, suggesting that the two are indeed linked.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>Axin1 Is Required for Development of Concordant CNS Asymmetries Downstream of Epithalamic Nodal Expression</title><p>Although the <italic>mbl</italic> mutation frequently results in bilateral activation of epithalamic Nodal signaling, this does not result in concordant randomization of neuroanatomical asymmetries as happens in other situations with bilateral Nodal signaling in the brain (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Halpern et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). For instance, early activation of Wnt signaling by overexpression of <italic>wnt8b</italic> or early treatment with LiCl, both of which result in bilateral Nodal pathway gene expression and similar or more severe morphological phenotypes than in <italic>mbl</italic> embryos, does not prevent the development of habenular asymmetry (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref>, and data not shown). This implies that Axin1 has additional roles in the development of the lateralized habenulae downstream of Nodal pathway activation. It is well established that Axin1 functions in the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway, but, in some circumstances, the protein may be able to influence additional signaling pathways (<xref rid="bib27 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kofron et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Kusano and Raab-Traub, 2002</xref>).

However, as similar phenotypes have not yet been described in any other mutants or following late LiCl treatments (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref>), the possibility of a noncanonical role for Axin1 in these events remains a possibility.</p><p>The habenulae of <italic>mbl</italic> mutants show a severe reduction in the extent of right/left differences, and parapineal cells are delayed in their migration by as much as 2 days.

However, as the parapineal is present, in some cases migrates correctly, and usually innervates the habenulae in <italic>mbl</italic> mutants, then <italic>axin1</italic> is the first gene to be implicated in the communication between the parapineal and the left habenula.</p><p>An early habenular asymmetry is the precocious generation of neurons on the left (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Aizawa et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>), and so one might predict that, in <italic>mbl</italic> mutants, neurogenesis is delayed and habenular cells continue to divide in a manner characteristic of the wild-type right habenula. Indeed, given the ability of Wnt signaling to promote proliferation in many other contexts (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Willert and Jones, 2006</xref>), one might expect the <italic>mbl</italic> mutant habenulae to show enhanced proliferation more characteristic of the right habenula. However, the formation of habenula precursor cells appears not to be affected in <italic>mbl</italic> mutants as judged by the onset of <italic>cxcr4b</italic> expression, a marker for habenular precursor cells (M. Roussigne and P. Blader, personal communication; data not shown). On the other hand, habenular neurogenesis does appear to be slightly delayed by approximately 2 hr between 32 and 34 hpf as judged by the appearance of HuC&#x0002b; neurons (data not shown). As described previously (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Aizawa et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>), this period is during the time window in which there is a bias to production of early born lateral habenular neurons, and so the slight delay could contribute to the loss of left-sided character. However, it seems unlikely that the delay could completely explain the almost complete lack of left-sided character for <italic>mbl</italic> habenular neurons, as such neurons are generated over a more protracted period of time, extending beyond 34 hpf (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Aizawa et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). The mechanisms by which communication occurs between parapineal and habenular cells are currently not known, and so, although we currently do not know whether the symmetric habenular phenotype of <italic>mbl</italic> embryos is due to Axin1 function in the habenulae, parapineal, or both, we think that the mutant will provide a useful resource for future investigation of such issues.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The Wnt pathway has previously been implicated in patterning the AP and DV axes, and our study reveals novel roles in left/right patterning.

Events in the LPM are shown in the green boxes. Black lines and lettering indicate that the gene/pathway is active, while gray lines and lettering indicate repression/lack of activation.</p><p>In the late gastrula neural plate, Axin1 bilaterally represses Wnt signaling in the epithalamus, allowing the establishment of bilateral repression of epithalamic Nodal expression that is carried through to late somite stages. This repression is overcome on the left side by Spw activity from the LPM.</p><p>In the LPM, the Nodal pathway is activated by Nodal signals emanating from around KV (or the node&#x02014;see <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et&#x000a0;al. [2006]</xref>), and activation is subsequently propagated through the left LPM and is shut down on the right. Manipulations to Wnt signaling at this stage (after regression of KV) can disrupt the propagation of Nodal expression. Not shown is the ability of Nodal signals on one side of the LPM to block activation of the pathway on the other side (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Ohi and Wright, 2007</xref>). Although Spw normally only relieves repression in the left epithalamus, the bilateral symmetry of repression in the epithalamus means that any manipulations or mutations that result in right-sided Spw activity will concordantly lead to right-sided epithalamic activation of Nodal signaling.</p><p>On the right side of the schematic, events downstream of left-sided activation of Nodal signaling are shown. Nodal signaling influences the laterality of parapineal and habenular asymmetries, but not their establishment per se. How Nodal does this is unknown, and it is not clear whether the pathway exerts its effects primarily through actions on the parapineal, the left habenula, or both (dashed arrows). Axin1 is required for the elaboration of asymmetries downstream of Nodal signaling, both for timely migration of parapineal cells (pp) and for the communication between habenula and parapineal that ensure concordant elaboration of neuroanatomical asymmetries.</p><p>The spiral symbolises the ciliary flow in KV; lhab, left habenula; rhab, right habenula; L, left; R, right.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr6"/></fig></floats-wrap></article>
