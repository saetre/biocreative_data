However, the exact mechanisms by which these signals interrelate and contribute to homeostasis are not understood. By performing T cell transfers into TCR transgenic hosts we detected a hierarchical order of homeostatic proliferation for T cells differing in MHC restriction, such that OT1 cells (K<sup>b</sup> restricted) proliferated in P14 (D<sup>b</sup>-restricted TCR) recipients, but not vice versa. Using K<sup>b</sup> mutant mice, we demonstrated that proliferation of OT1 cells in P14 recipients, as well as the ability of host OT1 cells to hinder the proliferation of donor P14 cells, were dependent on OT1-TCR binding to K<sup>b</sup> molecules. However, interclonal T cell competition was not mediated simply by competition for physical access to the MHC-bearing cell. This was shown in parabiotic pairs of OT1 and K<sup>b</sup> mutant mice in which P14 cells failed to proliferate, even though the OT1 cells could not interact with half of the APCs in the system. Thus, we conclude that the interaction between the TCR and restricting MHC molecule influences the ability to compete for trophic resources not bound to the stimulating APC. This mechanism allows a local competitiveness that extends beyond a T cell's specificity.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>J.-P.

More recently, proliferation of transferred T cells was observed in recipient mice containing a full complement of T cells, provided that they were of different TCR specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Instead of a pure intraclonal competition toward their MHC ligand only, subsequent work found a &#x0201c;hierarchy&#x0201d; among T cells that were restricted to putatively different peptide&#x02013;MHC molecule complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Thus, cells of one specificity proliferated in mice harboring T cells of a different specificity, but not vice versa. However, in these studies, some combinations of transfers were not pursued, and the possibility that peptide&#x02013;MHC ligands could be cross-recognized by the given TCRs was not investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>).</p><p>Considering these data, homeostatic proliferation is not simply dependent on lymphokine availability, as interclonal T cell competition appears to depend on the nature of the TCR. Yet, it is unclear whether T cells would compete only for specific peptide&#x02013;MHC molecule complexes or whether TCR contact with cells bearing the MHC restriction element would determine the T cells' subsequent ability to respond to lymphokines and undergo homeostatic proliferation.</p><p>We addressed these hypotheses by comparing the proliferation of transferred T cells in recipient mice expressing the same or different TCRs. We demonstrate a hierarchical competitiveness: OT1 (K<sup>b</sup> restricted) &#x0003e; P14 (D<sup>b</sup> restricted) &#x0003e; F5 (D<sup>b</sup> restricted). The ability of transferred OT1 cells to proliferate in P14 recipients was solely caused by OT1 TCR binding to K<sup>b</sup>, as transferred OT1 cells failed to proliferate in K<sup>b</sup> mutant P14 recipients. Moreover, transferred P14 cells demonstrate homeostatic proliferation in K<sup>b</sup>-mutant OT1 recipients when these had been grafted with K<sup>b</sup>-expressing thymi to allow peripheral OT1 cell reconstitution. Interestingly, using parabiosis of OT1 and K<sup>b</sup>-mutant mice, we demonstrate that homeostatic proliferation of P14 cells is offset even when OT1 cells cannot interact with all MHC-bearing cells.</p><p>Thus, peripheral T cells derive a relative competitiveness that is apparently defined by the TCR's affinity toward restricting MHC molecules. Yet, competition does not operate via direct competition for, or modulation of, the MHC-bearing cell or MHC molecules per se, but by secondary competition for ligands whose availability is restricted both in quantity and location and that are not bound to the MHC-bearing cell.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Hierarchical competition across MHC restriction elements</title><p>We initially compared the ability of different class I&#x02013;restricted TCR transgenic CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells to proliferate in a lymphopenic environment using cells from TCR transgenic Rag<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. As reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), most class I&#x02013;restricted transgenic cells demonstrate homeostatic proliferation under lymphopenic condition (OT1, 2C, A18, and F5), whereas others (HY) do not (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> and not depicted). For TCRs demonstrating homeostatic proliferation, increasing the dose of transferred cells resulted in a decrease in proliferation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Apparently, when numbers increase, T cells are signaled to slow or cease proliferation. This could be caused by the progressive consumption of a soluble factor present in limited supply, accumulation of an inhibitory factor, and/or by increasing competition for restricting MHC molecules/MHC-bearing cells.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Hierarchical competitiveness in homeostatic proliferation of OT1 and P14 T lymphocytes.</bold> (A) Equal numbers of CFSE-labeled lymphocytes from OT1 Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and P14 Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> donors were cotransferred into B6.Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipient mice.

However, division of OT1 cells was clearly evident at all time-points when focusing on cells that are labeled with CFSE and thus donor derived, or by staining for V&#x003b2;<sub>5</sub> to positively identify OT1 cells (as V&#x003b2;<sub>5</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Ly-5.1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) as performed from week 2 onward (not depicted). For each time point, two mice per genotype were analyzed. Proliferation of OT1 cells in P14 Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipients was also detected in further experiments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, B and C</xref>).

A, B and C and D were derived from independent experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2052735f01"></graphic></fig><p>To distinguish between these possibilities, we cotransferred CFSE-labeled OT1 and P14 cells into P14 recipients. OT1 and P14 TCRs differ in the isotype of the restricting MHC molecule. Initially, this experiment was prompted by the idea that a separate niche of peptide&#x02013;MHC complexes might exist for each clone expressing a given TCR specificity. T cell proliferation within a given niche would be possible so long as the number of T cells occupying it remained low. T cells occupying different niches would not interfere with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Indeed, K<sup>b</sup>-restricted OT1 cells divided in mice that had normal numbers of D<sup>b</sup>-restricted P14 cells, whereas cotransferred P14 cells did not divide (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Because the only genetic difference between these two T cell populations is their TCR, proliferation of OT1 cells and lack of proliferation of P14 cells must be caused by a difference in TCR signaling. This differential ability to proliferate excludes the possibilities that proliferation is regulated exclusively by a factor becoming limiting, or the accumulation of an inhibitory factor acting on a receptor expressed by T cells or the APCs, as this should affect both populations. If the model proposing TCR-specific niches was correct, the complementary experiment should result in a similar outcome: P14 cells should divide in OT1 hosts. Surprisingly, with a preformed population of OT1 cells, neither P14 nor OT1 donor cells divided (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Interestingly, both proliferated in an environment prefilled with F5 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>).</p><p>We interpret these results as showing that homeostatic proliferation is not a simple issue of TCR-specific niches being filled. This conclusion relies on the implicit assumption that the OT1 TCR, selected in the thymus on K<sup>b</sup> molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), does not cross-react with D<sup>b</sup> molecules. This will be addressed experimentally below. However, it is evident that there is a hierarchy in the ability of T cells to undergo homeostatic proliferation within the prefilled environment of a recipient differing in TCR specificity in the order OT1 &#x0003e; P14. Our finding is similar to the hierarchical competition described for OT1 and 2C; these TCRs are, however, both restricted to K<sup>b</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Our result is contrary to those reported by Troy and Shen despite using the same TCRs. However, these authors used TCR transgenic cells from Rag-proficient mice in which TCR-&#x003b1; chain rearrangement can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p><p>We found a significant increase in the number of memory T cells (CD44<sup>hi</sup>), or recently activated CD62L<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells (not depicted), in OT1 mice compared with P14 or F5 mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). As overrepresentation of memory OT1 cells in the inoculum might favor the proliferation of OT1 cells in adoptive hosts, we also performed cotransfer experiments with purified naive OT1 cells (CD44<sup>&#x02212;</sup>122<sup>&#x02212;</sup>). However, this led to similar results; naive OT1 cells did not proliferate in OT1 recipients, but they proliferated in P14 mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). We also determined whether hierarchical competition could be observed between T cell populations that have similar numbers of naive and memory T cells, i.e., from P14 and F5 mice. We found that naive P14 cells (CD44<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) divide in F5 recipients (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). However, as for the OT1 and P14 combination before, the reverse experiment, i.e., the transfer of F5 cells into P14 hosts, did not result in proliferation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Thus, we found a second case of hierarchical competitiveness and extended the order to: OT1 &#x0003e; P14 &#x0003e; F5. The observed hierarchy is most likely based on the avidity of each TCR for its restricting MHC molecule loaded with self-/environmental peptides. Unfortunately, comparative affinity measurements that would confirm such a notion are not available. In fact, binding affinities have been determined for a limited number of TCR and MHC/peptide ligands, but the chosen peptides may not reflect the full complement of self-/environmental peptides presented by each MHC molecule as recognized by a given TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Hierarchical competitiveness in homeostatic proliferation of naive OT1, P14, and F5 T lymphocytes.</bold> (A) Total lymphocyte numbers in the same pool of lymph nodes and from spleen of individual animals of the indicated genotype were determined.

In the absence of K<sup>b</sup>, the OT1-TCR was not positively selected in the thymus and no CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were present in the periphery (Fig. S1, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070467/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070467/DC1</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>).

Alternatively, T cells could derive a graded ability to compete for some (diffusible) ligands, whereas they transit through the peripheral lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). These ligands would be available in limited supply and would not be bound to the APCs; the level of competitiveness for these ligands would be determined by the affinity of the TCR toward restricting MHC molecules. It would be possible to differentiate these possibilities by creating a situation where T cells of &#x0201c;higher&#x0201d; hierarchy could not interact with a proportion of the MHC-bearing cells. To generate a balanced situation in which only some APCs express K<sup>b</sup>, we performed parabiosis between K<sup>b</sup>-mutant or control K<sup>b</sup>-sufficient mice and OT1 mice. After several weeks of parabiosis, CFSE-labeled OT1 and P14 cells were transferred into the animals. Interestingly, P14 donor cells did not divide more in K<sup>b</sup>-mutant and OT1 parabiosis pairs compared with control K<sup>b</sup>-sufficient and OT1 parabiosis pairs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Thus, P14 cells are not able to obtain sufficient signals to allow for their division, even in the presence of K<sup>b</sup>-deficient APCs that OT1 cells cannot interact with (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070467/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070467/DC1</ext-link>). Similar parabiosis experiments with K<sup>b</sup>-sufficient, K<sup>bm1</sup>-mutant, and OT1 mice were also performed, resulting in identical outcomes (unpublished data).</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Homeostatic dominance of OT1 cells operates beyond the MHC-bearing cell, indicating a graded, TCR-based competition for a limiting ligand not bound to APCs.</bold> The following parabiotic couples of mice were made: [OT1 Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and K<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>] (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 5), [OT1 Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and K<sup>b&#x0002b;</sup> B6.Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>] (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 2), and [K<sup>b&#x0002b;</sup> B6.Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and K<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>] (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 2). 3 wk after surgery, CFSE-labeled lymphocytes from OT1 Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and P14 Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were cotransferred into the parabionts. Analyses shown were performed 14 d later. Detailed analysis of donor T cell and host DC exchange for individual pairs of parabiotic mice is shown in Fig. S2. All parabiotic couples were prepared at the same time and were injected with the same mixture of donor cells. The experiment was repeated using K<sup>bm1</sup>Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in place of K<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (in the same order as above: <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 7, 3, 2 parabiotic pairs, respectively).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2052735f04"></graphic></fig><p>To determine which factors may rule the level of competitiveness downstream of the TCR, we analyzed cytokine receptor expression before and after transfer. No differences were detected before transfer (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070467/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070467/DC1</ext-link>). Upon transfer into a lymphopenic environment, IL-7R&#x003b1; and -2R&#x003b2; receptor expression was similar for OT1 and P14 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). However, we observed differences between OT1 cells proliferating in T cell&#x02013;proficient P14 recipients and OT1 or P14 cells undergoing lymphopenia-induced proliferation in immunodeficient recipients in respect to IL-7R&#x003b1; downmodulation and gradual increases in IL-2R&#x003b2; expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). Thus, the mechanism of OT1 cell dominance over P14 cells is different to the lymphopenia induced proliferation of both TCR specificities in lymphopenic Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipients. Proliferation in the latter may be lymphokine-only driven, whereas in P14 recipients, lymphokines may not be as abundant and TCR signaling is, as shown above, essential for OT1 cells to dominate over P14 cells. Indeed, we also observed reduced CD5 expression on OT1 cells in P14 Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>K<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> versus P14 Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipients (unpublished data).</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Homeostatic dominance of OT1 cells is controlled by multiple soluble factors.</bold> (A) CFSE-labeled lymphocytes from OT1 Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (filled symbols) and P14 Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (open symbols) were transferred into B6.Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (triangle), OT1 Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (circles), or P14 Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (squares) recipients.

OT1 cell proliferation in the spleen was analyzed on day 19 after transfer as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Two more experiments, comparing nontreated, control rat IgG-injected, and A7R34-injected P14 Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that received OT1 cells, gave similar results (two to four mice per experimental group).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2052735f05"></graphic></fig><p>To determine if other molecules were regulating this clonal competition beyond IL-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), we treated recipient mice with anti&#x02013;IL-7R&#x003b1; antibodies: OT1 cell proliferation in P14 mice was not affected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). This does not exclude that OT1 cells act as a &#x0201c;sink&#x0201d; for IL-7, thereby hindering P14 cell proliferation in OT1 recipients. Unobstructed proliferation of OT1 cells despite IL-7R blockage appears to contradict studies involving IL-7&#x02013;deficient recipient mice. In contrast to these results, however, our experiments lasted longer (day 19 vs. day 5 or 7) and another study, using similar IL-7R blockage, showed limited OT1 cell proliferation on day 6, which was further diminished when recipient mice were IL-15 deficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Thus, other cytokines may have allowed for later homeostatic proliferation in our experiments.</p><p>Collectively, our results suggest that competition based on TCR triggering is mediated by ILs, such as IL-7, -2, and/or -15 as their receptor expression is modulated, yet other soluble factors (e.g., trophic factors) probably play a role and remain to be characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Several important conclusions can be made on basis of our results. First, hierarchical competitiveness operates beyond competition for MHC molecules. Thus OT1 cells, whose TCR is restricted by K<sup>b</sup>, hinder the homeostatic proliferation of P14 cells, restricted to D<sup>b</sup>. A similar conclusion had been made based on the finding of hierarchical competitiveness among OT1 and 2C-TCRs (17). However, even though the antigenic peptides recognized by these K<sup>b</sup>-restricted TCRs are distinct, one does not know whether they compete for overlapping niches of self-peptide&#x02013;MHC molecules. Based on our results, we can formally exclude such a mechanism of competition for the OT1 and P14-TCRs because in the absence of K<sup>b</sup> expression the hierarchical dominance of OT1 cells is no longer seen.</p><p>Second, we demonstrate that hierarchical competitiveness is not caused by the (simple) model of cellular competition for the MHC-bearing cell, or alternatively, by modulation of the stimulating ability of this cell. This conclusion is derived from our experiments using parabiotic pairs of K<sup>b</sup>-deficient and OT1 mice as recipients for OT1 and P14 cells. Even though in such parabiotic pairs OT1 cells cannot interact with K<sup>b</sup>-deficient APCs, representing half of the APCs in the system, these cells were not able to stimulate homeostatic proliferation of P14 cells. Thus, OT1 cells were still able to dominate P14 cells in trans. Therefore, TCR binding to restricting MHC molecules appears only as a primary requirement for homeostatic competitiveness. Here, the TCRs' affinity toward self-MHC molecules, as well as the kinetics of DC interactions, while T cells migrate through the lymphoid organs, would result in a TCR-characteristic level of signaling within the lymphocyte. The overall signal received in this way, however, would only define the cells' relative ability to secondarily compete for trophic ligands essential for homeostatic proliferation, which are available in limited supply and not bound to the stimulating APC.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>B6.Rag2<sup>tm1Alt</sup> (Rag-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice were a gift from A.
