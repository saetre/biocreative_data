Tyrosinase (monophenol oxygenase, EC 1.14.18.1) is the first enzyme in the pathway for melanin synthesis, and the gene encoding this enzyme has been mapped to the mouse albino (c) locus. We have used mouse tyrosinase cDNA clones and genomic sequencing to study the albino mutation in laboratory mice. Within the tyrosinase gene coding sequences, a G to C transversion at nucleotide 308, causing a cysteine to serine mutation at amino acid 103, is sufficient to abrogate pigment production in transgenic mice. This same base pair change is fully conserved in classical albino strains of laboratory mice. These results indicate that a conserved mutation in the tyrosinase coding sequences is responsible for the classical albino mutation in laboratory mice, and also that most albino laboratory mouse strains have been derived from a common ancestor.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0089-a" xlink:role="7295"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0090-a" xlink:role="7296"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0091-a" xlink:role="7297"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0087.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7293"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7294"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0089.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7295"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0090.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7296"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0091.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7297"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00208-0092.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7298"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
