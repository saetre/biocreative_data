This defect in fatty acid oxidation can lead to severe and sometimes fatal disease, especially in young children because they are unable to tolerate a fasting episode. Metabolic complications include very low blood glucose concentrations and generation of toxic by-products. This disorder can result in sudden infant death. Using a process known as gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem cells, the authors have developed a mouse model with the same enzyme deficiency. This mouse model of MCAD deficiency develops many of the same disease characteristics found in affected children. The MCAD-deficient mouse model shows a high rate of newborn loss, intolerance to cold, and the characteristic biochemical changes in the blood, tissues, and urine that are very similar to those found in the human disease counterpart. The MCAD-deficient mouse model will allow researchers to better understand disease mechanisms so that new preventive measures or therapies can be developed.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Tolwani RJ, Hamm DA, Tian L, Sharer JD, Vockley J, et al.

Fatty acid oxidation occurs in mitochondria and consists of a repeating circuit of four sequential steps. There are four straight-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases involved in the initial step.

An animal model for MCAD deficiency is essential to better understand the pathogenesis of MCAD deficiency and to develop better management regimens for human patients. To gain further insight into the mechanisms of this disease, we developed a mouse model of MCAD deficiency by gene targeting in embryonic stem (ES) cells (for reviews &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010023-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010023-b14">14</xref>&#x0005d;).

Correct targeting of the MCAD locus resulted in a duplication of exons 8, 9, and 10 and integration of flanking plasmid and Neo sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010023-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The insertion vector was designed to duplicate exon 8, 9, and 10 at the MCAD locus. Translation of the duplicated exon 8 region results in the formation of premature stop codons resulting in truncation of the MCAD monomer. Specifically, the first premature stop codon arises after translation of only seven amino acids from the duplicated exon 8. The resulting MCAD monomer is missing the C-terminal domain &#x003b1;-helixes that are responsible for making intersubunit contacts to generate the functional MCAD homotetramer.</p><p>ES cell clones were screened by PCR (data not shown) and confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Southern blot analysis used an exon 10 probe (probe A), not present in the targeting vector, hybridized to a 13.2-kb band in addition to the 3.1-kb endogenous band indicating targeted insertion of the vector at the <italic>Acadm</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010023-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Correctly targeted ES cell clones were microinjected into B6 (C57BL/6NTac) blastocysts to generate chimeric mice. Chimeric mice were backcrossed to both 129P2 and B6 inbred mice to produce MCAD<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> and eventually MCAD<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice on a B6/129 mixed background. The studies described here were conducted exclusively on the B6/129 mixed background compared with littermate controls or B6/129 control groups maintained by intercrosses as were the mutants. Perpetuating this mutation as a congenic mutant line on the 129P2 background proved impractical. The 129P2 mice were poor breeders as wild-types, and when introduced, the <italic>Acadm</italic> mutation was nearly lost on this background because of the high rate of neonatal death. Because of the molecular structure of the targeted allele, it proved virtually impossible to distinguish all three potential genotypes. We could clearly detect the presence or absence of the targeted allele, however, whether a particular mouse was MCAD<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or MCAD<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> could not be determined by Southern blot or PCR of genomic DNA. Ultimately MCAD<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were ascertained by immunoblot analysis of offspring with subsequent perpetuation of MCAD<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and MCAD<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice as separate groups.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>RNA Analysis</title><p>RT-PCR amplification from exon 7 to 11 from total heart RNA amplified the expected 600-base pair (bp) fragment in MCAD<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and MCAD<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, and a 1.5-kb fragment in MCAD<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (data not shown). Sequence analysis of the 1.5-kb fragment revealed that the amplified fragment consisted of exon 7 to exon 10 with 280 bp of pGEM plasmid sequence followed by exons 8&#x02013;11.

Thus it is tempting to relate the cardiac problems in the mouse to the apparent broader range of substrate utilization of mouse MCAD. The inconsistent liver and cardiac lesions in these mice is analogous with the significant inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity seen in MCAD deficiency in humans &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010023-b01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010023-b20">20</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In comparisons with our experiences with the other mouse models for acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiencies, the overall phenotype of MCAD<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is less severe than that found in LCAD<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, yet more pronounced than the VLCAD<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or SCAD<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse models &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010023-b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010023-b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010023-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d;.
