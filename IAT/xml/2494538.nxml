This study takes advantage of the recent finding that HIPK2 may repress the &#x003b2;-catenin transcription activity. Thus, we investigated whether HIPK2 overexpression may down-regulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels (a &#x003b2;-catenin target gene) and the role of &#x003b2;-catenin in this regulation, in order to consider HIPK2 as a tool for novel anti-tumoral therapeutical approaches.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The regulation of VEGF expression by HIPK2 was evaluated by using luciferase assay with VEGF reporter construct, after overexpression of the &#x003b2;-catenin transcription factor. Relative quantification of VEGF and &#x003b2;-catenin mRNAs were assessed by reverse-transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses, following HIPK2 overexpression, while &#x003b2;-catenin protein levels were evaluated by western immunoblotting.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>HIPK2 overexpression in tumor cells downregulated VEGF mRNA levels and VEGF promoter activity. The VEGF downregulation was partly depending on HIPK2-mediated &#x003b2;-catenin regulation. Thus, HIPK2 could induce &#x003b2;-catenin protein degradation that was prevented by cell treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG132. The &#x003b2;-catenin degradation was dependent on HIPK2 catalytic activity and independent of p53 and glycogen synthase kinase 3&#x003b2; (GSK-3&#x003b2;) activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results suggest that VEGF might be a target of HIPK2, at least in part, through regulation of &#x003b2;-catenin activity. These findings support the function of HIPK2 as tumor suppressor and hypothesise a role for HIPK2 as antiangiogenic tool in tumor therapy approaches.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Homeodomain interacting protein-kinase 2 (HIPK2) has been initially identified as corepressor for various homeodomain-containing transcriptional regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In the last ten years, HIPK2 has been found to regulate transcription, apoptosis, cell growth, and development, acting both as transcriptional co-repressor and as kinase, through its interaction with a variety of functional proteins [reviewed in ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]]. HIPK2 phosphorylates substrates such as oncosuppressor p53 for activation of its apoptotic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] or promotes proteasomal degradation of proteins such as MDM2 or CtBP, repressing their antiapoptotic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It has been shown that Axin forms a ternary complex with HIPK2 and p53, activating p53-dependent transcription and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In Wnt signalling, Axin interacts with many components of the pathway, including the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor, the serine/threonine kinases casein kinase I&#x003b1; (CKI&#x003b1;) and glycogen synthase kinase 3&#x003b2; (GSK3&#x003b2;), and &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This complex promotes the degradation of &#x003b2;-catenin through multiple, hierarchical phosphorylation events that, once &#x003b2;-catenin is phosphorylated at Ser-37 and Ser-33 by GSK3&#x003b2;, is recognized by &#x003b2;-transducing repeat-containing protein (&#x003b2;-Trcp) and targeted for proteasomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>One essential element of the Wingless-Wnt signalling pathway is &#x003b2;-catenin, a potent oncogene whose accumulation has been implicated in tumorigenesis in a wide variety of human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. &#x003b2;-catenin can be regulated by many biochemical mechanisms, not yet completely understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In most cases, Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway is activated by a mutation in APC tumor-suppressor; in many remaining cases, mutations in &#x003b2;-catenin itself at sites of GSK3&#x003b2; phosphorylation lead to &#x003b2;-catenin cytoplasmic accumulation and activation as transcription factor to induce the expression of several target genes, including <italic>c-myc</italic>, <italic>cyclin D1</italic>, <italic>uPAR</italic>, <italic>c-jun</italic>, and <italic>fra-1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], involved in cell growth.</p><p>Among the &#x003b2;-catenin target genes is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], a potent inducer of angiogenesis both <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Tumor progression is often dictated by increased vascularity following VEGF up-regulation. Thus, due to its role in tumor angiogenesis VEGF is overexpressed in a wide variety of human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The inhibition of VEGF expression has been shown to decrease tumor size in nude mice and inhibit tumor angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These findings underline the effort is undertaken to study the regulation of the signalling pathways involved in tumor angiogenesis in an attempt to propose effective multiple-target strategies for the prevention and treatment of human cancers.</p><p>These findings, along with a recent study showing that HIPK2 represses the transcription of the &#x003b2;-catenin target cyclin D1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], prompted us to investigate the influence of HIPK2 on VEGF expression in tumor cells and the involvement of &#x003b2;-catenin in this regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell cultures and reagents</title><p>Human lung adenocarcinoma H1299 and human breast cancer MCF7 cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 (GIBCO-BRL, Life Technology, Grand Island, NY, USA), human embryonic kidney 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, GIBCO-BRL), all supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (GIBCO-BRL) plus glutamine and antibiotics in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>at 37&#x000b0;C.

The VEGF amplification leads to doublets representing the 165 and 121 VEGF isoforms, as previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].

Therefore, inhibiting the output of the Wnt pathway remains a goal for therapeutical intervention for many tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Increasing evidence indicates that HIPK2 is able to modulate the transcription activity of a growing number of transcription factors involved in cell growth and apoptosis [reviewed in ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]]. Recently, &#x003b2;-catenin activity has been identified as target of HIPK2 transcriptional repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], thus it was shown that HIPK2 suppresses &#x003b2;-catenin-mediated activation of cyclin D1, controlling cell proliferation. In agreement with this report, here we found that HIPK2 might downregulate the &#x003b2;-catenin target VEGF. The &#x003b2;-catenin transcription activity was inhibited by HIPK2-mediated proteasomal degradation, moreover we showed that HIPK2 but not its catalytic inactive mutant was able to downregulate &#x003b2;-catenin protein levels, suggesting that HIPK2 catalytic activity might be involved in &#x003b2;-catenin phosphorylation/degradation. HIPK2 has been shown also by our studies to phosphorylate substrates for either activating their apoptotic function, such as oncosuppressor p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], or promoting proteasomal degradation of antiapoptotic proteins such as MDM2 or CtBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Thus, our effort is since several years to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of HIPK2 in restraining tumor progression in p53-dependent and independent ways. However, whether HIPK2 acts directly or indirectly inside multiprotein regulatory complexes, on &#x003b2;-catenin phosphorylation and therefore activity remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Collectively, the data presented in this study indicated that HIPK2 could repress the &#x003b2;-catenin transcription activity and downregulate VEGF expression in tumor cells. Constitutive activity of &#x003b2;-catenin can exert both proliferative and antiapoptotic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] as well as VEGF expression favours tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Hence, the downregulation of &#x003b2;-catenin by HIPK2, also in p53/null cells, is likely to contribute to the antiproliferative effects of HIPK2. However, the existence of multiple different pathways for both &#x003b2;-catenin and VEGF regulation may provide a fail-safe mechanism in case one of the components along either of the pathways becomes inactivated. Many different mechanisms can contribute to VEGF up-regulation and in this regard we have recently found that HIPK2 can regulate the HIF-1&#x003b1;-induced VEGF expression, inhibiting tumor angiogenesis (L.N. and G.D.O. unpublished results). In conclusion our findings support the potential role of HIPK2 as oncosuppressor and might give important contributions for the development of novel combinatory anti-tumoral therapeutical approaches focused to deal with tumor angiogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RP carried out cell transfection, immunoblotting analysis, and luciferase assays, LN contributed to cell transfection, cell treatments, RT-PCR, and densitometric analyses.
