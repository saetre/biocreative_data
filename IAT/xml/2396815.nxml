Pharmacological and neuropathological evidence suggests that dysfunction of dopaminergic, glutamatergic, or GABAergic transmission underlies its symptomatology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coyle, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ross et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Snyder, 2006</xref>). Genetic epidemiological studies show that schizophrenia has a heritability of &#x0223c;80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cardno and Gottesman, 2000</xref>), and several putative schizophrenia-susceptibility genes have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Norton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ross et al., 2006</xref>). Among these, the dystrobrevin-binding protein 1 (<italic>DTNBP1</italic>) or dysbindin gene, located on chromosome 6p, is a promising candidate from schizophrenia linkage and association studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Straub et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">O'Donovan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwab et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Norton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morris et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Compelling evidence indicates that dysbindin influences neurotransmission and so contributes to the cognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia. In most patients with schizophrenia, the expression level of dysbindin is reduced in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, two regions that have long been associated with psychotic symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Talbot et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weickert et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weickert et al., 2008</xref>). However, no protein coding sequence mutations of the dysbindin gene have been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ross et al., 2006</xref>). Knockdown of dysbindin in cultured cells affects SNAP25 expression and the extracellular glutamate or dopamine levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Numakawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kumamoto et al., 2006</xref>). More recently, it has been shown that the <italic>sandy</italic> (<italic>sdy</italic>) mouse, which harbors a large deletion within the dysbindin gene and has no dysbindin protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2003</xref>), has reduced dopamine levels in the cortex and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murotani et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, dysbindin is located on the synaptic vesicles, postsynaptic densities (PSDs), and microtubules of apparent glutamatergic neurons in the hippocampus. It binds to snapin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Starcevic and Dell'Angelica, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Talbot et al., 2006</xref>), a SNARE-associated protein implicated in neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ilardi et al., 1999</xref>). The results of biochemical assays suggest that dysbindin is associated with transmitter release in a population of cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Numakawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kumamoto et al., 2006</xref>). These findings, combined with the prevailing hypothesis that schizophrenia is a subtle disease of synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frankle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harrison and Weinberger, 2005</xref>), prompted us to investigate the role of dysbindin in neurotransmitter release.</p><p>In the present study, using real-time measurements (electrochemical amperometry and patch clamp recording) and electron microscopy, we discovered that <italic>sdy</italic> mice had larger vesicle size, slower quantal release, fewer release events and reduced readily releasable pool (RRP) in single cells of both the adrenal gland and the hippocampus. These results reveal details of the functions of dysbindin in neurotransmitter release and may provide new insights into our understanding of the cognitive abnormalities in schizophrenia at the synaptic level.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Lack of dysbindin changes kinetics of quantal vesicle release in chromaffin cells</title><p>Amperometry provides high temporal and spatial resolution in directly detecting vesicular release from various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wightman et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Augustine and Neher, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chow et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artalejo et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albillos et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). Amperometric measurements have another advantage, as they detect exclusively presynaptic release without contamination from the postsynapse. Therefore, taking advantage of amperometric recordings in the adrenal slice, a physiological and widely used model for studying stimulus-secretion coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moser and Neher, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbara et al., 1998</xref>), we first determined whether dysbindin regulates the characteristics of single vesicle fusion events. Local application of high-K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> solution elicited amperometric spikes in a wild-type (WT) chromaffin cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Three parameters of amperometric spikes were analyzed: half-height duration (HHD) and rise time (RT), which reflect the fusion kinetics; and quantal size (Q), which reflects the vesicle content released in each spike (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). The shape of spikes changed markedly, with a longer HHD (WT, 13 &#x000b1; 1 ms; <italic>sdy</italic>, 20 &#x000b1; 2 ms) and a larger Q (WT, 0.52 &#x000b1; 0.05 pC; <italic>sdy</italic>, 0.68 &#x000b1; 0.06 pC) in <italic>sdy</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). However, no noticeable difference was detected in RT (WT, 3.1 &#x000b1; 0.4 ms; <italic>sdy</italic>, 3.2 &#x000b1; 0.3 ms). These data suggest that dysbindin plays a role in the regulation of single vesicle release kinetics and Q in chromaffin cells.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Dysbindin-deficient chromaffin cells display slow release kinetics and reduced depolarization-induced secretion.</bold> (A) A typical amperometric recording in response to a 20-s stimulus of 80 mM K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in a WT chromaffin cell.

Compared with WT cells, the evoked total amperometric spike charge was reduced by &#x0223c;30% in <italic>sdy</italic> cells (WT, 49 &#x000b1; 8 pC; <italic>sdy</italic>, 32 &#x000b1; 4 pC; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>). Similarly, <italic>sdy</italic> cells displayed a modest reduction in the number of amperometric spikes (WT, 20 &#x000b1; 3 events per cell; <italic>sdy</italic>, 14 &#x000b1; 1 events per cell), which suggests a decreased vesicle release probability caused by dysbindin deficiency (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>). In contrast, voltage-gated Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> currents were unaffected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>), demonstrating that the observed secretory defects in the absence of dysbindin were not caused by changes in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx. Collectively, these amperometric data suggest that dysbindin regulates large dense-core vesicle (LDCV) secretion in terms of total amount of secretion, vesicular release probability, and the kinetics and size of single fusion events.</p></sec><sec><title>Intracellular dialysis of purified full-length dysbindin rescues the <italic>sdy</italic> phenotype of LDCV secretion</title><p>To confirm that the aforementioned phenotype in <italic>sdy</italic> mice was directly caused by the lack of dysbindin, we intracellularly applied purified full-length dysbindin protein (352 amino acids, RefSeq available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_025772">NM_025772</ext-link>; Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711021/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711021/DC1</ext-link>) into chromaffin cells by patch pipette. Similar to previous approaches in which dialysis of glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2007</xref>) or microinjection of peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ilardi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang and Zhou, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krapivinsky et al., 2006</xref>) for a certain amount of minutes was sufficient to regulate exocytosis in neurons or chromaffin cells, we recorded vesicle release events after dysbindin application over a period of minutes. After stable whole-cell recording was established, amperometric responses were evoked by a 2-s depolarization every 5 min for &#x0223c;30 min. The temporal effect of dysbindin dialysis on the characteristics of single amperometric spikes is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>. Perfusion of 0.2 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l dysbindin for 5 min significantly decreased the HHD and Q in <italic>sdy</italic> cells. No further difference was observed between the 5- and 10-min time points. As a control, dialysis of heat-denatured dysbindin at the same concentration failed to rescue (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, gray). The mean signal curve of <italic>sdy</italic> amperometric spikes recorded after 5 and 10 min of dysbindin dialysis was similar to that of untreated WT cells, clearly showing efficient rescue of the exocytotic kinetics (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). When exogenous dysbindin was applied in WT cells, no significant change in HHD, RT, or Q was found (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). This suggests that higher concentrations of dysbindin, i.e., endogenous plus dialyzed dysbindin, do not affect these parameters. Collectively, these data show that dysbindin is involved in the regulation of single vesicle fusion kinetics and Q in chromaffin cells. Note, the absolute HHD times of WT or <italic>sdy</italic> were slightly different between <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, which is probably due to the different stimulation protocols (whole-cell depolarization pulse vs. high KCl application).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Microdialysis of purified dysbindin protein rescues the slow kinetics and reduced Q but not the probability and total amount of release in <italic>sdy</italic> mice.</bold> (A) Time course of the effects of intracellular dysbindin (black line) or heat-denatured dysbindin (gray line) on the kinetics of amperometric spikes and Q in <italic>sdy</italic> chromaffin cells.

This failure to rescue release probability and total amount of secretion may be due to the lack of dysbindin disrupting the biogenesis of synaptic vesicles, and its addition for a time period of minutes cannot reverse this effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Morphological changes in LDCVs of <italic>sdy</italic> chromaffin cells</title><p>Defects in LDCV secretion might result from changes in number, size, or spatial distribution of chromaffin vesicles. To differentiate among these possibilities, we performed electron microscopy on adrenals from WT and <italic>sdy</italic> mice. The gross morphology of <italic>sdy</italic> chromaffin cells was similar to that of the WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). The size distribution of LDCVs in <italic>sdy</italic> mice showed an &#x0223c;10% increase in vesicle diameter (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>).

Therefore, changes in the kinetics of single vesicle release in dysbindin-deficient cells suggest that this may affect the fusion process (i.e., fusion pore dynamics), as the slowing of quantal release kinetics (increased HHD and decay time) is consistent with a function of dysbindin in modulating fusion pore closure to allow kiss-and-run exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgoyne and Barclay, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2005</xref>).

This result, together with the normal morphology of docked vesicles in <italic>sdy</italic> mice, also suggests a postdocking function of dysbindin, probably in the priming process (i.e., the stability of release-ready vesicles).</p><p>It is conceivable that these functions of dysbindin in the priming and fusion steps may be mediated by its interaction with the SNARE proteins and/or other synaptic vesicle proteins involved in exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burgoyne et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgoyne and Barclay, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonanomi et al., 2006</xref>). In our experiments, we did not find any changes in the steady-state levels of these exocytotic regulators, including SNARE proteins (SNAP25, syntaxin-1, and VAMP2), synaptotagamin-1, VGLUT1, munc18-1, dynamin-1, and complexin1/2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). However, we did confirm that snapin is a binding partner of dysbindin (unpublished data; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Talbot et al., 2006</xref>). Snapin is identified as a ubiquitously expressed SNAP25-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ilardi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buxton et al., 2003</xref>). It has been proposed that snapin stabilizes the release-ready vesicles by enhancing the interaction of the SNARE proteins with synaptotagmin during the priming process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tian et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, dysbindin may modulate vesicle priming by its interaction with snapin.</p><p>Dysbindin is a subunit of biogenesis of lysosome-related organelle complex-1 (BLOC-1). We previously reported that the <italic>sdy</italic> mouse displays defects in lysosome-related organelles biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, our observed alteration in vesicle structure may arise from deficiency-induced alteration in vesicle structure and reflect defective biogenesis of synaptic vesicles and LDCVs via a BLOC-1&#x02013;dependent pathway. Besides, dysbindin also binds to the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DPC), a component of the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benson et al., 2001</xref>). DPC is required for proper maturation and function of a subset of inhibitory synapses because the cerebellar synapse is defective in mice lacking &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-dystrobrevin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grady et al., 2006</xref>). This might explain the decreased width of the synaptic cleft and increased thickness of PSDs in the <italic>sdy</italic> hippocampal asymmetrical synapse (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). These morphological changes in the postsynapse and synaptic cleft predict a change in postsynaptic function. However, our electrophysiological recordings show no changes at the postsynaptic site in <italic>sdy</italic> hippocampus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4 B</xref> and S2). Future work is needed to address this puzzle.</p><p>Our results reveal that dysbindin deficiency produces a specific set of &#x0201c;dysbindin-related defects&#x0201d; in neurotransmitter release, including slow fusion kinetics, increased Q, decreased release probability, and smaller RRP. These abnormalities might cause an abnormal efficacy of synaptic transmission in <italic>sdy</italic> synapses. As it is generally proposed that schizophrenia is a disorder of synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frankle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harrison and Weinberger, 2005</xref>), our findings present the first description that part of the <italic>sdy</italic> endophenotypes of transmitter release might contribute to schizophrenia-like traits. However, further studies should be performed for whether/what dysbindin-related defects in exocytosis lead to the cognitive impairments or psychotic symptoms seen in humans.</p><p>Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous syndrome with subtle behavioral and psychotic abnormalities. Genetic variation of dysbindin has been associated with negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DeRosse et al., 2006</xref>). These negative symptoms are difficult to identify in mice with any known diagnostic laboratory tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ross et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, although our initial behavioral observations, including prepulse inhibition, did not show differences between <italic>sdy</italic> and WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2003</xref>), more elaborate tests need to be performed to see whether <italic>sdy</italic> mice have any equivalent of psychotic symptoms. Nevertheless, our findings have indicated that the <italic>sdy</italic> mutant, originally identified as a model of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2003</xref>), may also be useful for studying the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, particularly in the area of neurotransmitter release.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals and slice preparations</title><p>The <italic>sdy</italic> mutant and control DBA/2J mice (WT) were originally obtained from the Jackson Laboratory, transferred from R.T.
