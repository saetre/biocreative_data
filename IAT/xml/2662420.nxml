We previously reported BAG3 overexpression protected ubiquitinated clients, such as AKT, from proteasomal degradation and conferred cytoprotection against heat shock. We hypothesized that the BAG3 protein is regulated by proteolysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Staurosporine (STS) was used as a tool to test for caspase involvement in BAG3 degradation. MDA435 and HeLa human cancer cell lines exposed to STS underwent apoptosis with a concomitant time and dose-dependent loss of BAG3, suggesting the survival role of BAG3 was subject to STS regulation. zVAD-fmk or caspase 3 and 9 inhibitors provided a strong but incomplete protection of both cells and BAG3 protein. Two putative caspase cleavage sites were tested: K<underline>E</underline>V<underline>D</underline> (BAG3<sup>E345A/D347A</sup>) within the proline-rich center of BAG3 (PXXP) and the C-terminal L<underline>E</underline>A<underline>D</underline> site (BAG3<sup>E516A/D518A</sup>). PXXP deletion mutant and BAG3<sup>E345A/D347A</sup>, or BAG3<sup>E516A/D518A</sup> respectively slowed or stalled STS-mediated BAG3 loss. BAG3, ubiquitinated under basal growth conditions, underwent augmented ubiquitination upon STS treatment, while there was no increase in ubiquitination of the BAG3<sup>E516A/D518A</sup> caspase-resistant mutant. Caspase and proteasome inhibition resulted in partial and independent protection of BAG3 whereas inhibitors of both blocked BAG3 degradation. STS-induced apoptosis was increased when BAG3 was silenced, and retention of BAG3 was associated with cytoprotection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>BAG3 is tightly controlled by selective degradation during STS exposure. Loss of BAG3 under STS injury required sequential caspase cleavage followed by polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.

The protective effect of BAG3 was also observed when cells were exposed to heat shock.

We demonstrate a requirement for sequential caspase cleavage followed by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation under STS stress. Interruption of both pathways is required to restore BAG3 and overcome the apoptotic drive.

Caspases 3, 9 and 7 were cleaved earlier and at lower STS doses than caspases 8 or 10, confirming the expected predominant activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. A similar effect was observed in HeLa cells.

MG-132 pretreatment in the absence of STS caused accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated BAG3, indicating that some BAG3 ubiquitination occurs basally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005136-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 1). Augmented ubiquitination of BAG3 was demonstrated with the combination of STS and MG-132 arguing that BAG3 is targeted to the proteasome under STS stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005136-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 4 v. lane 1). We next investigated the complementarity of pharmacological inhibition of both caspases and the proteasome on BAG3 rescue. Some protection of BAG3 was seen with proteasome inhibition alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005136-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), while there was no BAG3 degradation when zVAD and MG-132 were used in combination. A plot of these data demonstrates progressive loss of BAG3 in the presence of MG-132. This is attenuated with the combination of zVAD and MG-132. These results were recapitulated when lactacystin was used as a proteasomal inhibitor. Disappearance of BAG3 signal caused by STS was prevented by pre-treatment with lactacystin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005136.s003">Figure S3A</xref>).

Apoptotic bodies in DAPI-stained STS-treated cells were counted in wild type MDA435 and MDA_FL overexpressors. A progressive reduction in apoptotic bodies was observed upon STS treatment with added zVAD, or zVAD plus MG-132, supporting a role for the loss of BAG3 augmenting STS cell injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005136-g006">Figure 6A,B</xref>).

We hypothesized that decreased cellular survival in response to STS was due to destruction of BAG3 protein through STS-stimulated caspase activation. This was confirmed through demonstration that BAG3 was lost in response to STS, in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, temporally correlated with activation of caspases 3, 9, and 7. The involvement of caspases in BAG3 degradation was established by protection of BAG3 in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD and by mutagenesis of putative caspase recognition sites. However, BAG3 was not completely protected by individual caspase inhibitors or by mutation of the caspase 3 site KEVD (BAG3<sup>KAVA</sup>). This led to the conclusion that other proteolytic events were required. Inclusion of proteasome inhibitors provided partial protection of BAG3 protein that was complementary with zVAD. BAG3 was polyubiquitinated in MDA435 cells in the absence of stress, consistent with proteasome involvement in basal BAG3 turnover; progressive ubiquitination and subsequent BAG3 loss was observed with STS. Little or no ubiquitination of caspase-resistant BAG3<sup>LAAA</sup> was observed, while increased ubiquitination was seen in BAG3<sup>KAVA</sup> as expected because of its partial protection from caspase cleavage and loss. Since absence of BAG3 cleavage precluded ubiquitination, these data argue a requirement for sequential caspase cleavage followed by ubiquitination. Protection of BAG3 translated into cellular protection against STS-induced apoptosis. In forced BAG3 expression experiments, cytoprotection correlated with the molecular construct most resistant to degradation. In contrast, silencing BAG3 augmented STS-mediated apoptosis. Together these data confirm that BAG3 functions as a pro-survival protein, the presence of which is regulated by caspase cleavage followed by ubiqutination and proteasomal degradation. It further suggests that impaired BAG3 degradation is central in the protection of cancer cells against intrinsic apoptotic pathway stress.</p><p>Many important signaling proteins are controlled by polyubiquitination, including p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005136-Haupt1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, p21<sup>cip1</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005136-Bendjennat1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, c-Jun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005136-Gao1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, and c-fos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005136-Basbous1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.
