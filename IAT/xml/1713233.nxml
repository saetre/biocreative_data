It is a multi-step process that consists of: the hatching of the blastocyst from the <italic>zona pellucida</italic>, adhesion of the blastocyst to the uterine epithelium, stromal invasion and reorganization. This process is orchestrated through the coordinated, reciprocal interaction between the embryo and uterus and is mediated via a variety of molecules including steroid hormones, cytokines, adhesion molecules, proteinases and their inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Proteinases of different classes have been hypothesized to give the blastocyst its invasive character and/or participate in the remodelling of the uterine stroma. Alfonso et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] have reported that cysteine proteinases play a critical role in implantation, and there have been several reports implicating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Different serine proteinases are also known to be expressed in a finely regulated pattern during implantation, including urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and proprotein convertase SPC5/6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, the targeted disruption of several murine proteinase genes, presumed essential for implantation, has indicated that many are dispensable, suggesting that other distinct proteinases may be involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>In order to discover additional serine proteinases with potential involvement in implantation, we identified two novel implantation serine proteinase genes (ISP1 and 2). These were found to be co-expressed in mouse uterine endometrium throughout the peri-implantation period and tandemly organized within a bed of tryptase genes on mouse chromosome 17A3.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. ISP1 gene expression was first detected in pre-implantation embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Antisense disruption of ISP1 gene expression prevented embryo hatching and outgrowth <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Both ISP1 and 2 gene expression was also detected in the uterine endometrial gland, under the positive influence of progesterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Using immunoblotting, both ISP proteins were detected in the uterine fluid on day 4 of pregnancy, just prior to the commencement of implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This appearance of protein in the glands and uterine fluid seems to be negatively regulated by estrogen, such that both ISP proteins appear in the uterine fluid shortly after the estrogen spike synchronizes uterine-embryo receptivity and the commencement of implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Interestingly, antibodies directed against ISP2 protein have recently been found to abrogate implantation, suggesting an important role for the ISPs in implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Mast cell tryptases are known to exist in multimeric form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Since the ISPs are co-expressed in endometrial glands, we previously hypothesized that they exist as hetero-tetramers, a theory that was supported by protein modelling studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In this study, we have purified a heterodimeric 63 kD ISP enzyme complex from day four pregnant mouse uterus, which is comprised of ISP1 (30 kD) and ISP2 (33 kD) monomers. The same enzyme complex was detected in uterine fluid and pre-implantation embryos. Enzyme kinetic studies have demonstrated the affiliation of ISP enzyme complex with S1 proteinases, having trypsin-like substrate specificity. Immunohistochemistry suggests the ISP enzyme complex localizes to the site of embryo invasion during implantation. Gabexate mesylate, a potent tryptase inhibitor, was found to inhibit ISP activity, and arrest hatching and outgrowth of embryos <italic>in vitro</italic>, and implantation <italic>in utero</italic>. These results demonstrate that ISP enzyme complex plays a critical role in initiating murine implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Characterization and Purification of the ISP1-ISP2 enzyme complex</title><p>We have characterized the expression of the ISPs in uterine tissue, uterine fluid and blastocysts. Uterine tissue homogenate and intra-uterine fluid from CD1 mice at the peri-implantation period were probed for the presence of ISPs using mAbs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Under denaturing conditions, monomers of both ISP1 (30 kD) and ISP2 (33 kD) proteins were found in highly enriched uterine tissue homogenates and uterine fluid. In addition to the monomers, an upper band (~63 kD), presumably a complex of ISP1 and ISP2 was also obtained when either anti-ISP1 or anti-ISP2 mAb were used to probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This 63 kD band exhibits proteolytic activity in gel when N-Benzoyl Arginine p-Nitroanilide (BAPNA) is used as a substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The other two bands obtained (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) were identified as IgG light (27 kD) and heavy (54 kD) chains by mass spectrometry analysis. The existence of IgGs in the uterine tissue homogenates and uterine fluid can be explained by the vascular nature of pre-implantation uteri, such that blood serum products are found in high abundance. A similar enzyme complex was also detected in mouse blastocysts in western blots using denaturing conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). As we had previously not detected ISP2 expression in the embryo, we used RT-PCR to confirm that ISP2 was indeed expressed in the preimplantation embryo (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Following upon our previous observation of ISP1 and ISP2 co-expression in uterine glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and now embryos (this study), as well as this higher molecular weight complex in the gels, we used co-immunopreciptation to investigate the possibility that ISP monomers formed hetero-dimeric complexes. Co-IPs were performed by cross-linking anti-ISP mAbs to activated agarose beads followed by affinity purification of the respective proteins from the uterine tissue homogenates. The bound antibodies were able to precipitate their cognate protein targets (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), as well as their corresponding opposite ISP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). These results lend credence to the idea that ISP1 and ISP2 hetero-dimerize to form a higher molecular weight enzyme.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Characterization of uterine ISP expression</bold>.

These included an inhibitor affinity method using Benzamidine-sepharose (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), ion exchange chromatography (DEAE sepharose and CM-sepharose), and hydrophobic interaction chromatography.

In this report, we show that the ISPs are also co-expressed in pre-implantation embryos, consistent with the idea that they may also be co-regulated in the pre-implantation embryo. These observations are consistent with our observation that ISP1 and ISP2 form a hetero-dimeric complex. Upon purification of ISP enzyme complex from pregnant uterus and confirmation by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry, we determined its molecular weight to be ~63 kD, with the ISP1 and ISP2 monomers being ~30 and 33 kD, respectively. These molecular weights are consistent with our previous study, where we characterized the appearance of ISP monomers in uterine fluid during the peri-implantation period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, our results contradict a previous report of ISP2 as having a molecular weight of 48 kD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>We have suggested that the ISPs are members of the mast cell tryptase family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and have demonstrated that the ISP genes reside in a tryptase cluster on mouse chromosome 17A3.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In this study we have used synthetic substrates to classify ISP enzyme complex based on its enzymatic activity. Consistent with our previous suggestions, we have sub-classified ISP enzyme complex as being trypsin-like since; it does not show any reactivity with synthetic serine proteinase substrates specific for chymotrypsin, subtilisin or elastase. Hence, ISP enzyme can only cleave peptides that contain arginine or lysine at the P1 position, with arginine being the preferred choice. Amongst the substrates tested, BPVANA has the highest affinity towards the enzyme (Km = 0.06 mM) demonstrating preference of a tripeptide having valine at P2 position and phenylalanine at P3 position over the other peptide substrates. Currently, work is in progress to further define the substrate preferences of ISP using phage display peptide mimetics.</p><p>The ISP genes are most closely related to their neighbours MMCP6 and 7, which have previously been shown to exist as homo-tetrameric enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Based on previous <italic>in silico </italic>molecular modelling, we have postulated that ISP1 and ISP2 exist as hetero-tetramers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Following on our finding that the ISPs do not seem to tetramerize <italic>in vitro</italic>, we have examined the properties of tryptases, which promote tetramer formation. Although the ISPs possess the hydrophobic domain containing eight Trp residues important for tetramer formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], they lack two of the three surface-exposed His residues that are necessary for MMCP6 tetramerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Interestingly, in this regard, at least one other tryptase in this cluster, tryptase &#x003b3;, has been speculated to form only dimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Although we demonstrate at this time that ISP1 and ISP2 form heterodimers, we do not know if this is exclusive, or whether the ISPs can also homodimerize. Our observation that ISP1 and ISP2 mAbs can block embryo hatching and/or outgrowth, only when applied in combination, suggests the possibility that homo-dimers not only exist, but can also function in embryo hatching and invasion.</p><p>Previously, we have reported that the antisense abrogation of ISP1 expression in blastocysts resulted in the inhibition of hatching from the <italic>zona pellucida </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>outgrowth into extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We have suggested that embryonic ISP enzyme represents the murine hatching enzyme strypsin, which is secreted from blastocysts and predicted to be ~74 kD based on autoradiography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In this study, several general trypsin inhibitors including Benzamidine, APMSF, TLCK, Gabexate mesylate, BABIM and TSI showed an inhibitory influence on ISP activity. Amongst them TSI exhibited the highest affinity for the ISP enzyme complex (Ki = 2.18 &#x003bc;M). Our results agree with the previous characterization of stypsin, which demonstrated that trypsin inhibitors had a significant inhibitory effect on blastocyst hatching. Like ISP, TSI was the strongest inhibitor of strypsin activity. Like strypsin, ISP demonstrates the highest affinity towards inhibitors of 'trypsin like' activity; and doesn't catalyse the cleavage of chymotrypsin or elastase substrates.</p><p>In this study, we have confirmed a role for ISP in embryo hatching and outgrowth. When exposed to gabexate mesylate, a synthetic inhibitor of tryptases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and ISP (this study), both <italic>in vitro </italic>embryo hatching and outgrowth were almost completely inhibited. Similarly, administration of anti-ISP1 and anti-ISP2 monoclonal antibodies also led to a delay in hatching and outgrowth <italic>in vitro</italic>. Together these results suggest that ISP plays a vital role during embryo implantation, likely at the level of <italic>zona pellucida </italic>lysis and the initiation of invasion into uterine endometrium.</p><p>Interestingly, immunohistochemistry of implanting embryos shows that ISP enzyme complex surrounds the invading embryo, highlighting their importance in implantation. At this time, it is not clear whether this peri-implantation ISP staining is strictly from the embryo or whether ISP complex that resides in uterine fluid is also recruited to sites of embryo invasion. However, inhibition of ISP activity <italic>in vivo </italic>via the topical application of gabexate had a significant negative effect on implantation. Although we cannot rule out the involvement of other proteinases in the process of hatching and implantation at this time, ISP appears to be an essential link in the cascade of events. Presently, we are disrupting the ISP genes to genetically confirm their role in hatching and implantation. We are also characterizing the substrates and protein targets of ISP in order to better understand the process of implantation. This could in turn lead to the design of more specific synthetic inhibitors of ISP and the development of new and more potent contraceptives.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Substrates and Inhibitors</title><p>p-Nitroanilide substrates, Benzamidine Hydrochloride, TLCK (N -p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone), APMSF (4-Amidino-Phenyl)-Methane-Sulfonyl Fluoride), Trypsin Soybean Inhibitor (TSI) and Gabexate mesylate were obtained from Sigma Aldrich and Co.

The precipitated fractions were re-suspended and subjected to column chromatography using the Duo Flow FPLC system (Bio-Rad). The purification involved sequential ion exchange (DEAE Sepharose), desalting (Sephadex G-25) and gel filtration (Superdex-200 and Superdex-75) chromatography.
