The smaller isoform, MRJ(S), is studied mainly for its possible role in Huntington's disease. There are no reports of any biologic activity of the longer isoform, MRJ(L). We investigated whether this molecule plays any role in breast cancer. Our studies were prompted by interesting observations we made regarding the expression of MRJ in breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer tissue microarrays, as described below.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Expression of MRJ(L) from several breast cancer cell lines was evaluated using real-time PCR. Relative levels of the small and large isoforms in breast cancer cell lines were studied using Western blot analysis. A breast cancer progression tissue microarray was probed using anti-MRJ antibody. MRJ(L) was ectopically expressed in two breast cancer cell lines. These cell lines were evaluated for their <italic>in vitro </italic>correlates of tumor aggressiveness, such as invasion, migration, and anchorage independence. The cell lines were also evaluated for <italic>in vivo </italic>tumor growth and metastasis. The secreted proteome of the MRJ(L) expressors was analyzed to elucidate the biochemical changes brought about by re-expression of MRJ(L).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that MRJ(L) is expressed at a significantly lower level in aggressive breast cancer cell lines compared with normal breast. Furthermore, in clinical cases of breast cancer expression of MRJ is lost as the grade of infiltrating ductal carcinoma advances. Importantly, MRJ staining is lost in those cases that also had lymph node metastasis. We report that MRJ(L) is a protein with a functional nuclear localization sequence. Expression of MRJ(L) via an exogenous promoter in breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and in MDA-MB-435 (a cell line that metastasizes from the mammary fat pad) decreases their migration and invasion, reduces their motility, and significantly reduces orthotopic tumor growth in nude mice. Moreover, the secreted proteome of the MRJ(L)-expressing cells exhibited reduced levels of tumor progression and metastasis promoting secreted proteins, such as SPP1 (osteopontin), AZGP1 (zinc binding &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-glycoprotein 1), SPARC (osteonectin), NPM1 (nucleophosmin) and VGF (VGF nerve growth factor inducible). On the other hand, levels of the secreted metastasis-suppressor KiSS1 (melanoma metastasis suppressor) were increased in the secreted proteome of the MRJ(L)-expressing cells. We confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis that the secreted profile reflected altered transcription of the respective genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Collectively, our data indicate an important role for a totally uncharacterized isoform of DNAJB6 in breast cancer. We show that MRJ(L) is a nuclear protein that is lost in breast cancer, that regulates several key players in tumor formation and metastasis, and that is functionally able to retard tumor growth.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian relative of DnaJ (MRJ) is a class II DnaJ/heat shock protein (Hsp)40 family protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The human <italic>MRJ </italic>gene has been mapped to chromosome 7q36.3 and encodes two spliced variants (reported in GenBank) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]: isoform a (referred to here as MRJ [L]) and isoform b (MRJ [S]). Murine MRJ has been shown to be essential for murine placental development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. MRJ(S) has also been implicated as an important chaperone in Huntington's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Over-expressed MRJ(S) effectively suppressed polyglutamine-dependent protein aggregation, caspase activity, and cellular toxicity in neurons. MRJ(S) specifically has also been shown to regulate keratin-8/18 filament organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Interesting recent studies have shown a role for MRJ(S) in blocking calcineurin-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>All studies of MRJ have focused on the shorter isoform (isoform b, 242 amino acids). Our study elucidates the role of the longer isoform (isoform a, 326 amino acids) in breast cancer cells. Here, we report for the first time that MRJ(L) levels are almost undetectable in aggressive breast cancer cells and in advanced grade infiltrating ductal carcinoma. MRJ(L) localizes to the nucleus and suppresses tumorigenicity and metastasis of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, cells expressing MRJ(L) show an altered profile of the secreted proteome. Several secreted proteins that are known to play important roles in promoting cancer progression are downregulated. This is concomitant with upregulation of a breast and melanoma metastasis suppressor protein, namely KiSS1 (melanoma metastasis suppressor; metastin).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells were maintained as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Transfected cells were grown in presence of 500 &#x003bc;g/ml G418 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cells of lines MCF10.DCIS.com, MCF10CAcl.a, and MCF10CAcl.d were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 with 5% horse serum, cholera toxin (100 ng/ml), insulin (10 &#x003bc;g/ml), hydrocortisone (500 ng/ml) and epidermal growth factor (EGF; 25 ng/ml). MCF7 was cultured in DMEM/F12 containing 5% horse serum and insulin (10 &#x003bc;g/ml). All cells were maintained at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% carbon dioxide in a humidified atmosphere.</p><p>MCF10DCIS.com (locally aggressive) and metastatic variants MCF10CAcl.a and MCF10CAcl.d are isogenic cell lines derived from <italic>in vivo </italic>passages of MCF10AT (tumorigenic) in nude mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These cell lines were obtained from the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute (Detroit, MI, USA).</p><p>MDA-MB-435 was reported to be derived from the pleural metastases of a 46-year-old woman with breast carcinoma. It forms progressively growing tumors that form metastases in the lungs and regional lymph nodes after injection into the mammary fat pads of 5-week-old athymic nude mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The origin of MDA-MB-435 has been questioned because it expresses melanoma-associated genes and is reported to originate from the M14 melanoma line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Its breast cancer origin was contested based on the fact that it expresses milk proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It is also pertinent to note that MDA-MB-435 metastasizes from the mammary fat pad but rarely from the subcutaneous site. In the present study this cell line was used because it metastasizes from the mammary fat pad.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmids and cell lines</title><p>MRJ(L) cDNA was subcloned into mammalian expression vector pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) to obtain pIRES2-EGFP-MRJ(L). MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells were transfected with pIRES2-EGFP-MRJ(L). We used the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Briefly, 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells were seeded in a 60 mm dish 1 day before transfection. Plasmid (8 to 10 &#x003bc;g) was mixed the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent, as recommended by the manufacturer. The DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 complex (final volume 1 ml) was added to the plate containing 4 ml serum-free DMEM/F12. Twelve hours later the media were replaced with growth medium without any selection. Transfection was monitored by examining the tranfectants for the green fluorescence. Cells were detached approximately 45 hours after transfection. Using FACSVantage SE (Becton Dickinson), the top 20% fluorescent (enhanced green fluorescent protein [EGFP]) cells were selected (correspondingly high MRJ [L] expressors because of the internal ribosome entry site [IRES]). The expressor cells were passaged in medium with G418. We used the expressors as a pooled population to avoid any clonal variation. All cell lines were used within 10 to 12 passages to avoid variations.</p><p>MRJ(L) with wild-type and mutant nuclear localization signal (NLS) were cloned in frame with a carboxyl-terminal EGFP tag in the vector pEGFP-N1. The wild-type NLS from amino acids 305 to 313 (KRKKQKQR) was mutated to (RPDRPETT) using PCR. The corresponding plasmids are called as pEGFP-N1-MRJ(L)<sup>WT </sup>and pEGFP-N1-MRJ(L)<sup>mut</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Collection of Serum free media and Western blot for secreted proteins</title><p>Cells (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) were plated in 10 cm plate containing appropriate growth medium overnight. The growth medium was replaced with 3 ml serum-free phenol-free DMEM/F12. The conditioned medium was harvested 18 hours later, spun at 1,300 rpm at 4&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes, and concentrated eightfold using a Millipore Amicon Ultra 4 Centrifugal Filter Unit (Billerica, MA, USA) with a 10 KDa cut-off. The concentrated conditioned media samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for proteins of interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>Plates (10 cm) at 90% confluence were washed twice with calcium and magnesium-free phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with cold lysis buffer (150 mmol/l NaCl, 50 mmol/l Tris, 1% NP-40, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors). The lysates were kept on ice for 1 hour and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. Protein concentration was measured using Bradford reagent (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Proteins (20 &#x003bc;g) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (0.2 &#x003bc;m). The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline Tween-20 (1 mol/l Tris [pH 7.5], 9% NaCl and 0.05% Tween-20) and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. After washes in Tris-buffered saline Tween-20 and incubation with the respective horseradish peroxidase-tagged secondary antibody, the blots were developed using SuperSignal&#x02122; (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). For detection of MRJ, 5% milk in PBS containing 0.2% Tween-20 was used, and for detection of osteopontin, 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.05% Tween was used as blocking buffer.</p><p>We used the following antibodies (dilutions given in parenthesis): anti-DNAJB6 antibody (1:5,000) from Abnova Corporation (Taipei City, Taiwan); anti-osteopontin (1:2,500) from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA); anti-KiSS1 antibody (1:500) from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA); anti-osteonectin (1:1,000) from Haematologic Technologies Inc.

A central linear wound (perpendicular to the guide lines) was made with a 200 &#x003bc;l sterile pipet tip. Media were changed gently to remove any floating cells. Phase micrographs of the wound cultures were taken at 0 and 16 hours (average doubling time is 18 to 20 hours). The photographs were analyzed by measuring the distance from the wound edge of the cell sheet to the original wound site. Migration activity was calculated as the mean distance between edges in 12 fields per well. Each test group was assayed in triplicate, and the results are expressed relative to vector control cell migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Migration and invasion assay</title><p>Migration and invasion assays were conducted using 8 &#x003bc;m polyethylene terpthalate filters (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA), as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Cells migrated to the lower sides of the trans-well were stained using Diff-Quik<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>reagent (Diff Quik is from International Medical Equipment Inc., San Marcos, CA, USA) and the cell number was counted under a microscope. Each test group was assayed in triplicate. Four different fields of each insert were photographed at 10&#x000d7; magnification using a Zeiss Axiocam 200 M microscope (Zeiss Axiocam : Carl Zeiss Microimaging Inc. Thornwood, NY, USA.). Each field was divided into quadrants, and cells in diagonally opposite quadrants were counted.</p></sec><sec><title>Soft agar colonization assay</title><p>Cells (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup>) suspended in 0.35% agar were plated onto a layer of 0.75% bactoagar in DMEM/F12 (5% fetal bovine serum) in six-well tissue culture dishes.

The protein sample in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was loaded onto the cartridge and washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Proteins were eluted with increasing amounts of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid from 30% to 70% at 0.1 ml/minute, concentrated to dryness, and digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

Involvement of the Hsp40 family in tumorigenesis and malignant progression has yet to be completely elucidated.

The continued presence of the MRJ(L)-NLS-mut in the nucleus can be explained by the possibility that there exists an additional cryptic NLS that the PSORT II software may not have identified. Alternatively, MRJ(L) lacking the NLS may still interact with another nuclear protein and could be transported into the nucleus while attached to the other protein, as indicated in the recent report by Cheng and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Secreted proteins play an important role in promoting tumor growth and interaction with the local microenvironment and facilitate its pathway to metastasis.

It is important to note that we have sequenced the KiSS1 mRNA from the MRJ(L) expressors of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 and found no mutation in the resident KiSS1 sequence (data not shown). Thus, the upregulated, resident KiSS1 protein is functional as a metastasis suppressor. Also, it is tempting to speculate that MRJ(L) may play a similar role in regulating melanoma metastasis by upregulation of KiSS1.</p><p>The changes in secreted protein levels could be due to several factors such as altered secretion rate, altered stabilization of proteins or altered transcription. The quantitative PCR analysis shows that the influence of MRJ(L) on the secreted proteins is at the transcriptional level, suggesting that MRJ(L) plays a role in mediating regulation of transcription of these genes. In a recent elegant study, Dai and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] showed that the MRJ(S) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)c3 could directly associate with one another in cardiomyocytes. Those investigators also found that MRJ(S) served as a potent inhibitor of NFAT transcriptional activity within the nucleus through a mechanism involving histone deacetylase recruitment in conjunction with heat shock. Heat shock is needed for the translocation of MRJ(S) from cytoplasm to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that MRJ(L) is capable of similar transcription regulatory activities.</p><p>Tissue microarray analysis revealed that MRJ expression is lost as IDC grades advance. Importantly, total absence of MRJ staining in cases with lymph node metastasis was seen. The MRJ antibody does not distinguish between isoforms, and so we cannot comment on the presence or absence of each of the isoforms. Because of small sample size, it is premature to draw correlations between nuclear staining (which may correspond exclusively to MRJ [L]) and disease stage. However, it must be emphasized that none of the IDCs had positive nuclear staining (n = 24), whereas there was a higher number of positive nuclear staining in normal and benign (adenosis, simple hyperplasia, atypical hyperplasia) lesions (eight out of 17 stained). In fact, one of the ways in which a tumor can gain aggressive behavior is by spontaneous deletion or silencing of the MRJ gene, which will lead to absence of both isoforms. It is also likely that the expression of MRJ(S) is not ubiquitous in tissues, in contrast to the expression observed in cell lines, and this isoform may play similar or independent role(s) in regulating tumor growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we found that MRJ(L) plays an important role in regulating breast cancer tumoriginicity and metastasis by altering transcription of key players in cancer progression and metastasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AZGP1 = zinc binding &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-glycoprotein 1; DMEM = Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; EGF = epidermal growth factor; EGFP = enhanced green fluorescent protein; GAPDH = glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Hsp = heat shock protein; IDC = infiltrating ductal carcinoma; IRES = internal ribosome entry site; KiSS1 = melanoma metastasis suppressor; MRJ = mammalian relative of DnaJ; MRJ(L) = long isoform of MRJ; MRJ(S) = short isoform of MRJ; NFAT = nuclear factor of activated T cells; NLS = nuclear localization signal; NPM1 = nucleophosmin; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; RT = reverse transcription; SPARC = osteonectin; SPP1 = osteopontin; VGF = VGF nerve growth factor inducible.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no current competing interests.
