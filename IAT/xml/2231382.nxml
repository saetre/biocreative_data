This suggests that other factors must contribute to the phenotypic differences between human and mouse. Gene duplication and alternative splicing are two fundamental mechanisms that shape genome evolution. Alternative splicing acts at the level of mRNA processing, whereas gene duplication affects genomic DNA. Gene duplication can also operate at the level of RNA via retroposition, which has been shown to generate functional intronless duplicates of entire genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The contributions of these two processes to the proteome variability are substantially different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Duplication of existing genes is an important mechanism for generating new genes while maintaining the original [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Gene duplication gives rise to a state of genetic redundancy, in which one of the newly formed gene copies enters a period of reduced evolutionary pressure, allowing entirely novel functional patterns to emerge. Selective constraints ensure that one of the duplicates retains its original function but the second copy is free from these constraints and, thus, accumulates mutations. These mutations can lead to a non-functional pseudogene that may continue (during a transition period) to be expressed at the RNA level; eventually the pseudogene accumulates further mutations that inactivate its transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Alternatively, the mutations may lead to a different expression pattern or to neo-functionalization that advances organism speciation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Neo-functionalization of duplicated genes was previously attributed to amino acid sequence changes through sporadic mutations or through changes in gene expression patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Indeed, in plants whole genome duplication is associated with speciation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>An average human gene is 28,000 nucleotides long and consists of 8.8 exons of ~130 nucleotides each (excluding terminal exons) that are separated by 7.8 introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. RNA splicing is the process in which introns are removed and exons are joined together to form a mature mRNA. RNA splicing is carried out by the spliceosome, which is comprised of more than 150 proteins and five snRNPs, called U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Alternative splicing generates multiple mRNA products from a single gene, contributing to transcriptome and proteome diversity. Alternative splicing is a possible mechanism for bridging the gap between the gene count in an organism's genome and its level of phenotypic complexity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Up-to-date estimates suggest that more than 60% of human genes undergo alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. About 80% of alternative splicing events change the encoded protein and ~15% of genetic diseases are caused by mutations within splicing regulatory elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. There are four types of alternative splicing alternative 5' splice or 3' splice site selection, exon skipping, and intron retention. Selection of previously un-used splice sites can result in creation of a new exon, which is alternatively spliced. Exonization is essentially a birthing process of new exons from intronic sequences.</p><p>In human, most of newly generated exons originate from the primate-specific transposed element, <italic>Alu</italic>. Repetitive DNA sequences are found in most organisms and, in some, constitute a substantial fraction of the entire genome (~46% in human). Various types of repetitive DNA sequences are found within mammalian genomes and have contributed to mammalian evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The <italic>Alu </italic>sequences are short interspersed elements (SINE) of about 300 nucleotides in length, which are unique to primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Over the past 65 million years, the <italic>Alu </italic>sequence has been amplified via an RNA-mediated transposition process to a copy number of 1.1 million, comprising an estimated 10% of the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Seven hundred thousand <italic>Alu </italic>elements exist within intronic sequences; of these, 480,052 are found within introns of protein coding genes, in both sense and antisense orientations with respect to the mRNA precursor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The <italic>Alu </italic>element in the antisense orientation contains most of the characteristics required for identification as an exon by the splicing machinery. <italic>Alu </italic>exonization is an evolutionary pathway that generates primate-specific transcriptomic diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies that examined the evolutionary trend of alternative splicing after gene duplication revealed that duplicate genes have fewer alternatively spliced forms than single-copy genes (singletons) and that an inverse correlation exists between the mean number of alternative splice forms and the gene family size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These results suggest that there is a loss of alternative splicing in duplicated genes after the duplication and that there is an asymmetric evolution of alternative splicing after gene duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It seems that the duplication event compensates for a reduced use of alternative splicing and that gene duplication and alternative splicing do not evolve independently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we compared the level of <italic>de novo </italic>exonization of transposed elements in duplicated genes with the level in singletons. We employed a whole-genome bioinformatic analysis, supported by <italic>in vivo </italic>analysis, to examine whether duplicated genes exhibited a lower level of selection against exonization of transposed elements (TE). The results suggest that alternatively spliced exons that originate from exonization of transposed elements are found significantly more frequently in duplicated genes than in singletons. In one of these genes, TIF-IA, the TE in one of the duplicates, but not in the original, is exonized. We identified the point mutation leading to the exonization. When this mutation was inserted into the original gene, it caused exonization that substantially reduced production of the protein-coding mRNA. This implies that there was selection against exonization in the original gene, whereas the duplicate was free from such constraints. The exonization in the duplicated gene occurs in some leukemia cells, but not in normal cells, implying that changes in activity or concentration of splicing factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] within leukemia cells changes exon/intron recognition.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Transposed elements more likely to be exonized in duplicated genes</title><p>Duplicated genes undergo relaxation of selective pressure following duplication. The increase in mutational rate leads to changes in the mRNA sequence in the duplicated gene relative to the original [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In this study, we investigated whether the relaxation in selective pressure also leads to an increase in exonization of TEs in duplicate genes compared with singletons. For this purpose, we compiled a dataset of exons resulting from TE exonizations within the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These exons were divided into two groups: those that reside within duplicated genes and those that reside within singletons. Our dataset of TE exonizations contains 1824 exons in 1388 different genes. We found 57 <italic>Alu </italic>exons in 45 duplicated genes, 7 MIR (mammalian interspersed repeat) exons in 7 duplicated genes, 15 L1 (LINE-1) exons in 15 duplicated genes, three L2 (LINE-2) exons in three duplicated genes, 15 LTR (long terminal repeat) exons in 12 genes, and three DNA exons in three genes. Overall, we identified 100 TE exons in 77 duplicated genes, that is, an average of 1.3 TE exons per gene (the genes with numerous exonizations are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>; also see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). All other TE exons (1724) reside in 1559 genes, that is, an average of 1.1 exons per gene. The exonization rate within duplicated genes was significantly higher than that in singletons (two-tailed Mann-Whitney p-value &#x0003c; 0.005).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Duplicated genes with multiple TE exonization</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">No. of exons</td><td align="left">TE</td><td align="left">Gene</td><td align="left">Accession</td><td align="left">Description</td><td align="left">Dup. gene</td><td align="left">Dup. accession</td><td align="left">Dup. description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">3</td><td align="left">AluSx AluJo MER5A</td><td align="left">SRPN</td><td align="left">NM_022807</td><td align="left">small nuclear ribonucleo-protein polypeptide N</td><td align="left">SNRPB</td><td align="left">BC003530</td><td align="left">small nuclear ribonucleo-protein polypeptides B and B1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">AluSx AluJb</td><td align="left">NCF1 pseudo-gene</td><td align="left">BC002816</td><td align="left">neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 pseudo-gene</td><td align="left">NCF1</td><td align="left">NM_000265</td><td align="left">neutrophil cytosolic factor 1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">AluSx AluJb</td><td align="left">YY1AP1</td><td align="left">BC025272</td><td align="left">YY1 associated protein</td><td align="left">GON4L</td><td align="left">BX648802</td><td align="left">gon-4-like protein</td></tr><tr><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">AluSp MIR</td><td align="left">NSUN5C</td><td align="left">NM_148936</td><td align="left">NOL1/NOP2/Sun domain family member 5C</td><td align="left">NSUN5</td><td align="left">NM_018044</td><td align="left">NOL1/NOP2/Sun domain family, member 5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">AluY AluJb</td><td align="left">RAP1A</td><td align="left">NM_001010935</td><td align="left">RAP1A, member of RAS oncogene family</td><td align="left">RAP1B</td><td align="left">NM_015646</td><td align="left">RAP1B, member of RAS oncogene family</td></tr><tr><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">AluSx MSTA</td><td align="left">POLR2J2</td><td align="left">BC086857</td><td align="left">RPB11b1beta protein (DNA directed RNA polymerase II polypeptide J-related)</td><td align="left">POLR2J2</td><td align="left">NM_032958</td><td align="left">DNA directed RNA polymerase II polypeptide</td></tr><tr><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">AluSg/x AluJb</td><td align="left">ZNF611</td><td align="left">NM_030972</td><td align="left">zinc finger protein 611</td><td align="left">ZNF701</td><td align="left">NM_018260</td><td align="left">zinc finger protein 701</td></tr><tr><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">AluSq AluSp</td><td align="left">ZNF702</td><td align="left">NM_024924</td><td align="left">zinc finger protein 702</td><td align="left">ZNF137</td><td align="left">NM_003438</td><td align="left">zinc finger protein 137</td></tr><tr><td align="left">3</td><td align="left">MSTA MSTA MSTA</td><td align="left">PMS2L14</td><td align="left">AB017005</td><td align="left">PMS2L14 protein.</td><td align="left">PMS2</td><td align="left">NM_000533</td><td align="left">PMS2 postmeiotic segregation increased 2 isoform</td></tr><tr><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">AluJb AluY</td><td align="left">ZNF283</td><td align="left">AK098175</td><td align="left">zinc finger protein 283</td><td align="left">ZNF420</td><td align="left">NM_144689</td><td align="left">zinc finger protein 420</td></tr><tr><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">AluJo L1MA9</td><td align="left">ZNF678</td><td align="left">NM_178549</td><td align="left">zinc finger protein 678</td><td align="left">ZNF479</td><td align="left">AF277624</td><td align="left">zinc finger protein 479</td></tr><tr><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">AluSx LTR49</td><td align="left">PILRB</td><td align="left">NM_013440</td><td align="left">paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor beta</td><td align="left">PVRIG</td><td align="left">NM_024070</td><td align="left">poliovirus receptor related immunoglobulin</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Are these TE exonizations within duplicated genes part of a neo-functionalization or a non-functionalization process? Apparently, both trajectories are present within our dataset. An example for neo-functionalization is the primate-specific duplication of the gene GON4L that generated the duplicated gene YY1AP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The gene YY1AP1 is functional and also has a new role as a co-activator, YY1; it also has different levels of expression within human tissue relative to its duplicate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Our exonization analysis revealed that YY1AP1 contains two different <italic>Alu </italic>exonizations that do not exist within GON4L. One of the exonizations results from the <italic>Alu </italic>that was inserted prior to the gene duplication. The other resulted from an insertion of an <italic>Alu </italic>element after the duplication and subsequent exonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>An example of non-functionalization and subsequent pseudogenesis is found in the duplication of the NCF1 gene. NCF1 is one of the genes responsible for the chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and also contributes to autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In human, the gene underwent triplication, the two duplicates are well characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Our analysis of TE exonization revealed that there was an <italic>Alu </italic>exonization within the second intron of each of the two pseudogenes. There is no evidence for this exonization within the functional gene, even though the <italic>Alu </italic>element is present within the intron of the functional gene as well. Our dataset contains both exonization of TEs that were inserted prior to gene duplication and those that were inserted after gene duplication. Two of the <italic>Alu </italic>exonizations in duplicated genes in our dataset were shown to be associated with cancerous tissues based on the tissue origin of their ESTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]; the <italic>Alu </italic>exonization within intron 2 of the gene YY1AP1, the aforementioned duplicate of the gene GON4L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]; and <italic>Alu </italic>exonization within intron 6 of the gene ACAD9, a paralog of ACADVL (p-value &#x0003c; 0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>TIF-IA gene underwent a hominidae-specific triplication</title><p>One of the genes from our bioinformatic analysis is transcription initiation factor IA (TIF-IA). This transcription initiation factor directs growth-dependent regulation of RNA polymerase I. It is a 75-kDa protein and levels, or activity, fluctuate in response to cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Genetic inactivation of the transcription factor TIF-IA leads to nucleolar disruption, cell cycle arrest, and p53-mediated apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Therefore, TIF-IA is a key protein in adapting cellular biosynthetic activities to cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>The gene that encodes TIF-IA is highly conserved from yeast to human and is essential for cell survival. Alignment of the human cDNA of TIF-IA against the human genome using Blat (UCSC Genome Browser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]) revealed two imperfect copies of TIF-IA, which presumably resulted from gene duplication. The original copy of TIF-IA gene (termed locus 15), as well as the two duplicates (termed locus 28 and locus 21), are located on chromosome 16. In addition, a processed pseudo-gene of TIF-IA is located on chromosome 2, but is not transcribed according to EST data.</p><p>The two duplicates of the gene were probably generated in a sequential manner, as illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Non-homologous recombination was probably the mechanism for the triplication, because all the copies are on the same chromosome. In detail, the original gene from locus 15 was duplicated almost completely, except for the last exon (exon 18), to locus 28. Next, a major deletion of 3,517 bp within the duplicate, which included exons 11 and 12, occurred. Then, locus 28 was duplicated to locus 21. This duplication was also incomplete, resulting loss of the last three exons (exons 16 to 18). The deletion was confirmed experimentally (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The original TIF-IA gene and its two duplicates in the human genome</bold>. Exons and introns are marked with numbered boxes and horizontal lines, respectively. Splicing events between exon 1 and 2 are marked with dashed lines. Each of the TIF-IA genes is named according to its relative location on chromosome 16: that is, loci 15, 28, and 21. The relative levels of expression from each locus, as measured by DS Gene<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, are given as percent of total TIF-IA mRNA in P69 cells and shown on the left. Locus 15 is the original full-length gene, containing 18 exons, coding for a 75 kDa protein (651 aa) (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). The transcription start site is marked by an arrow above exon 1 and the stop codon by a stop sign above exon 18. The 3'UTR accounts for ~47% of the mRNA molecule. The <italic>Alu </italic>element is located in intron 1. Locus 28 is a duplication of the original TIF-IA gene containing the promoter region of the original gene (marked by black box). A deletion of 768 nucleotides in the promoter region reduced its transcription activity. Also, this locus contains two additional deletions with respect to the original gene: a deletion of 3517 nucleotides between intron 10 and intron 12 (between LTR16A1 and <italic>Alu</italic>-Sg transposed elements) and a deletion of the last exon (exon 18). The last two exons of locus 28 probably originated following a duplication event of exons 3 and 4 of BANP gene (96.6% sequence similarity). The complete BANP gene is also located on chromosome 16. The mRNA synthesized from that site has the potential to encode a protein of 514 aa according to a translation-prediction tool, using the same start codon as that of locus 15. A protein corresponding to the predicted molecular weight was not detected by western blotting analysis (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Locus 21 is presumably a duplication of locus 28, containing the exact major deletion as that of locus 28 and, in addition, a deletion downstream of exon 15. The last two exons originated from exonization events of LINE-LTR and <italic>Alu</italic>-Sq transposed elements. Alternative poly-adenylation signal in the last two exons is shown. Locus 21 has the potential to encode a 106 aa protein from the third AUG downstream from the transcription start site. The first AUG potentially encodes a 39-aa polypeptide.

The original gene is located on chromosome 16, as it is in the human genome. There are several regions of homology to TIF-IA on chromosome 16 (in addition to the WT gene), as well as a processed pseudogene on chromosome 2b. It was difficult to determine the order and pattern of duplication events in the chimpanzee genome due to incomplete sequencing and the low level of genome assembly; however, it is clear that the chimp genome contains more than one copy of the TIF-IA gene on the same chromosome.</p><p>Alignment of TIF-IA cDNA with the rhesus genome revealed the presence of the original copy of the gene on chromosome 20 and the processed pseudogene on chromosome 12, but no duplications.

This <italic>Alu </italic>was inserted into another transposed element called L2, located in intron 1 of the TIF-IA gene. We reconstructed this scenario by examination of intron 1 of the TIF-IA gene in other mammals. The L2 element was present in all sequenced mammals except opossum. The insertion of the <italic>Alu </italic>element into the L2 transposed element led to an exonization in human. Based on alignment of ESTs to the human genome (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), the 3' splice site (3'ss) is donated by the L2 transposed element and two alternative 5' splice site (5'ss) are selected, one donated by the <italic>Alu </italic>sequence and the other by L2. We designated the distal 5'ss, located in the <italic>Alu </italic>sequence as 5'ss-a, and the proximal 5'ss, located in the L2 element, as 5'ss-b (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The overall steps that lead to the exonization of that exon were as follows: (1) During primate evolution, an <italic>Alu</italic>-Sx element was inserted into an L2 retrotransposon of the LINE family. (2) The sequence accumulated mutations that caused exonization, leading to selection of three different isoforms as demonstrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>. This exon is termed L2-AEx.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Retrotransposition and exonization of an <italic>Alu </italic>element in the first intron of TIF-IA gene in locus 21</bold>.

The region of 1 kb upstream of the translation start codon of locus 15 has 96.5% identity to the corresponding upstream region of locus 21. The 1-kb promoter region of locus 28 shows similarity to that of locus 15; however, this putative promoter contains a deletion of 768 bp that ends at position -117 upstream of the potential translation start codon.</p><p>The many changes that occurred between the wild-type gene and the two duplicates suggest that the duplicates are not under selective pressure to encode functional protein. Translation of the mRNA produced from the original TIF-IA gene results in a 651-aa protein with a molecular weight of 75 kDa. The duplicate at locus 28 potentially encodes a 514-aa polypeptide chain, whereas the duplicate at locus 21 potentially encodes a 39-aa polypeptide using the genuine start codon or a 106-aa polypeptide chain using the third ATG downstream of the transcription start site (TSS). Polypeptides of sizes expected from the duplicate loci were not detected by western blotting analysis with polyclonal antibodies to the wild-type TIF-IA protein (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Although proteins do not appear to be generated from the duplicate genes, these duplicates are active transcriptionally as indicated by ESTs that derive from these loci. In addition, we measured the relative mRNA levels based on nucleotide variation at certain positions between the loci. In P69 cells, mRNA from the wild-type gene comprises about 80% of the mRNA transcribed from the three loci and locus 28 and locus 21 constitute 3% and 17% of the mRNA, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Alu</italic>-exonization is exclusive to the TIF-IA duplicate in locus 21</title><p>EST analysis revealed that a large fraction of the L2-AEx-containing ESTs originated from carcinogenic tissues, such as Burkitt's lymphomas (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). To examine the splicing patterns of exons 1 and 2 of the wild-type gene and the two duplicates, we designed a pair of primers to sequences in the flanking exons: 1 and 2 that are conserved among all three loci, meaning all three copies will be amplified simultaneously. We then performed RT-PCR analysis of human cDNA from normal tissues and from transformed cell lines. The major mRNA product from the TIF-IA genes in most of normal tissues skips the <italic>Alu </italic>exon and shows either no exonization or a negligible level of exonization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). In two cell lines, 293T and BJ-1, there was a substantial level of exonization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lanes 9 and lane 10, respectively). These results imply that, for most of the tested cells, the exonization is a minor or non-existent event. We did not detect any exonization of L2-AEx within chimpanzee blood cells, implying that this exonization may be human specific (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lane 17).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Scanning of diverse normal human tissues, various human cell lines, and chimpanzee blood for <italic>Alu</italic>-exonization in the TIF-IA genes</bold>.

To specifically identify the locus from which this exonization occurred, we designed loci-specific primers and repeated the RT-PCR analysis using the pair of primers that detects all three loci and the locus-specific pairs of primers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Only locus 21 showed exonization in which 5'ss-a or of 5'ss-b or both were selected and the ratio among the three isoforms varied significantly among the cell lines. Thus, there was a low level or an absence of exonization in normal human tissues and in epithelial cancer cell lines. In contrast, most leukemia cell lines exhibited a high level of exonization. The exonization was restricted to one of the duplicates (locus 21), but not to the original gene (locus 15). The cells that show exonization do not exhibit a known common characteristic, such as a specific hematopoietic lineage or mutations in a certain pathway or gene that can explain the exonization in these cells but not in the others. These results imply that there is a certain level of transcriptomic instability of the TIF-IA locus in certain cancer cells, in particular leukemic. The definition of exon/intron is abnormal for the TIF-IA locus, and perhaps other loci as well, in these cancer cells; what is defined as an intron for normal tissues is selected as an exon in leukemic cells.</p></sec><sec><title>The wild-type TIF-IA gene is one step away from exonization</title><p>To understand the molecular mechanisms leading to exonization in locus 21, but not in loci 15 and 28, we compared the genomic sequence of the L2-<italic>Alu </italic>among the loci (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Many point mutations have accumulated in the L2-<italic>Alu </italic>genomic sequence following the duplication event. One of these mutations was of particular interest, because it changed a GAG found in locus 15 and 28 to CAG in locus 21. This CAG is used as the 3'ss of the L2-AEx. GAG is a week 3'ss, whereas CAG is a strong one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. We, thus, hypothesized that this mutation leads to locus 21-specific exonization.</p><p>To examine this hypothesis, we cloned a mini-gene containing the human genomic DNA from exon 1 to exon 2 of locus 15 (WT gene). The mini-gene was transfected into human 293T cells, RNA was extracted, and the splicing pattern between exon 1 and 2 was examined by RT-PCR analysis using primers that are specific to the mini-gene mRNA. As expected the WT mini-gene does not exhibit <italic>Alu</italic>-exonization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lane 2). However, a single point mutation at position -3 (G &#x02192; C) at the putative 3'ss activated the exonization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lane 3). The predominant mRNA generated following this mutation is the one that includes the L2-AExs (selection of 5'ss-b), leading to a low level of the normal mRNA. In addition, the 3'ss mutation also generated an intron retention isoform. This indicates that the L2-<italic>Alu </italic>in the wild-type gene (locus 15) is one mutation away from exonization. If such a mutation were to occur, it would terminate production of a normal TIF-IA protein in the cells almost completely, because the L2-<italic>AEx </italic>inserts a premature stop codon.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>A single point mutation activates the L2-AEx in wild-type TIF-IA</bold>.

Strengthening of the either of the two sites did not activate the exonization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lanes 4 and 5) and neither did strengthening both (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lane 8). When the 3'ss is functional, the selection of 5'ss-a or 5'ss-b is determined by their relative strength (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lanes 6, 7, and 9). Overall, these results indicate that the L2-<italic>Alu </italic>element in the WT TIF-IA gene is on the edge of exonization and that a single point mutation from G to C in position -3 of the putative 3'ss leads to exonization.</p><p>Next, we examined which nucleotides in position -3 of the 3'ss would activate exonization. We mutated the 3'ss from GAG to CAG, TAG, and AAG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, lanes 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Only the mutation from G to C at position -3 lead to exonization: The mutations to A and T did not. These results support our previous observation that CAG is the strongest 3'ss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Also, the results show that alternative splicing is delicately balanced and is partially controlled by the strength of the 3' and 5'ss signals.</p><p>Alternative splicing is often regulated in a tissue-specific or developmental-stage-specific manner. A common explanation for differential splicing patterns is that the concentrations of splicing regulatory proteins vary depending on tissue type and developmental stage. Therefore, we examined the effect of different cellular environments on the splicing of the TIF-IA mini-gene by transfection into different cell lines; we used the mini-gene containing the G-to-C mutant at position -3 of the 3'ss. The patterns of splicing observed depended on the cell line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). In two cell lines, Du145 and PC3, the introns were not always excised (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, lanes 2 and 6, respectively; see figure legend for the source of each cell line) and in U2OS, HT1080, HepG2, HeLa, and 293T cell lines, the alternatively spliced mRNA containing L2-AEx was the predominant isoform (lanes 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7, respectively). These findings show that, for this TIF-IA mini-gene, the cellular environment regulates the level of exonization and intron/exon recognition.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Alu</italic>-exonization in YY1AP, the duplicate of GON4Lb</title><p>To further support the bioinformatics analysis we demonstrated another case of a gene that underwent a duplication event, and the duplicate gene exhibits a distinct alternative splicing pattern originated from an intronic <italic>Alu </italic>element, which also exist in the ancestor gene, but is not exonized. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> demonstrates the genomic structure of the original GON4Lb gene compared to the duplicated gene, YY1AP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. An intronic <italic>Alu </italic>element is exonized between exons 13 and 14 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Aligning the <italic>Alu </italic>element in both original and duplicated genes uncovers many sequence changes between them (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). In contrast to the TIF-IA gene, no mutation was detected in the splice signals, thus we assume that the reason for exonization in the duplicated gene and not in the original GON4Lb gene is due to mutations in regulatory sequences such as ESRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> examines the splicing pattern of the corresponding genomic region and revealed that the <italic>Alu </italic>element in GON4Lb gene is not exonized while the duplicated gene (YY1AP1) exhibits low levels of exonization. When the <italic>Alu</italic>-exon enters into the mature RNA of YY1AP1, it inserts a pre-mature termination codon (PTC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].

Gene duplication works at the level of DNA and alternative splicing at the level of mRNA. These two processes are seemingly independent, but recent comprehensive bioinformatics analyses suggest that they are correlated inversely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. That is, certain genes proliferate and acquire new functions by duplication, while other genes gain new functional properties through alternative splicing.</p><p>It was observed previously that duplicated genes, unlike singletons, undergo relaxation in selective pressure. The duplicate rapidly diverges from the original sequence due to a higher rate of nucleotide substitutions within the coding regions relative to orthologs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Here we show that there is another contributor to the fast divergence of duplicated genes: a higher level of exonization of transposed elements in duplicated genes relative to singletons. Previous work dealing with the correlation between alternative splicing and gene duplications indicated that there is less alternative splicing in duplicated genes and that there is alternative splicing loss after duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. All together our observations imply that although in general there is a reduction in alternative splicing in gene families, the level of TEs exonization is higher in duplicated genes.</p><p>In the analysis described here, we found that, following duplication, genes can acquire new alternatively spliced isoforms through exonization of transposed elements and that genes with more than one copy per genome (duplicated genes) tend to undergo more exonization of TE elements in one of the duplicates than do singletons. This indicates a high level of selection against exonization in singletons, with fewer restrictions against exonizations in multi-copy genes. It also supports the observation that one of the duplicates is under lower selective pressure, which allows the accumulation of mutations leading to exonization without deleterious effects on the organism.</p><p>Our results suggest that alternatively spliced exons that originate from exonization of transposed elements are found significantly more frequently in duplicated genes than in singletons. We selected one of these duplicated genes, TIF-IA, for further examination. TIF-IA underwent a humanoid-specific triplication, in which one of the duplicates retained the evolutionary conserved exon-intron structure and maintained the reading frame. Because the two duplicates were under less evolutionary constraint, each underwent substantial changes with respect to the original copy. These changes include large and small deletions and point mutations in the original coding sequence. In addition, in one of the duplicates, we identified an exonization of an <italic>Alu </italic>element that was inserted into the first intron prior to the duplication. All three copies of TIF-IA gene are active transcriptionally, but the wild-type gene is the major contributor to TIF-IA mRNA levels. Only the wild-type mRNA is translated into protein. We found negligible levels of this exonization in diverse normal tissues and diverse cell lines, with the exception of the 293T and BJ-1 cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). In contrast, when we examined various leukemia cell lines, we discovered high levels of L2-<italic>Alu</italic>-exonization in 13 of the 17 cell lines. This indicates that the definition of this <italic>Alu </italic>as an exon is restricted to certain types of cancers. The genomic sequence of the <italic>Alu </italic>between the cells that show exonization and those that do not is unchanged (not shown). This implies that this exonization is due to aberrant expression or activity of one or more splicing factors.</p><p>Next, we generated a mini-gene with the genomic region of locus 15, the original copy of TIF-IA gene. The single product of this wild-type mini-gene was the one that joined exon 1 with exon 2; the <italic>Alu </italic>element was intronic. Introducing a single point mutation at position -3 of the 3'ss (from G to C) in the <italic>Alu </italic>element strengthened the 3'ss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. The main spliced isoform in this mutant was the one in which 5'ss-b was selected. Alternative splicing of <italic>Alu </italic>exons usually generates both the isoform containing the additional exon and the original isoform that presumably holds an important function in the cell. Thus, alternative exonization with low inclusion level can advance transcriptomic diversification. We previously demonstrated that alternatively spliced <italic>Alu </italic>exons have low inclusion levels (10&#x02013;19%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. This strongly suggests that a point mutation that strengthened the <italic>Alu </italic>element 3'ss were to occur in the original gene of TIF-IA (locus 15), there would be a substantial decrease in the amount of the evolutionary conserved protein. Under these conditions, a genetic disease might develop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>TIF-IA (locus 15) is a vital gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], however its two duplicates (loci 28 and 21) are probably non-functional based on their relative short open reading frames and very low expression levels. This duplication probably represents the non-functional stage described by Ohno in the period of time following the duplication event. As described by Ohno, this initial phase of non-functionalization will be followed by complete relaxation of selective constraints and may be followed by a neo-functionalization process, wherein the duplicate acquires a new function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The NCF1 gene duplicates may also be in the non-functional stage as its two well-described pseudogenes are presumably non-functional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>Why might there be selective forces against acquisition of the exons in certain genes and others not? We have demonstrated recently that conserved human-mouse alternative exons that disrupt the reading frame (termed non-symmetrical) tend to undergo fixation in the beginning of the gene, whereas those in the middle and the 3' half of the genes were presumably "weeded out" during evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. This suggests that acquisition of new exons close to the beginning of the genes is tolerated. In contrast, those in other parts of the genes are deleterious because polypeptides translated from these mRNAs are less likely to be targeted for the nonsense mediated decay than shorter products and the exon-containing isoforms are likely to be deleterious to the cells. If the initial exonization is natural or even present beneficial advantages to the cells, it will lead to an increase in the inclusion level of these alternative exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. The mutation in the 3'ss of the L2-AEx in TIF-IA gene (locus 15) presumably occurred during evolution in some individuals, but was selected against since TIF-IA is a vital gene, this isoform must have been deleterious due to the insertion of a premature termination codon.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results add another layer to our understanding of the delicate interplay between gene duplication and alternative splicing. Both increase gene complexity, albeit through different mechanisms. We have demonstrated an indirect link between duplication of genes and exonization of transposed elements.

Coordinates of the EST and cDNA mapping were obtained from chrN_intronEST and chrN_mrna tables, respectively. The TE mapping was obtained from chrN_rmsk tables. A TE was considered intragenic if there was no overlap with ESTs or cDNA alignments; it was considered intronic if it was found within an alignment of an EST or cDNA within an intronic region. Finally, a TE was considered exonic if it was found within an exonic part of the EST or cDNA, if it possessed canonical splice sites, and if it was an internal exon of the EST/cDNA found within the CDS or a UTR. The insertions of TEs within EST/cDNA alignments were separated into two parts: those that entered within protein coding genes relative to the list of the knownGene table in the UCSC genome browser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] (based on proteins from SWISS-PROT, TrEMBL, TrEMBL-NEW and their corresponding mRNA from GenBank), and other insertions within cDNA/ESTs alignments that were not mapped to the known genes list and, therefore, were considered as non-protein-coding genes. Non-protein-coding genes were determined as genomic regions covered by at least two correctly spliced cDNA/ESTs (flanked by canonical splice sites) containing at least three exons that did not overlap any annotated gene based on UCSC known genes lists, versions hg17 and mm6 for human and mouse, respectively. Unspliced genes were not included in our analysis; we only considered genes with at least two introns. Internal UTR exons were considered to be internal according to the annotations of knownGenes in UCSC and the fact that they were internal within the cDNA/EST. The TE position within the gene (UTR or CDS) and the exon phase were calculated based on knownGenes table annotations of the gene start and end positions, as well as CDS start and end positions.</p></sec><sec><title>TE exonization within duplicated genes</title><p>To analyze whether the exonization occurred within a duplicated gene or a singletons, we performed a blast search of these genes against all mRNA sequences listed as known genes (knownGene table) downloaded from UCSC human genome build hg17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] and searched for transcripts with at least 75% sequence similarity along 40 percent of the gene, the dataset was filtered to delete transcripts of isoforms generated by alternative splicing that belonged to the same gene and nonduplicated genes. The filtration of similar mRNA that are isoforms of the same gene was done by comparing the locus of the mRNA as indicated in UCSC genome browser; only mRNAs that mapped to different loci were considered.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell line maintenance</title><p>293T, HeLa, HT1080, HepG2, Du145, and U2OS cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's Modification of Eagle Medium (DMEM), supplemented with 4.5 g/mL glucose (Biological Industries, Inc., Israel), 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 1 U/mL nystatin (Biological Industries, Inc.). PC3 cells were cultured in Ham's F12K medium with 2 mM L-glutamine adjusted to contain 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate (90%) and fetal bovine serum (10%).
