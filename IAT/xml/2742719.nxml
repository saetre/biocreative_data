The axons from the medially located VTA project primarily to more medial target tissues in the forebrain, whereas the more lateral SN axons project to lateral targets including the dorsolateral striatum. This structural diversity underlies the distinct functions of these pathways. Although a number of guidance cues have been implicated in the formation of the distinct axonal projections of the SN and VTA, the molecular basis of their diversity remains unclear. Here we investigate the molecular basis of structural diversity in mDN axonal projections. We find that Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is expressed at a choice point in the course of the rostral dopaminergic projections. Furthermore, in midbrain explants, dopaminergic projections are attracted to a Shh source. Finally, in mice in which Shh signaling is inactivated during late neuronal development, the most medial dopaminergic projections are deficient.</p><p>In addition to the role of Shh in the induction of mDN precursors, Shh plays an important role in dopaminergic axon pathfinding to rostral target tissues.

Shh is expressed in the ventral midline (floor plate) at this time point in development, as demonstrated both by immunohistochemistry for Shh and in situ hybridization for <italic>Shh</italic> mRNA transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007007-g001">Figures 1A and 1C</xref>). Prior studies have established the presence of a Shh gradient from ventral to dorsal regions throughout the neuroaxis, including the midbrain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007007-Ericson1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. mDN axons, identified by the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, the rate-limiting enzyme of dopamine synthesis), express the Shh receptor component Smoothened (Smo; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007007-g001">Figure 1B, 1C</xref>). Additionally, the Shh receptor component, Patched (Ptc), is expressed in the ventral midbrain region where the mDNn are located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007007-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, other canonical Shh signaling components including Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007007-Blaess1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007007-Zervas1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>; (data not shown), are not expressed in the mDNs at this stage of embryogenesis.</p><p>To investigate a role for Shh as a chemoattractant for mDN axons, we established an explant culture model in which E11.5 midbrain tissue was maintained next to an aggregate of HEK293 cells transfected with full-length Shh cDNA or control vector for 3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007007-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Whereas control vector-transfected HEK293 had no effect, cells expressing Shh promoted unidirectional outgrowth toward the Shh source of TH-positive dopaminergic axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007007-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). If Shh is a chemoattractant for TH-positive neurons, we would predict that ventral midline tissue rostral to the explant, which expresses Shh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007007-g001">Figure 1A, 1C</xref>), should also attract mDN axons. Consistent with this, ventral (but not dorsal) tissue was effective at attracting mDN axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007007-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Cyclopamine, a specific antagonist of Smo function, partially blocked the chemoattractant activity of ventral tissue, indicating a role for Shh as a ventral guidance cue for mDN axons. The remaining attractant activity of the ventral tissue is likely due to an additional, unidentified chemoattractant expressed in the rostral ventral areas. Shh did not alter the overall outgrowth of TH-positive axons from the explant, but rather promoted unidirectional outgrowth towards the chemoattractant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007007-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). As residual endogenous Shh may be present in the midbrain explants, the effects we observe may underestimate the role of Shh. E11.5 midbrain explants harbor mature mDNs, and consistent with this, Shh did not alter the number or specification of mDNs in the explants (data not shown).</p><fig id="pone-0007007-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007007.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Shh as a chemoattractant in mDN explant cultures.</title><p>(A) Schematic of explant dissection.

(B) E11.5 bilateral ventral midbrain explants cultures (FP &#x02013; floor plate) in apposition to mock-transfected or Shh transfected HEK293T cells (delineated by white dotted lines). Explants and cell clusters were cocultured for 3 days, fixed, and immunostained for TH. Explants demonstrated increased TH-positive axonal outgrowth in the rostral quadrant (facing the explant &#x02013; quadrants delineated by yellow dotted lines) in the presence of a Shh source. This effect was diminished by the addition of cyclopamine (Cyc) at 10 nM to the culture medium. The axonal extension from the rostral side was quantified using pixel counting software (see Materials and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) and expressed as a percentage of total rostral and caudal outgrowth. The effect of Shh was significant when tested using the two-tailed Student T-test (p&#x0003c;0.05), n&#x0003e;25 explants in each condition. Total (non-directional) outgrowth from the lateral and caudal sides remained unaffected by the presence of Shh. (C) The effects of Shh transfected HEK293T cells can be mimicked by the presence of rostro-ventral neuroepithelium known to express Shh (excluding the zona limitans intrathalamica; ZLI), and this effect can be reduced by the addition of cyclopamine to the medium. This effect is significant (p&#x0003c;0.05) by the two-tailed Student T-test, n&#x0003e;25 explants in each condition. Total axonal outgrowth from the caudal and lateral sides of the explants appears unaffected by the presence of dorsal or ventral tissue pieces. However dorsal tissue, which lacks Shh expression, does appear to have a positive effect on dopaminergic axonal outgrowth from the rostral side of ventral midbrain explants, an effect that is not blocked by cyclopamine implicating a Shh/Smo independent mechanism.

Medial fibers appear to be intrinsically more sensitive to Shh than lateral fibers.</p><p>Shh expression starts around E7.5 in the notochord and prechordal mesoderm that underlies the medial neural plate and subsequently induces Shh expression in the ventral midline along the entire neuroaxis of the neural tube. In the midbrain, Shh signaling from the ventral midline is essential for ventral patterning, including the induction of mDNs, but only prior to E10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007007-Hynes1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007007-Blaess1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Shh expression is maintained in the ventral-medial midbrain and hypothalamus for the subsequent days of embryonic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007007-g001">Figure 1</xref> and S.B. unpublished data), after mDN induction and differentiation are completed and during the period of mDN axonal outgrowth. Shh in the ventral hypothalamus can therefore act as a local guidance cue for medially projecting dopaminergic axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007007-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Several factors have been implicated in mDN axonal pathfinding, and thus we have sought to address the possibility that Shh functions indirectly through these factors to alter mDN pathfinding. Prior studies have presented evidence of a role for Slit-1 and Slit-2 in the chemorepulsion of mDN axons at the midline. Slit2 has been shown to be a chemorepellant for mDNs in explant cultures, and Robo1 and 2, Slit receptors appear to be expressed in mDNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007007-Lin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, Shh expression is essential for the expression of Slit1 in the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007007-Barresi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it is unlikely that the phenotype we observe in the absence of Shh signaling is a consequence of deficient Slit expression, as, in fact, mice deficient in Slit1 and Slit2 display the opposite phenotype: ventrally displaced ascending dopaminergic fibers, with a relative expansion of the medial fibers that course ventrally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007007-Bagri1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore hypothesized that Slit signaling may serve to antagonize Shh at the ventral midline and thus refine the axonal targeting of mDN axonal projections. Consistent with this model, Slit2 expression along with Shh in HEK293 effectively suppressed the chemoattractive activity of Shh towards mDN axons in explant cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007007.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>In vitro studies additionally suggest a role for Netrin signaling in mDN axonal chemoattraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007007-Lin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. It is unlikely that Shh functions upstream of Netrin signaling to alter mDN axonal pathfinding, as <italic>Netrin</italic> expression appears unaltered in the conditional <italic>Smo</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007007-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). We hypothesize that Netrin signaling may serve to refine the synaptic targeting of dopaminergic axons at forebrain regions.</p><p>Our data indicate that Shh functions through the Smo receptor as a ventral midline cue for ascending dopaminergic fibers. Furthermore, we find that the other Shh receptor component, Ptc is expressed in the ventral midbrain at this point in development. However, other canonical Shh signaling components, such as Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3, are absent, suggesting a non-canonical pathway. Interestingly, a recent paper demonstrated that Shh guides commissural axons in the spinal cord by stimulating the activity of Src family kinases in a Smo-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007007-Yam1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. While this study would indicate a primary role for Smo, prior studies have indicated an additional role for the novel Shh receptors, Boc and Hip, in Shh mediated axonal chemoattraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007007-Okada1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007007-Bourikas1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. It will be of interest to investigate a possible role for these kinases and receptors in mDN axonal targeting.</p><p>Further studies are also needed to identify the molecular basis for the differential sensitivity of medial and lateral mDN populations to Shh chemoattraction. We hypothesize that unidentified noncanonical signaling components may be differentially expressed in these cell populations. Alternatively, chemorepulsive signaling pathway components that antagonize the Shh signal, such as Slit pathway components, may be differentially expressed on these cell populations. One limitation to determining differential expression of these signaling components in lateral and medial mDN populations during embryogenesis is the lack of specific markers for embryonic mDN subpopulations.</p><p>In conclusion, these studies support a model in which Shh signaling is necessary for the structural and functional diversity of the ascending mDN axonal projections that emanate from the midbrain. Therefore, Shh guidance signaling may play an important role in proper targeting of dopaminergic cells in replacement therapies for Parkinson's disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All animal studies were performed under an approved IACUC</p><p>animal protocol according to the institutional guidelines at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Columbia University.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Immunohistochemistry, X-gal staining and in situ hybridization on embryonic sections</title><p><italic>Nestin-Smo</italic> cko mice (<italic>Nestin-Cre; Smo flox/rec</italic>) mice were generated as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007007-Blaess1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Ptc-lacZ</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007007-Goodrich1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> mice were described.</p><p>Immunohistochemistry and X-gal staining: 12 &#x000b5;m or 30 &#x000b5;m cryosections or 50 &#x000b5;m vibratome sections of 4&#x00025;PFA fixed mouse embryos were blocked with 5&#x00025; donkey serum in PBS/1&#x00025; Triton-X for one hour, stained with sheep anti-TH (1&#x02236;500, Pel-Freeze) or rabbit anti-TH (1&#x02236;500, Millipore), rabbit anti-Smo (1&#x02236;50, Santa Cruz), mouse anti-SHH (1&#x02236;100, 5E1 clone, DSHB Iowa) in 5&#x00025; donkey serum in PBS/1&#x00025; Triton-X overnight, and labeled with appropriate secondary antibodies (1&#x02236;250, Jackson ImmunoResearch) in 5&#x00025; donkey serum in PBS/1&#x00025; Triton-X for 2 hours.
