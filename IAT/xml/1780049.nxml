A large body of evidence suggests that plant WRKY transcription factors are involved in plant defense including transcriptional regulation of plant host genes in response to pathogen infection.

This proposed role is consistent with the recent finding that WRKY25 is a substrate of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>MAP kinase 4, a repressor of SA-dependent defense responses.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Plants are subjected to constant attack by a variety of microbial pathogens and herbivores and they have evolved a complex battery of defense mechanisms that are activated by multiple defense signaling pathways. Thus, in response to infection by some microbial pathogens, the interacting EDS1 and PAD4 proteins are induced and activated; these proteins positively regulate biosynthesis of salicylic acid (SA) and SA-dependent defense signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Other defense pathways mediated by ethylene (ET) and jasmonic acid (JA) also can be activated by certain pathogens and herbivores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Genetic and molecular analyses indicate that these distinct defense pathways cross-talk extensively and their relationship can be synergistic or antagonistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Activation of plant defense responses following pathogen infection is associated with induction of a large number of host genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Some of the pathogen-induced genes encode proteins with direct anti-microbial activities (e.g. the hydrolytic glucanases and chitinases that degrade cell walls of microbial organisms) or enzymes involved in biosynthesis of anti-microbial compounds (e.g. phytoalexins), whereas others encode proteins with regulatory functions in the defense signaling pathways. Many of these defense genes appear to be induced at the transcriptional level through the specific recognition of <italic>cis</italic>-acting promoter elements and <italic>trans</italic>-acting sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors. Several classes of transcription factors have been implicated in plant defense responses, including DNA-binding proteins containing the novel WRKY zinc-finger motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Although originally thought to be plant specific, genes encoding WRKY proteins have been found in two non-photosynthetic eukaryotes, the slime mold <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>and the protist <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic>. The latter two organisms evolutionally precede the divergence of plants from animals and fungi, indicating an ancient origin of WRKY transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, WRKY genes have greatly proliferated and form large superfamilies in angiosperms, with more than 70 members in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>A growing body of evidence suggests that WRKY proteins play important roles in regulating genes associated with plant defense responses. For example, pathogen infection or treatment with elicitors or SA rapidly induces WRKY gene expression in several plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, expression of many WRKY genes was differentially regulated after pathogen infection or SA treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Moreover, many defense-related genes, including several <italic>Pathogenesis-Related </italic>(<italic>PR</italic>) genes and the regulatory <italic>NPR1 </italic>gene, contain W-box elements in their promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. W-box sequences are specifically recognized by WRKY proteins and are necessary for inducible expression of these genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>In addition to this indirect evidence, several studies have revealed direct links between specific WRKY proteins and plant defense responses. Virus-induced silencing of three <italic>WRKY </italic>genes in tobacco compromised <italic>N </italic>gene-mediated resistance to <italic>Tobacco mosaic virus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Additionally, the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>resistance gene <italic>RRS1</italic>, which confers resistance to the bacterial pathogen <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic>, encodes a novel WRKY protein, WRKY52, that combines typical TIR-NBS-LRR R protein motifs with a WRKY domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Moreover, two <italic>Arabidopsis WRKY </italic>genes (<italic>WRKY22 </italic>and <italic>WRKY29</italic>) were shown to be induced by a MAP kinase pathway that mediates resistance responses to both bacterial and fungal pathogens and expression of <italic>WRKY29 </italic>in transiently transformed leaves led to reduced disease symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Likewise, constitutive expression of <italic>Arabidopsis WRKY18 </italic>and <italic>WRKY70 </italic>conferred constitutive or enhanced expression of defense-related genes, including SA-induced <italic>PR1</italic>, and increased resistance to virulent pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Interestingly while overexpression of <italic>Arabidopsis WRKY18 </italic>activated SA-regulated <italic>PR1 </italic>gene expression and enhanced resistance to <italic>P. syringae</italic>, its coexpression with genes encoding its interacting partner WRKY40 or WRKY60 had opposite effects on <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>resistance to the bacterial pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>In a previously reported study using yeast two-hybrid screening, <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>MAP kinase 4 (MPK4), an activator of JA/ET-mediated defense and a repressor of SA-dependent resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], was found to interact with a MPK4 substrate MKS1 that, in turn, interacts with <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>WRKY25 and WRKY33 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In addition, WRKY25 and WRKY33 were phosphorylated by MPK4 <italic>in vitro </italic>and a <italic>wrky33 </italic>knockout mutant expressed elevated levels of <italic>PR1 </italic>under a short-day growth condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These results suggest that WRKY25 and WRKY33 may function as downstream components of the MPK4-mediated SA-repressing and JA/ET-activating signaling pathways. Indeed, we have recently shown that disruption of <italic>WRKY33 </italic>results in enhanced susceptibility to necrotrophic fungal pathogens and impaired expression of JA/ET-regulated defense genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. No such phenotypes were observed in the <italic>wrky25 </italic>T-DNA insertion mutants. These results indicate that WRKY33 functions as a positive regulator of JA/ET-mediated pathways and plays an important role in disease resistance to necrotrophic fungal pathogen.</p><p>SA-mediated signaling has been shown to play a critical role in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>responses to infection by <italic>Pseudomonas syringae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We therefore used this model system to investigate the role of WRKY25 in the activation of defense responses. WRKY25 specifically bound the W-box sequence and was localized in the nucleus. In addition, <italic>WRKY25 </italic>is induced by a variety of environmental stress stimuli, including SA and ET treatment. Further linking WRKY25 with defense signaling, transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>constitutively overexpressing <italic>WRKY25 </italic>displayed reduced pathogen-induced <italic>PR1 </italic>gene expression and enhanced susceptibility to virulent <italic>P. syringae </italic>pv. <italic>maculicola </italic>strain ES4326 (<italic>Psm</italic>ES4326). By contrast, two independent T-DNA insertion mutants for <italic>WRKY25 </italic>developed milder disease symptoms than wild type plants after <italic>Psm</italic>ES4326 infection. These results suggest that WRKY25 plays a negative role in SA-regulated <italic>PR1 </italic>gene expression and resistance to <italic>P. syringae</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Structure, DNA binding and subcellular localization</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis WRKY25 </italic>(At2g30250) encodes a protein of 394 amino acids with a molecular weight of 44.134 kD and an isolelectric point of 6.43 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Based on the presence of two WRKY domains, WRKY25 is classified as a group I WRKY protein. The N-terminus and the region between the WRKY domains are rich in serine and/or threonine residues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Thus, WRKY25 may be regulated, at least in part, via protein phosphorylation by a protein kinase(s) such as MPK4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>WRKY transcription factors are thought to function by binding their cognate TTGACC/T W-box <italic>cis</italic>-elements in the promoter regions of target genes and activating or repressing their expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A number of isolated WRKY proteins have been shown to bind W-box sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. To examine the DNA-binding activity of WRKY25, we expressed the gene in <italic>E. coli</italic>, purified the recombinant protein, and assayed its binding to an oligonucleotide that contains two direct TTGACC repeats (Pchn5; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) using EMSA. Several WRKY25/DNA complexes with differing mobility were detected when purified recombinant WRKY25 protein was incubated with the Pchn5 probe (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Whether the different complexes represent probes in which one or both of the W boxes are bound by WRKY25, or whether they are caused by formation of monomeric and oligomeric WRKY25 complexes is unclear. Alternatively, some of these complexes might result from protein degradation or incompletely translation of the <italic>WRKY25 </italic>gene. Binding of WRKY25 was not detected with a mutant probe (mPchn5) in which both TTGACC sequences were changed to TTGAAC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Thus, binding of WRKY25 to the TTGACC W-box sequence is highly specific.</p><p>If WRKY25 is a transcription factor, it is likely to be localized in the nucleus. The presence of putative nuclear localization signal predicted by the PSORT II program is consistent with this possibility. To determine the subcellular location of WRKY25, we constructed a GFP protein fusion of WRKY25. The fusion construct, driven by the <italic>Cauliflower mosaic virus </italic>(CaMV)<italic>35S </italic>promoter, was directly bombarded into onion (<italic>Allium cepa</italic>) epidermal cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, the transiently expressed WRKY25-GFP fusion protein was localized exclusively to the nucleus. By contrast, GFP was found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm due to its small size (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of <italic>WRKY25</italic></title><p>A possible role for WRKY25 during defense signaling was further investigated by analyzing its expression in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>after inoculation with <italic>Psm</italic>ES4326. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, <italic>WRKY25 </italic>mRNA levels increase in wild-type plants after infiltration with either the control MgCl<sub>2 </sub>solution (mock inoculation) or the bacterial suspension. However, <italic>WRKY25 </italic>expression was prolonged in pathogen-infected plants, as transcript levels remained elevated at 24 hours post infiltration (hpi), whereas they were nearly undetectable in MgCl<sub>2</sub>-treated plant at this time (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether WRKY25 expression is influenced by the SA, ET and/or JA signaling pathways, WRKY25 expression was monitored in various signaling mutants. Induced <italic>WRKY25 </italic>expression was modestly reduced in the <italic>npr1-3 </italic>and <italic>sid2 </italic>mutants, which are defective in SA signaling and biosynthesis, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). By contrast, no significant difference was observed in <italic>WRKY25 </italic>expression between the wild-type plants and the ET-insensitive <italic>ein2 </italic>mutant plants following mock or pathogen inoculation. Analysis of the JA-insensitive <italic>coi1 </italic>mutant revealed a delay in <italic>WRKY25 </italic>expression following mock inoculation; however, it was significantly enhanced after pathogen infiltration, as compared with that observed in wild-type plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>WRKY25 </italic>expression is sensitive to environmental cues and it appears to be positively regulated by the SA signaling pathway but negatively regulated by the JA pathway.</p><p>We also analyzed <italic>WRK25 </italic>induction in wild-type plants sprayed with water, SA, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC, the immediate precursor of ET) or methyl JA. <italic>WRKY25 </italic>expression was rapidly induced in water-treated plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), underscoring that the gene is very responsive to environmental stimuli. Plants sprayed with SA or ACC accumulated greater levels of WRKY25 transcripts than water-sprayed plants, whereas JA-treated plants accumulated less (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Thus, both SA and ET regulate <italic>WRKY25 </italic>expression in a positive manner, whereas JA has a negative effect on <italic>WRKY25 </italic>expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Disrupting or altering <italic>WRKY25 </italic>expression affects disease resistance and symptom severity</title><p>To analyze the role of WRKY25 in disease resistance, we identified two T-DNA insertion mutants for <italic>WRKY25</italic>. <italic>wrky25-1 </italic>(Salk_136966) contains a T-DNA insertion in the promoter region while <italic>wrky25-2 </italic>(Sail 754_A03) contains a T-DNA insertion in the last intron of the <italic>WRKY25 </italic>gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Homozygous mutant plants were identified by PCR with <italic>WRKY25</italic>-specific primers. We then compared the wild-type and <italic>wrky25 </italic>mutants for Induced accumulation of <italic>WRKY25 </italic>transcripts. Since MgCl<sub>2 </sub>treatment and pathogen infection had almost the same potency in inducing <italic>WRKY25 </italic>expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), we used only pathogen infection in these experiments. Northern analysis using a full-length <italic>WRKY25 </italic>cDNA clone as the probe detected <italic>WRKY25 </italic>transcripts in wild-type plants but not in <italic>wrky25-1 </italic>plants after pathogen infection. By contrast, a <italic>WRKY25 </italic>transcript of reduced size was detected in pathogen-infected <italic>wrky25-2 </italic>plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, upper panel). This transcript was not detected when the same blot was probed with a DNA fragment corresponding to the region downstream of the T-DNA insertion site in <italic>wrky25-2 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lower panel). Thus, the T-DNA insertion in the <italic>wrky25-2 </italic>mutant results in generation of a truncated <italic>WRKY25 </italic>transcript that is predicted to generate a truncated WRKY25 protein lacking the C-terminal WRKY domain, which is important for DNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of both <italic>wrky25 </italic>mutants revealed no difference in growth or morphology from that of wild-type plants; flowering also occurred at the normal time. Following inoculation with <italic>Psm</italic>ES4326, the mutant lines supported similar levels of bacterial growth as wild-type plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). However, the inoculated leaves of <italic>wrky25-1 </italic>and <italic>wrky25-2 </italic>plants consistently displayed less disease symptom than wild-type plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).</p><p>To examine the effect of <italic>WRKY25 </italic>overexpression, we generated plants containing a full-length <italic>WRKY25 </italic>cDNA driven by the <italic>CaMV 35S </italic>promoter (<italic>35S::W25</italic>). Northern blotting identified several transgenic plants that contained elevated levels of <italic>WRKY25 </italic>transcript constitutively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Two transgenic lines (#12 and #18 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) that constitutively expressed <italic>WRKY25 </italic>at elevated levels and contain a single T-DNA locus in their genomes, based on the ratio of antibiotic resistance phenotypes, were chosen for further study.</p><p>Analysis of T<sub>3 </sub>homozygous plants from both lines revealed no difference in growth or development from that of wild-type plants, although their leaf color appear to be slightly paler. Following inoculation with <italic>Psm</italic>ES4326, the transgenic 35S:W25 overexpression lines displayed substantially greater bacterial growth (~12 fold) than wild-type plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). The inoculated leaves of <italic>WRKY25</italic>-overexpressing plants also developed more severe disease symptoms than those of wild-type plants after infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>PR1 </italic>gene expression and SA accumulation</title><p>To study the molecular basis for the altered responses to <italic>Psm</italic>ES4326 infection, <italic>PR1 </italic>gene expression was monitored. Consistent with the enhanced susceptibility phenotype, <italic>WRKY25 </italic>overexpressing lines contained substantially lower levels of <italic>PR1 </italic>transcripts than wild-type plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). In contrast, <italic>PR1 </italic>transcript levels in the <italic>wrky25 </italic>mutants were comparable to those in wild-type plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether altered <italic>PR1 </italic>induction in the <italic>WRKY25</italic>-overexpressing plants correlated with reduced SA accumulation, the levels of both free SA and SA-glucoside conjugates (SAG) were monitored. Both wild-type plants and the T-DNA insertion mutants displayed similar levels of free SA and SAG following <italic>Psm</italic>ES4326 infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Free SA levels in <italic>WRKY25</italic>-overexpressing plants were comparable to those in wild-type plants at 0 and 24 hpi; however, the level of free SA at 48 hpi was somewhat lower than in wild-type plants. SAG levels in uninoculated <italic>WRKY25</italic>-overexpressing plants also were ~10-fold lower than those in wild-type plants, although they rose to nearly wild-type levels after infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion and Conclusion</title><p>To determine whether WRKY25 is a transcription factor that regulates disease resistance, we analyzed its role in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>responses to the bacterial pathogen <italic>P. syringae</italic>. Consistent with this putative function, WRKY25 is a nuclear-localized, DNA-binding protein that specifically recognizes the TTGAC W-box sequences (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Analysis of WRKY25 expression revealed that it is highly responsive to a variety of biotic and abiotic stress conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In wild-type plants, pathogen infection induced prolonged <italic>WRKY25 </italic>expression, whereas induction by mock inoculation was more transient. SA treatment also induced <italic>WRKY25 </italic>expression over that observed in water-treated plants, whereas it was reduced in JA-treated plants. Further arguing that the SA and JA signaling pathways play positively and negatively roles in regulating <italic>WRKY25 </italic>induction, respectively, was the demonstration that pathogen-induced <italic>WRKY25 </italic>expression was reduced in <italic>npr1-3 </italic>and <italic>sid2 </italic>mutants and enhanced in the <italic>coi1 </italic>mutant. Although JA frequently works with ET to signal defense responses, the role of ET in <italic>WRKY25 </italic>expression is unclear. ACC treatment induced <italic>WRKY25 </italic>expression, but pathogen-induced expression of this gene was unaffected in the <italic>ein2 </italic>mutant. Taken together, these results indicate that multiple signaling pathways associated with stress responses influence <italic>WRKY25 </italic>induction.</p><p>Strong evidence that this stress-induced <italic>WRKY </italic>gene functions as a negative regulator of defense against <italic>P. syringae </italic>comes from analysis of both transgenic overexpression lines and two T-DNA insertion mutants. Constitutive overexpression of <italic>WRKY25 </italic>suppressed pathogen-induced <italic>PR1 </italic>expression and enhanced both bacterial growth and symptom development as compared with wild-type plants, whereas the <italic>wrky25 </italic>mutants displayed reduced disease symptoms. Since the <italic>wrky25-1 </italic>and <italic>wrky25-2 </italic>mutants supported wild-type levels of bacterial growth, <italic>PR1 </italic>expression and SA accumulation, it is possible that WRKY25 exerts its negative effect(s) primarily by promoting disease symptom development. Consistent with this possibility, several studies have suggested that bacterial growth and symptom development are not necessarily linked and can be differentially affected by host genes. For example, the ET-insensitive <italic>ein2 </italic>mutant supports normal bacterial growth but develops reduced chlorosis after infection by <italic>P. syringae </italic>as compared to wild-type plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In addition, disruption of the <italic>Arabidopsis BOTRYTIS-SUSCEPTIBLE 1 </italic>(<italic>BOS1</italic>) gene, which encodes a R2R3 MYB transcription factor, causes enhanced disease symptoms after infection of <italic>P. syringae </italic>without affecting bacterial growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Alternatively, the observation that <italic>WRKY25</italic>-overexpressing plants displayed increased bacterial growth and enhanced disease symptoms suggests that this protein promotes both processes. If so, one possible explanation for why bacterial growth was unaffected in the <italic>wrky25 </italic>mutants is that WRKY25 function might vary depending on its expression level and/or biological context. Thus, relatively low-level and possibly tissue-specific expression of <italic>WRKY25</italic>, as in the wild-type plants, might promote symptom development, whereas the high-level, non-specific expression, as in the overexpression lines, might promote both disease symptoms and bacterial growth. Alternatively, functional redundancy between various members of the large WRKY gene family might mask the effect of a mutation in a single WRKY gene. WRKY25 shares very similar protein structure with WRKY33 and they also display similar pathogen-induced expression patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. To test possible functional redundancy between the two WRKY proteins, we have generated double knockout mutants for the two genes but observed no further enhancement in the phenotypes of disease resistance to either necrotrophic fungal pathogens or <italic>P. syringae </italic>(Zheng and Chen, unpublished results).</p><p>A growing body of evidence indicates that pathogen infection can activate multiple signaling pathways in the regulation of diverse defense mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. SA-mediated signaling pathway(s), for example, play important roles in defense against biotrophic pathogens and in activation of systemic acquired resistance against a diverse range of microbial pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Defense pathways mediated by JA and/or ET, on the other hand, are more effective against herbivores and necrotrophic pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. While these distinct defense pathways can sometimes function cooperatively, they often are antagonistic. SA has been shown to play an important role in signaling resistance to <italic>P. syringae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Thus, one possible mechanism through which WRKY25 negatively regulates defense responses after <italic>P. syringae </italic>infection is by repressing the SA signaling pathway. Supporting this possibility, plants overexpressing <italic>WRKY25 </italic>displayed reduced pathogen-induced expression of <italic>PR1</italic>, a molecular marker for SA-mediated defense pathways. Since these overexpressing plants accumulated nearly wild-type levels of free SA, WRKY25 may work at a point downstream of SA to repress defense responses. Previous studies have revealed that suppression of the SA signaling pathway enhances the activation of JA-induced responses. Thus, we tested whether <italic>WRKY25 </italic>overexpressing lines and/or <italic>wrky25 </italic>mutants displayed altered responses to two necrotrophic fungal pathogens, <italic>Botrytis cinerea </italic>and <italic>Alternaria brassicicola</italic>. Neither the <italic>WRKY25 </italic>overexpression lines nor the mutants lines displayed altered fungal growth or symptom development (unpublished results).</p><p>It was recently demonstrated that WRKY25 is phosphorylated by MPK4 <italic>in vitro</italic>; WRKY25 also interacts with MKS1, a substrate of MPK4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These results, together with our analysis, suggest that WRKY25 functions in the MPK4 signaling pathway that represses SA-mediated defense responses. WRKY33 appears to function largely as an activator of JA/ET-mediated signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. These studies support that these two WRKY transcription factors function in the MPK4-mediated SA-repressing and JA/ET-activating signaling pathways. In addition, our analyses revealed that <italic>WRKY25 </italic>expression is induced by abiotic stress, such as infiltration with MgCl<sub>2 </sub>or spraying with water. Previous studies have demonstrated that <italic>WRKY25 </italic>also is induced by oxidative stress, heat shock and wounding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Thus, this transcription factor may play a role in responses to abiotic as well as biotic stresses. However, transgenic plants constitutively expressing <italic>WRKY25 </italic>were not more tolerant to oxidative stress, as measured by root growth on agar plates in the presence or absence of the superoxide-generating agent paraquat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Whether our <italic>WRKY25 </italic>overexpression plants and/or the loss-of-function mutants exhibit altered responses to other abiotic stress conditions has not been determined. Future studies in this direction may reveal not only additional roles for WRKY25 in plant defense and stress responses, but also possible interactions between their respective signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>[&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]dATP (&#x0003e;3,000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from New England Nuclear; other common chemicals were purchased from Sigma. <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>plants were grown in growth rooms at 22&#x000b0;C and 120 &#x003bc;Em<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1 </sup>light on a 12 hour light and 12 hour dark photoperiod.

A. Amino acid sequence of WRKY25. The two WRKY motifs are indicated with the highly conserved WRKYGQK sequence and the residues forming the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2 </sub>zinc fingers underlined. B. Oligonucleotides used in the electrophoretic mobility shifting assay (EMSA). The Pchn5 probe contains two direct W-box repeats, while in the mPchn5 probe, the TTGACC sequences are mutated to TTGAAC. The wild-type and mutated W-box sequences are underlined. C. EMSA to test binding of recombinant WRKY25 to the W box motif in the Pchn5 probe. Binding reactions containing WRKY25 and Pchn5 produced two major DNA/protein complexes, which are indicated by arrows. Change of the TTGACC to TTGAAC in the mPchn5 probe abolished WRKY25 binding. No retarded bands were detected in the absence of the recombinant WRKY25 protein.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2229-7-2-1"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Localization of WRKY25 <italic>in vivo</italic>. WRKY25 was fused to GFP to yield W25-GFP; this chimeric protein was localized to the nucleus of onion epidermal cells. GFP alone was detected in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm due to its small size. Bright-field image of the onion epidermal cells are shown in the top panels.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2229-7-2-2"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Expression of <italic>WRKY25</italic>.
