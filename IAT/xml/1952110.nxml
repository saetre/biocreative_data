SR proteins bind to exonic splicing enhancers via their RRM(s), and from this position are thought to promote splicing by antagonizing splicing silencers, recruiting other components of the splicing machinery through RS-RS domain interactions, and/or promoting RNA base-pairing through their RS domains. An RS domain tethered at an exonic splicing enhancer can function as a splicing activator, and RS domains play prominent roles in current models of SR protein functions. However, we previously reported that the RS domain of the SR protein SF2/ASF is dispensable for <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing of some pre-mRNAs. We have now extended these findings via the identification of a short inhibitory domain at the SF2/ASF N-terminus; deletion of this segment permits splicing in the absence of this SR protein's RS domain of an IgM pre-mRNA substrate previously classified as RS-domain-dependent. Deletion of the N-terminal inhibitory domain increases the splicing activity of SF2/ASF lacking its RS domain, and enhances its ability to bind pre-mRNA. Splicing of the IgM pre-mRNA in S100 complementation with SF2/ASF lacking its RS domain still requires an exonic splicing enhancer, suggesting that an SR protein RS domain is not always required for ESE-dependent splicing activation. Our data provide additional evidence that the SF2/ASF RS domain is not strictly required for constitutive splicing <italic>in vitro</italic>, contrary to prevailing models for how the domains of SR proteins function to promote splicing.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The SR proteins are a family of conserved splicing factors that consist of either one or two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRM) and a C-terminal arginine- and serine-rich (RS) domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Zahler1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Birney1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although the aforementioned functions of SR proteins are assumed to occur via RS-domain-mediated protein-protein interactions, it has not yet been demonstrated that such interactions occur in the context of a functional spliceosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Hertel1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A second mode by which SR proteins promote exon inclusion is by antagonizing the negative regulation conferred by exonic splicing silencers (ESSs), pre-mRNA regulatory elements that inhibit exon inclusion in both constitutive and alternative splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Pozzoli1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the recruitment model, SF2/ASF binds via its RS domain to U2AF<sup>35</sup> to indirectly recruit U2AF<sup>65</sup> to the polypyrimidine tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Graveley2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas in the antagonism model, the sole function of enhancer-bound SF2/ASF is to prevent PTB from binding to a downstream ESS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Shen3">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.

We prepared various fragments of SF2/ASF for structural and functional studies, including versions lacking the C-terminal RS domain and/or an N-terminal extension that precedes RRM1.

In retrospect, what these early experiments may have been demonstrating was the importance of sequences preceding RRM1 in influencing the ability of SR proteins to be recruited to pre-mRNA. Initial experiments to test whether the RS domain of SF2/ASF is required for splicing were carried out with versions of &#x00394;RS tagged at the N-terminus, and these experiments consistently showed that the RS domain of SF2/ASF was required for constitutive splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Cceres1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Zuo2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Mayeda1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>.

We have not ruled out the possibility that deletion of sequences from the N-terminus, including the N-terminal extension to RRM1, increase the ability of &#x00394;RS to bind to pre-mRNA and promote splicing merely by increasing solubility of the SR protein. Nonetheless, we now find that deletion of the majority of the amino acids preceding RRM1 in the context of the &#x00394;RS protein permits splicing even of the IgM M1-M2 pre-mRNA, a substrate previously classified as RS-domain-dependent, further demonstrating that the RS domain is dispensable for constitutive splicing <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>RRMs can have N-terminal and C-terminal extensions augmenting their core structure that are usually poorly ordered, but in some cases adopt a secondary structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Maris1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.

The 20 available NMR structures of RRM1 of SF2/ASF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-He1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref> when viewed collectively hint that the N-terminal extension is probably flexible and can adopt many different conformations, such that this region could sometimes occlude key RNA-binding residues on the protein's &#x003b2;-sheet. The observed flexibility of the N-terminal extension could be due in part to an additional hydrophilic-tag extension that was added for the purpose of improving solubility in the structure determination.</p><p>Based on our data and the documented functions of other RRM extensions, we propose that the most likely explanation for the inhibitory effect of amino acids 2-11 of SF2/ASF on splicing is that the N-terminal segment negatively affects RNA binding by RRM1. In this model, the N-terminal domain may be inhibitory by functioning as a damper upon RRM1 to interfere with its binding to the RNA. Indeed, we have observed in UV crosslinking assays that deletion of the N-terminal extension from &#x00394;RS greatly enhances apparent binding of the protein to IgM M1-M2 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000854-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). These quantitative differences in crosslinking probably reflect differences in binding; although residues outside the &#x003b2;-sheet could potentially crosslink also, the major sites of crosslinking likely involve conserved aromatic residues in the RNP-1 and RNP-2 core submotifs at the center of the &#x003b2;-sheet, as has been shown for the RRMs of hnRNP A1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Merrill1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>. Addition of an N-terminal tag to &#x00394;RS may exacerbate the inhibitory effect of the natural N-terminus on RNA binding, accounting for the early observations that His-tagged SF2/ASF lacking its RS domain was unable to support constitutive splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Cceres1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Zuo2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Mayeda1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>.

In a scenario in which the N-terminal extension of RRM1 prevents recruitment of &#x00394;RS to pre-mRNA by blocking access to key RNA-binding residues on the &#x003b2;-sheet, substitution of the conserved arginine with an acidic residue, but not with an uncharged residue, may be sufficient to interfere with potential intramolecular interactions between the N-terminal extension preceding RRM1 and the RNA-binding surface of the protein.</p><p>We propose that in the context of the splicing reaction, the SF2/ASF RS domain normally assists in overcoming the inhibitory effect of the N-terminus, most probably by helping to recruit the RRM(s) to the RNA. Thus, one possible reason for the previously reported, apparent RS-domain-dependence of some substrates could be that in the context of these pre-mRNAs, binding of RRM1 of SF2/ASF is inhibited, due to unfavorable secondary structure of the pre-mRNA or steric block by proteins bound adjacent to the RRM1 target, or both; a hypophosphorylated RS domain might therefore assist in initial recruitment of SF2/ASF to its target, through its own charge-mediated contacts with adjacent RNA sequences, bringing in the N-terminal RRM region so that it can directly contact the RNA. In agreement with this hypothesis, using a UV crosslinking assay, we observed little difference between crosslinking of SF2/ASF and &#x00394;NSF2/ASF to IgM M1-M2 pre-mRNA, whereas the &#x00394;RS protein bound less efficiently to IgM M1-M2 than did either SF2/ASF or &#x00394;NSF2/ASF; however, when the N-terminal extension was deleted from &#x00394;RS, its binding to the pre-mRNA was greatly enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000854-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Constitutive splicing without an SR protein RS domain</title><p>Our finding that the RS domain is not required for constitutive splicing of IgM M1-M2 seemingly contradicts prevailing models about how SR proteins function to promote splicing.

However, because some substrates were found to require the RS domain, RS-domain-mediated recruitment functions of SF2/ASF could not be formally discounted, and were still hypothesized to occur for RS-domain-dependent substrates. Splicing in the absence of an SR protein RS domain suggests two possibilities for how the domains of SR proteins function to promote pre-mRNA splicing from the ESE position. First, the RS domain may indeed be required in some contexts for recruitment functions of SR proteins, and in contexts where the protein is active in the absence of the RS domain, the &#x00394;RS portion of the protein may promote splicing by antagonizing the function of splicing silencers. Second, the &#x00394;RS portion of the protein may be sufficient to recruit splicing factors to activate splicing. As the number of constitutive substrates that can be spliced without an SR protein RS domain continues to grow, it seems increasingly improbable that SR proteins lacking their RS domains can only support splicing in contexts where recruitment functions of SR proteins are dispensable. Instead, it appears more likely that protein-protein interactions occurring through the RS domain of SR proteins are not essential for recruitment of splicing factors, a finding that seems at odds with current recruitment models for SR protein function.</p><p>The traditional recruitment models for SR protein function assume that the ESE-bound RS domain of an SR protein interacts with the RS domain of another splicing component, such as U2AF<sup>35</sup> or U1-70K. Much support has been garnered for the SR protein RS domain-mediated recruitment model, through experiments that employed MS2-RS domain fusion proteins as splicing activators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Graveley2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Graveley3">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Graveley4">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. However, if our &#x00394;N&#x00394;RS protein is functioning to recruit other splicing components, it cannot be doing so through RS-RS domain interactions. Although there is evidence to suggest that SR proteins assist in the recruitment of essential splicing factors, such as U2AF<sup>35</sup> or U1-70K, which themselves have RS domains, it is not clear that this recruitment requires the RS domains of both of the involved proteins. For example, the RS domain of SF2/ASF is not required for enhancement of U1 snRNP binding to alternative 5&#x02032; splice sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Eperon1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>, which is presumed to occur through an interaction with the RS-domain-containing protein U1-70K. Indeed, it is unlikely that the SF2/ASF RS domain can function to recruit U1 snRNP through interactions with U1-70K, as the isolated, unphosphorylated RS domain of SF2/ASF is not sufficient for interaction with U1-70K <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Xiao1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. It seems more probable that some portion of SF2/ASF other than, or in addition to, the RS domain engages in protein-protein interactions with U1-70K to recruit U1 snRNP, considering that a GST-&#x00394;RS fusion protein can engage in RNA-independent protein-protein interactions with U1-70K <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Xiao1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Some labs have reported that at least one of the RS domains of SF2/ASF and U1-70K is required for interactions between these two proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Kohtz1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Cao1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>, but these experiments did not demonstrate that the RS domains of both proteins were required for their interaction. The proposed recruitment function of SR proteins for which the most experimental evidence has been assembled is the model in which an ESE-bound SR protein engages via its RS domain in protein-protein interactions with the RS domain of U2AF<sup>35</sup> to aid in the recruitment of U2AF<sup>65</sup> to the polypyrimidine tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Graveley1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Zuo1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

From these experiments we may conclude that one of the primary functions of ESEs is to recruit an RS domain. However, an ESE is still required for splicing of IgM M1-M2 with our &#x00394;N&#x00394;RS protein, which lacks an RS domain. Clearly, recruitment of an RS domain by any means to the position of the ESE can function to promote splicing, yet in conjunction with the previous report of RS-domain-independent splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Zhu2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> our data strongly suggest that the SR protein RS domain is not required at this position to activate splicing. This apparent paradox can be resolved if we consider that the function of an SR protein may not be to recruit other splicing factors through its RS domain, but rather simply to recruit an RS domain, whether its own or the RS domain of another splicing factor. In an SR protein RS-domain-independent recruitment model, the SR protein would interact with another splicing factor, and this interaction must recruit at least one RS domain for splicing to be activated. An SR protein lacking its RS domain could activate splicing by interacting, for example, with U2AF<sup>35</sup>, which itself has an RS domain, or with U1-70K, which also has its own RS domain. Such a mechanism would be analogous to the situation described for U2AF<sup>65</sup> and U2AF<sup>35</sup>, which interact with each other and both have RS domains, but only one of the two RS domains is required for splicing to occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Zamore1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Rudner1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000854-Rudner2">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>.
