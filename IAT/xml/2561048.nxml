Mutations in the G-CSFR in patients with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) transforming to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) have been shown to induce hypersensitivity and enhanced growth responses to G-CSF. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of the ubiquitin/proteasome system in the initiation of negative signaling by the G-CSFR. To further investigate the role of ubiquitination in regulating G-CSFR signaling, we generated a mutant form of the G-CSFR (K762R/G-CSFR) which abrogates the attachment of ubiquitin to the lysine residue at position 762 of the G-CSFR that is deleted in the &#x00394;716 G-CSFR form isolated from patients with SCN/AML. In response to G-CSF, mono-/polyubiquitination of the G-CSFR was impaired in cells expressing the mutant K762R/G-CSFR compared to cells transfected with the WT G-CSFR. Cells stably transfected with the K762R/G-CSFR displayed a higher proliferation rate, increased sensitivity to G-CSF, and enhanced survival following cytokine depletion, similar to previously published data with the &#x00394;716 G-CSFR mutant. Activation of the signaling molecules Stat5 and Akt were also increased in K762R/G-CSFR transfected cells in response to G-CSF, and their activation remained prolonged after G-CSF withdrawal. These results indicate that ubiquitination is required for regulation of G-CSFR-mediated proliferation and cell survival. Mutations that disrupt G-CSFR ubiquitination at lysine 762 induce aberrant receptor signaling and hyperproliferative responses to G-CSF, which may contribute to leukemic transformation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR) plays a critical role in myeloid cell survival, proliferation, and neutrophilic maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003422-Demetri1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003422-Schmitz2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Like other members of the cytokine receptor family, the G-CSFR undergoes conformational changes in response to G-CSF binding, leading to activation of associated Jak kinases and downstream signaling cascades that include signal transducer and activators of transcription (Stat) kinases, Ras/mitogen-associated protein (Ras/MAP) kinase, and the phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI3) kinase/Akt pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003422-Avalos2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003422-Hunter1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Simultaneously, mechanisms that down-regulate the G-CSFR in target cells are rapidly turned on to attenuate receptor signaling and protect cells from over-stimulation. Although multiple processes, including the recruitment of SHIP and SHP-1 to the G-CSFR complex as well as the production of SOCS proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003422-Hunter2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003422-Hermans1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> have been extensively studied, the mechanisms mediating negative G-CSFR signaling remain poorly understood.</p><p>Ligand binding has been shown to trigger intracellular signaling as well as endocytosis, internalization, and subsequent intracellular degradation of growth factor receptors. For the Type I cytokine receptors to which the G-CSFR belongs, endocytosis and degradation have been best characterized for the growth hormone receptor (GH-R), interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R), and the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003422-Lamaze1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003422-Walrafen1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. These receptors all undergo ligand-induced ubiquitination. Enzymatic attachment of ubiquitin, a 76 amino acid polypeptide, to lysine residues present in these receptors was shown to provide a recognition tag for delivery of the receptors to either the lysosome or proteasome. In the acidic environment of lysosomes, bound ligands can dissociate from their respective receptors, while in the proteasome the ubiquitinated receptors are degraded, processes that both culminate in attenuation of receptor signaling.</p><p>We previously examined the role of the ubiquitin/proteasome system in G-CSFR internalization and intracellular sorting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003422-KindwallKeller1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The G-CSFR was shown to be ubiquitinated via ligand-dependent and independent mechanisms and disruption of the ubiquitin machinery inhibited endocytosis of the G-CSFR. Pre-treatment of both transfected cells and primary human neutrophils with proteasome inhibitors inhibited ligand-induced degradation of the activated G-CSFR, indicating the importance of G-CSFR ubiquitination and the proteasome in modulating G-CSFR surface expression.</p><p>To further investigate the role of ubiquitination in G-CSFR-mediated cell proliferation, we generated a mutant form of the G-CSFR (K762R/G-CSFR) which abrogates the attachment of ubiquitin molecules to the lysine residue at position 762 of the receptor that is deleted by mutations in the G-CSFR in patients with SCN/AML. In response to G-CSF, mono-/polyubiquitination was impaired in cells transiently expressing the mutant receptor form. Cells stably transfected with the K762R/G-CSFR exhibited increased growth and enhanced sensitivity to G-CSF, and extended cell survival following G-CSF depletion. Activation of both Stat5 and Akt were also prolonged in K762R/G-CSFR transfected cells in response to G-CSF, and their activation remained prolonged even after G-CSF withdrawal. These data indicate that ubiquitination of the C-terminal lysine in the G-CSFR that is detected in patients with SCN/AML is required for normal G-CSFR-mediated cell proliferation and survival.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mono-/polyubiquitination is impaired in cells transfected with the K762R/G-CSFR</title><p>We previously reported that the WT G-CSFR undergoes both mono- and polyubiquitination in response to G-CSF, which could be detected using the commercially available FK2 antibody <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003422-KindwallKeller1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although the cytoplasmic domain of the G-CSFR lacks a classical ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis motif, it has five lysine residues at positions 632, 672, 680, 681, and 762 that could serve as potential attachment sites for ubiquitin. The lysine residue at position 762 is the sole cytoplasmic lysine that localizes to the region that is deleted in the &#x00394;716 G-CSFR mutant. Recent studies by our laboratory have suggested that defective ligand-induced ubiquitination of the &#x00394;716 G-CSFR underlies its aberrant internalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003422-KindwallKeller1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. We were therefore interested in determining whether site-specific disruption of ubiquitination at lysine762 of the G-CSFR would induce a similar phenotype as the &#x00394;716 G-CSFR truncation mutant.</p><p>In the current study, we replaced the lysine residue at position 762 of the G-CSFR with an arginine residue, and examined the effects of this mutation on G-CSF-mediated cellular responses and signaling. CHO cells expressing the K762R/G-CSFR exhibited markedly reduced mono- and polyubiquitination of the G-CSFR in response to G-CSF compared to cells expressing the WT receptor, indicating that lysine 762 is critical for ligand-induced G-CSFR ubiquitination. BaF3 cells stably transfected with the mutant K762R/G-CSFR were found to by hypersensitive to G-CSF and could survive and proliferate in G-CSF concentrations as low as 0.08 ng/ml, a concentration that was insufficient to support the growth and survival of cells expressing the WT receptor. Furthermore, at G-CSF concentrations high enough to support the survival of cells expressing the WT G-CSFR, cells expressing the K762R mutant G-CSFR hyperproliferated in response to G-CSF, which was reproducible in three independent experiments using three different K762R clones. Additionally, following withdrawal of the BaF3 transfectants from G-CSF-containing media, cells expressing the K762R/G-CSFR mutant exhibited prolonged survival over WT G-CSFR-expressing cells. These results suggest that ubiquitination of the G-CSFR at lysine 762 is required for the normal G-CSFR-mediated cell growth and survival.</p><p>To confirm the physiologic relevance of our findings in BaF3 cells, we next examined the G-CSF-responsiveness of myeloid cells expressing the K762R mutant. For these experiments, we used the 32Dcl3 cell line. 32Dcl3 cells stably expressing the K762R/G-CSFR mutant also hyperproliferated in response to G-CSF and exhibited enhanced survival following cytokine depletion. These findings are consistent with our previously reported observations with cells expressing the &#x00394;716-G-CSFR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003422-Hunter1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, and suggest that defective ubiquitination contributes to the aberrant cellular response of cells from patients with SCN/AML to G-CSF.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that both Stat3 and Stat5 are rapidly activated and phosphorylated in response to G-CSF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003422-Irandoust1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. We were therefore interested in determining whether mutation of lysine 762 which disrupts ligand-induced ubiquitination of the G-CSFR had any effect on Stat3 and Stat5 activation. Notably, cells expressing the K762R/G-CSFR exhibited increased activation of Stat5 in response to G-CSF compared to WT cells, and Stat5 activation remained prolonged in K762R-expressing cells even following G-CSF withdrawal. In contrast, there was no evidence that activation of Stat3 was altered in K762/G-CSFR-expressing cells. These findings are consistent with recently published data from Link's group in which expression of a truncated mutant murine G-CSFR form (d715F) in mice that is equivalent to the &#x00394;716 human G-CSFR in patients with SCN/AML was found to confer a strong clonal advantage that was dependent on Stat5, but not Stat3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003422-Liu1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, Stat5 has been implicated in leukemogenesis, and expression of constitutively active Stat5 in hematopoietic cells has been shown to induce a rapidly fatal myeloproliferative disease in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003422-Moriggl1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003422-Schwaller1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A recent study by Irandoust et al in which all five lysine residues in the G-CSFR were mutated to arginine was reported to result in hyperproliferative responses to G-CSF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003422-Irandoust1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. These authors also reported that cells expressing the lysine-deficient G-CSFR exhibited prolonged activation of not only Stat5 but Stat3 as well. The reasons for the differences in their results and those reported here are not clear. However, collectively the results suggest that the proximal four lysine residues in the G-CSFR may play roles in Stat3 activation while lysine 762 is critical for Stat5 signaling, implicating distinct roles for individual cytoplasmic lysine residues in the G-CSFR.</p><p>Activation of the Akt signaling pathway has been reported to protect a variety of cell types from apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003422-Hunter1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. G-CSF has been shown to induce rapid phosphorylation of Akt at serine 473 in both WT- and &#x00394;716 G-CSFR-expressing cells. Moreover, we have previously reported that the enzymatic activity of Akt in response to G-CSF is prolonged in cells expressing the &#x00394;716 G-CSFR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003422-Hunter1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Our current results also demonstrate enhanced and prolonged activation of Akt in K762R-expressing cells in response to G-CSF compared to WT cells, suggesting that ubiquitination is also involved in regulation of the Akt signaling pathway in response to G-CSF stimulation.</p><p>Collectively, our data suggest a role for ubiquitination in G-CSF-mediated cell survival and proliferation. Lysine 762 in the cytoplasmic tail of the G-CSFR appears to be critical in regulating the amplitude and duration of Stat5 and Akt activation. Future studies to identify the molecules that interact with the ubiquitinated G-CSFR and the E3 ligase that is recruited to the phosphorylated G-CSFR should provide additional insights into the mechanisms that downregulate G-CSFR signaling, which are disrupted in patients with SCN/AML.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents and cell culture</title><p>G-CSF-responsive murine 32Dcl3 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Giovanni Rovera (The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, USA) and were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10&#x00025; WEHI 3B conditioned medium as a source of IL-3.
