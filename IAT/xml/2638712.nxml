Since pollen cells are symplasmically isolated during maturation and germination, membrane transporters are required for nitrogen import across the pollen plasma membrane. This study describes the characterization of the ammonium transporter AtAMT1;4, a so far uncharacterized member of the Arabidopsis AMT1 family, which is suggested to be involved in transporting ammonium into pollen. The <italic>AtAMT1;4</italic> gene encodes a functional ammonium transporter when heterologously expressed in yeast or when overexpressed in Arabidopsis roots. Concentration-dependent analysis of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled ammonium influx into roots of <italic>AtAMT1;4</italic>-transformed plants allowed characterization of AtAMT1;4 as a high-affinity transporter with a <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of 17&#x02009;&#x003bc;M. RNA and protein gel blot analysis showed expression of <italic>AtAMT1;4</italic> in flowers, and promoter&#x02013;gene fusions to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) further defined its exclusive expression in pollen grains and pollen tubes. The AtAMT1;4 protein appeared to be localized to the plasma membrane as indicated by protein gel blot analysis of plasma membrane-enriched membrane fractions and by visualization of GFP-tagged AtAMT1;4 protein in pollen grains and pollen tubes. However, no phenotype related to pollen function could be observed in a transposon-tagged line, in which <italic>AtAMT1;4</italic> expression is disrupted. These results suggest that AtAMT1;4 mediates ammonium uptake across the plasma membrane of pollen to contribute to nitrogen nutrition of pollen via ammonium uptake or retrieval.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ammonium uptake</kwd><kwd>AMTs</kwd><kwd>Germination</kwd><kwd>Nitrogen transport</kwd><kwd>Pollen</kwd><kwd>Pollen tube</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pollen development, pollen germination and pollen tube growth are critical stages during sexual reproduction of higher plants. At these stages in particular, pollen represents a significant sink for carbon and nitrogen which must be imported from source organs such as leaves (Schneidereit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2003</xref>, Lee and Tegeder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2004</xref>). Since there are no plasmodesmal connections to surrounding cells after microspores have been released from the tetrad, pollen grains and pollen tubes develop as symplasmically isolated organs (Scott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">1991</xref>). This isolation requires the presence of plasma membrane-localized transporters that load nutrients into the pollen. Therefore, pollen has been proposed as an ideal subject to study the role of membrane transport processes in nutrition and development (Schwacke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">1999</xref>). In fact, a recent genome-wide analysis of membrane transporter genes expressed in the male gametophytes of Arabidopsis revealed 757 transporter genes which are expressed in pollen, and even 16% of those are specifically or at least preferentially expressed relative to sporophytic tissues, revealing the essential roles of membrane transporters in pollen function (Bock et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2006</xref>). Based on further Arabidopsis transcriptome data (Honys and Twell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2004</xref>, Pina et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2005</xref>, Schmid et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2005</xref>, Sze et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2006</xref>), several Lys/His transporters (LHT) are specifically expressed in pollen at certain developmental stages of the flower, suggesting distinct roles of the individual transporters for organic nitrogen supply during pollen development, pollen germination and pollen tube growth. Further amino acid transporters, such as tobacco NsAAP1 and tomato LeProT1, have also been suggested to contribute to nitrogen transport into pollen (Lalanne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">1997</xref>, Schwacke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">1999</xref>).</p><p>Ammonium is a primary nitrogen source and key metabolite for plant nitrogen metabolism. Membrane transport of ammonium is mediated by ammonium transporters of the ammonium transporter/methylamine permease/rhesus (AMT/MEP/Rh) protein family, which has been found in all domains of life (von Wir&#x000e9;n and Merrick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2004</xref>). While NH<sub>3</sub> has been identified as the substrate being transported by either prokaryote AMT or eukaryote Rh-type ammonium transporters (Khademi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2004</xref>, Ripoche et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2004</xref>, Zheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2004</xref>), plant transporters of the AMT1 subfamily have been described as NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> uniporters or NH<sub>3</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> co-transporters (Ludewig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2002</xref>, Ludewig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2003</xref>, Mayer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2006</xref>). All plant AMT proteins investigated so far were localized to the plasma membrane, implicating their roles in ammonium acquisition by plant cells (Ludewig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2002</xref>, Sohlenkamp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2002</xref>, Simon-Rosin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2003</xref>, Ludewig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2003</xref>, Loqu&#x000e9; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2006</xref>, Yuan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2007a</xref>). In Arabidopsis, five members of the AMT1 subfamily have been identified (Loqu&#x000e9; and von Wir&#x000e9;n <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2004</xref>), and the physiological roles of four of them have been intensively investigated in roots (Kaiser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2002</xref>, Loqu&#x000e9; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2006</xref>, Yuan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2007a</xref>). AtAMT1;1, AtAMT1;3 and AtAMT1:5&#x02009; are highly expressed in nitrogen-deficient rhizodermal cells, including root hairs, and contribute additively to approximately 70&#x02013;80% of the overall high-affinity ammonium uptake capacity in Arabidopsis roots (Loqu&#x000e9; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2006</xref>, Yuan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2007a</xref>). In contrast, AtAMT1;2, presenting a relatively lower affinity for ammonium than the other members of the subfamily, is localized in endodermal and cortical cells, and appears to be responsible for the uptake of ammonium that has entered the root tissue via the apoplastic route (Yuan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2007a</xref>). In contrast to roots, the physiological functions of AMTs in other plant organs remain to be elucidated.</p><p>So far, AtAMT1;4 (At4g28700) represents the only member of the AMT1 subfamily in Arabidopsis which has not yet been characterized. Here, we describe the functional expression in yeast and in planta, as well as the tissue-specific expression and membrane localization of AtAMT1;4. Even though a transposon-tagged line in <italic>AtAMT1;4</italic> did not show any phenotype, substantial evidence is provided to propose a role for AtAMT1;4&#x02009;in ammonium uptake or retrieval in pollen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Heterologous expression of AtAMT1;4 in yeast</title><p>Out of the six AMT proteins identified in Arabidopsis, five have been subjected to functional analysis to date. For a functional characterization of AtAMT1;4 (At4g28700), the corresponding gene was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of the Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0 which was possible due to the absence of introns. The open reading frame (ORF) in <italic>AtAMT1;4</italic> is 1,515&#x02009;bp long and encodes a protein of 504 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 53.7&#x02009;kDa. At the amino acid level, AtAMT1;4 shares a high degree of homology (69.7&#x02013;74.3% identity) to other members of the AMT1 family in Arabidopsis.</p><p>To investigate the functional properties of the AtAMT1;4 protein, the ORF of <italic>AtAMT1;4</italic> was cloned into the yeast expression vector p426 and placed under control of the constitutively active yeast hexose transporter promoter <italic>HXT7</italic>. The resulting construct was used for transformation of the yeast stain 31019b, which is defective in the expression of three endogenous ammonium transporter genes (<italic>mep1</italic>, <italic>mep2</italic> and <italic>mep3</italic>) (Marini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">1997</xref>). This strain grows poorly on low ammonium concentrations (&#x0003c;5&#x02009;mM) as a sole nitrogen source. In contrast to transformants carrying the empty vector, yeast cells expressing either AtAMT1;4 or AtAMT1;1 were able to grow on 1&#x02009;mM ammonium, indicating that AtAMT1;4, similarly to AtAMT1;1, encodes a functional ammonium transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Growth complementation of the ammonium uptake-defective yeast strain <italic>31019b</italic> by AtAMT1;4.

Transformants were pre-cultured for 24&#x02009;h on YNB medium supplemented with 5&#x02009;mM arginine. A 1&#x02009;ml aliquot of a saturated culture was harvested, and resuspended in 1&#x02009;ml of water. One- to 5-fold dilutions of a 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;&#x02009;l aliquot of yeast cell suspension were spotted on YNB medium supplemented with either 5&#x02009;mM arginine or 1&#x02009;mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl at pH 6.0.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcn186f1"/></fig></p></sec><sec><title>Ectopic expression of AtAMT1; 4 in an Arabidopsis line defective in high-affinity ammonium uptake</title><p><italic>AtAMT1;4</italic> was then constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis plants to examine whether AtAMT1;4 has the potential to contribute to ammonium uptake in roots. To circumvent transport activities from endogenous AtAMTs in Arabidopsis roots, a multiple insertion line (<italic>qko</italic>) was chosen for transformation, in which the high-affinity ammonium uptake capacity is reduced by approximately 90% due to the genetic disruption of the <italic>AtAMT1;1</italic>, <italic>1;2</italic>, <italic>1;3</italic> and <italic>2;1</italic> genes (Yuan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2007a</xref>). Four independent homozygous lines from the T<sub>2</sub> generation of <italic>CaMV35S:AtAMT1;4</italic> transformants were selected for further investigation. RNA gel blot analysis of root RNA from 6-week-old plants grown in nitrogen-sufficient nutrient solution showed that <italic>AtAMT1;4</italic> transcripts were highly expressed in roots of the transgenic lines <italic>H2f</italic>, <italic>H3a</italic>, <italic>H6d</italic> and <italic>H8g</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>A). No hybridization signal was detected in <italic>qko</italic>, confirming that <italic>AtAMT1;4</italic> is not or at least very weakly expressed in roots under these conditions. Furthermore, large amounts of AtAMT1;4 protein were found in the same transgenic lines by protein gel blot analysis of microsomal membrane fractions from roots using a rabbit antibody directed against 15 amino acid residues in the C-terminus of AtAMT1;4. Also no protein signal was detected in <italic>qko</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>B). Two AtAMT1;4-specific bands were observed with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 40 and 80&#x02009;kDa. Although the predicted molecular weight of the AtAMT1;4 protein is approximately 53.7&#x02009;kDa, the 40&#x02009;kDa band is supposed to correspond to the monomer, since lipophilic membrane proteins usually migrate at a lower apparent molecular mass (Sauer and Stadler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">1993</xref>). The 80&#x02009;kDa band probably represents the dimer of AtAMT1;4 or a stable complex with another unknown protein. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Overexpression of AtAMT1;4&#x02009;in a multiple insertion line defective in high-affinity ammonium uptake.

The purity of these membrane fractions was verified by the abundance of the DET3 protein, a subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase; Schumacher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">1999</xref>), and, alternatively, by the abundance of the vacuolar pyrophosphatase (VPPase; Takasu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">1997</xref>), which both were enriched in the lower phase. In contrast, AtAMT1;4 protein accumulated in the upper phase, coinciding with high expression levels of the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase AHA2 (DeWitt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">1996</xref>). This observation strongly indicated a localization of the AtAMT1;4 protein in the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the in planta transport capacity of AtAMT1;4</title><p>To test the functionality of overexpressed AtAMT1;4 protein in roots, <italic>qko</italic> and three transgenic lines (<italic>H2f</italic>, <italic>H3a</italic> and <italic>H8g</italic>) were grown on agar medium supplemented with either ammonium or nitrate as the sole nitrogen source. At 250&#x02009;&#x003bc;M ammonium, <italic>qko</italic> plants grew poorly because of a low ammonium uptake capacity in roots (Yuan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2007a</xref>), while the transgenic lines were able to increase shoot biomass significantly, indicating that AtAMT1;4 is able to mediate ammonium uptake into plant roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>A, B). In contrast, plant growth did not differ between <italic>qko</italic> and transgenic plants with the supply of 250&#x02009;&#x003bc;&#x02009;M nitrate. Besides ammonium, plant AMT1-type transporters have also been shown to permeate the substrate analog methylammonium (MeA) which is toxic to plants (Loqu&#x000e9; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2006</xref>, Yuan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2007a</xref>).

First, AtAMT1;4 complemented growth of an ammonium uptake-defective yeast strain using ammonium as the sole nitrogen source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Secondly, AtAMT1;4 mediated ammonium uptake in roots of transgenic plants overexpressing AtAMT1;4, as assayed by short-term influx studies using <sup>15</sup>N-labeled ammonium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>A; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/pcn186/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link>) or by a long-term growth assay on agar supplemented with ammonium as a sole nitrogen source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>A, B). In addition, these transgenic plants showed a strongly enhanced growth sensitivity to MeA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>C, D), indicating that AtAMT1;4 also permeates this toxic ammonium analog similarly to other members of the AtAMT1 subfamily but unlike AtAMT2 (Gazzarrini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">1999</xref>, Sohlenkamp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2002</xref>, Yuan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2007a</xref>).</p><p>AtAMT1;4-mediated ammonium uptake into roots presumed a localization of the corresponding protein in the plasma membrane. Indeed, a large majority of the AtAMT1;4 protein expressed in transgenic <italic>qko</italic> plants partitioned into a plasma membrane-enriched protein fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>C). Furthermore, using a GFP fusion protein, AtAMT1;4 was shown to be localized to the plasma membrane of pollen grains and pollen tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>A, B). Thus, plasma membrane localization represents a common feature of all members of plant AMT proteins that have been investigated so far (Sohlenkamp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2002</xref>, Ludewig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2003</xref>, Simon-Rosin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2003</xref>, Loqu&#x000e9; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2006</xref>, Yuan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2007a</xref>), supporting their role in ammonium acquisition by plant cells. Interestingly, in addition to the monomer observed in both roots and shoots, the overexpressed AtAMT1;4 protein formed a putative dimer or a stable complex with another unknown protein of similar size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>B, C). A similar feature was also observed in the case of AtAMT1;2, but not for AtAMT1;1 or AtAMT1;3 (Yuan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2007a</xref>). This complex probably represents the functional form in plants, since the endogenous AtAMT1;4 protein in pollen was detected exclusively as a dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>B). However, other members of the AMT/MEP/Rh family have been demonstrated to form trimeric complexes (Khademi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2004</xref>, Zheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2004</xref>, Andrade et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2005</xref>), and homology modeling also suggested a trimeric structure for AtAMT1;1 (Loqu&#x000e9; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2007</xref>). Considering a high degree of structural conservation within the AMT family, the AtAMT1;4 protein might also form a trimer, but the trimeric complex may be sensitive to SDS and hence become undetectable on SDS&#x02013;PAGE.</p><p>Short-term influx studies revealed that AtAMT1;4 mediates ammonium uptake in the high-affinity range but not in the low-affinity range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>A; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/pcn186/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link>). Taking advantage of the genetic background of <italic>qko</italic>, in which high-affinity uptake is reduced by&#x02009;&#x0003e;90%, the kinetic properties of AtAMT1;4 were investigated and a <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value for ammonium of 17&#x02009;&#x003bc; M was determined in nitrogen-sufficient roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>B, C). Although influx analysis was conducted with an overexpressed protein, the measured <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value most probably also reflects the natural substrate affinity in pollen. In comparison, the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values of AtAMT1;1 and AtAMT1;3 were determined to be approximately 50&#x02013;60&#x02009;&#x003bc;&#x02009;M, while that of AtAMT1;2 was&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;230&#x02009;&#x003bc;&#x02009;M in nitrogen-deficient roots (Yuan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2007a</xref>). The residual high-affinity uptake capacity in nitrogen-deficient <italic>qko</italic> roots with a <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of 4.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;&#x02009;M was supposed to reflect the activity of AtAMT1;5. Thus, AtAMT1;4 together with AtAMT1;5 represent those ammonium transporters in Arabidopsis plants which exhibit the highest affinity for ammonium.</p></sec><sec><title>AtAMT1;4 is expressed specifically in pollen</title><p>A major finding of the present study was the localization of AtAMT1;4 exclusively to pollen, which was demonstrated by several independent approaches. First, RNA and protein gel blot analysis showed that the <italic>AtAMT1;4</italic> transcript is only detected in flowers but not in other tissues such as roots, leaves, stems or siliques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>A, B). Secondly, a more detailed expression in floral tissues was obtained using transgenic plants expressing either an <italic>AtAMT1;4-promoter:GFP</italic> or an <italic>AtAMT1;4-promoter:ORF:GFP</italic> construct, and showed the corresponding promoter activity to be localized only to pollen grains and pollen tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This pollen-specific expression was further confirmed by microarray data from the AtGenExpress project, in which <italic>AtAMT1;4</italic> was reported to be specifically expressed in the tissue of stamens (ATGE_36) or mature pollen (ATGE_73), but not in other floral parts, such as sepals, petals, carpels and pedicels, or in any other Arabidopsis tissue (Schmid et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2005</xref>).</p><p>Transcriptome analysis of pollen at four different developmental stages revealed that many membrane transporter genes are developmentally regulated in pollen, most probably reflecting their distinct physiological roles in pollen (Bock et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2006</xref>, Sze et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2006</xref>). The genes expressed in early stages (microspores or bicellular pollen) are most likely to be important for pollen development, while those expressed at later stages (tricellular or mature pollen) seem to be more essential for post-pollination events such as pollen tube growth. By these transcriptome analyses, <italic>AtAMT1;4</italic> was assigned to a group of pollen-specific and pollen-preferential genes whose expression peaked during early stages, but was low or even undetectable during later stages (Bock et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2006</xref>). In our study, <italic>AtAMT1;4</italic> was found to be constitutively expressed throughout these stages, with a high promoter activity from flower stage 10 to 14, corresponding to the period of microspore development to pollen maturity. The promoter activity of <italic>AtAMT1;4</italic> at later developmental stages did not correlate with reported transcript levels, which might be due to a slow turnover of GFP in vivo. Moreover, AtAMT1;4 was also expressed in pollen tubes after their germination in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/pcn186/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S2</ext-link>). In the case of the monosaccharide transporter gene <italic>AtSTP2</italic>, which was clustered in the same group as <italic>AtAMT1;4</italic> in the above-mentioned transcriptome studies, mRNA and protein were not detected by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in mature pollen or pollen tubes, respectively, whereas promoter-dependent &#x003b2;-glucuronidase (GUS) activity was detectable, which might be supported by the high stability of the soluble GUS protein (Truernit et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">1999</xref>). However, our approach with the AtAMT1;4&#x02013;GFP fusion protein confirmed expression in mature pollen and pollen tubes (Fig. 6A, B), which does not agree with the transcriptome-based characterization (Bock et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2006</xref>). It has been shown for several membrane transporters that their mRNA in developing pollen was not translated before hydration and germination of pollen on the stylar tissue (Stadler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">1999</xref>, Schneidereit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2003</xref>, Schneider et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2006</xref>). It is thus recommended to verify the occurrence of the endogenous AtAMT1;4 protein at certain developmental stages in pollen by an immunohistochemical approach using the AtAMT1;4-specific antibody.</p></sec><sec><title>The possible physiological role of AtAMT1;4 in pollen</title><p>Nitrogen presents a major limiting factor not only during vegetative plant growth but also during reproductive plant growth, because transport of nitrogen to the developing flowers has a significant influence on flower set, pollen and embryo development, as well as seed production (Lee and Tegeder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2004</xref>). It has also been shown that the nitrogen status of pollen donor plants affects kernel set and seed yield in maize (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2007</xref>). Nitrogen import into pollen appears essential for protein synthesis not only during the development of pollen grains in the anthers or during pollen germination but in particular during the rapid pollen tube growth in the pistil. Because of the symplasmic isolation of pollen from the surrounding tissue, nitrogen sources present in the fluid of the anther locule and exudates from the stylar canal need to be taken up via transporters across the plasma membrane of the pollen grains and the pollen tubes, respectively. In general, amino acids are supposed to be the major nitrogen form being imported into pollen, which was supported by studies on the amino acid transporters LeProT1 or NsAAP1&#x02009;in pollen grains and pollen tubes (Lalanne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">1997</xref>, Schwacke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">1999</xref>). Moreover, there are even further transporter homologs in Arabidopsis found to be specifically or at least preferentially expressed in pollen, e.g. several <italic>AtLHT</italic> genes and <italic>AtProT1</italic> (Bock et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2006</xref>, Sze et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2006</xref>, Foster et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2008</xref>). Whether ammonium, a major nitrogen form being continuously generated in metabolically active tissue, is present in the apoplasmic fluid around pollen still remains to be shown. However, we show here that ammonium can be taken up by pollen, because pollen germination in vitro was sensitive to the toxic ammonium analog MeA (Fig. 7D). In addition, proteome studies indicated the presence of glutamine synthetase in the pollen tubes of rice and white pine (Fernando et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2005</xref>, Dai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2006</xref>), and pollen-specific gene expression of <italic>AtGLN1;5</italic> (At1g48470) was reported in mature Arabidopsis pollen as well as in growing pollen tubes on the basis of transcriptome data (Honys and Twell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2004</xref>, Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2008</xref>). This suggests that in pollen ammonium can be assimilated into amino acids. The importance of functional ammonium assimilation in pollen has been further supported by antisense <italic>NADH-GOGAT</italic> alfalfa plants, which were found to be male sterile due to inviable pollen (Schoenbeck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2000</xref>). Besides uptake across the plasma membrane, large amounts of cytoplasmic ammonium in pollen may also derive from an internal breakdown of amino acids, particularly in fast growing pollen tubes. Since ammonium efflux across the plasma membrane has been demonstrated in roots and leaves (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">1993</xref>, Husted et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2002</xref>), ammonium leakage from pollen or pollen tubes should be expected. In this case, an ammonium retrieval process might be required for pollen nutrition, which would be mediated by high-affinity ammonium transporters, such as AtAMT1;4. Together with other amino acid transporters, AtAMT1;4 may thus contribute to nitrogen nutrition during pollen development, pollen germination and pollen tube growth.</p><p>To elucidate further the physiological role of AtAMT1;4 in pollen, the insertion line <italic>atamt1;4-6</italic>, in which <italic>AtAMT1;4</italic> gene expression is completely disrupted, was subjected to phenotypic analysis (Fig. 7). However, there was no visible difference between the mutant line and its corresponding wild type in terms of pollen function. One explanation might be a compensation by other AtAMTs, such as by AtAMT1;1, which is also expressed in mature pollen according to microarray data (Honys and Twell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2004</xref>). Additionally, a compensation for the lack of AtAMT1;4 expression might be conferred by amino acid transporters, which may transport organic nitrogen forms into pollen. Considering nitrogen uptake by pollen as an essential prerequisite for pollen function, it is not surprising if this function could be conferred by several independent membrane proteins. For example, expression in pollen of five monosaccharide transporter genes (<italic>AtSTP2</italic>, <italic>4</italic>, <italic>6</italic>, <italic>9</italic> and <italic>11</italic>) indicates that the import of carbon into pollen is of major importance for pollen survival (Truernit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">1999</xref>, Schneidereit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2003</xref>, Scholz-Starke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2003</xref>, Schneidereit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2005</xref>). However, so far, no pollen-specific phenotype has been observed in any single knock-out line of these genes. Therefore, the generation of double or multiple knock-out lines might be required before a pollen-specific role for AtAMT1;4 can be observed, similar to the situation in roots, where AtAMTs display non-overlapping but additive functions in nitrogen nutrition (Yuan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2007a</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>AtAMT1;4 cloning and expression in yeast</title><p>The ORF of <italic>AtAMT1;4</italic> was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Col-0) using the specific primers AMT1;4-<italic>Hin</italic>dIII, CCCAAGCTTATGGCGTCGGCTCTCTCTTG; and AMT1;4-<italic>Xho</italic>I, CCGCTCGAGTCAAACACTACATTGGGAT.
