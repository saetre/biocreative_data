A high-complexity transposon-mutagenized library was used to infect mice intraperitoneally, and the selective disappearance of mutants was monitored after 7, 14, 21, and 28 d postinfection. One hundred and eighteen genes were identified to contribute to serovar Typhimurium infection of the spleens of mice by 28 d postinfection. The negatively selected mutants represent many known aspects of <italic>Salmonella</italic> physiology and pathogenesis, although the majority of the identified genes are of putative or unknown function. Approximately 30&#x00025; of the negatively selected genes correspond to horizontally acquired regions such as those within <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity islands (SPI 1&#x02013;5), prophages (Gifsy-1 and &#x02212;2 and remnant), and the pSLT virulence plasmid. In addition, mutations in genes responsible for outer membrane structure and remodeling, such as LPS- and PhoP-regulated and fimbrial genes, were also selected against. Competitive index experiments demonstrated that the secreted SPI2 effectors SseK2 and SseJ as well as the SPI4 locus are attenuated relative to wild-type bacteria during systemic infection. Interestingly, several SPI1-encoded type III secretion system effectors/translocases are required by serovar Typhimurium to establish and, unexpectedly, to persist systemically, challenging the present description of <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenesis. Moreover, we observed a progressive selection against serovar Typhimurium mutants based upon the duration of the infection, suggesting that different classes of genes may be required at distinct stages of infection. Overall, these data indicate that <italic>Salmonella</italic> long-term systemic infection in the mouse requires a diverse repertoire of virulence factors. This diversity of genes presumably reflects the fact that bacteria sequentially encounter a variety of host environments and that <italic>Salmonella</italic> has evolved to respond to these selective forces in a way that permits both the bacteria and the host to survive.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Bacteria belonging to the genus <italic>Salmonella</italic> are capable of establishing a long-term systemic infection in a variety of hosts, including humans, rodents, fowl, and cattle.

The mechanisms by which <italic>Salmonella</italic> can establish and maintain a persistent infection are complex, since both innate and adaptive immunity must be subverted.

The most extensively studied virulence factors are <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity island (SPI) 1 and 2 (SPI1 and SPI2).

This persistence model closely resembles the carrier state seen in human typhoid fever and provides the opportunity to better study the basic aspects of persistent bacterial infections.</p><p>The contribution of serovar Typhimurium genes has been largely unexplored in the mouse model of persistent infection. The known <italic>Salmonella</italic> persistence proteins are Mig-14, VirK, and AceA.

The goal of the current study was to identify novel genes that allow <italic>Salmonella</italic> to establish and maintain long-term systemic infection.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the SPI1-encoded T3SS and the invasion effectors/translocases SipB, SipC, and SipD, as well as the SPI2 T3SS-secreted effector SseK2 and SPI4, have a previously unappreciated role in long-term systemic disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Microarray-Based Negative Selection Strategy Reproducibly Identifies Genes Required for the Establishment of a Systemic Infection</title><p>In this study, we wished to identify novel genes that are important for establishment and maintenance of a 28-d systemic infection in mice. This infection model, for reasons discussed below, required the mice to be inoculated with approximately 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> bacteria intraperitoneally (IP). In this model, bacterial numbers increase modestly for the first 21 d and remain about the same through 28 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020011-g001">Figure 1</xref>). During this acute phase of infection, the histopathological lesions were frequent in the spleen and liver, and contained large numbers of polymorphonuclear lymphocyte (PMN) cells, monocytes/macrophages, and regions of necrosis (data not shown). Only between 28 and 49 d were the bacterial numbers significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020011-g001">Figure 1</xref>), after which bacterial persistence is established. The liver and spleen tissues from mice infected for 49 d contained typical microgranulomas, which contained PMNs and central regions of necrosis. We used this model of infection to identify novel serovar Typhimurium virulence genes that are required to infect mouse spleens for 28 d. The contribution of these genes to persistence in the reticuloendothelial system beyond 28 d will require additional studies.</p><fig id="ppat-0020011-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Time-Dependent Negative Selection of Serovar Typhimurium Mutants</title><p>SAM two-class analysis was performed grouping various time points in order to identify the features that are most significantly different between time points. The data corresponding to these SGLs were manually assembled and verified to have the expected hybridization patterns, and then duplicate features were removed. The arrays were organized by time point and the features placed in genome order. Colored bars at the top indicate grouping of technical microarray replicates for the same time point, and the same color scheme was employed to delineate groups of features that exhibit the same time-dependent pattern (vertical bars on right of microarray data figure). Also indicated is the average splenic log10 CFU/ml bacterial load observed over the course of infection along with the predicted stages of the host immune response (S. Clare and G.

Each transposon insertion contains a T7 transcriptional promoter. When purified bacterial genomic DNA isolated from a mixed bacterial population containing specific transposon inserts is subjected to an in vitro transcription reaction, RNA is generated corresponding to each transposon insertion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. Of course, a transposon insertion may disrupt transcription of downstream genes, resulting in polar mutations. In any event, mutants initially present in laboratory culture that cannot survive the infection process disappear from the bacterial pool isolated from an infected animal and will no longer have RNA generated from their T7 promoters. In this manner, probes corresponding to each transposon insertion is generated, and by comparing the input library with the output obtained from mice, genes potentially important for the establishment and maintenance of infection can be identified. Specifically, we inoculated the laboratory-grown library into two groups of mice. In the first group (passage 1), 50 mice were injected with 1.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> colony-forming units (CFUs) and at day 7 (ten mice), 14 (ten mice), 21 (ten mice), 28 (eight mice), and 49 (four mice) postinfection mice were sacrificed and bacteria were recovered from their livers and spleens. In the second group (passage 2), ten mice were injected with 7.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> CFU. The seven surviving mice were sacrificed at 29 d postinfection, and bacteria were recovered from their livers and spleens. The spleen outputs for each time point from passage 1 were pooled and processed for microarray analysis whereas both pooled and individual samples from both liver and spleen were processed from passage 2.</p><p>Any screen utilizing a pool of mutants is subject to a number of variables that can dramatically affect its reproducibility &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. The choice of infection route is critical as physical and biological bottlenecks can greatly diminish the complexity of the library in a stochastic manner. For our experiments, we inoculated mice IP because previous studies have shown that the oral route imposes a significant bottleneck in which less than 1&#x00025; of bacteria were able to successfully breach the intestinal barrier and colonize systemic tissues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b030">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Although it is possible that subsequent to an IP inoculation, a bottleneck exists that can affect the number of bacteria that successfully disseminate from the peritoneal cavity, the IP route has been shown to have minimal impact on the reproducibility of a library screen &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. In order to address any concerns regarding the possible impact that the IP route of infection may have on our ability to identify virulence genes, we analyzed the data from the two independent passages utilizing the Statistical Analysis of Microarrays software (SAM) tool &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;, a program that analyzes sets of microarrays in order to identify the genes that differ in the most statistically consistent manner. Application of SAM to a dataset comparing the individual liver and spleen samples from the 29 d second passage revealed that there were no differences between the two tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020011-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Furthermore, when all the arrays were clustered, we observed that the liver and spleen samples did not segregate into distinct nodes and that the liver and spleen samples from the same mouse often shared the same node (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020011-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This indicates that there is not a bottleneck that differentially affects the dissemination from the peritoneal cavity to the spleen compared to the liver. Finally, we have always observed a strong correlation in the bacterial loads in spleens and liver, suggesting that there are not significant differences in bacterial replication between the two tissues. Taken together, these findings indicate that the impact of the IP route of inoculation on the complexity of the library is negligible under our experimental conditions. Furthermore, these data indicate that there are not any specific virulence factors for replication/survival in the liver versus the spleen.</p><fig id="ppat-0020011-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Microarray Dendogram Illustrating the Relationship between the Different Time Points and Passages</title><p>The dendogram was generated from a single dataset which included arrays from both mouse passages.

We assessed the amount of reproducibility between the two biological replicates to determine if the parameters of our experiments were at sufficient levels for the identification of mutants attenuated in the ability to establish or maintain a long-term systemic infection. The top 300 negatively significant features (representing mutants that are absent from the mouse-selected pools) in both passages were identified by performing a SAM analysis comparing the input and spleen pooled arrays from the first passage, and the input and all samples from the second passage. This analysis did not identify any positively significant features. There are a total of 138 overlapping features corresponding to 46&#x00025; of each of the original list of 300. These features represent a total of 118 genes (as there are multiple features for many of the genes on the array) and two intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020011-st001">Table S1</xref>). In addition, although the exact same feature may not have appeared in the overlapping dataset, oftentimes different features corresponding to the same gene or corresponding to the same known or putative transcriptional unit appeared in the compiled list from either passage. The negatively selected genes belonging to the same known or putative transcriptional unit have been highlighted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020011-st001">Table S1</xref>. Such information is valuable because gene products encoded within the same operon generally function in the same biological process.

Obvious examples include the LPS (i.e., <italic>rfb</italic> and <italic>rfa</italic>), fimbrial, and T3SS operons.

Importantly, these results show that the presence of the chloramphenicol resistance cassette had no effect on serovar Typhimurium virulence.</p><p>One of the major findings of this work is the demonstration that SPI1 is important for systemic infection, which challenges the prevailing model that SPI1 only contributes to the gastrointestinal phase of <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Indeed, others have demonstrated in streptomycin-pretreated mice that the role of SPI1 in the localization of serovar Typhimurium to Peyer's patches may not be required to establish systemic disease in mice and that SPI1 may have alternative functions during infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;. Likewise, SPI2 has been proposed to be expressed in the lumen of the intestine and has been implicated in intestinal inflammation, suggesting that the functions of virulence factors during <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenesis may not be as segregated as once believed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d;. The results presented here demonstrate that the SPI1-encoded T3SS and invasion complex, comprised of SipB, C, and D, play an important role in establishing and maintaining the systemic state of infection. We can rule out the SPI1-secreted effectors SipA, SptP, AvrA, and SlrP as being responsible for these functions. However, several SPI1-secreted effectors remain to be tested before we can conclude which virulence proteins are responsible for these functions.</p><p>It has been proposed that SPI1-encoded products are not required for intracellular survival but are required for entry of <italic>Salmonella</italic> into host cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;. Although this would suggest distinct roles for SPI1 and SPI2 during pathogenesis, there is mounting evidence that the contributions of SPI1 and SPI2 to the multiple stages of pathogenesis may not be mutually exclusive. For example, it has been observed that SPI2 mutants have altered SPI1 gene expression and invasion properties &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;, perhaps mutations in SPI1 have similar pleiotrophic effects.

Most recently, it has been shown that some SPI1-secreted effectors, including SptP and SopB, persist within host cells after invasion, suggesting that there is continued secretion of these effectors postinvasion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;. Consistent with these observations, we have observed an enrichment of SPI1 mutants in a negative SGL derived from serial passage of the transposon-mutagenized library in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, there appears to be considerable functional overlap between SPI1 and SPI2 during pathogenesis.</p><p>The precise role(s) of SPI1 during long-term systemic <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection and persistence are not known. Perhaps SPI1 is required to maintain colonization of the Peyer's patches, which results in continual seeding of the systemic sites, such as the MLN, spleen, and liver, during long-term infection. Indeed, we observe that serovar Typhimurium can colonize the Peyer's patches of mice infected by the IP route (unpublished data). Alternatively, the SPI1 deficiency observed during persistent infection is related to <italic>Salmonella</italic>'s inability to reinvade new host cells or to reestablish a replicative state within host cells. Host cell death is a hallmark of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection of the liver and spleen &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d; and may result in bacteria being released into the extracellular environment. In order to maintain its privileged niche, <italic>Salmonella</italic> would need to effectively reinvade or reestablish itself within a host phagocyte. SPI1 also mediates caspase-1&#x02013;dependent macrophage cytotoxicity that results in the release of proinflammatory cytokines that lead to the recruitment of immune cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d;, which may serve as new cells for <italic>Salmonella</italic> to infect. Alternatively, the role of SPI1 may be even more complex, involving modulation of host responses or integration with bacterial signaling pathways from within the host cell. Regardless, the SPI1 deficiency is mirrored in the spleen and MLN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020011-g004">Figure 4</xref>), indicating a role for SPI1 in maintaining <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection of systemic sites.</p><p>It is emerging that the majority of in vivo infected phagocytes contain low bacterial numbers of <italic>Salmonella</italic> (1&#x02013;3/phagocyte) and that most, but not all, bacteria are conclusively intracellular &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.

Although the exact mechanism by which the bacteria spread to new foci is not known, it is possible that <italic>Salmonella</italic> exists for some period of time as an extracellular form, either in the intestine or in systemic tissues, during persistence. SPI1 may play a role in mediating the increase in the number of infection foci. In addition, genes from SPI4 and SPI5, which are down-regulated during replication in macrophages in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020011-b068">68</xref>&#x0005d;, as well as a number of fimbrial genes, appear to contribute to persistence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020011-t002">Table 2</xref>). Taken together, these observations imply that <italic>Salmonella</italic> persistence relies upon both intracellular and extracellular stages to maintain a long-term infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>Salmonella</italic> persistence manifests when a fine balance is achieved between the functions of bacterial virulence factors and host immune clearance mechanisms. One of the more striking observations from the current study is that serovar Typhimurium employs a diverse array of virulence factors to establish and maintain persistence, highlighting the complexity of bacterial persistence. The requirement for numerous virulence factors implies that <italic>Salmonella</italic> utilizes many distinct mechanisms to subvert the immune system. As SPI1 maintains the persistent state of infection, perhaps an equilibrium exists between intracellular and extracellular bacterial forms, and when <italic>Salmonella</italic> SPI1 mutants cannot reestablish an intracellular form, the balance is tipped in the host's favor and <italic>Salmonella</italic> persistence is compromised. This example would represent just one of many balances achieved during <italic>Salmonella</italic> persistence.</p><p>The demonstration that certain classes of genes are required at specific times during infection provides a foundation to further dissect <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenesis into distinct temporal phases. Because the classes of genes likely reflect a variety of immune system insults that bacteria must counteract, further characterization of the temporal phases of persistence and delineation of the in vivo functions of virulence factors will serve as a powerful approach to understanding the basic principles of <italic>Salmonella</italic> persistence.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Bacterial strains.</title><p>All bacteria were grown and maintained at 37 &#x000b0;C with aeration in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or on LB agar plates using the following antibiotic concentrations unless otherwise stated: kanamycin (Km) 40 ug/ml, chloramphenicol (Cm) 10 &#x003bc;g/ml, tetracycline (Tc) 10 &#x003bc;g/ml, and streptomycin (Sm) 200 &#x003bc;g/ml.

Approximately 50,000 colonies were then scraped off of the plates and stored as a single pool in 15&#x00025; glycerol.

When the appropriate Cy3 filter was applied, very few Typhi-specific features made it through to the analysis.

Negative significant genes are genes whose mutants are absent in the tissue samples but present in the input. The two-class analysis that was performed on the data from the first passage included five arrays corresponding to the pooled spleen sample and three input arrays. For the second, 29-d passage, individual spleen and liver samples as well as pooled and input samples were analyzed by SAM (see text for further details). The overlap between the first and second passage was determined. Because there are multiple spots corresponding to many of the Typhimurium genes, overlap between the two biological replicates was assessed on a spot-by-spot basis rather than by genes. The false discovery rate (FDR) is calculated within the SAM analysis program and determines the proportion of each SGL that is identified by chance and therefore falsely discovered. A 1&#x00025; FDR cutoff essentially generates an SGL in which approximately 1&#x00025; of the genes will be falsely called (either false negatives or false positives). Application of the 1&#x00025; FDR generated SGLs for both microarray datasets (both passage 1 and passage 2) that have approximately 300 negative significant genes/features in addition to a few positive significant ones. This is why the top 300 negative significant features in either dataset were analyzed for overlap.
