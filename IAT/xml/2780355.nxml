In all crystal structures of the proteases to date, the NS2B cofactor is located far from the substrate binding site (open conformation) in the absence of inhibitor and lining the substrate binding site (closed conformation) in the presence of an inhibitor.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this work, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of isotope and spin-labeled samples of the West Nile virus protease was used to investigate the occurrence of equilibria between open and closed conformations in solution.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>In solution, the closed form of the West Nile virus protease is the predominant conformation irrespective of the presence or absence of inhibitors. Nonetheless, dissociation of the C-terminal part of the NS2B cofactor from the NS3 protease (open conformation) occurs in both the presence and the absence of inhibitors. Low-molecular-weight inhibitors can shift the conformational exchange equilibria so that over 90&#x00025; of the West Nile virus protease molecules assume the closed conformation. The West Nile virus protease differs from the dengue virus protease, where the open conformation is the predominant form in the absence of inhibitors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Partial dissociation of NS2B from NS3 has implications for the way in which the NS3 protease can be positioned with respect to the host cell membrane when NS2B is membrane associated via N- and C-terminal segments present in the polyprotein. In the case of the West Nile virus protease, discovery of low-molecular-weight inhibitors that act by breaking the association of the NS2B cofactor with the NS3 protease is impeded by the natural affinity of the cofactor to the NS3 protease. The same strategy can be more successful in the case of the dengue virus NS2B-NS3 protease.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Dengue and West Nile virus infections put an estimated 2.5 billion people at risk. Neither drugs nor vaccines are currently available against these diseases. The non-structural protein NS3 is a protease that, together with the cofactor NS2B, is essential for viral maturation. The NS2B-NS3 proteases of dengue and West Nile viruses are highly homologous and present promising drug targets. Crystal structures of the West Nile virus protease with and without bound inhibitor revealed large structural differences in NS2B, while no crystal structure of the dengue virus protease could be determined with a bound inhibitor. We investigated the structural change in solution and found that the C-terminal segment (CTS) of the NS2B cofactor is prone to dissociation from NS3. In the case of the West Nile virus protease, the CTS of NS2B is mostly associated with NS3, especially in the presence of inhibitors. In the case of the dengue virus protease and in the absence of inhibitors, the CTS of NS2B is mostly dissociated from NS3. Finding drug candidates to inhibit the association of the NS2B cofactor may thus be easier for the dengue virus protease.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>West Nile virus (WNV) is a flavivirus related to yellow fever virus, dengue virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus all of which cause human diseases.

The N-terminal part of nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) encodes a serine protease that cleaves the polyprotein into several components. The activity of the NS3 protease (NS3pro) is greatly enhanced by covalent tethering of about 40 residues from the membrane-bound NS2B protein that acts as a co-factor. NS3 is essential for viral replication making it an attractive drug target <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000561-Chappell1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000561-Stoermer1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

The fold of NS2B is very different in the presence of inhibitors from that in the absence of inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000561-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In all structures, the N-terminal segment of NS2B (residues 52&#x02013;58) inserts into a &#x003b2;-sheet formed by NS3pro. In the presence of inhibitor, the C-terminal segment (CTS) of NS2B wraps around NS3pro, bringing the C-terminal &#x003b2;-hairpin of the NS2B cofactor in close proximity of the active site. This fold is referred to in the following as the closed conformation. In the absence of inhibitor, the NS2B CTS is located at a very different position far from the active site of the protease. We refer to this fold and any other conformation, where NS2B is disengaged from the substrate binding site, as open conformations.

As the cleavage site near Lys96<sup>NS2B</sup> lacks the characteristic recognition sequence of two sequentially neighboring basic residues and is also not conserved in the highly homologous dengue virus NS2B-NS3 protease, cleavage at this site may be inefficient, in which case NS2B would remain tethered to the host cell membrane at either end. Independent of whether the NS2B cofactor is tied to the membrane at one or both ends, there is no reason why the association of NS3pro with the NS2B CTS should be any tighter than that observed in the model system studied here, once the covalent linkage between NS2B and NS3 has been broken.</p><p>The association between NS2B and NS3pro appears to be independent of the helicase domain of NS3.

The NS2B CTS could, however, follow the NS3 protease domain if its C-terminal membrane attachment is broken by cleavage at the non-canonical site near Lys96<sup>NS2B</sup>, generating a catalytically active NS3 protease that is anchored to the membrane only at the NS2B N-terminus.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Populations of Different Conformations</title><p>The present work shows that, in solution, the closed conformation (or a closely related conformation) is predominantly populated even in the absence of inhibitors.

In addition, the PREs indicate that the open conformations detected by the spin-labeling experiment are mostly unrelated to those found in the crystal structures of the WNV and dengue NS2B-NS3 proteases. As PREs strongly depend on the distance from the spin label, they enable the detection of minor conformational species which may be populated by as little as 1&#x00025;.</p><p>The exchange broadening observed for many NMR resonances is also in agreement with the closed conformation as the major species. Chemical exchange of a major conformational species with one or several minor species populated by as little as 5&#x00025; can lead to the disappearance of cross-peaks if the exchange rate is comparable to the difference in chemical shifts of the conformational states. The appearance of all cross-peaks in the presence of inhibitors can thus be explained, if the inhibitor shifts the conformational equilibrium towards a single conformation (populated by at least 90&#x00025;).
