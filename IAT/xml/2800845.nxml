Several intracellular pathogens can cross this barrier and succeed the vertical transmission. These include some bacteria such as <italic>Brucella abortus</italic>, <italic>Chlamydophila psittaci</italic>, <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic>, and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], viruses such as cytomegalovirus and parvovirus B19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and parasites such as <italic>Toxoplasma gondii </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, the precise molecular mechanisms of the vertical transmission of these pathogens are still unclear.</p><p>Brucellosis is a widespread and economically important infectious disease of humans and animals caused by members of the genus <italic>Brucella</italic>. <italic>Brucella </italic>spp. are small, gram-negative, facultative intracellular pathogens that cause abortion, and are retained in the placenta and causing infertility in numerous domestic and wild mammals. In humans they cause undulant fever [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Infection in humans is almost exclusively due to zoonosis, either through direct contact with infected animals or from contaminated dairy products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>is a gram-positive bacterium found widely in nature. As a facultative intracellular food-borne pathogen, it is responsible for both severe central nervous system and fetal infections in humans and in a large variety of animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Although human listeriosis occurs anytime during pregnancy, it is frequently detected during the third trimester, resulting in intrauterine fetal death, abortion, preterm birth, or neonatal infection with a severe septic syndrome known as granulomatosis infantiseptica.</p><p>The infectious abortion model using pregnant mice is a powerful tool for investigating the mechanisms of pathogen infection. In our previous study, we demonstrated that <italic>B. abortus </italic>causes abortion in pregnant mice by inoculating bacteria on day 4.5 of gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We found that there was a higher degree of bacterial colonization in the placenta than in other organs, that there were many bacteria in trophoblast giant (TG) cells in the placenta and that an intracellular replication-defective mutant did not induce abortion. These findings suggest that bacterial infection of TG cells plays a key role in abortion induced by <italic>B. abortus </italic>infection. Also, several studies have reported on an experimental model of listeriosis using pregnant mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Trophoblastic cells are the early targets of <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>and bacteria then disseminate rapidly to the other trophoblastic structures, such as the syncytiotrophoblast cells lining the villous core in the labyrinthine zone of the placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Despite some aspects unique to rodents, notably blood circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], the mouse placenta is comparable to that of humans in that both are hemochorial placentas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It is known that fetal-embryonic trophoblast cells play a central role in the development and physiology of the placenta, including the establishment of local immunotolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This structure also has an area of high phagocytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In mice and other rodents, TG cells are the placental cells in direct contact with endometrial tissues throughout gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. After the onset of implantation, the phagocytosis of maternal components develops in TG cells. It has been reported that this phagocytic activity participates in fetal nutrition prior to the complete formation of the placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The phagocytic activity also plays a role in acquiring space for embryo attachment and development in the endometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Since it is thought that there are receptors against pathogens on TG cells, we attempted to identify the receptors and isolated a monoclonal antibody that inhibits bacterial uptake by TG cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The monoclonal antibody R2-25 reacted to heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70). In the present study, we investigated the epitope of monoclonal antibody R2-25 on Hsc70 and showed that the binding of proteins containing tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains to the C-terminal of Hsc70 through its EEVD motif inhibited bacterial uptake by TG cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains</title><p><italic>Brucella abortus </italic>544 strain and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes </italic>EGD strain were used in this study.

TG cells are polyploid cells that play a crucial role in implantation, remodeling of the embryonic cavity, and preventing maternal blood flow to the implantation site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, the phagocytic activity of TG cells participates in fetal nutrition prior to complete formation of the placenta and plays a role in embryo attachment and development in the endometrium. TG cells are also able to phagocytize microorganisms, supporting the hypothesis that a possible trophoblast defense mechanism contributes to the removal of infectious agents from the fetal-maternal interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The uptake activity of bacteria by TG cells was inhibited by adding TPR-Ba or TPR-Lms. These results suggest that the phagocytosis of TG cells using surface-presented Hsc70 could form an embryonic and fetal innate immune defense through elimination of the microorganisms present at the maternal-fetal interface. Hsc70 has been reported to be present on the surface of several types of cells, and can bind fatty acids and bacterial LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We recently reported that ezrin, a member of the family of ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins, associated with Hsc70, and that Hsc70 may be able to present on membranes by interacting with ezrin in TG cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. It has also been suggested that extracellular Hsp70 and Hsc70 possess immunological properties and they are commonly perceived as being inflammatory mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thus, surface-presented Hsc70 on TG cells would recognize bacterial molecules such as LPS or components of the bacterial cell wall and phagocytize microorganisms lysing the cells. Since the amino acid sequences of human and mouse Hsc70 are identical, the function of their Hsc70 is assumed to be the same. Rodent TG cells are analogous to extravillous cytotrophoblast cells of the human placenta, both are polyploid and invasive, and have similar patterns of trophoblast cell subtype-specific gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>The TPR domain is a protein-protein interaction motif that was originally identified through sequence comparisons among yeast proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. A number of TPR containing proteins participate in interactions with major members of the heat shock protein family, <italic>i.e</italic>., Hsp70, Hsc70, and Hsp90, and are necessary for the appropriate regulation of protein folding and transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Further, one of the TPR containing proteins, the carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP), negatively regulates chaperone activities of Hsc70 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Hsc70 binds to bacterial molecules in the uptake of extracellular pathogens, and the binding of TPR-Ba and TPR-Lms to the C-terminal of Hsc70 would also negatively regulate this bacterial uptake function of Hsc70 on TG cells. The anti-Hsc70 monoclonal antibody that inhibited bacterial uptake by TG cells mimics the interaction between TPR containing proteins and the C-terminal of Hsc70. We have previously made TPR-Ba deletion mutant in <italic>B. abortus </italic>and investigated the virulence of the mutant. Although we expected that deletion mutant failed to invade into TG cells, and exhibited weak virulence in mouse, the results were contrary (data not shown). The mutant showed hypervirulence because of loss of TPR proteins as a negative regulator. However, it also remains possible that deletion of TPR-Ba may change the property of some molecules and affect virulence indirectly.</p><p>In previous studies, we showed that <italic>B. abortus </italic>replicated preferentially in TG cells in the placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Trophoblastic cells are the early targets of <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Since abortion-inducing bacteria such as <italic>B. abortus </italic>and <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>infect TG cells and replicate in them, the cell functions are suppressed to some extent, which leads to abortion since implantation and placental development are inhibited. Therefore, it is thought that bacterial infection of TG cells is a key event in inducing abortion. In our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], abortion by <italic>B. abortus </italic>infection was inhibited in pregnant mice that were inoculated with the R2-25 antibody 24 h before bacterial infection. This suggests that infectious abortion could be prevented by blocking bacterial uptake by TG cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results in this study show that the bacterial uptake function of Hsc70 is inhibited by binding between proteins containing TPR domains, TPR-Ba and TPR-Lms, and the C-terminal of Hsc70 through the EEVD motif. We could not find any typical transmembrane domains, secretion signals, or lipid anchor sequence in TPR-Ba and TPR-Lms. However unknown transmembrane sequence or unconventional secretion systems independent on signal sequence would contribute to distribution of the TPR proteins on bacterial surface or extracellular fractions. Alternatively, it is possible that TPR proteins might be released from damaged or destroyed bacteria and they interact with Hsc70 on cell surface. Although the function of TPR-Ba and TPR-Lms in bacterial physiology is still unknown, these molecules could be useful in the development of methods for preventing infectious abortion.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MW conceived the study.
