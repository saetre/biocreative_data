Master regulators, such as homeotic proteins, code for transcription factors in both plants and animals and are thought to act by regulating other genes. Recent genomic studies in the plant Arabidopsis have shown that over 1,000 genes are regulated by homeotic proteins that directly control various target genes, including different classes of transcriptional regulators. It is not known, however, how expression of so many genes is coordinated by a single homeotic gene to form functional organs and tissues. Here we identified a transcriptional target of the plant homeotic protein AGAMOUS using bioinformatics analysis and showed that AGAMOUS directly controls GIANT KILLER, a multifunctional chromatin modifier. GIANT KILLER then binds to the upstream regions of multiple genes involved in patterning and differentiation in the AGAMOUS pathway and fine-tunes the expression of these genes. These data therefore provide a possible mechanism by which a homeotic gene coordinates multiple downstream targets in plants.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>During flower development, many key processes depend on tissue-specific regulation of gene expression achieved by the coordinated interplay of transcription factors.

We also showed that <italic>ETT</italic> silencing was associated with repressive histone dimethylation of H3K9 in the <italic>ETT</italic> promoter, especially at the distal putative MAR. It remains unclear whether GIK is directly involved in this histone modification. Because GIK lacks known domains typically found in chromatin-modifying enzymes, GIK may introduce structural changes to the genomic region through MAR binding and may thereby facilitate the binding of chromatin-modifying enzymes to carry out histone modifications. It is also possible that GIK serves as a center for organizing chromatin remodeling complexes in the nuclear matrix to regulate target gene expression. Alternatively, MAR binding by GIK may inhibit the binding of the transcriptional machinery to the proximal promoter, leading to gene silencing associated with dimethylated H3K9. However, our time-course analysis showed that the dynamic changes in H3K9 dimethylation levels appeared to precede negative regulation of <italic>ETT</italic> transcription, which does not support the later hypothesis. Dimethylation of H3K9 increased rapidly during the 2 h after GIK induction. A further increase in dimethylation at the 4 h time point corresponded with the steepest downregulation of <italic>ETT</italic> transcription at the 8 h time point. Conversely, a dynamic reduction of H3K9 dimethylation to a level lower than that seen prior to induction at the 8 h time point was followed by a steady recovery of <italic>ETT</italic> transcription at the later time points of 16 h and 24 h. Nevertheless, how this dynamic methylation pattern is achieved remains unknown. The mammalian AT-hook protein SATB1 has been shown to mediate gene repression by directly recruiting histone deacetylases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000251-Yasui1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. Further studies of proteins that interact with GIK may provide a more detailed account of the mechanism of GIK-mediated repression.</p><p><italic>ETT</italic> has recently been shown to be regulated by trans-acting short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000251-Fahlgren1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000251-Hunter1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, <italic>ETT</italic> expression may be refined by two different molecules, GIK and siRNA, to establish strict spatiotemporal expression boundaries. These events may also partially explain the modest effects of the <italic>GIK</italic> loss-of-function mutant and of deletion of putative MAR regions in the <italic>ETT</italic>-promoter reporter construct in the wild-type context.

SATB1 in mice contains an AT-hook DNA binding motif and acts as a &#x0201c;gene organizer&#x0201d; to regulate temporal and spatial expression of multiple genes during thymocyte maturation and breast tumor growth and metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000251-Alvarez2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000251-Han1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Another SATB1-related MAR-binding protein, SATB2, represses the expression of several <italic>Hox</italic> genes during skeletal development and osteoblast differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000251-Dobreva1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. In agreement with these studies, we show that GIK exhibits similar properties in its regulation of target genes. First, these proteins share the role of a matrix binding protein with an AT-hook DNA binding motif and regulate expression of multiple genes. Second, they are important regulators of various developmental processes: SATB1 in T-cell development, SATB2 in craniofacial patterning and osteoblast differentiation, and GIK in floral reproductive development. Third, most of these proteins execute their effects by modifying chromatin (SATB1 recruits histone deacetylase, whereas negative regulation by GIK is associated with H3K9 methylation). Thus, convergent evolution may have permitted proteins with the same motif to be used for transcriptional coordination in the two kingdoms. Plants and animals are considered to have independently evolved their multicellular developmental processes, but organ or segment identity control in plants and animals starts with transcription factors: <italic>HOX</italic> genes in animals and <italic>MADS</italic> genes in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000251-Meyerowitz1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. Proteins with AT-hook motifs are predominantly present in eukaryotes. The motif is found in some families of HMG proteins that bind to the minor groove of DNA, and the proteins may serve as an anchor for chromatin modifying proteins or may change chromatin architecture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000251-Reeves1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000251-Reeves2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000251-Yasui1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. Such properties may explain why AT-hook proteins have been used in the evolution of both plant and animal development. In mice, SATB2 controls the expression of the homeotic protein Hoxa2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000251-Dobreva1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, the homeotic protein AG controls the expression of GIK in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.
