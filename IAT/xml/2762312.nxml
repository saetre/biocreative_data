Lamins contain three domains: an N-terminal head, a central rod and a C-terminal tail domain possessing an Ig-fold structural motif. Lamins are classified as either A- or B-type based on structure and expression pattern. The Drosophila genome possesses two genes encoding lamins, <italic>Lamin C</italic> and <italic>lamin Dm<sub>0</sub></italic>, which have been designated A- and B-type, respectively, based on their expression profile and structural features. In humans, mutations in the gene encoding A-type lamins are associated with a spectrum of predominantly tissue-specific diseases known as laminopathies. Linking the disease phenotypes to cellular functions of lamins has been a major challenge. Drosophila is being used as a model system to identify the roles of lamins in development. Towards this end, we performed a comparative study of Drosophila and human A-type lamins. Analysis of transgenic flies showed that human lamins localize predictably within the Drosophila nucleus. Consistent with this finding, yeast two-hybrid data demonstrated conservation of partner-protein interactions. Drosophila lacking A-type lamin show nuclear envelope defects similar to those observed with human laminopathies. Expression of mutant forms of the A-type Drosophila lamin modeled after human disease-causing amino acid substitutions revealed an essential role for the N-terminal head and the Ig-fold in larval muscle tissue. This tissue-restricted sensitivity suggests a conserved role for lamins in muscle biology. In conclusion, we show that (1) localization of A-type lamins and protein-partner interactions are conserved between Drosophila and humans, (2) loss of the Drosophila A-type lamin causes nuclear defects and (3) muscle tissue is sensitive to the expression of mutant forms of A-type lamin modeled after those causing disease in humans. These studies provide new insights on the role of lamins in nuclear biology and support Drosophila as a model for studies of human laminopathies involving muscle dysfunction.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lamins are type V intermediate filament proteins that line the inner surface of the nuclear envelope of animal cells, providing structural support and making contacts with chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Herrmann1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Mattout1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Humans possess two types of lamins, A- and B-types, which differ in developmental expression patterns and structural properties. Human A-type lamins include Lamin A and Lamin C, alternatively spliced products from the <italic>LMNA</italic> gene. Human B-type lamins include lamin B1 and Lamin B2, encoded by two separate genes. With the exception of Lamin C, human lamins possess a CaaX box (C, cysteine; a, aliphatic amino acid; X, any amino acid) that becomes prenylated and provides a nuclear envelope anchor. For Lamin A, the prenylated C-terminus is removed by processing by the conserved metalloprotease FACE1 (mouse Zmpste24) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Misteli1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, processed A-type lamins lack a membrane anchor that is possessed by B-type lamins.</p><p>A- and B-type lamins exhibit contrasting developmental expression profiles. B-type lamins are ubiquitously expressed throughout development. In many organisms, expression of A-type lamins does not appear until midway through embryogenesis, suggesting a role in differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Foster1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Rober1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Another distinction between A- and B-type lamins has been observed by RNAi knock-down in cultured cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Harborth1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Depletion of both B-type lamins leads to cell death. In contrast, knock-down of A-type lamins has no effect on cell viability (Harborth et al 2001). Taken together, these data suggest that B-type lamins play an essential role, while A-type lamins have specialized functions in differentiated tissues.</p><p>Lamins possess a conserved structural organization consisting of a small N-terminal head domain, a long central alpha-helical rod domain, and a large C-terminal tail containing an immunoglobulin (Ig)-fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Krimm1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

The LEM domain is an approximately 40 amino acid sequence motif that interacts with the small double stranded DNA binding protein Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor (BAF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Cai1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Laguri1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-SeguraTotten1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Proper localization of the LEM domain protein emerin is dependent on A-type lamins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Sullivan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Mutations in several genes encoding nuclear envelope proteins cause diseases known as laminopathies, many of which are tissue-specific. Paradoxically, these genes are nearly ubiquitously expressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Hutchison1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Many of these diseases arise due to mutations in <italic>LMNA</italic>, such as autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (AD-EDMD) and familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), which predominantly affect muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Jacob1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. This observation led to the hypothesis that mutations in the lamina weaken nuclear structure, which may manifest as a dystrophic phenotype in tissues subject to mechanical stress, such as skeletal or cardiac muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Worman1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to physical weakening, force-related changes in gene expression have also been observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Nikolova1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. However, susceptibility to mechanical stress cannot explain laminopathies that do not affect muscle, such as those that cause familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD), the neuropathy Charcot Marie-tooth syndrome type 2B (CMT) and the premature aging disorder Hutchinson Gilford-Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Jacob1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. With the exception of HGPS, many of these laminopathies are tissue-specific, an observation that supports the hypothesis that lamins regulate tissue-specific gene expression programs, presumably by organizing chromatin and/or interacting with transcriptional regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Worman1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>All vertebrates characterized to date possess A- and B-type lamins. Evolutionary analyses indicate that with the exception of Drosophila, invertebrates generally possess a single B-type lamin possessing a CaaX box <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Erber1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Melcer1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genome encodes two lamin genes. <italic>Lamin Dm<sub>0</sub></italic> encodes a protein classified as a B-type lamin based on possession of a CaaX box and ubiquitous expression throughout development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Riemer1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Lamin C</italic> encodes a protein classified as an A-type lamin based on the lack of a CaaX box and developmentally regulated expression that first appears late in embryogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Riemer1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. From an evolutionary perspective, A-type lamins are thought to have arisen independently twice during evolution, once in the arthropod and once in the vertebrate lineages. This hypothesis suggests that Drosophila <italic>Lamin C</italic> is most closely related to Drosophila <italic>lamin Dm<sub>0</sub></italic>, which is presumably derived from an ancestral B-type lamin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-MunozAlarcon1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. However the similarities between both Drosophila <italic>Lamin C</italic> and human <italic>LMNA</italic> are striking. The Drosophila <italic>Lamin C</italic> gene possesses shared intron/exon positions with vertebrate <italic>LMNA</italic>, whereas Drosophila <italic>lamin Dm<sub>0</sub></italic> possesses totally unique intron positions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Erber1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Drosophila is the only known example of an invertebrate metazoan that evolved a requirement for two lamin types. Based on expression, lamin Dm<sub>0</sub> appears to have a more general role whereas Lamin C possesses tissue-specific roles during differentiation. The fact that Lamin C lacks a CaaX box and localizes to the nuclear interior, in addition to the periphery, suggests the possibility of broader roles in nuclear processes.</p><p>The function of Drosophila lamins has been assessed through the analysis of mutant alleles. Homozygotes for loss of function alleles of lamin Dm<sub>0</sub> exhibit a late pupal lethal phase, with a fraction of the progeny surviving to adulthood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Osouda1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. The pupal lethal phase is likely due to the fact that lamin Dm<sub>o</sub> is maternally supplied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Riemer1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. &#x0201c;Escaper&#x0201d; adults display sterility, shortened lifespan, and locomotion defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-LenzBohme1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. At the cellular level, <italic>lamin Dm<sub>0</sub></italic> mutants display clustering of nuclear pores, fragmented nuclear envelopes and annulate lamellae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-MunozAlarcon1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-LenzBohme1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

It is not known whether physical abnormalities of the nuclear envelope cause these phenotypes or whether the defects are due to indirect effects of altered tissue-specific gene expression. A role for lamins in chromosome organization and gene regulation is suggested by DamID experiments in which a <italic>Dam</italic> methyltransferase-lamin Dm<sub>0</sub> fusion protein associated with clusters of repressed genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Pickersgill1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Less is known about the phenotype of flies lacking <italic>Lamin C</italic>.

Drosophila is a genetically tractable, well-characterized model that possesses A- and B-type lamins that have approximately 30&#x00025; amino acid sequence identity with human lamins. In addition, other components of the nuclear envelope such as LEM domain proteins and BAF are conserved between humans and Drosophila <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Furukawa1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Pinto1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Wagner1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Wagner2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. We examine the evolutionary conservation of human and Drosophila nuclear envelope proteins by expressing human lamins and the LEM domain protein emerin in Drosophila. The mammalian proteins show predictable patterns of localization suggesting shared assembly mechanisms. Supporting this observation, yeast two-hybrid analyses confirmed that human and Drosophila nuclear envelope proteins possess conserved partner interactions. We exploit similarities between arthropod and mammalian lamins to investigate the role of A-type lamins in development. Loss of Drosophila Lamin C causes defects in nuclear structure and lethality at the larval to pre-pupal stage. To model laminopathies, transgenic flies were generated that express mutant forms of Lamin C analogous to those causing disease in humans. Expression of mutant forms of Lamin C in larval muscle, but not other tissues, caused lethality. The requirement for Drosophila A-type lamin in muscle suggests conserved functions in muscle biology.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Conserved interactions between Drosophila and human nuclear envelope proteins</title><p>Towards the development of an invertebrate model for laminopathies, we investigated the conserved relationship between Drosophila and human nuclear envelope proteins. Transgenic flies were generated that possess a single copy transgene encoding a human nuclear envelope protein under control of a heat shock promoter (<italic>hsp70</italic>). Multiple transgenic stocks expressing each human nuclear envelope protein were tested to rule out effects due to the site of transgene insertion. Daily heat shock treatment resulted in stable production of the human proteins and viable adults. Cytological studies were performed on salivary gland nuclei to compare the localization of the human proteins to their Drosophila counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007564-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Human Lamin A exhibited strict localization to the nuclear periphery in both polytene and diploid cells of transgenic third instar larvae. In contrast, Lamin C showed both peripheral and internal localization, similar to endogenous Drosophila Lamin C, suggesting that internal localization results from the absence of a CaaX box. While Lamin B2 localized to the periphery, small nuclear aggregates were also observed. &#x0005b;Human Lamin B1 transgenics were not analyzed by cytology due to the fact that we were unable to identify an antibody that specifically recognized Lamin B1 following expression in Drosophila.&#x0005d;</p><fig id="pone-0007564-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007564.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Localization of human nuclear envelope proteins in Drosophila.</title><p>Polytene nuclei from salivary glands (top row z-series; middle row section) and diploid cells from imaginal discs (bottom row) were obtained from transgenic stocks and stained with antibodies specific for the human nuclear envelope proteins.

Heat shock induced expression of emerin resulted in localization to the nuclear periphery without visible phenotypes or lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007564-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Thus, the mechanisms for localizing this LEM domain-containing protein appeared to be conserved. These data suggest that transgenic Drosophila might be useful as an <italic>in vivo</italic> model to analyze the function of mutant forms of emerin and examining the function of emerin in different mutant backgrounds.</p><p>The human nuclear envelope proteins were also expressed using the Gal4-UAS system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Duffy1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. This system involves crossing Gal4 &#x0201c;driver stocks&#x0201d; that express the Gal4 transcription factor in specific patterns to &#x0201c;responder stocks&#x0201d; possessing a transgene driven by a UAS element. The UAS element is bound by Gal4, which results in activation of transgene expression. Resulting progeny are assayed for effects of expression of the responder gene in specific patterns. UAS responder transgenes were constructed from Lamin A, C, B1, B2 and emerin, and crossed to a variety of ubiquitous and tissue-specific drivers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007564.s001">Table S1</xref>). Using this system, the human proteins showed nuclear localization patterns consistent with that obtained following heat shock induction. In contrast to the viability observed with the heat shock driven expression, ubiquitous and muscle-specific drivers caused lethality, primarily when used to express human B-type lamin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007564.s001">Table S1</xref>). Differences in the outcome between the heat shock and the Gal4-driven expression is likely due to the higher levels of protein produced by Gal4 as observed by western analysis (data not shown).</p><p>The fact that the human proteins exhibited peripheral localization within the Drosophila nucleus suggests conservation of mechanisms of localization. Based on this observation, we predicted that the human and Drosophila lamins would have conserved interaction partners. To test this, yeast two-hybrid analyses were performed. Human Lamin A and C and Lamin B2 each showed interaction with Drosophila Lamin C and Lamin Dm<sub>0</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007564-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), suggesting that the nuclear envelope association could occur through interactions of lamins from the two species. The association between BAF and the LEM domain proteins is also conserved between species, as Drosophila BAF interacts with emerin and Bocksbeutel, a LEM domain protein expressed as two isoforms, one lacking the transmembrane domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Wagner2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007564-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).

Since our studies indicated both conserved and possible species-specific functions for human and Drosophila lamins, we opted to model the human mutations in the Drosophila lamin proteins. Seventy of the Lamin A/C amino acid residues altered in disease human disease are conserved in Drosophila Lamin C. Therefore, we modeled the human disease-causing mutations in Lamin C by making the corresponding amino acid substitutions in the Drosophila proteins. We modeled amino acid substitutions within the rod and C-terminal tail that give rise to AD-EDMD (R386K, R453W, W520S and L530P, human numbering). In addition, we generated an amino acid substitution within the rod domain that causes DCM (N195K, human numbering) and two truncations that remove either the N-terminal head or the C-terminal globular domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007564-g006">Fig. 6</xref>).

Lethality was also observed for the N-terminal truncation and W557S with the muscle-specific drivers Mef2 and how<sup>24B</sup>, suggesting that the lethality associated with ubiquitous expression was likely due to expression in muscle. In contrast, no lethality or visible phenotypes were observed using elav or ey drivers that are expressed in the nervous system and eye, respectively. Lethality could not be attributed to differences in protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007564-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). For example, expression of W557S by the Act5C driver caused lethality, yet Lamin C protein levels were nearly equal to that of endogenous Lamin C and to that produced by the ey driver, which allowed for viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007564-g007">Fig. 7</xref>).

Given the structural similarities between A-type lamins in humans and flies, and the fact that, like humans, Drosophila is the only invertebrate known to possess two lamin types it was of interest to determine whether human lamins would properly localize in an insect nucleus. Expression of the human proteins Lamin A, Lamin C, Lamin B2 and emerin in transgenic Drosophila exhibited a pattern of localization similar to that observed in humans. In addition, yeast-two hybrid data showed that many of the interactions between lamins and nuclear envelope associated proteins are conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007564-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>One difference between the human and Drosophila A-type lamins involves protein processing. Human Lamin C is produced without a CaaX box due to alternative splicing, and is therefore never prenylated for membrane anchorage. Human lamin A is initially produced with a CaaX box (designated pre-lamin A) that is modified and subsequently cleaved to produce mature lamin A lacking a CaaX box <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Misteli1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, Drosophila Lamin C lacks a CaaX box, while Drosophila lamin Dm<sub>0</sub> possesses a CaaX box. Due to conservation of prenylated consensus sequences, it is likely that the human lamin A is prenylated in Drosophila, however, the occurrence of downstream cleavage events is not yet known. The localization of human Lamin A in Drosophila most closely resembles that of Drosophila lamin Dm<sub>0</sub>, suggesting that while the CaaX is processed for anchorage, it is not subsequently cleaved as it appears to be in human cells. The localization of human Lamin C, lacking a CaaX box, displays internal nuclear localization, which is similar to that observed for Drosophila Lamin C. Lamin B2 shows somewhat aberrant localization, suggesting difficulties in assembly, which nevertheless, under controlled heat shock treatment did not affect viability. It is interesting to note, however, that human B-type lamins, when over-expressed by ubiquitous or muscle-specific Gal4 drivers, cause lethality, whereas over-expression of A-type lamins and emerin using the same drivers has no effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007564.s001">Table S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Loss of Lamin C causes nuclear defects</title><p>Several analyses have been performed on Drosophila <italic>lamin Dm<sub>0</sub></italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-LenzBohme1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

The phalloidin staining fibers observed in Lamin C null larval muscle nuclei are consistent with the presence of filamentous actin in the nucleus.

Specific amino acid substitutions were selected due to their location within a given domain of the protein and their connection with human disease. Expression of Drosophila Lamin C possessing amino acid substitutions within the rod domain caused lamin aggregation. This aggregation is strikingly similar to that observed upon expression of human A-type lamin rod domain mutants in mammalian cell culture and is consistent with earlier findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Schulze1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Ostlund1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite the presence of Drosophila Lamin C aggregates, flies expressing rod domain amino acid substitutions were viable (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007564-t001">Table 1</xref>) and showed no visible adult phenotypes. In contrast, lethality was observed upon expression of the N-terminal truncation and W557S amino acid substitution within the C-terminal globular domain. The fact that these forms cause lethality in the background of wild type endogenous Lamin C suggests they are functioning in a dominant negative manner.

Lethality is observed with W557S, but not the C-terminal truncation, suggesting lethality is not due to loss of domain function. The fact that expression of W557S causes lethality when expressed in muscle, but not in non-muscle tissues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007564-t001">Table 1</xref>), implies a role for this residue in muscle development, possibly by generating a structure needed for muscle-specific protein interaction.

Here, we focused on Lamin C and discovered many commonalities between the fly and human A-type lamins. The loss of A-type lamins in both species gives rise to nuclear envelope fragility. Expression of mutant forms in both humans and flies give rise to similar nuclear abnormalities and muscle defects. We also find differences between the two species. For example, alterations in A-type lamins in humans correlates with changes in heterochromatin organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007564-Worman2">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas, Drosophila nuclei lacking Lamin C showed no obvious changes in heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007564-g004">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007564-g005">5</xref>). Amino acid substitutions in the rod domain cause muscle defects in humans, whereas, flies expression theses amino acid substitutions appear normal. Whether such differences can be attributed to species-specific functions remains to be discerned. Certainly, for physiological aspects of EDMD, Drosophila presents as a promising model.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Genetic Analyses and transgenic stocks</title><p>Drosophila stocks were raised on standard sucrose/cornmeal medium.
