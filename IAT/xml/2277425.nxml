However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the reduction of steroid production have not been described. Adiponectin is an adipocytokine that has insulin-sensitizing actions including stimulation of glucose uptake in muscle and suppression of glucose production in liver. Adiponectin acts via two receptor isoforms &#x02013; AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 &#x02013; that are regulated by hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia in liver and muscle. We have recently identified AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in rat ovary. However, their regulation in ovaries of diabetic female rat remains to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We incubated rat primary granulosa cells in vitro with high concentrations of glucose (5 or 10 g/l) + or - FSH (10-8 M) or IGF-1 (10-8 M), and we studied the ovaries of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (STZ) in vivo. The levels of oestradiol and progesterone in culture medium and serum were measured by RIA. We used immunoblotting to assay key steroidogenesis factors (3beta HSD, p450scc, p450 aromatase, StAR), and adiponectin receptors and various elements of signalling pathways (MAPK ERK1/2 and AMPK) in vivo and in vitro. We also determined cell proliferation by [3H] thymidine incorporation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Glucose (5 or 10 g/l) impaired the in vitro production in rat granulosa cells of both progesterone and oestradiol in the basal state and in response to FSH and IGF-1 without affecting cell proliferation and viability. This was associated with substantial reductions in the amounts of 3beta HSD, p450scc, p450 aromatase and StAR proteins and MAPK ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In contrast, glucose did not affect the abundance of AdipoR1 or AdipoR2 proteins. In vivo, as expected, STZ treatment of rats caused hyperglycaemia and insulin, adiponectin and resistin deficiencies. Plasma progesterone and oestradiol levels were also reduced in STZ rats. However, the amounts of 3beta HSD and p450 aromatase were the same in STZ rat ovary and controls, and the amounts of StAR and p450scc were higher. Streptozotocin treatment did not affect adiponectin receptors in rat ovary but it increased AMPK phosphorylation without affecting MAPK ERK1/2 phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>High levels of glucose decrease progesterone and oestradiol production in primary rat granulosa cells and in STZ-treated rats. However, the mechanism that leads to reduced ovarian steroid production seems to be different. Furthermore, adiponectin receptors in ovarian cells are not regulated by glucose.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Diabetes is associated with increased risk of various diseases including cardiovascular disorders, and is also linked to reproductive problems such as impaired folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis, anovulation, and spontaneous abortions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Although several studies have shown altered ovarian function in association with diabetes, the molecular alterations in ovarian steroid metabolism that could explain these reproductive dysfunctions remain to be elucidated. Cholesterol metabolism is profoundly altered in the diabetic condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and cholesterol is the essential precursor molecule in the synthesis of steroid hormones. Follicular development and ovulation are dependent on proliferative and differentiation changes in granulosa cells (GCs) and thecal cells, which undergo steroidogenesis upon stimulation with gonadotropins and intraovarian cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. For example, FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) and IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor-1) stimulate the expression of steroidogenic enzymes including the cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome p450 (p450scc), 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3&#x003b2;HSD), cytochrome p450 aromatase (p450 aromatase) and the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), which is a protein that participates in the transport of cholesterol from the mitochondrial outer membrane to the inner membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The MAPK ERK1/2 signalling pathway has been reported to be involved in the regulation of steroidogenesis in granulosa cells. Indeed, some studies suggest that activation of MAPK ERK1/2 is required for promoting steroidogenesis and steroidogenic gene expression in granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, we have recently shown that the activation of AMPK, a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, reduces progesterone secretion through inhibition of the MAPK ERK1/2 signalling pathway in rat and bovine granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, it remains to be determined whether diabetes is associated with abnormalities in the abundance of ovarian p450scc, 3&#x003b2;HSD, StAR, p450 aromatase or in MAPK ERK1/2 and AMPK phosphorylations.</p><p>Alterations of glucose concentrations can profoundly affect some reproductive process. For example, glucose is required for hormone-induced maturation, but under the appropriate culture conditions, elevated levels of glucose can suppress maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, these effects can be reversed by insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Adiponectin is an adipokine that has insulin sensitizing actions including stimulation of glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and suppression of glucose production in liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Hence, adiponectin has attracted great interest as an antidiabetic agent. Adiponectin acts via two receptor isoforms, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, which have different tissue distributions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Expression of AdipoR isoforms can be regulated by hyperinsulinaemia and hyperglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Adiponectin is a key adipokine in the regulation of energy metabolism; however, it is also able to control some reproductive functions. Recently, the adiponectin system (adiponectin, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) was described in rat and human hypothalamus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and pituitary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In rat primary pituitary cells, recombinant adiponectin regulates GnRH receptor expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In mouse L&#x003b2;T2 gonadotrope cells and in rat pituitary cells, recombinant adiponectin inhibits LH secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Moreover, adiponectin and AdipoR2 are expressed in rat and human placenta and rat placental adiponectin mRNA increases in abundance during pregnancy whereas AdipoR2 has the opposite pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Adiponectin and its receptors are also present in ovary of various species including pig [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], chicken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Ledoux et al. reported that recombinant adiponectin has a direct effect on gene expression in porcine follicular cells associated with ovarian follicle remodelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In recent work, our group showed that adiponectin is mainly expressed in rat theca-interstitial cells and could exert paracrine effects on the steroidogenesis of granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The expression of the adiponectin system in insulin target tissues (muscle, adipose tissue and liver) in human and animal diabetic models has been studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, the expression of the adiponectin system in reproductive tissues in diabetic animals has not been explored.</p><p>We report an investigation of ovarian steroid production and the protein levels of key factors involved in steroidogenesis in two conditions: in primary rat granulosa cells in the presence of high glucose concentrations; and in streptozotocin-treated female rats. In these conditions, we also assayed adiponectin receptor proteins in ovarian cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Hormones and reagents</title><p>Purified ovine FSH-20 (oFSH) (lot no.AFP-7028D, 4453 IU/mg, with an FSH activity = 175 times the activity of oFSH-S1) used for culture treatment was a gift from NIDDK, National Hormone Pituitary Program, Bethesda, MD, USA.

Eight week-old female Wistar rats (n = 18) were purchased from Janvier Laboratories (France). They were housed with controlled temperature and photoperiod (10 h darkness, 14 h light, light on from 0600&#x02013;2000 h). The animals had ad libitum access to food and water. Diabetes was induced in one group of rats (n = 12) by an intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml of 50 mM sodium citrate solution (pH 4.5) containing streptozotocin (STZ, 55 mg/kg body weight). Control female rats (C, n = 6) were injected with 50 mM sodium citrate solution (pH 4.5). One week after injection, plasma glucose levels were checked for each animal and diabetes was confirmed (plasma glucose level &#x0003e;3 g/l). Then, control and STZ-treated rats were killed at diestrus stage.

On the third day of DES treatment the animals were killed and the ovaries removed aseptically and transferred to culture medium. Granulosa cells were harvested by puncturing the follicles allowing expulsion of the cells. Cells were recovered by centrifugation, washed with fresh medium and counted in a hemocytometer. The culture medium used was McCoy's 5A supplemented with 20 mmol/L Hepes, penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/l), L-glutamine (3 mmol/l), 0.1% BSA, 0.1 &#x003bc;mol/l androstenedione, 5 mg/l transferrin, 20 &#x003bc;g/l selenium and 5% FBS.

We report that high concentrations of glucose (5 or 10 g/l) decreased both progesterone and oestradiol production by rat primary granulosa cells in vitro, in both the basal state and in response to FSH or IGF-1. This inhibitory effect was associated with a reduction in the amounts of 3&#x003b2;HSD, p450scc, StAR and p450 aromatase and of MAPK ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In contrast, AMPK phosphorylation was not affected by high levels of glucose. We studied the steroidogenesis in vivo, in ovaries of the STZ-treated rats. The streptozotocin treatment significantly decreased plasma concentrations of progesterone and oestradiol. Curiously, this was associated with an increase in the amounts of p450scc and StAR proteins in the ovaries of STZ-treated rats whereas the amounts of 3&#x003b2;HSD and p450 aromatase proteins were similar in STZ-treated and control rats. Furthermore, AMPK phosphorylation was increased in STZ-treated rat ovary whereas the streptozotocin treatment had no effect on MAPK ERK1/2 phosphorylation. We also observed that the abundance of adiponectin receptors was not affected by supra-physiological levels of glucose either in vitro in rat granulosa cells or in vivo in ovaries of STZ-treated rats. Thus, glucose seems to be involved in a series of metabolic pathways that collectively contribute to normal ovarian steroidogenesis.</p><p>In the present study, we have shown that glucose treatment decreases basal and FSH-or IGF-1-stimulated steroid production in vitro in rat granulosa cells. Furthermore, this result was associated to a reduction in MAPK ERK1/2 phosphorylation. However, the dose of glucose used in our study is high (5 or 10 g/l), corresponding to supra-physiological levels. There are conflicting reports concerning the involvement of MAPK ERK1/2 in the regulation of steroidogenesis in various steroid-producing cells, probably because different species (rodents and humans) and different culture systems have been used in various studies. Consistent with our findings presented here, studies in rats using primary cultures of granulosa cells demonstrate that inhibition of MAPK ERK1/2 decreased FSH-induced progesterone secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], 3&#x003b2;HSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and StAR expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. MAPK ERK1/2 regulates target gene expression by activating downstream transcription factors including the steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Furthermore, the 3&#x003b2;HSD type 2 promoter contains a consensus sequence for SF-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Thus, high concentrations of glucose (5 or 10 g/l) like those we used may reduce progesterone secretion in rat granulosa cells through inhibition of MAPK ERK1/2 leading to a reduction in the 3&#x003b2;HSD and/or StAR levels and consequently progesterone secretion. We can not also exclude that high concentration of glucose may cause energy stress for the cells and consequently a reduction of the steroid production. However, we observed that high concentrations of glucose did not affect AMPK activation. AMPK is considered to be a master switch in regulating glucose metabolism: it acts as a fuel gauge, being activated in conditions of extreme phosphate depletion and inhibited by high levels of ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In granulosa cells, glucose can be metabolized through the pentose phosphate pathway and this leads to the production of ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Thus, high levels of glucose should reduce AMPK phosphorylation. However, we can not exclude the possibility that glucose regulates AMPK phosphorylation in rat granulosa cells but only in conditions different to those we used (different doses or after different periods of time). We recently showed that AMPK activation decreases progesterone secretion through MAPK ERK1/2 inhibition in rat granulosa cells. As 10 g/l glucose did not affect AMPK phosphorylation, it probably acts through another molecular mechanism to inhibit MAPK ERK1/2 phosphorylation. There is evidence that inhibition of MAPK ERK1/2 leads not only to a decrease in progesterone secretion but also an increase in the p450 aromatase expression and oestradiol production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We report that 5 or 10 g/l glucose decreased progesterone and oestradiol production, and it is therefore likely that glucose uses a molecular mechanism other than the inhibition of MAPK ERK1/2 to reduce oestradiol production. We found that 5 or 10 g/l glucose did not affect granulosa cell proliferation in the basal state or in response to FSH or IGF-1. These observations are opposite to findings for other cell types. For example, Turner and Bierman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and Hehenberger and Hansson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] have stated that glucose was important for cell proliferation; they report that increasing glucose levels to 18 and 15.5 mM (about 3 g/l), respectively, increases fibroblast proliferation, whereas further increases lead to an inhibition of proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Thus, the effect of glucose on cell proliferation seems to depend on the concentration used and the cell type. We have shown that high concentrations of glucose (10 g/l) did not affect the abundance of adiponectin receptors in rat granulosa cells. However, it is plausible that glucose modulates the signalling pathways activated by adiponectin. We recently observed that human recombinant adiponectin activated several signalling pathways including AMPK, MAPK ERK1/2 and p38, and also Akt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Thus, the effects of high glucose levels on the adiponectin response in rat granulosa cells need to be tested.</p><p>We also investigated the effect of hyperglycaemia (about 4 g/l or 22 mM glucose) in vivo in the ovary of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. As expected, the plasma concentrations of insulin were low in these STZ diabetic rats and they also had lower plasma adiponectin and resistin levels than rat controls. The concentration of adiponectin in plasma is diminished in type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] whereas it has been reported that the adiponectin concentration increased in type 1 diabetic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Our work suggests that STZ rats may have a degree of insulin resistance. We did not analyze the total body fat content. However, when we removed liver and muscle from STZ and Control rats, STZ rats seemed to lose fat mass (data not shown) despite their body weight not being significantly different to controls (mean: 229 g versus 214 g p = 0.1). The decreased fat mass may explain the diminished adiponectin and resistin levels. We observed that plasma progesterone and oestradiol concentrations were lower in STZ-treated rats than in controls suggesting that ovarian steroidogenesis function was altered. The decline in steroid production in several diabetic states is well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. However, the mechanism of the reduction in ovarian steroidogenesis is not clear. In the present study, no decrease in the amounts of 3&#x003b2;HSD and p450 aromatase was observed whereas the levels of StAR and p450scc proteins were increased in the ovaries of STZ-treated animals. These data are in a good agreement with other studies that report no alteration to p450scc or 3&#x003b2;HSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Possibly, the activity of these key steroidogenesis enzymes is decreased in STZ-treated rats and this could explain the decline in steroid production in these animals. We found that the protein level of adiponectin receptors (AdipoR1/R2) was similar both in ovaries and in the liver of control and STZ-treated rats. Only the AdipoR2 protein was slightly less abundant in muscle of STZ-treated than control rats. Several studies have explored the mRNA for adiponectin receptors in diabetic human and animal tissues, and the results are the subject of debate. They depend on the body mass index, the level of insulin resistance and especially the tissue type. In human and rodent type 2 diabetic model, mRNAs for insulin and the AdipoR1/R2 are altered in muscle and liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Another group concluded that the adiponectin level is inversely correlated with obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance, whereas the amounts of adipoR1/R2 mRNA increased in muscle in a compensatory effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In contrast, Hammarstedt's group and Yao's group reported no change in the expression of the two adiponectin receptors in type 2 diabetic patients and rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In the present study, we observed higher levels of AMPK phosphorylation in the ovary and also in muscle of STZ-treated than control rats. AMPK is activated by energy stress, for example glucose deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. In our model, STZ treatment causes a lack of insulin because of the pancreatic function impairment. Thus, hyperglycaemia develops but no glucose can enter into the cell of the insulin target tissues. This cellular stress may involve AMPK activation in the various tissues explored including the ovary despite it not being considered to be a major insulin-dependent tissue. The increase in AMPK activation in the ovary of STZ-treated rats may contribute to the decrease in progesterone secretion in these animals. Indeed, we have recently shown that AMPK activation decreases progesterone secretion in rat granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our various results suggest that high levels of glucose (5 or 10 g/l) decrease steroid production. However, the mechanisms involved in the reduction in ovarian steroidogenesis depend on the model used (in vitro primary rat granulosa cells or in vivo ovary of STZ-treated rat). In rat granulosa cells, high levels of glucose decrease the protein levels of the main steroidogenesis factors whereas the amounts of these factors are not affected or even increased in the ovaries of STZ-treated rats. Furthermore, high levels of glucose did not affect the abundance of adiponectin receptors in vitro in rat granulosa cells or in vivo in the ovaries of STZ-treated rats.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CC participated together with JD in the design of the study.
