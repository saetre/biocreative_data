Myelin-associated inhibitors are predominantly expressed by oligodentrocytes and they are known to inhibit axon regeneration after injury in adult CNS. Both in vivo and in vitro, the fate decision of NPCs has been suggested to be controlled not only by endogenous genes, such as POU genes, Notch genes, and bHLH genes, but also by exogenous niches. Some outgrowth factors such as EGF, bFGF, LIF and BMPs as exogenous factors could mediate the fate decision of NPCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001856-Weible1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001856-Chen1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001856-Hapner1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Though there is much progress in NPCs differentiation research, the underlying mechanism of NPCs fate decision still remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we have discovered the unknown function of myelin-associated growth inhibitory proteins which promote the glial differentiation and inhibit the neuronal differentiation of NPCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>We have prepared myelin from adult rat spinal cord and assessed its effect on the differentiation of NPCs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001856-g001">Fig 1B</xref>). After treated with 1.0 or 5.0 ug/ml myelin, NPCs were inhibited to differentiate into neuronal cells (&#x003b2; III tubulin positive cells) and promoted to differentiate into astrocytes (GFAP positive cells) (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001856-g002">Fig 2B and C</xref>). There are many components in myelin. We wonder if the major myelin components have the similar effects. Myelin basic protein (MBP) is one of the major myelin proteins, making up 40&#x00025; of total myelin protein in CNS. We found that MBP protein did not regulate the glial and neuronal differentiation of NPCs (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001856-g002">Fig 2D and E</xref>). Some myelin proteins such as Nogo-A, MAG, and OMgp are axon outgrowth inhibitors in CNS. We have hypothesized that these axon inhibitory myelin proteins could mediate the NPCs fate decision. Central to the current understanding of axon inhibitors is the membrane protein Nogo-A. In the myelin preparation, Nogo-A protein was successfully detected by western blot analysis with a Nogo-A antibody (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001856-g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0001856-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001856.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Myelin preparation and GST-Nogo-66 expression.</title><p>(A) Immunofluorescence analysis of Nestin (green) in the primary culture NPCs.

The soluble, native GST-Nogo-66 protein purified with a glutathione-resin was broken and only contained about 30&#x00025; full-length GST-Nogo-66. Thus we have renatured the GST-Nogo-66 from inclusion bodies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001856-g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The renatured GST-Nogo-66 had biological activity and significantly inhibited neurite outgrowth of rat cerebellar granule neurons (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001856-g001">Fig 1D, E</xref>). We thus used the renatured Nogo-66 to assess its effect on NPCs differentiation in our study. We observed the differentiation of NPCs treated by Nogo-66 for 8 days <italic>in vitro</italic> (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001856-g003">Fig 3</xref>). Nogo-66 promoted NPCs to differentiate into astrogalial cells (GFAP and S-100&#x003b2; positive cells). We found that 50 nM and 100 nM Nogo-66 could significantly increase the proportion of GFAP or S-100&#x003b2; immunostaining positive cells compared to the corresponding dose of GST treatment. It indicated that Nogo-66 could promote astroglial differentiation of NPCs, with the similarity of astrocyte differentiation promotion <italic>in vivo</italic> in previous reports. Meanwhile, both the NeuN and &#x003b2; III tubulin antibodies were used to identify the differentiated neurons in immunostaining analysis and Nogo-66 suppressed the neuronal differentiation of NPCs in a dose-dependent manner. Comparing to &#x003b2; III tubulin expression in neuron cytoplasm and its axons, NeuN was mostly expressed in the nuclei. From the two consistent results, we concluded that Nogo-66 could inhibit the differentiation of NPCs into neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>. And the result was further confirmed by western blot analysis (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001856-g003">Fig 3B</xref>). After Nogo-66 treatment, NeuN and &#x003b2; III tubulin expressions were significantly decreased and GFAP expression was significantly increased. In addition, no difference of cell apoptosis percentages between Nogo-66 and GST treatment group was detected by FACS using Annexin V-FITC and propidine iodide (PI) staining (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001856-g003">Fig 3G</xref>). The results suggested that the promotion of astroglial differentiation was not the result of the possible enhanced neuronal cell apoptosis induced by Nogo-66. Due to the consistent results with the astrocytic marker, GFAP and S-100&#x003b2;immunostaining analysis, we considered that Nogo-66 indeed promoted the glial differentiation of NPCs and GFAP was used as the marker of glial cells in our experiments.</p><fig id="pone-0001856-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001856.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Astroglial induction of NPCs by Nogo-66 for 8 days.</title><p>(A) Images of immunocytochemistry.

Thus, we hypothesized that the myelin associated inhibitory proteins had the astroglial induction in NPCs differentiation.</p><p>Nogo-A, a potent myelin associated inhibitor, is predominantly expressed in oligodentrocytes of CNS and its axon growth inhibiting domain of 66 amino acids (Nogo-66) is expressed at the extra-cellular surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001856-GrandPre1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In the predicted structure of Nogo-A, the N and C-terminus are cytosolic and Nogo-66 residue is in the extracellular or ER lumen localization. But the N terminus of endogenous Nogo-A has been found exposed on the surface of some cells such as fibroblasts, DRG neurons, and myoblasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001856-Dodd1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Nogo-A could be released during CNS injuries and might be present in the NPCs niche. Thus it may be possible for the interaction between Nogo-66 and NgR to occur in injured CNS and mediate the fate decision of NPCs. In our study, Nogo-66, a potent inhibitory factor in CNS axon regeneration, was found to have a new role in astroglial induction in NPCs. It provided us a novel insight into the function of Nogo-A and other myelin associated factors in the CNS development and regeneration. Nogo-66 receptor (NgR) mediates the regeneration inhibitory signal of Nogo-66 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001856-Fournier1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, we have detected that NgR was expressed in NPCs. After pre-treatment by PI-PLC and NEP140, the astroglial induction of Nogo-66 was partially recovered. Furthermore, we have used PI-PLC, NEP1-40 to recover the activated phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser727 and Tyr705 by Nogo-66. Thus the results indicated astroglial induction signal of Nogo-66 was mediated by NgR.</p><p>The mechanism of Nogo-66 in axon regeneration is well known. After Nogo-66 binding to the NgR, RhoA-ROCK pathway is activated and axon outgrowth is then inhibited. Y27632 is a RhoA-ROCK inhibitor and can partially rescue the regeneration inhibition and promote axon outgrowth of injured neurons both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. After Nogo-66 was found to induce astroglial differentiation of NPCs, we naturally wondered if the RhoA-ROCK pathway was also involved in the astroglial induction. Y27632 treatment did not reverse the astroglial induction of Nogo-66 and failed to rescue the activated phosphorylation of STAT3 induced by Nogo-66. It suggested that the mechanism of its astroglial differentiation induction is not dependent on RhoA-ROCK pathway in NPCs fate decision and different mechanism should be involved.</p><p>Extracellular stimulus and the cellular context activate the phosphorylation of STAT3. STAT3 requires phosphorylation on tyrosine (705) and serine (727) residues by independent protein kinase activities for the maximal activation of target gene transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001856-Wen1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Members of the JAK/Tyk family of tyrosine kinases mediate phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705 and mTOR could mediate phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser727. Activated phosphorylation of STAT3 plays a crucial role in glial differentiation in NPCs or neural stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001856-Rajan1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001856-Gossrau1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Some cytokines, such as LIF, BMP2 and CNTF promote glial differentiation of NPCs by activating phosphorylation of STAT3. In the glial differentiation of neural stem cells induced by BMPs, mTOR associates with STAT3 and facilitates STAT activation. In this study, Nogo-66 induced astroglial differentiation of NPCs and activated phosphorylation of STAT3 at both Ser727 and Tyr705 and phosphorylation of mTOR. AG490, a commonly used STAT3 pathway inhibitor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001856-Hapner1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, could almost entirely rescue the enhanced astroglial induction of Nogo-66 and this indicated that STAT3 and mTOR was indeed involved in the glial induction by Nogo-66.</p><p>We have found that rapamycin could mostly abolish the activated phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser727 and Tyr705. It indicated that mTOR might also mediate the phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705, not only at Ser727. The serine-threonine kinase FKBP12/rapamycin-associated protein (mTOR)/STAT3 pathway played crucial role in glial differentiation induced by BMPs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001856-Rajan1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001856-Gossrau1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and rapamycin could abolish this effect. Rapamycin can bind to FKBP12 and inhibit the activation of mTOR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001856-Hamilton1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. With the similar result, we found that rapamycin completely abolished the enhanced astroglial differentiation induced by Nogo-66. In western blot analysis, rapamycin could rescue the activated phosphorylation of STAT3 induced by Nogo-66. In addition, we have found that rapamycin treatment could decrease the complex formation between mTOR and STAT3 by immunoprecipitation with the mTOR antibody before western blot analysis using a STAT3 antibody. These results indicated that mTOR regulated the activation of STAT3 induced by Nogo-66 in NPCs differentiation. The serine-threonine kinase mTOR is an important regulator of cell growth and proliferation by promoting the synthesis of proteins crucial to cell size and cell cycle progression. MTOR can catalyze serine phosphorylation of STAT3 and the activation of STAT3 causes efficient glial differentiation. If rapamycin binds mTOR, the mTOR-STAT3 will be released and Nogo-66 will fail to activate the phosphorylation of STAT3. We thus proposed a model for astroglial induction by Nogo-66 in NPCs fate decision. The binding of Nogo-66 to NgR activated mTOR-STAT3 through a still unclear mechanism. MTOR-STAT3 complex formation is essential for phosphorylation of STAT3 induced by Nogo-66 in NPCs. The activation of STAT3 then induces the glial differentiation.</p><p>Myelin associated factors represent an important environmental niche for endogenous and transplanted neural stem cells in CNS, especially at the injured CNS sites. The transplanted neural stem cells or NPCs in the injured CNS mostly differentiated into astroglial lineage. In vitro, Nogo-66 has induced NPCs to differentiate into astroglial cells by activating the mTOR-STAT3 signalling pathway. The glial differentiation promotion by Nogo-66 may contribute to the low efficient neuronal differentiation in endogenous and engrafted neural stem cells in CNS. Our study has provided novel insight into the functions of Nogo-66 and other myelin associated factors in the CNS development and regeneration. Further studies could help to identify important cellular molecules for evolving pharmacological, gene and stem cell therapeutic interventions in CNS regeneration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Antibodies and Reagents</title><p>Nogo-R (Catalog #: sc-25659, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); GFAP (Catalog #: ab929, ABCAM); NeuN and &#x003b2; III tubulin (Upstate); S-100 beta and &#x003b1;-tubulin (Sigma); P-STAT3 (Ser727), P-STAT3 (Tyr 705) and STAT3 (CST), P-mTOR and mTOR (CST);Nestin (ABCAM) ; Nogo-A (#Nogo-A 12-A, AD);MBP (Boster, China).Myelin basic protein (MBP), bovine puried (Upstate).
