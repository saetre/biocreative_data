The SALL4-mediated transcriptional regulation was tested on two potential target genes: PTEN and SALL1. Both genes were confirmed as SALL4 downstream targets by chromatin-immunoprecipitation, and their expression levels, when tested by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), were decreased in 293T cells overexpressing SALL4.

Each of these homologues is expressed during embryonic development, as well as in specific adult tissues.</p><p>Human SALL4 mutations are associated with the Duane-radial ray syndrome (DRRS, OMIM#126800, also known as Okihiro syndrome), which is a human autosomal-dominant syndrome involving multiple organ defects, including kidney malformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005577-AlBaradie1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005577-Kohlhase4">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005577-Borozdin1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. SALL4 is also essential for maintenance of pluripotent and self-renewal properties of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by interacting with other two key regulators in ESCs, NANOG and OCT4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005577-Zhang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005577-Elling1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Loss of SALL4 expression in mouse ESCs results in downregulation of OCT4 and spontaneous differentiation. Significant zygotic SALL4 transcription in mice occurs after the 4-cell stage and continues to increase until the blastocyst stage. By 10.5 days postcoitum, SALL4 is detectable mainly in the stem/progenitor populations in various organ systems including the brain and bone marrow of the embryo and later in the adult. This may suggest that SALL4 is not only involved in ESCs but also in adult stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005577-Elling1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, we have reported that SALL4 is constitutively expressed in human leukemia cell lines and primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. We have generated a SALL4 transgenic mouse model in which SALL4B, one of the SALL4 isoforms, is overexpressed. These mice exhibit a pre-leukemic dysplastic phase and subsequently develop AML transformation that is transplantable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005577-Ma1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005577-Cui1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, 50&#x00025; of these transgenic mice developed cystic kidneys. Together, these characteristics indicate that SALL4 is a critical gene for ESC properties, kidney development, and leukemogenesis, and is involved in the biological functions of various types of stem cells. Defining the precise mechanism(s) and downstream target genes of SALL4 is of great importance to the field of stem cell study.</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that a conserved N-terminal 12 amino acid domain of SALL1 and FRIEND OF GATA1 (FOG-1) is sufficient for recruiting Mi-2/Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex and mediating transcriptional repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005577-Lauberth1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005577-Lauberth2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. It is known that acetylation status of histones is associated with the regulation of gene transcription. Generally, when histones are acetylated, chromatin becomes loosely packed euchromatin and gene expression is activated. In contrast, deacetylated histones lead to condensed heterochromatin and repressed gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005577-Ahringer1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. In mammalian cells, there are two major histone deacetylation complexes, Mi-2/NuRD and Sin3. These two protein complexes share four common components, HDAC1, HDAC2, RbAp46 and RbAp48. Mi-2/NuRD complex additionally includes Mi-2, MTA-1, MTA-2, p66 and MBD3. Among these eight factors, HDAC1 and HDAC2 are histone deacetylases, RbAp46 and RbAp48 are histone binding proteins, and Mi-2 is a chromatin remodeling ATPase. Therefore, histone deacetylation and chromation remodeling ATPase activities are uniquely linked in this single protein complex Mi-2/NuRD, whose function is to produce compactly packed, hypoacetylated nucleosomes that switch an active, hyperacetylate promoter to its inactivated state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005577-Denslow1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we report that SALL4, a protein containing the same conserved 12 amino acid motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005577-Lauberth1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005577-Lauberth2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005577-Wong1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, associates with the NuRD complex and functions as a strong transcription repressor.

To test this hypothesis, we performed ChIP-qPCR analysis using the anti-HDAC2 antibody and examined whether HDAC2 and SALL4 shared the same binding site(s) at the promoters of PTEN and SALL1. We have shown that SALL4 binds to the specific promoter regions of PTEN (&#x02212;2629 bp&#x0223c;&#x02212;2383 bp, Region I, and &#x02212;1706 bp&#x0223c;&#x02212;1571 bp, Region III) and SALL1 (&#x02212;2057 bp&#x0223c;&#x02212;1867 bp, Region II, and &#x02212;1464 bp&#x0223c;&#x02212;1279 bp, Region V). In this experiment, in HDAC2 pulldown fragments of both SALL4A and SALL4B transfected cells, 2 to 5 fold enrichment was detected at the SALL4 binding sites of PTEN and SALL1 promoters when compared with input.

The same result was obtained from the ChIP-qPCR assay using anti-MTA2 antibody (data not shown). Therefore, these results illustrate that SALL4 and NuRD complex co-occupy the same promoter sites of PTEN and SALL1 and indicate that SALL4 downregulates the transcription of those two genes through histone deacetylation. In addition, we performed the same analysis using anti-acetyl Histone H3 antibody.

During these studies we have noticed that SALL4 activates as well as represses its target genes. In addition, SALL1, another SALL gene family member, is capable of repressing transcriptional activity. These findings prompted us to ask whether SALL4 had transcriptional repression activity.</p><p>In this study, we have shown that SALL4 can act as a repressor in some context. More importantly, we have made a novel observation that SALL4 directly connects the epigenetic modulators (NuRD repressor complex) to its downstream target genes, such as PTEN and SALL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005577-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The NuRD complex has both histone deacetylase and ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling activity. It plays roles in transcriptional repression through its association with sequence specific DNA-binding protein in ESC, development, hematopoietic differentiation and tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005577-Ahringer1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005577-Denslow1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005577-Becker1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005577-McDonel1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. We have shown through tandem mass spectrometry and/or coimmunoprecipitation that both the endogenous and the exogenous SALL4 can bind to the NuRD complex. In addition, the SALL4-bound protein complex has histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. To make our study relevant to the biological functions of SALL4, we have searched genes that are involved in ESC, leukemogenesis, and kidney development, and have chosen PTEN and SALL1 as exemplar target genes to demonstrate the mechanism of SALL4-mediated gene repression. Both SALL4 isoforms, SALL4A and SALL4B, can interact with this complex to regulate their down stream targets (PTEN and SALL1), although they do so through different binding sites on the promoter regions of these genes. The SALL4-mediated repression of the expression of PTEN and SALL1 has been confirmed both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and is associated with phenotypes observed in SALL4B transgenic mice, i.e. AML and cystic kidneys, respectively. While both genes are involved in ESCs, kidney development and leukemogenesis, SALL1 is best studied for its essential role in kidney development, and PTEN is known as a key regulator in leukemic stem cells. Therefore, we tested the expression levels of these two genes in their most functionally relevant tissues: SALL1 in kidneys and PTEN in the bone marrow. Both genes were down-regulated in the SALL4B transgenic mice in comparison to their wild type littermates. In addition, our previous study on downregulation of SALL4 in leukemic NB4 cells has demonstrated that PTEN is upregulaetd when the expression of SALL4 is knocking down <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005577-Yang1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0005577-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005577.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Proposed functional model for SALL4/NuRD complex.</title><p>SALL4 recruits the NuRD complex to the specific promoter regions on its target genes (i.e. PTEN and SALL1).

Additional study in our lab has indicated that the SALL4-bound protein complex has histone H3K4 trimethylation activity (unpublished data). In this study, we have discovered that SALL4 can interact with an epigenetic repressor complex, NuRD, in gene silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005577-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Taken together, we have made the novel observation that SALL4 connects the epigenetic modulators (both the activator and repressor complex) to its downstream target genes, a phenomenon that has not been reported for other stem cell proteins, such as Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2. Though further studies are needed to define the precise mechanism(s) that determine SALL4 to work as an activator versus a repressor, this observation should provide us with a unique opportunity to study the connection between the genetic and epigenetic programs in stem cells in the future. Furthermore, we propose the following working model: it is possible that SALL4 recruits epigenetic modulators to specific DNA sequences in the promoter regions of its downstream targets for either activation or repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005577-g009">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0005577-g009" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005577.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Working hypothesis:SALL4 recruits epigenetic modulators to specific DNA sequences on the promoter regions of its downstream targets.</title><p>A, SALL4 represses its downstream targets by recruiting NuRD to specific promoter regions that results in histone deacetylation and transcription repression. B, SALL4 activates its downstream targets by recruiting a histone methyltransferase complex to specific promoter regions that results in H3-K4 trimethylation and transcription activation. C, Alternatively, SALL4 recruits both complexes to specific regions on the promoters of target genes. It can either repress or activate the transcription of these genes by balancing the interactions with both complexes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0005577.g009"/></fig><p>The genetic program in ESC consists of a core transcriptional network including SALL4, OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG. The epigenetic state of an ESC is very unique and is described as &#x0201c;bivalent&#x0201d;, wherein markers for repression (trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27, H3-K27) and activation (trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 4, H3-K4) on certain developmental genes coexist. This unique epigenetic state is essential for ESC pluripotency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005577-Bernstein1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005577-Sharov1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. It remains unknown how the core transcriptional network is linked to this unique &#x02018;stem cell&#x0201d; epigenetic state in maintaining properties of ESCs. Our studies suggest that SALL4 may be the key element that connects the epigenetic and genetic programs in ESCs. It is possible that SALL4 recognizes specific DNA binding sites for epigenetic modulators and activates or represses a SALL4 dependent transcriptional network to regulate the self-renewal and pluripotency in ESCs.</p><p>Being a pluripotency gene, SALL4 is present at a very early stage along with Oct4 during development, earlier than Nanog. Unlike Oct4 and Nanog, it is present in adult tissue stem cells (such as hematopoietic stem cells) and cancer stem cells (such as leukemic stem cells). The unique role of SALL4 in the self-renewal properties shared by ESCs, HSCs, and LSCs could be associated with its ability to recruit epigenetic modulators to regulate various downstream targets in various stem cells. Our study on SALL4 as a repressor and its association with the NuRD complex is only the first step in understanding the SALL4-mediated epigenetic modification in ESC, adult stem cells and cancer stem cells. Future studies on SALL4 in various stem cell models should help us to address the fundamental connection between chromatin structure and cell function.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0005577-AlBaradie1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
