The availability of the complete sequence of the mouse genome, followed by the analysis of genome-wide gene expression patterns, facilitates the identification of novel mouse testis-specific genes. Microarray analysis identified 1652 testis-specific transcripts, and it was estimated that more than 2300 genes are specifically expressed in meiotic and post-meiotic male germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c1">1</xref>). Many of these genes encode proteins that are functionally unique to the developing germ cells, or protein isoforms, which can take over functions of proteins encoded by genes that are silenced during spermatogenesis [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c4">4</xref>)].</p><p>The developmental series of subsequent steps in spermatogenesis starts with the mitotic proliferation and maintenance of spermatogonial stem cells, and the entry of differentiated spermatogonia into meiotic prophase. Progression of primary spermatocytes through meiotic prophase takes around 10 days in the mouse, and is followed by the first meiotic division resulting in the formation of haploid secondary spermatocytes, and then by the second meiotic division, which gives rise to round spermatids. Without further cell division, round spermatids engage in a long and complex differentiation process, to become spermatozoa ready to be released from supporting Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c6">6</xref>).</p><p>For many of the testis-specific genes that are expressed in differentiating male germ line cells, a developmental time-point of first expression during spermatogenesis can be indicated. In meiotic prophase, the initiation of expression can occur when the cells progress through the early prophase steps, from preleptotene to early pachytene, but also at later prophase steps, in mid-to-late pachytene spermatocytes. Several genes expressed in meiotic prophase may encode proteins that play some role in post-meiotic differentiation of spermatids and in sperm function, rather than in meiotic prophase. An example of a gene first expressed in mid-to-late meiotic prophase, is the gene encoding <italic>Calmegin</italic> (<italic>Clgn</italic>). In spermatogenesis, the Calmegin protein (Clgn) is thought to act as a chaperone for proteins in transition from endoplasmic reticulum to the spermatid surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c7">7</xref>).</p><p>The initiation of expression of the <italic>Clgn</italic> gene in mid-to-late meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c9">9</xref>) coincides with that of the genes encoding proacrosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c10">10</xref>), Tcp10-bt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c11">11</xref>), testis-specific histone H2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c12">12</xref>), testis-specific histone H1t (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c13">13</xref>) and Zfp35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c14">14</xref>). Initiation of expression of different genes at the same developmental step in spermatogenesis might be controlled by first expression of a transcription factor that activates transcriptional complexes for those genes. One example of such a key transcription activator is the well-studied CREM&#x003c4;, or activator CREM protein isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c15">15</xref>). CREM&#x003c4; has been implicated in the activation of testis-specific gene promoters that contain a cyclic AMP response element (CRE), post-meiotically in spermatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c17">17</xref>). Several other transcription factors that play an exclusive role in spermatogenesis have been identified, but an assigned role in the regulation of specific gene promoters has been described for only a very few factors [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c19">19</xref>)]. Known testis-specific transcription factors belong to several classes, including zinc finger proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c20">20</xref>), homeodomain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c21">21</xref>) and basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix (bHLH) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c22">22</xref>). In addition, testis-specific homologues of the general transcription factors TFIIA, TFIID, elongin and TBP have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c26">26</xref>).</p><p>Promoters of several testis-specific genes have been functionally analysed, including analysis of transcriptional activity in transgenic mouse models. It was observed that relatively short promoter sequences can be sufficient to drive first expression of a reporter gene at the correct spermatogenic developmental step, corresponding to initiation of expression of the respective endogenous gene. For example, testis-specific expression of the gene encoding the C-subunit of lactate dehydrogenase LDH-C4, was shown to be driven by a genomic DNA sequence containing 100 bp immediately upstream of the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c27">27</xref>). In addition, endogenous expression of the round spermatid-specific gene <italic>mSP-10</italic> is reliably mimicked in transgenic mice bearing a 294 bp 5&#x02032;-flanking region of the <italic>mSP-10</italic> promoter fused to the green fluorescent protein reporter gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c28">28</xref>). Even smaller promoter regions that can control spermatogenic gene expression have been identified. For example, DNase footprinting identified a 14 bp sequence in the promoter of the testis-specific mouse &#x003b2;4-galactosyltransferase-I gene, and the expression from this promoter was lost in transgenic mice carrying a mutation in this 14 bp region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c29">29</xref>).</p><p>Despite all knowledge about transcription factors and regulatory promoter elements in spermatogenesis, little is known about which transcription factor regulates which testis-specific promoter(s). In order to identify transcription factors that can take part in transcriptional regulation of known genes in spermatogenesis, we have used the yeast one-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c30">30</xref>) with a testis-specific promoter element as bait. The one-hybrid system is an <italic>in vivo</italic> genetic assay that can be used for the identification of genes encoding transcription factors that bind to a small <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory element.</p><p>In transgenic mice, a 330 bp sequence, containing a 152 bp putative promoter upstream of the <italic>Clgn</italic> transcription initiation site, is sufficient for testis-specific expression, and testis-specific proteins bind this promoter region in band shift assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c31">31</xref>). Based on this information, we selected the <italic>Clgn</italic> gene for the present experiments, and we have used the 152 bp putative promoter sequence, which was suggested to contain the <italic>cis</italic>-acting element regulating testis-specific transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c31">31</xref>), as a bait in the one-hybrid screen. We identified Tcfl5 as a testis-specific transcription factor, which interacts with the promoter of the <italic>Clgn</italic> gene in meiotic prophase, in primary spermatocytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast one-hybrid screening</title><p>Reporter constructs were created by cloning the 152 bp sequence from the putative <italic>Clgn</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c31">31</xref>) in the EcoRI&#x02013;XbaI sites of pHISi-1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and in the EcoRI&#x02013;KpnI sites of pLacZi vector (Clontech). The <italic>Clgn</italic> promoter was obtained by PCR on genomic DNA isolated from the liver of an adult male FVB mouse. Reporter strains were constructed by subsequent integration of the linearized reporter constructs in the genome of yeast strain YM4271 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). The resulting strain, CalHis&#x0002f;CalLacZ, was transformed with the mouse testis Matchmaker cDNA library (Clontech) and plated on the Synthetic DropOut medium lacking histidine and leucine containing 30 mM 3-amino-triazole (3-AT). Plates were incubated at 30&#x000b0;C for 4&#x02013;6 days. Positive clones were named One Hybrid Calmegin 1&#x02013;14 (OHC1&#x02013;14).

Cloning a 152 bp PCR fragment in front of the yeast reporter genes HIS3 and LacZ created the reporter constructs CalHis and CalLacZ. After integration of both reporters in the genome of yeast strain YM4271, reporter strain CalHis&#x0002f;LacZ was transformed with the mouse testis Matchmaker cDNA library. From library screening on plates lacking histidine and leucine containing 30 mM 3-AT, we obtained 14 HIS<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> positive clones (OHC1-14) from 200&#x02009;000 transformants. Seven of these clones showed blue colouring in the &#x003b2;-Gal assay.

The sequences were used to screen public databases, such as NCBI Blast, MouseBlast, TIGR Gene Indices and Ensembl, to identify the corresponding genes. All six clones from the one-hybrid screening with the <italic>Clgn</italic> promoter contained cDNA or part of the cDNA representing the mouse homologue of the human gene <italic>TransCription Factor-Like 5</italic> (<italic>TCFL5</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c37">37</xref>). This human gene has been originally identified by differential display analysis of PCR products from mRNAs isolated from nine different human tissues, as a testis-specific cDNA encoding a 452 amino acid protein that contains a bHLH motif. Immunohistochemical staining located the gene product exclusively in cell nuclei of primary spermatocytes at the pachytene stage. It was suggested that TCFL5 may function as a transcription factor in spermatogenesis through binding to a specific DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c37">37</xref>).</p><p>Three clones obtained in the present one-hybrid screening (OHC1, OHC5 and OHC13) contain the complete cDNA, and the other three clones miss sequences encoding the N-terminal part of the protein but still contain the sequence that encodes the DNA-binding bHLH domain of the protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f1">1</xref>A).</p><p>Through sequencing clones OHC1 and OHC13, we obtained the complete sequence of mouse <italic>Tcfl5</italic> cDNA. Comparison of this sequence with different databases (TIGR, Ensembl and NCBI BLAST) was done to check and correct the sequence. This sequence was deposited in GenBank at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/GenBank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/GenBank</ext-link>, and is available under accession no. AY234363. The mouse <italic>Tcfl5</italic> cDNA is 2018 bp, containing an open reading frame of 1326 bp that encodes a protein of 442 amino acid residues. Mouse Tcfl5 and human TCFL5 proteins show a high degree of sequence conservation (83% overall amino acid identity), whereas the bHLH domain located at the C-terminus is 100% identical (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f1">1</xref>A).</p><p>Database searches with the bHLH domain of Tcfl5 identified Mad and Mxi1 as the closest bHLH protein family members, showing 30% amino acid sequence identity to Tcfl5. Outside the bHLH domain of Tcfl5, no similarity was found to other bHLH family members or other proteins. Extensive analysis of the protein sequence did not identify any other functional domain.</p><p>According to the classification described by Atchley and Fitch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c38">38</xref>), there are five groups of bHLH proteins (A&#x02013;E), and the amino acids at positions 5, 8 and 13 accurately determine the groups. In Tcfl5 protein, the histidine (H), methionine (M) and arginine (R) at these positions follow the consensus of group B bHLH proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f1">1</xref>B). However, Tcfl5 protein seems to be an atypical group B protein, since Tcfl5 contains a basic domain with a high number of arginine (R) residues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f1">1</xref>B). The R residues at positions 12, 13, 14, 15 and 17 compose a basic domain that is more extended as compared with other mammalian group B bHLH proteins. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> group B proteins hairy and deadpan also contain an extended basic domain, with R residues at positions 11, 12, 13 and 15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c40">40</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue-specific expression of <italic>Tcfl5</italic></title><p>Using a northern blot containing poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA from 15 mouse tissue samples, we detected a <italic>Tcfl5</italic> mRNA species specifically in testis, whereas no detectable signal was obtained for the other tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f2">2</xref>A). The length of the observed transcript, &#x0223c;2.4 kb, is similar to the single <italic>TCFL5</italic> mRNA detected by Maruyama <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c37">37</xref>). Testis-specific expression of the <italic>Tcfl5</italic> gene was confirmed by RT&#x02013;PCR analysis on a mouse total RNA panel (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f2">2</xref>B).</p><p>To determine at which developmental time point <italic>Tcfl5</italic> expression is initiated, RNA samples were isolated from testis of mice of different ages, from postnatal day 4 to day 35. In newborn mice, the spermatogenic epithelium in the testis tubules consists of Sertoli cells and spermatogonia. In the first 3&#x02013;5 days of postnatal testis development, the spermatogonia engage in mitotic proliferation and differentiation, from undifferentiated spermatogonia to type B spermatogonia, which undergo the final mitotic division to become preleptotene spermatocytes that go through the meiotic prophase: leptotene, zygotene, pachytene and diplotene. Early and late pachytene spermatocytes are populating the mouse testis around day 14&#x02013;21 of postnatal development and concomitantly the expression level of the <italic>Tcfl5</italic> transcript markedly increased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f3">3</xref>A). Upon completion of the meiotic divisions, increasing numbers of haploid round and elongating spermatids appear around day 21&#x02013;35 and the testicular Tcfl5 mRNA level remains high, which is explained by continued presence of <italic>Tcfl5</italic> mRNA also in the post-meiotic cells. <italic>Tcfl5</italic> mRNA is found in both isolated meiotic spermatocytes and in post-meiotic round spermatids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f3">3</xref>A). It is to be noted that spermatogenesis is a continuous process, which is reinitiated from undifferentiated spermatogonia throughout adult life, so that the 35-day-old testis contains all spermatogenic cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c5">5</xref>).</p><p>RT&#x02013;PCR on total RNA from testis from 3-, 5-, 7-, 10-, 16-, 20- and 24-day-old mice showed an increase in <italic>Tcfl5</italic> mRNA signal from postnatal day 3 onwards (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f3">3</xref>B). The RT&#x02013;PCR signal for <italic>Clgn</italic> mRNA also increases in testis after postnatal day 3 and the patterns of <italic>Clgn</italic> mRNA and <italic>Tcfl5</italic> mRNA expression overlap (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f3">3</xref>B). Both <italic>Tcfl5</italic> and <italic>Clgn</italic> RT&#x02013;PCR signals show highest intensity in 20- to 24-day-old mouse testis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f3">3</xref>B).</p><p><italic>In situ</italic> hybridization analysis showed that <italic>Tcfl5</italic> signal becomes detectable in 15-day-old mouse testis, in tubules that contain pachytene spermatocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f3">3</xref>C). The number of tubules that contain <italic>Tcfl5</italic> mRNA is higher in 30-day-old mouse testis and <italic>Tcfl5</italic> mRNA was detected in both spermatocytes and spermatids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f3">3</xref>C).</p><p>Taken together, the present results indicate that <italic>Tcfl5</italic> expression initiates in late spermatogonia or early prophase spermatocytes and the mRNA level increases in mid-to-late pachytene spermatocytes and is maintained in round spermatids.</p></sec><sec><title>Tcfl5 protein expression</title><p>To study Tcfl5 protein expression, we generated antibodies against two Tcfl5 peptides. One peptide was located between amino acids 86 and 98, the other between amino acids 409 and 422 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f1">1</xref>A). Both antibodies yielded similar results. Western blotting using total testis lysate showed a faint signal at 55 kDa, but the signal intensity increased when a lysate from isolated spermatocytes was used (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f4">4</xref>A, left panel). Competition experiments with the immunizing peptide P3 showed that the observed band is specific for Tcfl5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f4">4</xref>A, right panel). As described above, northern-blot analysis and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization showed that <italic>Tcfl5</italic> mRNA is present in spermatids. However, with western blotting, we did not detect Tcfl5 protein in cell preparations containing round spermatids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f4">4</xref>A, left panel).</p><p>Immunohistochemistry on mouse testis sections showed that Tcfl5 protein is not present in all tubule cross-sections representing the different stages of the spermatogenic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c41">41</xref>). Stage I and stages II and III tubule cross-sections contain early prophase spermatocytes and post-meiotic round spermatids, but these stages were negative for Tcfl5 protein (data not shown). However, Tcfl5 protein is found at stages IV&#x02013;XII, in mid-to-late pachytene spermatocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f4">4</xref>B, showing cross-sections of different stages).</p><p>Nuclear localization of Tcfl5 was further investigated, using spread nuclei preparations of spermatocytes. To determine meiotic prophase stage in these spread nuclei, an antibody detecting the synaptonemal complex protein Sycp3 was used. Sycp3 is localized on lateral elements on the axes of paired chromosomes, and the visual appearance of these elements can be used to determine the progression of spermatocytes through meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c44">44</xref>). This analysis showed presence of Tcfl5 protein in late pachytene primary spermatocytes, and also in secondary spermatocytes that arise from primary spermatocytes through the first meiotic division (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f5">5</xref>). Interestingly, and this was observed in particular for diplotene spermatocytes, which are near the end of meiotic prophase, less P3-&#x003b1;Tcfl5 signal is observed in regions of the nucleus that show strong DAPI staining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f5">5</xref>). This is also seen for the XY body, a heterochromatic nuclear region that contains the transcriptionally inactive X and Y chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c45">45</xref>). Quantitative analysis showed that &#x0223c;15% of Tcfl5 signal above threshold co-localizes with 13% of DAPI signal above threshold. Thus, Tcfl5 preferentially localizes to chromatin regions containing DAPI signal below the threshold, and these areas contain transcriptionally active DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Tcfl5 preferentially binds the non-canonical sequence CACGCG</title><p>Searches in the Ensembl database with the 150 bp mouse <italic>Clgn</italic> promoter one-hybrid bait sequence, identified a putative promoter element for the human <italic>Calmegin</italic> gene (<italic>CLGN</italic>), which shows 58% sequence identity with the 150 bp mouse element. The mouse <italic>Clgn</italic> promoter contains a putative binding site for transcription factor AP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c31">31</xref>), but this site is not conserved in human (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f1">1</xref>C). All bHLH proteins recognize the canonical E-box CANNTG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c46">46</xref>), and no such consensus site is present in the mouse one-hybrid bait sequence or the putative human <italic>CLGN</italic> promoter. However, within the homologous part of the mouse <italic>Clgn</italic> and human <italic>CLGN</italic> promoters a conserved element of 11 nt is present directly upstream of the transcription start site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f1">1</xref>C). This element contains the non-canonical E-box sequence CACGCG, which might represent a putative binding site for Tcfl5, since the related <italic>Drosophila</italic> bHLH proteins hairy and deadpan both bind to this sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c40">40</xref>).</p><p>DNA binding of Tcfl5 was studied using gel-mobility shift assays. <italic>In vitro</italic> translated Tcfl5 protein was found to bind both the group B bHLH canonical E-box site CACGTG and the hairy-related bHLH non-canonical E-box site CACGCG, but not the group A bHLH canonical E-box site CAGCTG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f6">6</xref>A and B).</p><p>Subsequently, we generated three different strains containing trimers of the E-box sites specific for group A, B and hairy-related bHLH proteins, fused to the <italic>HIS3</italic> and <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter genes, named AEHis&#x0002f;LacZ, BEHis&#x0002f;LacZ and CEHis&#x0002f;LacZ, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh979tb1">1</xref>). Protein&#x02013;DNA interactions in these strains were compared to protein&#x02013;DNA interactions in strain CalHis&#x0002f;LacZ containing the 152 bp <italic>Clgn</italic> promoter (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh979tb1">1</xref>). All four strains were transformed with clone OHC1 expressing Tcfl5 and with the empty pACT2 vector.</p><p>The one-hybrid interaction between Tcfl5 and these reporter constructs was investigated on selective medium and in colony lift X-Gal assays. Transformants were spotted on plates lacking histidine and leucine containing 7.5 mM 3-AT, which is the optimal 3-AT concentration for the E-box reporter strains. As summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh979tb2">2</xref>, growth and blue colouring of reporter strains, BEHis&#x0002f;LacZ, CEHis&#x0002f;LacZ and CalHis&#x0002f;LacZ, indicate that Tcfl5 interacts with the promoter elements used in these strains. In contrast, absence of growth on selective medium of reporter strain AEHis&#x0002f;LacZ confirms that Tcfl5 is not able to interact with the canonical E-box site CAGCTG specific for group A bHLH proteins. Growth of CalHis&#x0002f;LacZ transformed with empty vector is due to the fact that the optimal 3-AT concentration for this reporter strain is 30 mM. Growth and blue colouring in strains CalHis&#x0002f;LacZ and CEHis&#x0002f;LacZ is stronger than in strain BEHis&#x0002f;LacZ, indicating that Tcfl5 is capable of binding CACGTG, but the CACGCG sequence specific for hairy-related bHLH proteins and present in the proximal <italic>Clgn</italic> promoter is the preferred binding site.</p><p>To quantify the one-hybrid interactions and to compare the relative strength of the protein&#x02013;DNA interactions, we assayed liquid cultures for &#x003b2;-galactosidase. In this assay, Tcfl5 is able to activate the CELacZ and the CalLacZ reporters to comparable levels, but the level of activation of the group B E-box reporter is &#x0223c;15-fold lower (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f7">7</xref>). As expected, Tcfl5 cannot activate the group A E-box reporter. These results identify the <italic>Clgn</italic> promoter as a <italic>bona fide</italic> downstream target of Tcfl5.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>One-hybrid screening appears to be a powerful and useful tool to identify candidate transcription factors involved in the regulation of genes in spermatogenesis. Screening of a mouse testis cDNA library for proteins that bind the <italic>Clgn</italic> promoter resulted in the identification of a cDNA encoding the testis-specific bHLH protein Tcfl5, which is homologous to human TCFL5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c37">37</xref>). bHLH proteins are important gene regulatory factors, and contribute to control of many developmental pathways, such as neurogenesis, myogenesis, cell proliferation and differentiation, cell lineage determination, sex determination and other essential processes, in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c38">38</xref>).</p><p>The present observations on <italic>Tcfl5</italic> mRNA and Tcfl5 protein expression in mouse testis are in agreement with the report on <italic>TCFL5</italic>&#x0002f;TCFL5 expression in human testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c37">37</xref>). In the mouse testis, we found <italic>Tcfl5</italic> mRNA in meiotic pachytene spermatocytes and in post-meiotic round spermatids, while the Tcfl5 protein is detected in spermatocytes, from late pachytene until the second meiotic division, but not in post-meiotic round spermatids. Tcfl5 protein expression overlaps with the onset of expression of the putative target gene <italic>Clgn</italic> in pachytene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c9">9</xref>). However, a function of calmegin during meiotic prophase is not evident. In <italic>Clgn</italic> gene knockout mice, spermatogenesis is quite normal, but the <italic>Clgn</italic> deficient spermatozoa do not adhere to the zona pellucida, resulting in male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c7">7</xref>). There is impaired heterodimerization of fertilin &#x003b1;&#x0002f;&#x003b2;, which results in the absence of fertilin &#x003b2; from mature <italic>Clgn</italic> knockout sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c47">47</xref>). Calmegin is thought to act as a chaperone for sperm surface proteins that mediate sperm&#x02013;egg interaction, and expression of the <italic>Clgn</italic> gene in spermatocytes seems to be like a kind of foresight of the meiotic cells looking ahead to post-meiotic spermiogenesis and sperm function.</p><p>In this context, it may be of interest to note that the <italic>Factor In the Germline &#x003b1;</italic> gene (<italic>Figla</italic> in mouse and <italic>FIGLA</italic> in human) encodes a bHLH protein expressed in the female germ line in both mouse and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c49">49</xref>). In mice, <italic>Figla</italic> mRNA is first detected in oocytes at E13.5 and persists in adults. The Figla protein forms a heterodimer with bHLH protein E12, and regulates the expression of the oocyte-specific zona pellucida genes <italic>Zp1</italic>, <italic>Zp2</italic> and <italic>Zp3</italic> by binding to a conserved E-box upstream of the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c50">50</xref>). Therefore, both bHLH proteins Tcfl5 and Figla are expressed during meiotic prophase, of male and female germ cell development, respectively, whereas putative or known target genes are not involved in meiosis but function even as late as fertilization. Tcfl5 and Figla belong to different groups within the bHLH protein family, but still, the analogy in function between these two bHLH transcription factors suggests that similar mechanisms may be operative in the regulation of sex-specific aspects of male and female gametogenesis.</p><p>Numerous bHLH proteins have been identified and have been classified according to different criteria. Atchley <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c51">51</xref>) defined five subgroups (A&#x02013;E) based upon evolutionary conservation of several amino acid residues and DNA-binding properties. In addition, the presence or absence of a leucine zipper domain is taken into account. Later studies have defined additional conserved functional protein domains that are present in subfamilies of bHLH proteins. An example of such a domain is the orange domain adjacent to the bHLH domain in the so-called hairy-related group of bHLH proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c52">52</xref>).</p><p>The basic domain of all bHLH proteins permits these proteins to bind to a consensus hexanucleotide that has been defined as the canonical E-box CANNTG. In addition, the HLH domain is important for homo- and&#x0002f;or heterodimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c51">51</xref>). Following the criteria of Atchley and Fitch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c38">38</xref>), we suggest that Tcfl5 is a member of the group B bHLH subfamily. However, the 152 bp putative <italic>Clgn</italic> promoter sequence that was used in the present one-hybrid screening does not contain the consensus group B hexanucleotide E-box sequence CACGTG. The present results show that Tcfl5 binds the non-canonical E-box CACGCG.</p><p>Conserved amino acid residues in the basic region determine binding site specificity of bHLH proteins. The highly conserved Glu (E) at position 9 contacts the 5&#x02032; CA nucleotides of the E-box consensus binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c53">53</xref>). Studies with the group B bHLH protein Max pointed out that the conserved Arg (R) at position 13 is the key determinant for binding specificity of group B bHLH proteins. Analysis of protein&#x02013;DNA co-crystals showed that R13 makes direct contact with the G nucleotide at position 4 in the group B binding site CACGTG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c53">53</xref>). However, this sequence is not present in the <italic>Clgn</italic> promoter, and Tcfl5 preferentially binds the non-canonical CACGCG sequence. This sequence is also preferred by a subfamily of bHLH proteins, including <italic>Drosophila</italic> hairy and deadpan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c40">40</xref>). These and other hairy-related bHLH proteins contain a conserved Pro (P) at position 6 of the basic region, but in Tcfl5 no Pro is found at this position. However, Tcfl5 contains an Arg at position 15 that is also found in hairy and deadpan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c40">40</xref>). The presence of this Arg, and the overall high similarity of this part of the basic region of Tcfl5 to that of hairy-related bHLH proteins, suggests that this Arg might play an important role in determining the DNA-binding specificity of Tcfl5. Tcfl5 lacks the Orange domain that is typical for the hairy-related subfamily of bHLH group proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c52">52</xref>), and it appears that Tcfl5 is an atypical member of the B group of bHLH proteins.</p><p>Database searches identified partial Tcfl5 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from rat, bovine, pig, chicken and trout (data not shown). Most of these libraries were listed to be derived from reproductive tissue. Although the ESTs represent partial sequences, we found that the bHLH domain is almost completely conserved in all these species, and that the C-terminus is highly similar. Database searches also yielded information that the target gene <italic>Clgn</italic> is present and testis-specifically expressed in rat, bovine and pig (data not shown), and we would like to suggest an important role for Tcfl5 in the regulation of spermatogenesis in species ranging from fish and birds to mammals.</p><p>All bHLH proteins known to date function as homo- or heterodimers. In addition to Tcfl5, two other bHLH group family members have been found to be expressed in mouse spermatocytes. One is the hairy-related factor, Hey1, which interacts with a co-regulator Boip through its Orange domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c54">54</xref>). The second is a more distant family member, a germ cell-specific truncated variant of sterol regulatory element binding protein 2, which is detected in mouse spermatocytes and round spermatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c55">55</xref>). Future two-hybrid screens may identify these or other bHLH proteins as dimerization partners for Tcfl5. However, Tcfl5 may function as a homodimer. In the helix II domain, involved in dimerization, Tcfl5 is more similar to hairy and deadpan than to Mad and Mxi1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh979f1">1</xref>), and hairy binds DNA as a homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c39">39</xref>).</p><p>As discussed herein, timing of Tcfl5 expression in spermatogenesis would be in agreement with Tcfl5 acting as a transcriptional activator of the <italic>Clgn</italic> gene. However, it is to be noted that members of the hairy-related bHLH family act as transcriptional repressors, inhibiting transcription by binding to co-repressors, mediated by a sequence in the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh979c52">52</xref>). Tcfl5 does not contain such a co-repressor binding sequence, and we cannot predict whether Tcfl5 acts as transcriptional activator or repressor. The present finding that Tcfl5 protein is associated with transcriptionally active chromatin regions in spermatocytes would support a role as activator of transcription, possibly of several target genes.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh979f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Alignment of bHLH proteins Tcfl5 and TCFL5.
