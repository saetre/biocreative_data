Children with the <italic>FTO</italic> (rs9939609) variant that increases the risk of obesity may have a higher susceptibility to the effects of DED because their internal appetite control system is compromised. We tested the relationship between DED and fat mass in early adolescence and its interaction with <italic>FTO</italic> variants.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>We carried out a prospective analysis on 2,275 children enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Diet was assessed at age 10 y using 3-day diet diaries. DED (kJ/g) was calculated excluding drinks. Children were genotyped for the <italic>FTO</italic> (rs9939609) variant. Fat mass was estimated at age 13 y using the Lunar Prodigy Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry scanner. There was no evidence of interaction between DED at age 10 y and the high risk A allele of the <italic>FTO</italic> gene in relation to fat mass at age 13 y (&#x003b2;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.005, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.51), suggesting that the <italic>FTO</italic> gene has no effect on the relation between DED at 10 y and fat mass at 13 y. When DED at 10 y and the A allele of <italic>FTO</italic> were in the same model they were independently related to fat mass at 13 y. Each A allele of <italic>FTO</italic> was associated with 0.35&#x000b1;0.13 kg more fat mass at 13 y and each 1 kJ/g DED at 10 y was associated with 0.16&#x000b1;0.06 kg more fat mass at age 13 y, after controlling for misreporting of energy intake, gender, puberty, overweight status at 10 y, maternal education, TV watching, and physical activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study reveals the multi-factorial origin of obesity and indicates that although <italic>FTO</italic> may put some children at greater risk of obesity, encouraging a low dietary energy density may be an effective strategy to help all children avoid excessive fat gain.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Overweight and obesity currently affects 32&#x00025; of children aged 10&#x02013;11 y in England <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-National1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Childhood obesity is associated with serious consequences to health in both the short and long term <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Reilly1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The recent rise in obesity prevalence is primarily caused by environmental changes affecting diet and activity levels; however large variation in the prevalence of obesity within populations suggests that some children are more susceptible than others to the obesogenic environment.</p><p>Dietary energy density (DED) refers to the amount of energy consumed per unit weight of food. Compared to a low DED, a high DED will increase energy intake (EI) and raise the risk of weight gain if there is no decrease in the amount of food eaten. Highly controlled experimental studies have shown that adults tend to consume a constant weight of food, despite changes in energy density, thus an increase in energy density leads to higher EI, a concept referred to as passive overconsumption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Poppitt1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. It is possible that the relationship between DED and EI may be a result of a correlation with high fat intake because fat is a key determinant of energy density. However, two studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Bell1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Stubbs1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> that manipulated fat content while keeping DED constant demonstrated the effect of DED is independent of fat intake because EI was greater as &#x00025;fat increased only when DED was allowed to vary as well, whereas when DED was held constant, changes in &#x00025;fat had no effect on EI.</p><p>Water is also a major determinant of DED. Water contributes more to the weight of foods than any macronutrient, thus energy-dense foods are not necessarily those high in fat, but those that are dry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Drewnowski1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. For example a dry food like breakfast cereal (e.g. sugar coated cornflakes) and a high fat food like cheese (e.g. Cheddar) have the same energy density of 16.2 kJ/g <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Holland1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly DED encompasses all foods likely to lead to an increase in EI and weight gain, not just high fat foods and so may represent an obesogenic diet better than fat intake alone.</p><p>In free-living humans the effect of energy density may be reduced as people may choose to combine energy dense foods with less energy dense foods or may reduce their portion sizes of more energy dense food when they know its energy content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-WesterterpPlantenga1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. A longer experiment lasting 2 weeks, where the energy density of all foods were manipulated, demonstrated that the increase in EI associated with high DED was maintained over 2 weeks and translated into short term body weight gain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Stubbs2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore longitudinal observational studies of free-living adults tend to support an effect of high DED on weight gain. One study found no evidence to support an effect on weight gain in a Danish adult population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Iqbal1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, three other studies of US women found evidence for an association between higher DED and greater weight gain during pregnancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Deierlein1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> or after 6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Savage1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> or 8 years of follow-up <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-BesRastrollo1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In contrast, the effect of DED on fatness in children is not straightforward. A review of experimental studies in 1997 found that children tend to be more sensitive to changes in energy density and are much more likely than adults to reduce their consumption at a subsequent meal to compensate for a high energy density at a previous meal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Birch1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. More recent experimental work suggests that the sensitivity that children have to changes in energy density tends to reduce with age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Birch1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Cecil1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Johnson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Further support for a decline in sensitivity to innate appetite control can be found in an observational study of 220 free-living twins followed from age 4 to 11 years, which showed that a psychometric measure of satiety responsiveness declined with age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Ashcroft1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on this there may not be a relationship between DED and fatness in young children, but a relationship may emerge in older children. There have been 2 prospective observational studies of DED and fatness in children. A small study in Northern Ireland of children selected for low and high risk of obesity based on parental weight status, found that each 1 kJ/g DED at age 7 y was associated with a 90&#x00025; increase in the risk of being in the top tertile of fat gain between age 7 and 15 y (defined by change in fat mass index), but no linear trend was reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-McCaffrey1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Analyses of data from a sub-sample of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) found a non-linear trend so that each 1 kJ/g DED at age 7 y was associated with a 36&#x00025; increase in the risk of excess adiposity (defined at as the top quintile of fat mass index) at age 9 y, although there was no evidence of a similar effect of DED at 5 y on excess adiposity at 9 y <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Johnson2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>There is currently no evidence to support an effect of DED in young children (&#x0003c;7 y). It is possible that young children are not susceptible to the effects of increased DED because they have an enhanced ability to respond to internal appetite cues compared to older children and thus reduce their intake to compensate for an increased energy density. Furthermore, there is no evidence of a linear effect of DED on later fatness i.e. on a group level children with the most fat or fat gain tend to have eaten more energy dense diets but there is no uniform increase in fat mass associated with each kJ/g rise in DED. The absence of a linear trend suggests that some children are more susceptible to the effects of DED than others, which may be explained by the presence of an interaction with some other factor that alters susceptibility to increased EI in the presence of high DED.</p><p>A variant (rs9939609, A allele) of <italic>FTO</italic> has been associated with higher BMI in both adults and children as young as 7 y, which equated to a &#x0223c;3 kg difference in body weight between homozygous high and low risk allele carriers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Frayling1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Further analysis of fat and non-fat mass separately found that the association of the high-risk A allele with weight was mainly attributable to changes in fat mass with a 14&#x00025; difference across the three genotype groups compared to a 1&#x00025; difference in non-fat mass across groups. The functional relevance of <italic>FTO</italic> to obesity is currently under investigation. To date gene expression studies have shown that <italic>FTO</italic> is highly expressed in the appetite control regions of the hypothalamus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Gerken1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Fredriksson1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. The implication of <italic>FTO</italic> gene expression in regions of the hypothalamus associated with appetite control suggests that compromised control of energy intake may be the reason for excess weight gain in people carrying the high risk A allele. Evidence of decreased responsiveness to satiety, a psychometric measure of appetite control, has recently been observed in 8&#x02013;11 year old twins carrying the high risk A allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Wardle1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Further evidence that appetite is compromised has been shown in ALSPAC where carriers of the high risk A allele had higher energy intake, which was independent of their larger body size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Timpson1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>If variation in <italic>FTO</italic> represents a genetic susceptibility to compromised appetite control, then it may modify the effect of exposure to a high DED on fat mass such that children without the high risk <italic>FTO</italic> allele are able to adjust their portion sizes to compensate for a higher DED. We assessed whether <italic>FTO</italic> variants modified the effect of DED at age 10 y on fat mass at age 13 y in the ALSPAC cohort.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sample</title><p>Data are from ALSPAC, a prospective cohort study, set up in 1991, to assess all aspects of pregnancy, infancy and childhood growth and development.

Children completed the diary, with parental help, before bringing it to a clinic. Diet recordings were requested to cover two weekdays and one weekend day. At clinics a nutritionist checked the diaries with the child (accompanied by a parent) and missing or ambiguous details were clarified to improve accuracy and completeness. If a diary had not been completed by the child a single 24 hour recall was administered at the clinic, this occurred in 13.5&#x00025; of cases.

Dietary energy density (kJ/g) (DED) was calculated (excluding drinks) by dividing total food energy (kJ) by total food weight (g).

If a dietary factor is related to fatness at follow-up but is also related to fatness at baseline then causal inference may not be appropriate as the original high fatness (which may have been caused by some other factor) may simply be tracking. In order to separate a diet associated with the development of high fat mass from a diet associated with later adiposity because of high fatness at baseline, fat mass at baseline should be used as a covariate. As fat mass was not assessed at baseline (10 years) when data on diet was collected, overweight status at baseline, an indicator of fatness, will be used as a covariate in this paper instead. At focus clinics at age 10 and 13 y height was measured to an accuracy of 0.1 cm using a Harpenden stadiometer (Holtain Ltd., Crymmych, Pembs, UK) and weight was measured to 0.1 kg using the Tanita (West Drayton, Middlesex, UK) TBF 305 body fat analyser weighing scale.

The results presented suggest that DED at age 10 y and <italic>FTO</italic> contribute independently to greater fat mass at age 13 y. Each A allele of <italic>FTO</italic> was associated with 0.35 kg more fat mass at 13 y and each 1 kJ/g DED at 10 y was associated with 0.16 kg more fat mass at age 13 y, after controlling for misreporting of energy intake, gender, puberty, maternal education, TV watching, physical activity and overweight status at 10 y. To our knowledge this is the first study of the effect of <italic>FTO</italic> on modifying the impact of DED on fatness and these results are an important addition to our understanding of the multi-factorial origins of obesity.</p><p>No previous study has found a linear relationship between DED and fat mass in children, therefore comparing the effect size with the existing literature is not possible. Data from a sub-sample of ALSPAC found that DED at 7 y was related to excess adiposity at 9 y but not fat mass across the whole range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Johnson2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore there was no evidence of a relationship between DED at 5 y and excess adiposity or fat mass at 9 y. The changing effect of DED on later fat mass with age suggests over-consumption in response to energy dense foods may become more likely as innate appetite control becomes more susceptible as children get older to disruption by external cues such as high palatability.</p><p>The addition of weight status at 10 y to the regression models attenuated the effects of both <italic>FTO</italic> and DED at 10 y on fat mass at 13 y. For DED this suggests that to some extent overweight children are more likely to consume more energy dense diets, which explains some of the impact of DED at 10 y on fat mass 3 years later. However, given that the effect of DED at 10 y remains (all be it reduced in size) this supports a causal role for DED in increasing fat mass over time. For <italic>FTO</italic> the inclusion of weight status at 10 y explained part of the effect on fat mass at 13 y, which suggests that the whole effect of <italic>FTO</italic> on fatness at a given time point, is the accumulation of many small effects over time.</p><p>The present analysis provides no evidence that the effect of DED on fat mass is altered by the <italic>FTO</italic> genotype. This lack of evidence could indicate that the A allele of the <italic>FTO</italic> gene does not enhance the effect of DED on fat mass or it could suggest that the real interaction effect is smaller than 0.3 (the smallest effect detectable with our sample size). There is also no evidence that the effect of <italic>FTO</italic> is explained by changes in DED as there was no change in the effect estimate for <italic>FTO</italic> when DED was included in a multiple regression. This reinforces a previous analysis of ALSPAC data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Timpson1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> suggesting that <italic>FTO</italic> increases the consumption of all foods and not specifically highly palatable, energy-dense foods. The evidence presented here suggests that DED and <italic>FTO</italic> simply combine to increase the risk of obesity in an additive manner.</p><p>The public health importance of the present findings is that the effect of the high risk A allele of the <italic>FTO</italic> genotype on fat mass may be, in part, offset by dietary changes to lower DED. Intervention studies have shown that free-living adults can feasibly reduce, for up to 12 months, their DED by at least 2 kJ/g via the replacement of high fat with low-fat foods and the inclusion of more fruits and vegetables in their diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Ledikwe1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-ElloMartin1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. If a similar reduction in DED could be achieved in children then, based on the effect estimate in the present analysis, this may lead to a third of a kilogram reduction in fat mass. This potential effect of lowering DED could balance out some of the extra fat mass associated with carrying an A allele of <italic>FTO</italic>.</p><p>There are several strengths to this study. The data analysed come from a large population based cohort, which has been followed prospectively for 13 y with detailed records of food intake, direct measures of body composition and good measures of a range of potential confounders. Previous work has shown that the diet observed in this cohort is comparable to that observed in nationally representative samples of young UK children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Glynn1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, as was the observed prevalence of overweight and obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004594-Jotangia1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. As with all observational studies, it is possible that the association between DED and fat mass was the result of some unmeasured confounding factor. A weakness of the study is that complete dietary, genetic and body composition data was available for only 30&#x00025; of the original sample. Comparison of data among children with and without complete data showed no difference in fatness and allele frequency. However, children with complete data did have a lower DED compared to those without complete data, which may mean that the effect of DED on fatness has been under estimated.</p><p>This study reveals the multi-factorial origin of obesity and indicates that although the <italic>FTO</italic> gene may put some children at greater risk of obesity, encouraging a low dietary energy density may be an effective strategy to help all children avoid excessive fat gain.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are extremely grateful to all the families who took part in this study, the midwives for their help
